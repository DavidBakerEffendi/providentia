I had a long day of running around and came here after being my boyfriend lunch. Go figure. The place is pretty small but very clean. It was around 100, so the place was pretty packed. I wish it was bigger because I definitely would've sat down and ate there. There were pre-made sushi rolls. I had a spider roll, California roll and spicy tuna roll. All for less than $10. Great deal if you ask me. Quality was pretty good too. I definitely will be returning when I'm in the area but I want to dine in next time.
