Long wait and the pizza was not good for me! It was margherita style and herbal tasting (lots of basil) and their sauce is strange.. veering towards sweet, but not at all sweet. My friend had what she called a "tomato tumor" on her pizza (literally 1/3 of a large tomato sitting whole on her slice). One of my friends decided to forego her entitled second slice becase the pizza was so bad. She literally had one slice and was done. I've never seen anything like it, and trust me, my friends love to eat. I love coal oven char, but Grimaldi's straight up burned half of the pie's crust. The pizza isn't great at all, guys and this sentiment was shared coming from 3 pizza experts native to NYC. If you want GREAT pizza reflective of what NYC has to offer, go elsewhere, there are so many more options that are less expensive and less of a wait than Grimaldi's. Ugh :( I really wanted to love this, but it just wasn't worth it. Especially not worth trying to navigate DUMBO. They're arrogant there too. The waiters wear shirts that read "I'm going to serve you up a pizza you can't refuse". This was cute until I tried their pizza. Additionally, the place is small so you'll be seated next to strangers. Again, this might have been cute if their pizza had been worth it. But alas. Bottom line: I like my pizza greasy and cheesy (like a real New York City pizza). This is not the place for that kind of pie. Screw you Grimaldi's. Oh, and this is a tourist trap.
