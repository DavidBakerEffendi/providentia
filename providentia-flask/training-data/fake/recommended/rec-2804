I've been here several times and the food is mediocre at best. The last time I sat down to eat at Piccolo with my family, I had the chicken piccatta. It was nothing special and the sauce was all concentrated into one section of the dish. Our waitress seemed irritable and was annoyed when my dad tried to use a coupon. Apparently their coupons aren't valid on holidays (it was Christmas Eve), but nowhere on the coupon does it actually say that. Anyway, we decided to give it another try the following week for takeout because we heard that the Brooklyn pizza is amazing. It was not even close. The sauce was way too sweet and the other ingredients did not taste fresh at all. I'm giving PIccolo two stars because the food wasn't terrible to the point of inedibility, but we won't be returning here any time soon.
