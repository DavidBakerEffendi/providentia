Now, here's a unique joint. I was on a search for Cuban sandwiches in the city and stumbled across the one served at The Cannibal. 1.) How can you not go to a place called, "The Cannibal?" 2.) They serve Cuban sandwiches? You already had me at the name. Wowza Now, the Cuban isn't your typical. The pork is actually replaced with Pig's head.  The texture is very unique and combined with the gruyere, this is easily once of the meltiest sandwiches I've ever had. That's right, meltiest. I went for lunch and this place was jamming.  A HUGE beer selection and a butcher shop combined in one with a bar.  In a few words, you gotta check it out. Now, it's a bit pricey, and the bar seating is tight, which is pretty much the only reason it's not a full on 5 star, but definitely a 4.5. Make the trip. It's worth it.
