This place gets four stars because their chicken paprika is every bit as good as my grandmother's.  The sauce was decadently creamy, while the skin of the chicken was nice and crisp.  The spaetzel was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It had a nice flavor of cheese and salt, which is one of the best combinations on Earth.   It was a refreshing trip back to my childhood, which I thought would never happen again. My dining companion ordered the Debrecina sausage plate, which was tasty, but a little dry.  We also ordered sides of red cabbage and saurkraut, which were fine.  Nothing to write home about. The ambiance was kitchy.  The waitstaff aloof.  The bar menu was fun and diverse, and included many interesting specialty cocktails.  The beer flowed plentifully. It should be noted that I went on a Saturday night and the place was packed.  There was a wait. I didn't care. The chicken paprika saved the day.   I can't wait to go back on a movie night....
