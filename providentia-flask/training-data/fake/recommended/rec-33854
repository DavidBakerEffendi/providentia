On a cold February night, their hot toddy made things so much better. Â A couple made it amazing. Have been here a couple of times, and have been duly impressed by their bourbons and cocktail choices. When establishments like Char No. 4 take out the need to leave Brooklyn for a good drink, I'm more than happy to continue frequenting them as many times as I can.
