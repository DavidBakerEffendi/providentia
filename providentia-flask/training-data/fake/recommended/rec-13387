Chose Balaboosta to celebrate my boyfriend's new job and it could not have been more perfect! Nice romantic atmosphere, the server was super attentive but not overly annoying, and the food was amazing. We checked out the specials board and we were so blown away by everything, we didn't even look at the menu - we ordered everything from the list! To start we had their special market salad (tomatoes, mozzarella, arugula) and ceviche (fluke, pineapple, avocado, paprika popcorn). For dinner we split the seared scallops (cooked perfectly with sweet corn), roasted vegetables (turnips, beets) and homemade gnocchi with 3 kinds of mushrooms. All highly recommended I look forward to going back and trying some items off their menu!
