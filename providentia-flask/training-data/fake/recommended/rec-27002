3.5 stars. Cookshop is good. Not great, but good. I loved the service, the atmosphere, the location, and a good part of the menu. We were five for a Sunday night dinner and there were no serious complaints around the table. It was also a bit of a reunion / get together so company can have some influence on reviews. I opened with the mushroom broth soup which was amazing. I think the best dish at the table. I went with the Mezze for a main, which is a bit off base for their menu, but it's the veg option. It was okay. We had two pork mains and the tuna. The pork got solid reviews, the tuna was a bit over done. I can't remember the last main - not a great thing - but there were no complaints. Desserts were split - not stunning, but good. Five with a few drinks came to about $235, without tip. Probably more than the quality called for, but it's Manhattan. I'd go again, I'd recommend it.
