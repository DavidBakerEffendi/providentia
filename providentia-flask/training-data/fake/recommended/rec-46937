Love this place! Boyfriend and I were looking for a new place to try in the city, and came across McGillin's Olde Ale House on yelp. The reviews were positive and the decor looked interesting so we gave it a shot. So happy we did, this place was really neat. It's tucked off of the main roads right in the heart of the city, very easy to get to from the train which is house we came in to the city. The atmosphere is great, the music wasn't too loud, there was surprisingly a young crowd there. Everyone was very friendly, we had a great server. Food was excellent, I highly recommend the Cheese Steak. Also you can't beat a place that has all of those features AND cheap drinks! Tom Collins are $4. Pitchers of PBR for $6.50 and Lager pitchers $7. We went in on a Sunday evening around 6pm, not sure if it changes every day.
