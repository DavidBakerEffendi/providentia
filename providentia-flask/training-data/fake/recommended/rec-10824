This place is a disaster. Management should just sell it. It's shocking that with such a great idea and a perfect location it could be such a nightmare. This is the worst *WORST* dining experience I've had. I live in the neighborhood, and have tried and tried to like this place. It seems so easy to get it "right" with the location and brilliant idea of a crab shack on the water. But every time I eat here I say it'll be the last time. This place is terrible. The really over priced and generally mediocre food is one issue, but the horrible HORRIBLE, rude service is just too much. From the moment I walk in I feels like everyone that works there just hates it and has a terrible attitude. It makes it really difficult to wait around for hours when you're waiting with rude grumpy people that want to leave. It's clear that the root issue is a horrible management that has no idea how to run a restaurant or how to treat customers. I was shocked by how I was spoken to. Having waited tables myself for years I am often way too lenient when places are run poorly, I understand both sides, but the service here is SO RUDE and SO MISMANAGED they really have no business being in the service industry. Redhook is wonderful, go to one of the many other fun and exciting restaurants around that have good food and treat you like they want you there.
