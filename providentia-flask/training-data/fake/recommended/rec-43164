Very good place to eat and drink with friends. Food is great. my 4 friends and I came here for a dinner. We had a table with no problem on a Saturday night at around 5:45 (granted they open at 5)...lol. Anyway, it filled up pretty fast thereafter. It's mainly a small dish kind of place. So we ordered a good amount of small dishes. We liked the chicken gizzards and the squid teriyaki. I mean everything is pretty good here. But please DO NOT order the sea urchin here as they were not fresh at all. We didn't order any other raw dishes but I wouldn't come here for sushi based on the sea urchin we got.
