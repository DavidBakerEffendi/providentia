A long overdue review...ilili is our (my boyfriend and I) go to spot for nice dinners or special occasions. Most recently we went to ilili at the end of September for my birthday and we sat upstairs for the first time. It is much more quiet and seems to be more spacious then the two-seat tables in the downstairs dining area. The wait staff is always amazing here and always us to make our picks. I am a vegetarian and I always feel well fed at ilili. Some of our favorite menu items include: almaza beer, poison sumac margarita, Phoenician fries (so addicting),cauliflower, riz, farro risotto(although last time we were there they had changed the menu and it was a regular risotto with veggies), and my boyfriend loves all of the lamb dishes especially the lamb chops...everything we have tried has been delicious(: ilili is a great place to celebrate a special occasion as it has a lively yet romantic atmosphere and delicious food!!
