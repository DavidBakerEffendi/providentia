Was recently very disappointed in Bangkok Kitchen. On a crowded Saturday night, service was awful. Food was mediocre at best. Dumplings, which had been my favorite were not good. tasted microwaved and like they sat for a while - hard around the edges. Asian Seafood Noodles was seriously lacking seafood. Not sure if this is a trend or an off night - not sure, will give it another try,
