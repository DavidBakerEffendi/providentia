Nice environment for bunch hangout place with friends. We'll portioned dish that makes you feel full but not stuffed. My GF and I had the frittata and chorizo. I absolutely like the chorizo. The frittata is more for someone who likes more veggie. The latte is good, but not outstanding. I would have given it a 5 stars if they had better coffee.
