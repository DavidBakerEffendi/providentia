Been here a handful of times. Location is in a mini mall off of a main strip, I believe there open late, and it'd probably be a great place to hang out with friends or study. Atmosphere is typical of the area and dimly lit which is always nice for a coffee house, plenty of seating and I think they have a full menu, although my review today is about there coffee. Was in the area and opted to support a smaller shop rather than Starfuxs. Saw that they were brewing a medium organic roast  and orderded a large. The cup was not reflective of the roast profile and description they had posted as it lacked body and had a really dirty finish that I believe you could attribute to a seriously dirty brewing equipment. No honestly tho it tasted like a step down from D&D... I returned it and gave their dark roast a try. Still super disappointed, as again, the coffee flavor was obscured by what seemed to be dirty brewing equipment.   I try to support smaller chains when its viable but I'm not willing to shell out my hard earned money to some hack coffee Shop. As I've read the reviews it's a popular destination for locals to get there blended icy drinks and that's all well and good but please skip this joint if your looking for a good cup of Joe!!
