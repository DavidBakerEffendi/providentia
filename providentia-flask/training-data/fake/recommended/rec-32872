The food warrants the rating.  The atmosphere was fun. They were playing alternative 90's rock and pumping the people through.  Took us over an hour to get seated.  They took our order from out in the street before we got sat.  This place is a well oiled machine.  Not sure I would brave the wait again, but perhaps on a busy day I would stop in and try to get a single seat!
