The never ending meats were delicious. They werent well seasoned however juicy and filling. The sides that came with it (potatoes, bananas, and cheese bread) i guess needed an acquired taste but the banana Yum! Â 4 stars to the waiter who did NOT explain how the meal plan works your lucky the next guy was Great!
