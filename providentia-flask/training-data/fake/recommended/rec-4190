Few local coffeehouses that are or seem independent mean that Cafe Twelve has an opportunity to carve a niche clientele, and they surely have.  This location has gone through various permutations, and I must say that the current ownership and management does it pitch-perfect.  As a gay man, I feel incredibly comfortable being candid in my conversations or showing affection.  In addition, Cafe Twelve routinely displays the work of local artists supporting our arts and culture scene in Philadelphia. The prices are comparable to other locations, but the atmosphere and friendly staff make this place a must-go for caffeine lovers and those wishing to enjoy the best of the Gayborhood in a casual, friendly, non-alcoholic environment.  I fully recommend sitting here for hours doing crosswords, enjoying conversation, reading, working,or simply taking in people watching.
