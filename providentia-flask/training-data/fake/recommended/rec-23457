kind of hate Yelp reviews because most of you are self-obsessed children (even by modern internet standards) with questionable opinions....but i had to get over that just to give Heavy Woods 5-stars. their beer selection is on point and affordable, and their food menu is now probably the best priced in the neighborhood. do the chicken biscuit, or the pork+crab po'boy; do any of the sides, particularly the red beans+rice. their New Orleans cuisine is all damn, damn good and SO affordable relative to Northeast Kingdom or Ghia or basically anywhere else around here.
