Festive, energetic spot with great food and solid libations. Weekend brunch is a popular destination and requires reservations. We had to sit a the bar despite a few open tables (apparently reserved for patrons on their way). Had good bar service, though. Their guacamole and chips were delicious, tortilla velvet soft.
