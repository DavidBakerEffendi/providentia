Great location and has free on site parking, which is a major plus.  Wait staff was very friendly and attentive.  Loved the bruschetta and sausage and pepper pizza.  We sat outside with our one year old who enjoyed the scenery while we enjoyed our food.  Relaxed but upscale.  We'll definitely be back.
