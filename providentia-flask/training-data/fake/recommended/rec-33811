This place can get packed, especially on Sunday mornings.. so come early. Service at Penelope is fast, efficient, and friendly. Decor is cute and homey. The breakfast selection is awesome here - you can't go wrong with it. My personal fav is the Abuelo's egg sandwich.. simple and delicious! Their fresh squeezed orange juice is also tasty. Lunch, on the other hand, was not up to par compared to the breakfast selection. Out of all the lunch dishes my table ordered, none were memorable. If you want a drink, Â though, try their take on the Bloody Mary!
