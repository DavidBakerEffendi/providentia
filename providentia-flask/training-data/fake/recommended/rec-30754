Stopped in opening night, definitely a much anticipated spot. The crowd slowly grew and everyone seemed to be having a great time. Atmosphere is chill and the open kitchen is awesome. On to the food - we started with the pickled mussels...so surprisingly refreshing and tasty! Next were the bacon wrapped matzo balls...fortunately they taste as good as they sound. The marrow was pure heaven and absolutely melts in your mouth and the chicken schnitzel was incredibly moist and delicious. Overall, I was really pleased...in truth I could've kept ordering if our plans had allowed. For those who enjoy new and interesting flavor combinations in a laid back, fun environment, the gorbals is for you. Bring friends, order one of everything and share, share, share.
