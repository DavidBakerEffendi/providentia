I've been procrastinating for the past hour or so, so why not review places from back home? Anyway, reading the other reviews, I double checked to see if I had the right place.  4 star ratings? I must have caught them on bad days, twice.  Granted, it's just a Chinese buffet, but even then, I have some standards for them, and this place barely met those standards.   The first time I came here was with my younger cousins.  They like buffets, and they're not picky with what they eat, but even they were upset with the quality of food, and that is saying a lot.  Food was definitely not fresh, some were cold.  Not too many options, and the sushi, yuck.  Like I said, no high expectations, just wanted a buffet with edible food, but seriously?  I was really pissed off that I spent money here, and I've never felt like that about a food establishment before. Okay.  So next time I came was with my parents and younger brother.  It wasn't willingly, someone gave my mom a gift card to this place and she wanted to use it.  I warned my parents about my experience here, and they felt like maybe it was a fluke, so okay, I'll try it again.  Same thing!!  I had some of their fruit and I had to spit it out.  had some weird taste to it. To top it off, the person who rang us up was totally rude to my mom about using the gift card.  Even my brother didn't like it and he's a 16 (at the time 15) year old boy who has eaten some questionable things before. Like I said, I know that this is a cheap buffet, but  I still have standards.  If my younger brother and cousins don't like it, I end up spitting out the fruit (how do you mess up fruit!), then it's just not good.  Maybe it was just my luck that I caught them on bad days, but never stepping foot inside of here again.
