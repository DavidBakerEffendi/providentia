When I encounter places with  "family restaurant" in the name my expectations are not very high.  Harrigans actually pulls it off well.  Not haute cuisine  by any measure, but if you want a super casual place for a burger or wings, it's not that bad.  If  you come here with low expectations as I did, you might be surprised.
