This is a very nice place with a Flamenco dance show. I don't know the show is every day though. The food was OK, but not super nor memorable. We had a Paella and Octopus and it was pretty authentic! The drinks were pretty good as well. We had the sangria and although it was delicious we didn't order a second one because It was late already. The environment is really enjoyable. I may give it another try, especially if I'm in a "flamenco" mood.
