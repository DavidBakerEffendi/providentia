Met a friend here for a pastry and coffee.  Place was packed midday on a Saturday but the servers accommodated us outside (with heaters on) until an inside table opened up.  Lovely apple strudel...and some other tempting choices. Excellent service...I'll be back to try some of the other temptations.
