Have been here a number of times already and it has become one of our favorite spots in the neighborhood. First of all, the staff is very friendly and accommodating.  Have been there with a bunch of friends (6 adults), 2 toddlers and an infant, and they were able to sit us all comfortably.  They also have a goodie bag for kids with crayons, little planes and toys (which I feel the adults enjoyed even more than the kids). Really like the decor, a bistro with a retro, soccer theme to it. The menu is not too ample, but it is solid and the food is fresh and tasty.  The appetizers are really nice (loved the ceviche and the morcilla with avocado) bur maybe a bit on the small side, but then, if you are going to order a sandwich, you don't really need too much of a appetizer, as the sandwiches are huge.  We have ordered different sandwiches and they are all fresh, delicious and come with a side of either French fries, salad or Israeli cous-cous.  As I mentioned, the sandwiches are huge and I always end up bringing home half of mine (not a complaint!! just a comment). As far as desserts go, the flan is creamy and rich and we also had the maple ice cream, which was delicious. Right now they are open only for dinner (and until late!!),but they will be opening for breakfast, brunch and lunch soon. Really hope that they keep up with the quality, prices and friendliness.
