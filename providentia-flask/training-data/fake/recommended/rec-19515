Oh my gosh this is pretty much our favorite place in Philadelphia!!!  The amount of enjoyment and pleasure that we receive per dollar cannot be matched.  I went here for the first time at the end of last semester, and I have been back at least six times in the past two months.  I have tried a lot of items on their menu, and definitely recommend that you start with the roti (amazing appetizer).  I have even tried their sushi, and despite my initial reluctance to order sushi from a Malaysian restaurant, I was amazingly impressed.  An incredible dish that we stumbled upon is a noodle dish called the Mee Siam, which is spicy but tastes great.  The restaurant is definitely very good at accommodating large groups and it seems as if every time I go it is someone's birthday.  Though this might not be the place if you are looking for an intimate dinner for two or if you are taking a small family (I always feel bad for those parties), it is DEFINITELY the place if you and a group of friends are looking for a rambunctiously fun time with incredible food!!
