This place is amazing! My husband and I go here for every special occasion and we are always treated like VIP by all of the staff. The waiters are always smiling and happy to answer any questions that you have about the great wine list and the menu. The hamachi salad is to die for, the pork chops were the best we EVER tasted and the pasta was outrageous! I think you can pick and dessert you want and you will be pleased. A tip...you can order from the bar menu at your table now! Amazing fried chicken. Can't wait to go back!
