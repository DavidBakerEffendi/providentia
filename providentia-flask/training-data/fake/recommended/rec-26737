I kind of want to kidnap Cafeteria and bring it back to Chicago. We ate here on my last night in NY. We showed up around 11pm and this place was hoppin'. It's definitely super loud... imagine taking a nightclub and placing some tables down in it. It might be different during the day (it is open 24 hours!), but at night, forget about a quiet meal. With that said, we didn't go hear to have a quiet meal - we went to have delicious drinks, stuff our faces with great food, and just enjoy ourselves. And we did all of that. Foodwise, amazing. We had a hard time deciding what to order, since we wanted to order just about everything. Mac and Cheese spring rolls! Genius! After 3 drinks, kale salad even sounded amazing (healthiest drunk meal ever). And it was. I could see where people are put off by some of the servers, but honestly, ours were super great. And let's not forget the quality people watching. Thanks to the random girl sitting next to me who let me try her mashed potatoes so we could also decide to order some. Simply - great menu, great drinks, fun atmosphere. xoxo to you, Cafeteria.
