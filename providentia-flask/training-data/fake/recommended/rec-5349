My boyfriend took me here for our one year anniversary. It was such a surprise and I was very excited to go because I've heard great things about it. He made a reservation over month in advance but we still had to wait about 15-20 minutes for our table. I wasn't too fond of that. When we got our seats, we were presented with a nice ,fit menu where the choices sounded delicious. We got our dishes in a reasonable time. For the appetizer, we ordered the lamb ravioli. It tasted like fish, in my opinion and the dough was a bit hard on the sides of the ravioli. For my entree, I got the veal and shrimp platter though the veal outweighed the shrimp in quantity 3:1. There was only one shrimp and three patties of veal. It was very good, but the risotto under the stack of veal had condensed and was more like a molded circle of rice. And for dessert, we got the banana creme brulee. It was by far the best part of the meal. Overall, the atmosphere was charming and quiet; it is a very nice place if you want some alone time with your special someone. The staff were accommodating and the food was satisfactory. A bit on the pricey side for those just looking for a nice, entertaining meal.
