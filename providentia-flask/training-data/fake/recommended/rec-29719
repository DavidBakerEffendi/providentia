In August my mom and I ate lunch here and had a wonderful lunch, and wonderful conversation with the owner.  There is so much history in that lovely place it was heart warming.  I had penne in vodka sauce and my mom had eggplant parmesan that was to die for! My mom is Italian and very picky about her eggplant parm and she was tickled that they did it right.  We plan to come back here the next time we make our way to NYC.
