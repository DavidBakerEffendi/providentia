This place was not too far from our hotel (Holiday Inn Express Madison Square Garden), so we decided to have dinner there one night.  It is a casual place where you order at the cash, pay and they give you a buzzer and you go sit down, then when your order is ready the buzzer goes off and you go to the counter by the kitchen and pick up your food yourself (and give the guy your the back).   I thought that the good here was just ok, but my husband really liked it (but since I'm the one doing the review, it just gets 3 stars, lol).  I ordered the Udon Noodle Soup.  Since I told them that I don't eat sesame seeds, they told me that they would not put the togarashi in since it contained sesame seeds (as well as pepper and other spices).  I was ok with this and glad that they were willing to accommodate.  My soup was a decent size and despite not having togarashi the broth was very flavourful.  It came with 2 very sorry tempura shrimp.  The tempura batter was heavy and greasy and the shrimp were like the skinniest shrimp I've ever seen.  The tempura shrimp pieces also looked like they were flattened.  I'm talking about a tempura shrimp that wandered its way into a panini press kind of flattened!  That was just weird.  The soup also had some fried tofu, seaweed, tempura flakes, scallions and fish cake slices.  I've had better for cheaper elsewhere, but it was not that bad (except the tempura shrimp).  My soup was $7.81 My husband had the kobe beef burger ($8.97).  It was really small and didn't come with any sides.  It had the kobe beef, onions, ketchup, mayo, lettuce, cucumber, carrot, cabbage and scallions.  The bun was like a brioche.  I had a small bite and it was good, but way too small and messy (too many toppings in my opinion).   Anyway, I don't think that I would make a special trip to return, but if I was in the area and hungry and someone else was paying, I would eat here again (but I wouldn't order anything with tempura shrimp in it though).
