This is my Chinatown go to place! I came here four score and like three girlfriends ago (that's like 6 years ago for muggles) and the owner came over and introduced himself. Years later I come back randomly one night and when I walk in he calls me by name. Its a BYOB which works even for a non drinker like me (there's a wawa down the street) and their beverage prices are the only thing keeping them from that elusive 5th star. Â Do yourself a favor, when you go (because you SHOULD go) try something that's a bit different. If you just order the mango chicken you get negative points for originality
