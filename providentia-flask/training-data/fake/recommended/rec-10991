Came here with my wife last night around 8. Great location on the water with beautiful harbor views, the sunset and general feel of the place made us feel we were in the Keys! The place was jumping, it had just stopped raining and we were told it was a 1 1/2 hour wait for a table in the beautiful upstairs dining room. We decided to sit at the bar for some cocktails and raw bar. The place has only been open a few days and they have some staffing and logistics issues to work out, hopefully they'll be cleaned up in a couple of weeks. That being said, service at the bar was friendly and fairly speedy. The raw bar was fresh and delicious, we had the Super Cool platter which has oysters, crab legs, lobster and shrimp. It was all delicious. By the time they called us for our table we were full so we didn't stay for dinner. But we will definitely be back. Also, they have bocce and miniature golf in the back and enough sand outside around the place to make you feel you're at the beach. Definitely recommend, and once they work out the opening day kinks we'll move to 5 stars.
