The happy hour is amazing. The beer list is amazing. The service, unless you're at the bar, stinks. The brunch stinks (last time i had brunch there the shells for the huevos rancheros were so stale that i couldn't cut thru them with my knife) as does the menu/prices in general. This place is an amazing happy hour bar, but there's plenty of better options in the neighborhood for anything else.
