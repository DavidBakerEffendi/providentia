My favorite place to go an spend an evening or afternoon.  They have a real coffee selection.  The crepes are delicious.  My favorite is the goat cheese with figs.  I also really like the mussel pasta dish. I've had several salads and their all good.  It's never a quick bite but it's always really pleasant and delicious.
