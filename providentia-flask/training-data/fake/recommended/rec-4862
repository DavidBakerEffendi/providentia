I've been to El Camino Real three times, once for brunch and twice for dinner, and I can't say that the quality has been consistent. The first time, for dinner, the service was INCREDIBLY slow. We waited forever for the waiter to greet us at our table. The food took an extremely long time and the bar took even longer. We didn't even get our margaritas until after we got our appetizer, and to make up for it, the waiter said he'd knock off the $2.50 charge for our chips and salsa (which, in my opinion, should already be free like in almost any other Mexican restaurant I've been to. Still, the place had just opened and I attributed the slow service to growing pains. My burrito was excellent. The second time I went was for brunch. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant so the service was quicker, and the food was delicious. But the waiter brought us the wrong check and it took way longer than it should have to straighten it out. The third time I went, for dinner again, our waitress was quick, efficient and friendly. But my brisket sandwich was essentially a slab of fat on a roll. Inedible. So, in conclusion, the staff is friendly but sometimes slow, and the Mexican food is great but I won't be trying their BBQ menu again.
