I'm convinced prices are made up on the spot because I usually order the same exact thing (black tea & a bagel with cream cheese) and it can run me anywhere from $5-8. Same with refills, sometimes they are free and other times I am charged a dollar or two. Despite the mostly condescending nature of the people who work there I still go fairly often since it's close to my house, has outdoor seating for nice days, and I always run into someone I know. Haven't really tried the food but the smoothies are pretty delicious, though everything is a bit overpriced... or is it? Long story short, if I moved outside of the 2 block radius I don't think I'd ever go here.
