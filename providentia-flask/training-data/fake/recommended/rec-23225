I'm surprised an 8:30 reservation on a Saturday night was so easy to get.  The oysters were fresh and delicious, the lobster appetizer was spot on, the scallops with white truffle with sea urchin was as perfect as perfect gets, and the tuna entree was very good.  The waffle and ice cream dessert was just ok.  I rarely write reviews and for whatever it's worth, I eat in restaurants often in Philly and NY and don't claim to be a food expert, but I felt compelled to add this because the food here was some of the best I've tasted.
