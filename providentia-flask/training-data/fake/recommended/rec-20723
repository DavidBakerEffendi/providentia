My friend brought me here saying that it was a very great place to get a burger. And after trying it, I would say it definitely deserves the praise it gets from that random guy in the bar in that scene from How I Met Your Mother. I got in when it had just filled up so we were first in line for a table. It's not too long of a wait though. We were seated a couple minutes later and it seemed like other people were moving through the line rather quickly as well. We both went for the bistro burger with a side of fries. We thought about getting beer but just stuck with water. The bistro burger is basically a cheeseburger with bacon in it. It's simple, very affordable, and done to perfection. It just shows that sticking with the basics and keeping things simple can be a lot better than those gourmet burgers overloaded with fancy ingredients. I would avoid the bathroom here. I went to use it to wash my hands and it's insanely tiny and insanely dirty. Other than that, it's a fun dive bar environment with good burgers and fries and plenty of beer to go with your meal. You can't go wrong with that.
