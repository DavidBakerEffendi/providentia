Be advised: when they say large pizza, they mean LARGE. You could feed an entire frat house with just one of these things. And, like others have said, expect to wait a good hour for your food to arrive if ordering delivery. But if I'm ever back in the area, I'd give them another shot. The wait was long, but the food was worth it.
