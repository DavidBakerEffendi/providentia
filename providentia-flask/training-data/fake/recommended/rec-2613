Over the years I have heard so many interesting and wonderful things about this diner, that when I was working in New Jersey recently, I had to come in and give this place a try. I was really excited about trying "authentic" NJ disco fries.  While, I've had fries with gravy and cheese over the years as various places, I have either had wonderful culinary experiences or meager experiences . . . unforntunately Tick Tock serves up on the meager end of the scale.  Now, mind you I do hold the bar pretty high when it comes to "disco fries", especially being a Canadian, who has a taste for the very best disco fries (known up north as "poutine").  Here at Tick Tock, you seem to get steak fries with a dollup of beef gravy and what appears to be a slice of processed white american cheese or perhaps mozarella (though I am not counting on it).  This was just pathetic. The burger I ordered was definitely edible and fairly tasty (it had cajun spices and cheese.  It didn't blow me away, but it was good I suppose. So far, for a state with so many diners, I have been met with limited success in the quality of their offerings, and unfortunately this was no exception.
