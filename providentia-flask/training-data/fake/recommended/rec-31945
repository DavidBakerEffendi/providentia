Best beer selection in New haven by far. The place is very large and can get pretty busy on the weekends. I feel like Cask has an identity crisis when it comes to the food. I'm not sure how to categorize it. Weird turkey burgers on english muffins, ahi tuna, and oyster sliders round out the odd menu. With that said, it's all pretty good. Burgers are a bit overcooked every time but all the beer makes up for that. Nice place, spend some time reading the beer menu because it's extensive.
