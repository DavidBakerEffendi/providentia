One of my favorite guilty pleasures in New Haven.  Open late, usually not crowded, huge varied selection.  I'll usually get a gyro, or one of the other greek choices like the spinach pie, and haven't been dissapointed...though i hope you like dill.  The large stuffed clams are amazingly huge and quite enjoyable and the garlic bread with mozzerella is great to shar with a large group. Definately one of the best places to go after 11PM for some decent food at a great price.
