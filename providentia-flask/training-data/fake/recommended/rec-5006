I've had great BBQ in Hill Country so naturally, was suspicious of this place as it's far easier to fuck BBQ up than it is to do it right.  Great food requires conviction, passion and soul and the combination of all three = love (on a plate).  In a word, Morgans does it right.  First bite and it was evident - they love me and aim to please.  Fatty brisket was peppery, moist and had the perfect "melt in your mouth" ratio of fat / meat.  The Mac & cheese was oozing with cheese and had the proper ratio of cheese to macaroni, and the collards were not too soggy (as they often are when overlooked) and were just vinegary enough - although, I must say they were a tad over salted.  My only issue was with the corn bread.  Served barely luke warm, a bit dry and dense and contained too many jalapeño's for my taste.   Wait staff was attentive and friendly.  Only five blocks from home, I may just become a regular.  Thanks Morgans, for loving what you do and for bringing great BBQ to the neighborhood!!
