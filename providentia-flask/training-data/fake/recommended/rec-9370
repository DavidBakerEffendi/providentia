this little gem in the heart of chelsea has some of the most exquisite argentinian cuisine in nyc.  The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is just great for a quite late diner or a first date. The empanadas are to die for, you can pick the all 3 for the experience and will fall in love immediately.  I dont have a favorite dish because i have loved everything i tried so far. The salmon patagonico, el bife de lomo, the mushroom risito (in my opinion the best even than those i've tried in italy) are the ones i would highly recommend. overall everything was excellent every single time. but i do recommend making a reservation for dinner.
