I made reservation thru open table at 12pm on Saturday, and due to my friend's train delay, I called to the restaurant and changed my reservation (twice!!) to 2pm that day and  they were all very polite to let me change the reservation.   I love the service , the waiter is very  professional. We chose the 3 pastas ($17.95)  that day,  the appetizer is very good esp the grilled octopus, it was so good that i not only ate mine but also my gf's!!  However, I am not a big fan of ravioli came with that day because it is a bit under cooked and a bit raw. The desert sampler ($18) was awesome, i am usually not too crazy about sweet stuff, but I ate almost everything on the plate and they are all so good!! Overall it was a place that i will definitely come back again while i am in the Hell's kitchen area! If you are there during the dinner time (and esp during the weekend ,i think you def need to make reservation. By the time we left around 5pm, it was almost full. (Dinner starts to be seated at 4pm)
