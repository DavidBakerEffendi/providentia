The noodles were good but my expectations were too high given all these 5 star reviews. I haven't had the picked mustard greens (za chai) in a while and it was a good addition. If you order the sliced beef noodle soup, for an extra dollar you can add what they call "brisket" which is the more chewy tendon-y stuff. They don't have much of an offering for vegetable side dishes and I would *not* recommend ordering the chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. It was just blanched and slapped on some standard store bought oyster sauce. Bottom line not very tasty.
