They have a beautiful location, they have decent parking in a city that is notorious for bad parking, their crispy duck is great, but the mainstay of their menu I find to be poorly executed. In general, their dining experience appears to be static but unfocused. I have yet to try their Korean offerings, but I think the fact that they have a Korean menu speaks to their lack of focus. There are much better Chinese restaurants within walking distance, so go try those.
