This place is just great all-round. For an area that frequently delivers over-priced mediocrity, Hudson Clearwater is a refreshing change. The food is consistently great. The wine selection and cocktails are spot on. The atmosphere is beautiful, yet relaxed and comfortable. Oh, and everything on the menu is less than $20! It's a solid go-to that never disappoints. You'll find yourself coming back again and again.
