Great spot for what it is. Cheap, no frills Vietnamese with a few Nepalese dishes also. The Banh Mi is a great deal for $3.50-$4.50. I prefer the chicken to the pork (similar to bologna). The dumplings are simple and delicious. I especially like the salsa-like dipping sauce they come with. Last time I was there, they had pyaji (similar to pakoras) 2 for $1. I love the feel of the place. It's much smaller than Pho Dang and Pho Hong (only 4 tables) and feels kind of like you're eating in someone's home. Will be back often!
