Girlfriend and I came here for a casual Saturday brunch in Williamsburg to get out of the City for a few hours. The restaurant is a little out of the way from the main hubub of Williamsburg near the L Subway station, but the walk gives you a chance to see the unique Williamsburg shops (and construction). The restaurant is in a nondescript building, but is decorated with a charming though slightly overdone francophile theme. On a NY summer day, the seating area was a little warm, but it did not interfere with our meal. The friendly and French waitress/hostess immediately greeted us and cleared a table for two.  She was attentive and helpful throughout the meal. I'm not a pro when it comes to crepes, but these tasted excellent.  We split the Bergere (~$10, Goat Cheese, Rosemary, Honey, Figs) and then I had the Normande (~$12, Chicken, Mushrooms, Wine Sauce).  Both had good consistency and amazing flavor.   We finished with the Banana-Nutella dessert crepe (~$6), which was good (anything with banana and nutella should be...).  As has been noted by other reviewers the whipped cream was a bit watery. 4 stars for the charming decor, excellent service, tasty food and reasonable prices.
