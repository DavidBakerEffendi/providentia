im not sure why it took me so long to do a review here.... i love this place so much that i would buy it out if i could (ie if i wasn't a poor starving grad student on a billion dollar loan).   what can i really say? the food is five star, the price is five star.  oh.. but for personal recommendations: the kim bap with spicy chicken.  its around $6 including soup!  super steal!!!  but the last few times i came here, they kinda split up the chicken and kim bap into two items- you get more of each, but you have to buy two different small boxes.  i think they finally caught on that they would make more $$$ this way.  oh well, ill forgive them since its still cheap.  another thing i like is the seafood pancake- but again, you can't really mess this up.  oh right, they also have the cheapest soju- so, perfect place for pre-gaming.
