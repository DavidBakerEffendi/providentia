If I had to pick one word to summarize this restaurant:  BLAND! My family and I visited Brazi's for a birthday dinner.  We ordered 3 appetizers and a wide variety of meals including a specialty pizza.   The best part of the meal was the free bread which was served before the appetizers.   Brazi's opened in the early '90s and through the years they have built a strong following of regulars.  Many of those regulars seem to be aging baby boomers who eat with their memories and not their taste buds.  The food is not the worst but for what they are charging I expected food that was fresher and flavorful.  The majority of food we ordered tasted as if it had been prepared well in advance and frozen until they needed it. The service was good however the waiter had very little knowledge of what kind of wine the restaurant had available.  The food came out very quickly which is another indication that it wasn't made to order.  I'd stay away from this place as there are just so many better choices in the greater New Haven area.
