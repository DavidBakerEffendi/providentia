Went here for our pizza meal while in NY based on reputation and reviews. Waited about 20 minutes in a line outside. Seems like there is always a line. Got seated and promptly served. The menu is simple, pretty much pizza, calzone, antipasto. The place was packed and the seating is cramped. It is clearly an old building and it shows. The service was not rude or gruff, just fast paced, as pretty much everyone seemed to be constantly working on something in there. The pizza was excellent. The olives were the most flavorful I have ever seen on a pizza, almost too much so, as they had a little too much salt on them. The pepperoni was great in thick small slices that curled up when cooked. The cheese is fresh globs on mozzerella, rather than tons of shredded cheap dry mozzerella. The large pizza with 5 toppings set us back $28, but honestly, that is not much more than I pay for a large good pizza at most independent places. It was the meal we felt was most worth what we paid in NY during our trip. All in all, really good pizza. No credit cards though, which I cannot stand, especially considering how many other places in NY only take cash. What is the deal with that? Also, they say No Takeout, but I saw people walking out with full pizzas packaged up, so I am not sure on that one.
