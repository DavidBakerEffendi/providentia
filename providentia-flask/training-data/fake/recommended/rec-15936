Recently I hosted my baby boy's birthday at the patio section..Wow!! is the only word that comes to my mind.Firstly the staff was very hospitable.The patio section looked beautiful..amazing atmosphere.Secondly,the food is great Italian food.We got pasta's,bruschetta,shrimp,gnocci,cheese & meat platter's,small pizza etc..for kids...all guests complemented on the food.Everyone had a good time at the party.The staff also helped with cake,decorations & also a little magic show I did in that place .I definitely and highly recommend this place.I am going to plan another get-together soon. Thank you all at UVA!
