While visiting NYC for our 37th wedding anniversary we chose Benito One in Little Italy.  The table we had requested in advance was not ready when we arrived but we decided to wait.  So glad we did! The wait provided us an opportunity to experience fabulous hospitality and customer service.  I spent a lot of the wait time getting to know James Bari, the co-owner.  James grew up in this neighborhood and worked at various other restaurants on the block before buying Benito One three years ago.  James and I got to know one another and I know now that I made a new friend that night. As for the food, "Bellissima!".  My wife had the lobster with pasta.  She only allowed me a small taste (all I get after 37 years!)  but it was fabulous.  For myself I enjoyed the bow tie pasta with broccoli and Italian sausage.  The pasta was prepared with the most tasty olive oil I've ever had.  The broccoli was cooked perfectly and the sausage the best.   Overall, a fabulous meal at a very cool restaurant owned by a very nice man.  Perhaps our best anniversary dinner yet!
