My friend and I were looking for some Mediterranean food for lunch on a Tuesday. We saw the good review for this place online and decided to give it a try. We were by no means disappointed! Minutes after we entered on a chilled day, we were served toasty, tender pita with warm tahini. Real comfort food. Our server, whose name we unfortunately did not catch (blonde hair! plaid shirt! youthful!), was absolutely terrific, offering us tailored advice in terms of dietary restrictions and portion sizes. With her help, we ultimately ordered the falafel ziti to share, I got the hummus mutabacha, and my friend got a lamb wrap. The falafel is some of the best we've ever had; it came with a sort of tomato salsa and delicious sauteed onions, all served over a lemony sauce (lemon tahini?) .Our server explained that they make their falafels specially; they were definitely different, in a great way. I'm a vegetarian and was concerned I was eating meat, because the falafels had such a meaty texture. My hummus mutabacha was incredible--a smokey, tahini-heavy hummus with warm tomatoes and a soft-boiled egg over top. The fact that some chickpeas were left unpureed gave the hummus a great texture. The wrap had lamb, onion, and black baba ghanoush (eggplant skin kept on), with crushed tomatoes and a lemon preserve on the side. My friend describes it as smokey and flavourful, and she said the lamb was extremely tender. All this is to say we left warm, full, and happy (and with leftovers!)
