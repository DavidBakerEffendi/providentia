We were at Grizzly Pear and wanted some vietnamese food.  My friend suggested Saigon Shack across the street.  When we went to put in our name, the waiter told us it would be a 15-20 wait, we said we were across the street, he said he would come get us when the table was ready, and sure enough in 20 mins he did!  He was super nice even when my friend was too drunk to sit properly, order, and eat.  The crew was really nice and the food came out fast.  The spicy pho was amazing, no other ingredients needed!  I can't wait to go back. The fresh/spring rolls were great too, they use marinated pork as the meat and it's delicious!   Great food and great service!  A must try if you're in that neighborhood.
