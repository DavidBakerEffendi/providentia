the second of the BXL locations that I've been to, and once again was not disappointed. we met up with our good Yelp friend Meredith (who has been extradited back to the West Coast) for dinner here as she was in town for a few days. kicked it off with a big pot of mussels in a wheat beer broth and plenty of fries. fantastic! a nice hint of citrus in it too. the size was perfect for us, though our dinner came out right after so we didn't get a chance to completely finish it. as for dinner, I went with the beef stew and fries. tender chunks of beef that just fell apart with a fork, and the brown ale-based sauce it came in packed a lot of flavor. the fries were perfectly crispy, though at this point fry overload was imminent. washed it down with a glass of BXL Cuvee. gotta love Belgian beer! dessert ended up being comped - since the mussels and dinner came out nearly on top of each other - so we ordered the profiteroles (since there were 3 of us). wonderfully flaky, and the dollop of ice cream inside hit the spot. service was excellent and friendly. the food at BXL is reliable, the beer list makes me a happy camper, and the atmosphere - relaxed and fairly subdued - is a welcome contrast to a neighborhood that can be a little too hectic for my taste.
