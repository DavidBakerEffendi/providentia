GREAT quality food, no matter what I have had.   They are a bit more pricey than most other places in downtown for lunch, but its a nice treat every so often.   Their garlic bread is pretty good.  They told me most people like it better than Hot Tomato's but to me it didn't even come close.  Although I have ever had their desserts, I have heard they are pretty good. I also recommend a reservation, because I have seen them have a wait during the work day for lunch.
