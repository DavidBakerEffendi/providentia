What a ridiculously good and under-rated brunch spot in Williamsburg.   Seriously, why is this place not on more people's radar? We had the eggs benedict and crab cakes and split them both.  Warning: food is a bit small, but priced right, and is absolutely delicious.  This is not to say that we were hungry upon leaving, but I just wanted to get the plate size out in the open. The presentation of the food was excellent, as was the attentive service. The atmosphere is as chill as Williamsburg, but the service is better than most Williamsburg locales, I would say.  The drinks tasted as though they were mixed and poured by a master mixologist.  The best old fashioned in Brooklyn, I say!   But really, this is a must for brunch, because not only was it awesome - there was no wait.  Why wait a decade at the over-rated Egg when you could come here?  Get a table in less time, and be surrounded by ambience that evokes an urban meeting rustic feel.  I cannot wait to return.
