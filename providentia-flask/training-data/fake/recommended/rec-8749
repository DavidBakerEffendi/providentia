My boyfriend and I made a 8:45pm reservation for Friday night but we got there early and they were able to accommodate us. Where do I begin... White linen table cloths, waiters in traditional outfits..it really is in the details that make experiences memorable. We started off with their Black Label Burger as an app(recommended by our waiter). They even split it in half for us. What can I say, it's famous for a reason! So juicy, so decadent, I could've eaten 2 of them. Literally devoured my half in 2 bites. Which brings me to my ONLY con, it was a tad on the small side for the price. But Hey, quality over quantity right? We then split the Steak for 2, perfectly cooked to our medium rare specifications. My boyfriend even hailed it as the best steak he's ever had! Lastly, we topped it all off with the soufle which I could've done without but I always need a sweet ending to a meal. It was rich but nothing spectacular to write home about. Oh Yea, we also got a bottle of their French Cab that our waiter gave us a brief tutorial/history on. It tasted sweeter than other cabs we've had in the past, apparently it's because French grapes are different..Who knew? Overall great experience, would def recommend for meat lovers and food enthusiasts!
