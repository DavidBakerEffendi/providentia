Who would have thought you could take something as simple and classic as a grilled cheese and make it exciting and new. Great flavors and combinations. I need to go back and try all the sandwiches. The tomatoe soup was surprisingly delicious. I expected a cup of watery Campbell's but instead got a cup of something slightly chunky and beautifully seasoned. Snack-wise, the pickled blueberries were unlike anything. I loved the extra zing they gave my salad. The curry pumpkin seeds were somewhat underwhelming but still fun to munch on. Extensive beer list and wine options. Â Great for groups or just to grab a quick bite at one of the smaller tables. Service was friendly and efficient. I'm impressed that such a small kitchen could quickly provide such special food. Can't wait to bring my guy back, if I can actually find the place again. They should probably invest in some kind of sign that sets them apart. I passed by twice without noticing the location because they're "sandwiched" (har har) between businesses. FYI: They're directly next door to the Pollo place with the huge yellow sign! Good luck!
