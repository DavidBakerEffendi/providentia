Tried the roasted pork with the broccoli rabe.  The bread was okay, the pork was dry, the cheese wasn't even melted (mostly because the pork wasn't even really hot), gravy was lacking. Maybe we had high expectations thanks to the travel channel, but this did not live up to the hype. Also it's a pricey sub to not be satisfied. Positives?  Even with a long line they were moving the line pretty quickly.
