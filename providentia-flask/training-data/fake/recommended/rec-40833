It's definitely a sports bar to try. They have a ton of TVs and great beer on tap. The food was good. I got a bar pie and boneless wings and they both were actually quite good. Everyone I was with enjoyed the food as well. My only issue was I felt some of the draft beers were a bit overpriced. My pumpkin beer was $7.00. Most people around me were getting the bud light pitcher special because it was the cheapest way to go which every bar has. So it's up to you how to interpret this last piece of information.
