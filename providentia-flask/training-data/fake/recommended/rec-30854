I've been a regularly customer at uli jib for the past year and a half, as I work on 34th street and it's an easy walk at lunchtime. Having lived in Korea before and eaten a lot of Korean cuisine, the food is pretty basic. It's essentially Korean cafeteria-comfort food with an American twist on many of the dishes. There is the a la carte option, but I usually go for the packaged entree and soup deals. I've had several entrees there but the only one that is consistently decent is the spicy garlic chicken. The curry and pork cutlet is terribly bland, avoid it. It's also usually very busy inside so a good option is to get your food and head out to Herald Square Park if the weather is nice.
