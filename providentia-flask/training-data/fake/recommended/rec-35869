Great food. Great atmosphere. Had the Concord Grape vodka cocktail. So good- I had another. The steak tartare was fabulous and so was the lamb our server was attentive and the service was impeccable. The dessert was excellent. At the end of the meal we were surprised with an additional selection of treats. After paying the bill we were given another treat- a cinnamon muffin which made a wonderful snack the next day. A wonderful experience. I will definitely return
