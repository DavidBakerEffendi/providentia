We were a party of 12, were seated immediately, but waited a good 45 min for the waiter to take our drink order. Food was ok, service sucked, noise level very loud, we were a mixed crowd young and middle aged couples, and everyone couldn't even carry on a conversation without yelling, and this was a Tuesday night..
