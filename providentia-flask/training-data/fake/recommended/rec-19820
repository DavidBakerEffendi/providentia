Honestly, these guys are like legalized drug dealers. It must be something in that white sauce. Come here at any time of the day and you'll see a line of people willing to wait like an hour just for a chicken and rice. And I'm one of them. I love when tourists walk past and look in awe about a line of people waiting for a street meat vendor. Try it once and you'll be hooked. I don't know what else to say that hasn't been said in almost 5500 4 1/2 star reviews. This place is that good.
