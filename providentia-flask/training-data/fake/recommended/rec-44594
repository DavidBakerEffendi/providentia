the daing na bangus was fried  to eternity, you could not anymore taste the fish.  not to mention, the serving was too small - just the head part, which does not contain alot of fish meat. total fail.  the adobong pusit was too tough, not enough sauce, and it still had the plastic particle.  the bicol express did not have slivers but big chunks of pork, and not sauteed, as the menu had promised.  hardly any peppers. buko pandan was good.
