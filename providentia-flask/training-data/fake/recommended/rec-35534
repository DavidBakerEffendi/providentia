Have been here at least once a month and receive consistently good service, great drinks, and yummy food. Service is always impeccable. Sometimes there's a wait, but it's a popular spot. Once seated, you're never waiting too long to see your server, and they are very good at refilling water and especially good at ensuring that you have enough cocktails and drinks. I'm not a tequila (and therefore margarita) fan, but I love their Pink Cadillac margarita! You can also get Corona on draft, which is the king of beers in my book. Their rojo sangria is sweet, but goes well with the spicy salsa that is served. Consistently good food! The guacamole happily feeds a party of 5! No one is fighting for the last bits of scrumptious avocado. Wide range of tacos to choose from and all have satisfied. I even got the Mexican chopped salad (with a side of beef) and it was HUGE. The only thing that has been less than stellar were the enchiladas, which were made with a marinara tomato, and weren't quite what I had expected. Otherwise, an obvious favorite of mine, and I take everyone who visits Philadelphia to El Vez.
