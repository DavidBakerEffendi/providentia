Have you ever seen the face of god? I have and I can tell you it looks like pulled duck lettuce wraps with banana puree. You ever wonder what the point of the Large Hadron Collider is? Well, it makes Pork cheek and pork belly meatloaf. I fucking love this place so much. If you like Traif, then just think of this as its older hotter sister. If you want to make out with some of your friends' hot older sisters, then just bring them here. Prices are extremely reasonable. $5-$22(Venison). We had 7 dishes + 2 desserts the first night. $6 Roasted Carrots $9 Fricca-dilla(Asiago cheese, potatoes, fried egg, and salsa verde) $11 Korean short ribs with Guacamole $11 Pulled duck lettuce wraps with banana puree $15 Crab Flan(not a fan) $7 Spring Onions $14 Pork cheek and pork belly meatloaf (Prices are fairly accurate, I was drunk, give me a break) We went back the next night to get dessert because it was that damn good. Churros with Jalepeno Cranberry Sorbet are solid, as well as the Sundae. Make sure to try the Agave. Ask for the side of Blood Oranges and coke lines of sesame salt, etc.
