Before I went to Egan & Sons, I was quiet excited for the extensive beer list and the fact that there were mainly good reviews on Yelp.  Now, after the fact, I need to seriously voice my opinion on the matter. My boyfriend and I went here on a Saturday night around 5:30, figured there wouldn't be a crowd and didn't exactly want to deal with one.  The decor (wood paneling, lighting, shutters, tables) was very elegant, and seemed fitting for an upscale bar scene.  Although, the artwork was way too modern and didn't fit the place; it emcompassed more of a classic feel.  It took us a while to get a waiter, even though the place had more than half of its tables empty.  We got our drinks in a reasonable matter of time as well as our food.   My first complaint was that our waiter, Henzly, got my order wrong.  Not a huge issue because I still was willing to eat what I was served.  I figured I'd let it slide, not wanting to make a big deal out of the matter.  Food was acceptable, nothing memorable or anything I would crave and go back for.  Throughout the course of our meal, he never asked how we were doing- not even once.  We sat with our plates basically empty for a solid fifteen minutes until the bus boy approached us. (I must say, I think I spoke to the bus boy more than our waiter)  When we were sick of sitting there, we had to flag Henzly down to get our check, which was insanely rude because all he was doing was bantering with his colleagues at the bar.  The time passed and when he did serve us our check, he didn't even say anything to us. I was really hoping this place would have been better.  A nicer bar scene in the Montclair area seems to be hard to find.
