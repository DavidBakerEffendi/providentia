stop #1 on the NYC FOODSTRAVAGANZA a friend and i were staying at my friends place in Chinatown. hungry after being on a plane for 5 hrs with a time change, we were ready for something on our list. luckily this spot was practically just a block away. a small noodle shop on a small street was reminiscent of noodle shops or congee shops i've been to in China and Hong Kong. we got hand pulled noodles of course. one with dumplings and one with oxtail. the consistency of the noodles was chewy, as it should be and the broth was tasty. the oxtail was sparse, but for $5 a bowl, there was nothing to complain about.
