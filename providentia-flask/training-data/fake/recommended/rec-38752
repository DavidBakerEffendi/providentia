Came from out of town last Saturday and enjoyed an affordable and delicious brunch at Chhaya. Staff: Good enough. They were kind enough to stow my luggage behind the counter while waiting for my wife to show up, serve me a cup of water while I was waiting and afford prompt and attentive service once she arrived. Not the friendliest in the world (no time for small talk or smiles), but very adept and competent. Drink: The black coffee is delicious and unlimited for something like $3. It was a Saturday so we both got unlimited coffee. Food. Ordered the Huevos Rancheros Waffle. Sounds weird, tastes great. Kind of like a vaguely Latin-influenced eggs Benedict over a waffle. $11 or $12 if I recall, which is an affordable price for brunch. Venue and Locale. I'm not from the NE, but thanks to the Fresh Prince I know that South Philly is not supposed to be a neighborhood of trendy cafes (wait, isn't that West Philly?). Anyways, no matter where Big Willie hails from, the neighborhood we explored has a cool, artsy vibe to it. This is relevant to this restaurant review because the restaurant really shares the vibe of the surrounding neighborhood. The majority of patrons look like they either have liberal arts degrees or work in a bike shop, or both. One stylish patron was sporting the hipster trifecta of bulky black glasses, suspenders and an impressive mustache. Typically I'm skeptical of restaurants that are "scenes" more than venues for delivering food and drink to my gullet, but fortunately Chhaya hasn't gotten lazy and decreased food quality or added a "trend" surcharge yet. Until they do Chhaya remains a great option for coffee, breakfast and brunch.
