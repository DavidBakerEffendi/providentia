Out of over 200 thai restaurant I've been to while I was traveling with my dad since 11 years old up until now, this has got to be the best restaurant I've ever been to. The restaurant has a casual setting. The seats were decorated with a fabric called pa karma (a traditional thai fabric which used as towels. The food was on point, delicious, fresh and authentic. I wish they have restaurant like this in Virginia. Â I was in New York for 4 days. Went there all 4 days. Wish i could give this place more stars!
