Incredible all around. The ambiance. The food. The wine. The servers. The French-ness of it all.... Absolutely divine. Highly recommend ordering the portabella flatbread. It was the most perfect balance of meaty mushrooms, balsamic, parm, on a crispy flatbread.... I already plan on returning Â with my husband just to order this. The Amelie Salad was full if goodness. My friend and I split it and still didn't finish it. Every bite was filled with delicious-ness: crisp green beans, avocado, asparagus... I don't often get excited about salad, but this is worth a call out. Note: There was a big table in the back that could seat 10. Must remember this for the next birthday or client dinner.
