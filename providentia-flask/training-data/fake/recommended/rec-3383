Came here with a friend for lunch. Very decent priced lunch specials. They also make a few speciality drinks but we tried their original Margarita and their red sangria. Both were very yummy. The meal came with chips and your choice of salsa or guac. The chips are not your traditional cut chips but they're small and round like tortillas. Extra chips cost a buck. The atmosphere is unique as well from the decor to the ceiling. Our waitress was very nice and attentive as well. They accidently put salt on our Margarita and she noticed right away and fixed it.
