So on our way back from new hamp we figured why not try there best pizza... Sub par at best and nothing special. Joe's pizza in the city is better and they only sell 2 different types of slices. We had a large pie half was peperoni the other half sausage and fresh roasted peppers... The side with the pepperoni was burnt the cheese was dark almost black. This could just be me but if I am going to a top pizza place shouldn't you serve fresh mozzarella? The dough was think and the crust for mist of it was too burnt. $23 for a large pie and I much rather be at Grimaldis or lombardis. This wasn't my favorite compared to Grimaldis by the way is the best pizza hands down! Ha Try franks to say that you tried it. It could be your thing.
