For dinner, Hiep and I had this place called The Meatball Shop. This was another of his picks from around the neighborhood. Good stuff. Got rigatoni with pesto sauce. The pesto sauce had some kind of nuts in it that made it very tasty. The meatballs were the right size and also very tasty. The weakest part of the meal was the foccacia bread, which was basically a small slice and totally useless. Had the Albita root beer. Also very tasty. Overall, a pretty good meal.
