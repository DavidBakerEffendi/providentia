THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! I don't know if I am being bias because I came here right after a mini spa treatment, starving, but I enjoyed my lunch immensely! My friend and I wanted some Greek food because we're rarely trek out to Astoria (which is so sad, but it's just so out of the way!). And lo and behold Yelp has led us here. We started out with the Octopus salad. Backstory- we once had this amazing grilled octopus tentacle from a restaurant we can not remember any more (one of t he NYC Restaurant Week places), but we always craved for it and can never find anything to compare with! And the day has come! This one was DELICIOUS. (BTW, if we did not like the grilled octopus at Taverna Kyclades, where everyone raved about it- I just remembered the texture was terrible). Just everything about it was great- octopus was cooked perfectly, no rubbery texture, and the chick peas and dressing complimented perfectly. I ordered the Lamb burger (medium) with smoked mozzerella. WOW. SO SO GOOD. And you know what's even better, what really sold this place for me? Their SMASHED FRIES. Okay, so it's fried like crazy, but IT IS SO GOOD AND CRISPY. I ate mine and also most of my friend's portion (shhhh). My friend got the Chicken Souvlaki, which looked delicious. She said she had better, but was still very good. Service was great, very attentive. I was driving for the day, but next time (and there will be a next time!) I will grab a couple of drinks. Too bad it's getting cold again, they did have a little outdoor space for tables out in the front, but the inside was pretty spacious and there is a nice looking bar. I even filled out their survey card. That's how much I really enjoyed my lunch there. :)
