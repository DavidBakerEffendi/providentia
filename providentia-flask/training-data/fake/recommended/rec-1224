HOLLYHELL! ...I thought DiNic's was good, but this place is F***ING awesome! My mouth waters just thinking about this artery clogging goodness. I'm a little mad that I only just found out about this place, even though I lived in Philly most my life. They need better advertising/signadge or something. Best beef brisket I have ever had, EVER! and I have had a lot of pork. (here goes trying to be 80% raw veg) I just ordered from here for my whole office, everyone was very happy. Got a "Best ______ I have ever had" from a few people. Sandwich Quality 5* Ambiance 4* Staff 5* Price 5* Delivery Time 5*
