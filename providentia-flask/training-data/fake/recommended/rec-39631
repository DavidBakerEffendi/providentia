I am from out of state and two seperate times, with two different friends, was I brought to this place - crazy that it would be a common favorite in a city of so many options! The food was great and the margaritas STRONG. There was a big wait both times and people were pretty pushy around the bars. So don't go here on a Friday or Saturday night if you are looking to have space, a quiet conversation, or immediate seating. A pretty good crowd - mid-20's -30's.
