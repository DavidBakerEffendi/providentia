This place should be spelled H-I-P-S-T-E-R. and I think I like it!  Their staff is uber cool with an indie style, and they offer $3 Kennsingers which I enjoyed all evening.  Great whiskey selection (I mean, they ARE hipsters so that's expected) and a huge beer list. You know something they do pretty well that hasn't been noted? I think it's pretty challenging to keep a sardine bar from smelling fishy, but they do it. Just thought I would tell you. We ordered a huge bowl of fries with a delicious dipping sauce for $5 and it was enough for three people to share. Ok, we might have ordered another bowl too. It was enough for three sober people to share. They keep the music and lighting just right, and create a perfectly hip atmosphere. Check it out... but remember, I was there before it was cool.
