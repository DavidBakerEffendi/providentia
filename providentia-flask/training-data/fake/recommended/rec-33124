I used to love this cart, but after eating here 100 times or more, my opinion isn't the same.  The chicken is way too dry, and you have to drown it in a mayo-laden white sauce to get it down the hatch.  And the white sauce itself gives me heartburn.  But it is cheap and plentiful.  The lamb is too greasy, but better than the chicken.  The hot sauce is FIRE so don't add too much on your own.  When I am starving or just want meat/lettuce during my low-carb days, I make at one of their 3 carts in the area (usually 53rd and 7th since there's never a line since everyone thinks they HAVE to go to 6th Avenue for the Halal Guys when in fact it's the same people).
