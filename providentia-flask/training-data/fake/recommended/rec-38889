This is the place my family comes every Christmas Eve. The prices are great and the sea assortment is the best. Fresness is never a question because the fish all have clear eyes, the octopus are still swiming in their pool, the clams are still spitting water, Jumbo shrimp are all fresh (not frozen), etc. The fish mongers filet the fish in front of us that we pick. Christmas Eve dinner is always 7 fish and this is still the best place to shop. We travel from northern Bergen county to Popular Market for the single reason that: our guests expect fresh delicious food and thats what we get here at the best prices!
