What I like so much about Empanada Mama is that it's very multi-purpose: whether it be take-out, catching up with an old friend or even a casual date, Empanada Mama is the true multi-purpose spot for feel-good Latin comfort food...empanadas and arepas are always tasty, guac is comforting and the steaks (the palomilla is better than the skirt) are a good bang for your buck...also, make sure to ask for extra mojo sauce (light green sauce, not to be confused with their chimichurri sauce which is actually one of the few things that are subpar).
