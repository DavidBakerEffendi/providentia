Though the broth was delicious, the brisket was sub par. I do not recommend getting it.. very fatty and not cut properly. The shaved noodles were fantastic and warrant the three star rating themselves! The restaurant is also gorgeous on the inside considering the location and interior of other local spots of similar cuisine. Would definitely try again but with another meat!
