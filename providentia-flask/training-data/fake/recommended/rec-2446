Pates et Traditions is tres magnifique! I cannot say enough good things about this place. Beautifully decorated like you are in the french countryside with cheery pictures of France, quaint vases, lighting, cushy seats and soothing music. You can enjoy heartier french dishes such as Beef Bourguignon, pressed sandwiches such as Croq Monsieur or crepes. They offer both savory and sweet. I went with the savory. It was heavenly combination of potatoes, cream, ham and Swiss cheese. Accompanying it was a green salad and freshly squeezed orange juice. Heavenly!!!! North Sixth street is really an exceptional block for food because of Pates Et Traditions, Seas and Fette Sau(nearby)! Lucky Williamsburgers!
