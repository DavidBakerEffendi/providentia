PHILADELPHIA Thin sliced roast pork stuffed into a hoagie.  Better than any cheesesteak Philly has to offer.  I prefer to have extra gravy or sauce on mine so it's more of a French Dip sandwich. You have the option of sit down stool service at the counter or getting it to go and grabbing a seat in the terminal's designated eating area.  Either way, don't let the lines scare you off as they are fast and efficient. I think I wolfed down my sandwich before I made it to the public tables.  The sauce drippings were running down my arm.   While the bread is not quite as good as Carmen's, DiNic's sandwich's are just fantastic and you get a lot of meat.  I'll have to go back to try the brisket everyone is raving about.  The brisket looked like it was falling apart when they were hand carving it as opposed to the roast pork which was thin sliced machine cut. Cheers! N.
