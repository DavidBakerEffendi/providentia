Love this place!! It's been here my whole life (actually, it's been in the same place since my grandmother was four yrs old), and only started really going there. The bartenders are hysterical! If you go when it's busy, you lose the opportunity to make conversation with them, but if it's a slow or empty night, they are the best. The food is surprisingly good for a bar, completely reasonable portions, also have the best prices for liquor, and a good jukebox. I went there on a Fri night and met the scenesters and hipsters that are moving from Williamsburg and Bushwick into Ridgewood. It was a fun night, lots of music, dancing, conversation and drink!!
