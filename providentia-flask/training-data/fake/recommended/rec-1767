I'm usually never up for breakfast but i had been craving pancakes for about a month so i decided to check out this place one Saturday morning.  When you walk you feel all warm and homey the way a breakfast joint should feel.   my gf and i both ordered omellettes bc we were starving and we got a stack of chocolate chip and banana pancakes to share.  The only reason why i didn't give this place 5 stars was because the omelletes were ok.  Nothing really special about them.   The best part about bfast was the pancakes!! wow so delicious... and the chocolate was melting OMG my mouth is watering thinking about them... They are on the thinner side as some places make thicker pancakes but this place is definitely worth checking out!
