I live nearby and had always wanted to try this place but was deterred by the long lines I see outside every weekend. Yesterday I decided to see what the fuss was all about and was not disappointed! First of all the line moves quickly (I waited about 25-30 minutes) and the hostess served everyone a glass of ice water and came around with french fries for us to try while we waited. Such nice service! I ordered eggs and shared the apple cinnamon pancakes which came with homemade flavored butters and were to die for. I will definitely come back so that I can try more of the delicacies!
