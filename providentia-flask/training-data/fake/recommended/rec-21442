Vietnam Café I don't know how I've lived in Philly for as long as I have and not succumbed to the café's beckoning neon light and enticing menu, but I made it. Seated very quickly for dinner on a Friday night. First thing I love about this place: they get down to business and believe in attending to you and serving up some deliciousness quickly. They're very matter-of-fact about it actually--not excessively smiley or chatty, but very much "you came here because you know it's good didn't you?" Started off with fried calamari and with one bite I morphed into the ever-so-loveable dinner companion Fat Bastard and I put all the calamari in my belly. Charmed, I'm sure. Then my beef lemongrass soup arrived and churl! Let there be a slurp competition somewhere. I will wear a noodle out. At this time of year few things are as satisfyingly delicious and nourishing as piping hot, richly flavored broth. My soul said yes. Speak Lord. And THEN my entrée arrived. When I try new places I always like to make myself get one of their specials. It's just good patron practice and common sense. Plus 'bout 5 other people surrounding me got it so I felt I was in good company. House Special Vermicelli y'all! Getcho self some of the bounty. All serving sizes were most generous bit not full on Fat Bastard levels of gluttony, even though my mind was telling me no and my body, my body was saying yaaaaaassssss. Sorry. Recapping this got so good to me I felt you needed to know that I don't see nothing wrong with eatin' at the Vietnam Café. Fantastic service, scrumdiddlyumptious food, reasonable prices and lovely relaxed atmosphere.
