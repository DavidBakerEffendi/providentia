I was recommended by a Vietnamese hair dresser saying that this was a one of the better/more authentic Vietnamese restaurant in the region, and I am inclined to agree. Â  They have a fairly small menu compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in the area, but what they do make, they make extremely well. The taste of the food here fresh and on the lighter side, where the flavor is through the natural taste of the ingredients instead of the gobs of sauces On a side note, I'm quite sensitive to MSG so I'm quite happy to say that if they do use it, they don't use it heavily, again, unlike some other Vietnamese restaurant in the area. The staff is friendly and nice, though since its family operated, they can sometimes lack people resulting in slightly slower service. The owner is always extremely nice and will always cater to your needs, all you need to do is ask. Definitely a welcome addition to West Hartford.
