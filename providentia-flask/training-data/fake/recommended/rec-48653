somewhere on the rough seas of south street, shipwrecked like the rest of us, in an underwater den in an underwater town, you'll find an odd assortment of castaways that make up mama's tats. (mama's tats may be sold to you as a dive, a pool hall, or a lounge for arts and crafts, but we know better.) a very pale stranger will approach you to talk about vampires (which is really fucking freaky....and yet good conversation); there's a whorehouse madam at the pooltable and a septuagenarian in his cups; a few lost souls watching clusters of clocks popping up, breathing in bubbles; mama's got a lotta tats. so drink up, forget home if you can, and never, ever, trust a sailor on dry land.
