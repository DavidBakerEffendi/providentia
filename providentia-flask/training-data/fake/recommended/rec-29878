Umami definitely makes a great burger, but it's not anywhere close to being top 5 for me.  The meat is a not tight and falls apart very easily.  While I was there, I had the truffle burger, which tasted good.  The truffle fries there are very good, but it only has a hint of it.  I would return to this place for a quick bite during lunch, but not for dinner.
