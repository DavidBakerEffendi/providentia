I just love this place and a few things I found out on my last visit there made me like it even more. First, I love the apps.  The first time I stopped in I had the pickled tomatoes and on my latest visit we tried the deviled eggs.  The appetizers are a great accompaniment to a pre-dinner drink and are enough to hold you over without ruining the meal.  We noticed the tater tots last time we were there and plan to try it next time.  None of the apps are overly fancy, but they're all really good. As far as the rest of the menu, their focus is definitely on burgers -- which isn't a bad thing, because they're great.  The "plain" burger comes with lettuce, tomato, and homemade Russian dressing on a very fluffy and delicious brioche roll.  The add-ons get pricey, but my husband ordered goat cheese on his burger and the amount they gave you was substantial.  I got the cheddar but I actually liked my husband's version better. The cheddar they use is a little saltier than I prefer. With all of those things said about the food, let's get to the drinks.  I'm a girl who likes to taste the liquor, so the prohibition-style drinks they serve are right up my alley.  They also have a set of "repeal" drinks that are fruitier with more mixers.  Every drink is carefully and artfully made and even if it's not something you've had before, you can count on it to be great.  I also found out that they make their own unique bitters concoctions -- definitely something I am now inspired to try on my own.  Finally, they change their drink menu, so there seems to always be something new to try.  Also, if you have an old favorite from a past menu, as long as they have the ingredients (which makes some of the custom "bitters-of-the-moment" drinks once and done), they're happy to make it for you.   In short, just love it.
