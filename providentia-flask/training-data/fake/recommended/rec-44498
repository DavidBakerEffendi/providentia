I have been a connoisseur of Filipino food for much of the last 24 years and Grill 21 is the only restaurant in Manhattan that I visit for a taste of home. The food is tasty and wholesome, as Filipino food should be. At the same time, Grill 21 prepares meals in a way that is clean and relatively healthier than I typically found in Manila (a big plus). To top it off, Henry, the owner is a great host, and he may liven up your meal with a hello. Will be back soon.
