I'm a first timer to the dim sum in general and I always felt like I wasn't a true Philadelphian until I had ate here. One the new restaurant is gorgeous! There is a ton of items on the menu so I definitely suggest going with someone who has ate their before. I wasn't disappointed with the scallion pancakes, bubble tea and of course the pork dim sum. You'll leave very full for not a ton of money. Remember to bring cash!
