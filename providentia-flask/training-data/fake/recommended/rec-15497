I specifically joined Yelp to warn people not to go to this restaurant. It was easily the worst dining experience my husband and I have had in the last 8 years. As Steve S. mentioned below, it failed to deliver in every way possible...from the service, to the ambiance, to the drinks, to the food, and especially to the owner/chef who was a complete nightmare to do business with. Save your money and save your frustration, go elsewhere.
