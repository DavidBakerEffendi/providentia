A little location on St. Mark's place. I always get the classic when I go to a new Vietnamese sandwich shop. It was pretty good! They forgot my order of summer rolls but they apologized and gave me a complimentary drink. The rolls were refrigerated so it would have been nice if it was a bit softer. Overall, Â I will definitely come back.
