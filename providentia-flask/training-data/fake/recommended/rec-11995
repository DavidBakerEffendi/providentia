Northern Spy is a good place for locovores.  Much of their food is locally or regionally sourced, organic, free range and all of that good stuff.  And, for those types of ingredients, the menu is not overpriced.  The atmosphere is good, though the decor has a paint by numbers feel.  The grocery in the back is a nice touch. When we got there, we were told there would be a thirty minute wait.  It was actually closer to an hour, but my girlfriend and I were in no hurry, the host was incredibly apologetic and sent some appetizers our way, and we were happy to hang out and have some wine. The food: The potato and rosemary flatbread appetizer was quite good; the flavor of rosemary was not too heavy, the potato was very light and the flatbread was tasty. We both got the butternut squash soup; it was more watery than that dish usually is, but I liked the flavor, though my girlfriend was unimpressed.  I had the fried chicken sandwich with the fried egg and chimichurri sauce.  It was great; I highly recommend it.  My girlfriend got the squash risotto; it was well prepared and delicious. Their wine list, though not large, is thoughtfully put together; there is something for everybody and there are some regional wines included.   I definitely recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a relaxed place with good, thoughtfully prepared food.
