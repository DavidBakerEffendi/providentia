I can't stop telling my friends about how Dinic's makes the best sandwich I've ever tasted in my life. Roast pork + sharp provo + broccoli rabe Not a combination you'd expect but wow, do they go well together. So good that I would go back to Philly JUST for this sandwich. The cheesesteaks have nothing on this!
