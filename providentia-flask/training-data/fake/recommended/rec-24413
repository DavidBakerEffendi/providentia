The restaurant is filled with flowers so it gives a very romantic vibe (you can buy the flowers there too). After you enter the restaurant, you pass a short hallway to get to the main dining area which is split into patio sitting and indoor sitting. The restaurant uses minimal lighting so it may not be good for children. The food is great. My husband and I got one main dish and three small dishes and we were comfortably full. Baked goat cheese, potatoes, lamb and rice were the small dishes we got which were very tastey and rice with octopus was the main dish for us. The food was not too heavily seasoned and the staff were very friendly.  I would come back to try other  dishes on the menu or try new dishes on the menu (I think they change the menu to keep it fresh).
