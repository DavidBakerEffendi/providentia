I felt very lucky to get a table right on the latter edge of brunch and 15 minutes before the kitchen closed for brunch.  My two friends, fiance and I slid into a corner banquet and enjoyed all of the yummy dishes we ordered.  I tucked into a plate of scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, a side of asparagus home fries and a bowl of cheese grits.  All were delicious dishes and I would order them again.  I loved the asparagus home fries - a mix of diced potatoes, cut up asparagus and leeks.  I ate all of mine and then ate the remainder of my friend's dish.  The scrambled eggs were fluffy and substantial.  The cheese grits didn't have a forward taste of cheese like my family makes it but I think it was probably the best bowl of grits I've had on the East coast. Everyone enjoyed their dishes and all plates were cleared.  Need I say more?
