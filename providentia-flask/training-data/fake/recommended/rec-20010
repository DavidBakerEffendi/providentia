Came here on a Wednesday night with a friend after having a few drinks nearby. The place is tiny but we got lucky and were seated immediately. We started with the grilled corn as an appetizer - get the corn, you will not be sorry. For our meals I had the enchiladas suizas, which were probably the best I've had. The tomatillo sauce was just the right amount of spicy and cheesey and the enchiladas were stuffed with chunks of well seasoned grilled chicken. My friend got the camarones al ajillo - huge shrimp in creamy garlicy sauce served with rice and beans. The waitress was great, very friendly and attentive. She brought our drinks out quickly, which were also pretty great. Everything was scrumptious and I'm still thinking about that corn...I can't wait to go back!
