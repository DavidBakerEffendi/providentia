Really great place for lunch or dinner.  The ambiance is very nice with both indoor and outdoor seating (weather permits).  The wait staff are very friendly and courteous. The food is really good - both meat and vegetarian dishes.  The portions are just right.  I personally love their ginger pork meatloaf.
