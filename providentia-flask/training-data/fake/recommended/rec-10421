Stopped by for the weekday buffet on Valentine's day and was really really disappointed, thus have to drop my overall review of Baadshah by 1 star... - There was a new soup available, however, it appeared to be only ramen noodles with some peas. Tried 2 spoons and could not have any more of it. Instead, perhaps a more traditional sambar would have been better suited. - There was Shrimp Vindaloo, however, it was extremely mild and more vinegary than spicy as it should be. - Many of the superb vegetarian dishes were removed and replaced with deep fried items. My GF, who is vegetarian was not pleased at all in the reduction of vegetarian options and the increase in unhealthy deep fried items. - The 'special price' for this 'holiday' was not advertised and we ended up paying more for what we thought was the worst buffet experience we have ever had here. I even mentioned some of the above items to the owner. Hopefully things will improve.
