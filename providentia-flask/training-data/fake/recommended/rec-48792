The atmosphere is fantastic. It's a little paradise in upper east side. The waiters were always there when you needed them, the food was absolutely delicious and less oily than most Thai food places I've been to. The presentation of the food was superb and the taste was even better. The servings were generous and even though I really wanted to be a pig and eat all of the crab fried rice that was on my plate, I had to stop after about half-way through. But of course I brought the rest home with me. I've also tried the steamed dumplings and they were amazing. The sauce that came with it was the perfect compliment adding the right amount of sweetness to this savory dish. I strongly recommend this place not only because of everything I just said, but that my total dinner was around $20! Genius food that's cheap is what I hunt for and I am glad I found this restaurant in my search!
