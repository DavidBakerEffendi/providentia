By far my favorite bar for many many reasons. 1. I must say I'm partial to it because I am in fact, a tattooed mom. 2. The drinks, oh the drinks. I order the pink puss. I don't know what's in it because they won't tell you but boy is it delicious! 3. The atmosphere, there's art and toys everywhere! Who wouldn't enjoy that? I mean really? Each table gets a selection of little games to play while they're drinking/eating. This is the best part of all. 4. Oh and they give you free lollipops. Enough said. This bar is the epitome of perfection.
