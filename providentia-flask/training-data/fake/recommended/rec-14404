As other's have noted, food is great here.   We had: Kefta sliders (AMAZING!!) - seriously good.  Some of the best sliders I've had to date.   Vegan Pizzette (chunky veggie, no cheese) Spinach, Bacon & Goat Cheese Pizzette Tomato, Basil & Mozzarella Pizzette All of the pizzettes we tried were delicious and were $5 on happy hour.  Two are more than enough for one person. We also split one of the day's specials which was a 12oz steak with salad and onion rings.  The onions rings were ridiculously good. Crispy, no trace of oil.  Wish I could have ordered them on their own.  The ketchup they serve with them is spicy but good.  The steak was buttery/well cooked but not as flavorful as I would have liked.   The namesake cocktail may appear tiny, but packs a punch.  An absolute steal for $6 on happy hour. Bar staff are sweet and incredibly friendly.  Yanni was helpful and very accomodating. Now for the not so good: It is hot in the restaurant.  The door was open but literally no air was coming in.  Definitely should have had the AC on. The host was rude.  He was not friendly when we walked in and kept leering at one of the ladies in our party, so much so it was uncomfortable.  Towards the end we planned to asked for a dessert menu but my gf asked that we wait while she ran to the restroom - literally 5 steps away.  As soon as she walked into the restroom, the host swooped over, removed her napkin and pushed her barstool in.  We ended up not staying for dessert as it appeared he was ready for us to leave even after we had spent quite a bit of cash. Not crowded during happy hour on a Friday.   Will not return.
