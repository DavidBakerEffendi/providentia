Place is just very cute... the woman cooking very sweet... The chicken and the shrimp were great and yummy, but just a bit too spicy (and we eat spicy food, even though we asked for it not to be too hot), so make sure to specify... Reading the reviews I was excited about the rice and beans, but our sat on the fridge and went to the birds, it was dry and not so tasty... the veggies were delicious. Prices not cheap for takeout... not expensive I guess, but if they were a little less we would do much more take out from here.
