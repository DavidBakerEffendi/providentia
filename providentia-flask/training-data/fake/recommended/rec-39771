once in a great while I need a lady night. this place, run by at least 3rd generation spanish and mexican resteranteurs, was under pressure to be great the minute they slaved over every perfect architectural detail. Life is rough. It's a beautiful unhysterical theater, the way the headwaiter in a suit greets you as if he vaguely remembers you, and helps Â you shrug off your coat. The debris of the day loosens up a bit, perfect for first date or to remember why you're with your partner in the first place. Or, when we get paid, at least one of us, a coupla ladies can have themselves a night out of the fray. This place is small, in between 2A, Ella, and Library, you can pick anything from divey to cocktailish and so on within a block but Yerba Buena is a little known haven. I get port there!
