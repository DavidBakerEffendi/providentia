I just saw that this place was open when I walked to work this morning and figured i'd try it out for lunch. The wrap I had wasn't bad, nothing to write home about though. The fries are pretty good and you get a ton of dipping sauces to choose from. The lady who took my order was extremely cute and courteous as well. I'll probably frequent this place until I try at least all of the wraps on the menu.
