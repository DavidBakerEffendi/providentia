As a local I've been to Cafe Steinhof many times and generally enjoy the service and food.  Tonight however, they've lost a regular customer. The cafe was at least 90% empty and I came in to sit at the bar and have Schnitzel and a drink while I did some work on my computer.  The problem? No computers after 5pm allowed. Now, I understand on busy nights this restriction - but on a quiet night when the restaurant is near empty?  And when I'm there to pay for a full meal and drinks? I'm now at Cafe Toto around the corner, where they are happy to serve me, computer and all, and I'll give them a rather large tip as a thank you.
