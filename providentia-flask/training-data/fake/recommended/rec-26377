This is by far the cleanest looking ramen shop i've ever been to since most are hole in the wall places. Everyone was very professional and service was quick. I came before noon as a party of 1 and was seated immediately. Their oolong iced tea was pretty plain..i wouldn't recommend it for $3. I had the "special" ramen that was on a laminated menu by itself. I forgot the actual name unfortunately. The broth was super light but still flavorful. I really enjoyed it. The meat was tender and not too fatty. There were also pickled veggies (maybe bamboo) that were pretty good. Reasonable portion size. Certainly not cheap as it was $23 for lunch with a drink. However, well worth the experience once in a while.
