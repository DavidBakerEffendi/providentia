fast, friendly, reliable service. Great place for a quick bite anytime, the menu changes almost daily to provide consumers with fresh choices. Try the breakfast sandwiches as well, VERY good!! Also check out the refrigerated case with take home items. Although not much space to sit and eat, there are tables outside, def an awesome place for a nice sunny day Def a must stop if your in the University City Area..
