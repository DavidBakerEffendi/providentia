I went to Chhaya for the first time this weekend and it was great!  The air conditioning was pumping, the food was delicious and the coffee was awesome.  The waitress was sweet, even though a cranky older woman was yelling at her about tea bags.  I will definitely return and try other things.  (We got the sausage gravy waffle and the bagel with cream cheese, bacon, avocado and tomato.)
