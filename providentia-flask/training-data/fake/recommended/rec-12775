After hearing about the hype, I was really excited to finally eat at Mu Ramen especially having lived in Japan eating ramen! The experience was completely "underwhelming" for the following three reasons: (1) HORRIBLE SERVICE - The restaurant's website said it would open at 6PM and a call to the restaurant confirmed this. But we ended up waiting a half hour in 20 degrees weather before they finally opened. There were at least three babies, a bunch of toddlers and two pregnant women waiting outside in the freezing cold - they could have let us wait inside. Once we were finally seated, the hostess was totally rude. Plus, she took orders from two other parties who arrived "after" we did.     (2) MEDIOCRE FOOD - The broth was just "so-so" and the noodles were overcooked. I can name at least 5 other ramen joints that are so much better! Not sure you can get away with poor quality ramen if you were located in Manhattan. (3) EXPENSIVE- Cost to quality ratio just doesn't add up. (4) CHEATED OUT OF PORK - The Tonkotsu Ramen was supposed to come with pork (according to its online menu) but there wasn't any. Out of all those reasons, if the ramen were amazing I would put up with bad service and high prices but ultimately just can't justify the cost for mediocre food. Mu is definitely a one-tripper.
