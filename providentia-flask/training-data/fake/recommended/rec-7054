Room Service doesn't disappoint.  It was quite busy on a Friday night, but my friends and I didn't have t wait for a table at 8pm. I must say the space is a bit narrow and there's not much room to wait in the front, nor at the bar area, and the service is quite quick so they can turn over tables as quickly as possible, but that is the only negative I see.  I was aware of this, and we had to be in and out quickly to catch a comedy show anyway, so it was perfect for our purposes. Drinks - Highly recommend the flavored mojitos. Ginger Basil, Blueberry and Lychee were all very tasty! Apps - Avocado Spring Rolls are awesome; quite small but comes with 6 pieces.  Assorted Chicken/Shrimp/Tofu sampler (shallow fried) comes highly recommended. Food - Solid all around, and most dishes have an interesting twist.  Room Service Pad Thai (with mixed seafood) is encased in an egg white shell, so good!  Blackened Fish with Mango Salsa was great too, and all the fried rices were a hit. Great Ambiance - definitely a trendy atmosphere and good looking crowd :-) Well decorated and lighting  is dimmed but not overly so.  I saw many large groups, a few couples, and everything in between.
