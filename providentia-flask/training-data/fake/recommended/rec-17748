After hearing about this place from multiple friends we decided to check it out - it was amazing from the get-go.  Immediately water glasses were poured, extra glasses were provided for our beer and chips and salsa were placed on our table.  The salsa , by the way, is amazing.  I had the chimichangas, they give you two - which were delicious.  My husband had chicken fajitas and he loved them.  Our friends had the carne asada - delicious and the quesadillas - super cheesy and tasty.  Each meal also came with a small, but perfectly sized portion of rice and beans.  The price was very affordable.  We were all totally satisfied.  The service was great and the staff was friendly.  We will be back again and again!  YUM!
