While I would probably go there to watch a phils game with some friends I will not be back for brunch.   My girlfriend wanted to go to Morning Glory and we thought it wouldn't have too long of a wait since it was relatively early.  But with the Broad Street run  -- likely thirty-something Bella Vista-ites wanting to show their suburban college friends a cute place with enough elbow room for their fancy baby strollers -- it was at least a 45 minute wait.   I was mad hungry so I said let's check out the place around the corner.  Mistake.  My next mistake was ordering the french toast.   Who ever thought it was a good idea to put grape compote on challa toast?   My girlfriend ordered an omelet with ham and peppers and no cheese.  It was brought out with cheese and chicken.  The chicken tasted like chicken from a frozen pot pie that was burned in the microwave and sat in a refrigerator for a week.  The omelet was returned and they brought back a new one.  It was like someone gave a hungover college kid who has never made an omelet some basic ingredients from some vendor at the italian market and told them to make an omelet.  Undercooked eggs, diced ham, overcooked veggies and no seasoning.  I tried one of her potatoes and I actually had to spit it out.  A potato! The most benign of foods! What has me perplexed here is that with all the fantastic food within three blocks of this place, how can it even exist?  But alas, just like so many other things in the world, there may be no explanation.  It just is what it is: a place to watch the phils during the playoffs when you can't find a table elsewhere. Lastly, we were there only two hours ago and my girlfriend's already hungry again -- my girlfriend who weighs 100 pounds and is usually full from eating a biscuit and doesn't need to eat again for 6 hours.
