A very smooth spot that serves two of my favorite things in the world: steak tartare and Old Fashioneds.  First on the steak tartare - it is prepared table side combining lean sirloin, the requisite sauces, a bit of spice and a unique touch of capers marinated truffle oil add an extra richness to the meal.  A true triumph (please see my review of Paradou of how NOT to prepare a steak tartare).  Next to the Old Fashioneds - they are neck-and-neck with Campbell's Apartment for the best in the city - they perfectly balance the sweetness of the muddled fruit/bitters with the bite of bourbon - after about 4-5 to wash down the steak tartare, you'll never feel more alive in your life.   It is the meal of champions.
