I went here for brunch on Saturday with one of my bestest friends and his partner. We each got a different steamed egg dish (they make the eggs in the cappuccino steamer!): Adam got the eggs with salmon, Craig the eggs with fresh prosciutto and I got the eggs with goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes. Each was delicious and came with crusty pieces of french bread. Adam and I also enjoyed cappuccinos which were tasty and, unlike many coffee drinks I have, did not require much sweetening! We sat at the bar and our waiter was SUPER nice and had a great sense of humor. The place is really pretty while also having a kind of laid back feel. On nice days, I would want to go back and get a table out back in their garden. I definitely recommend Gottino if you want a nice, tasty breakfast that is not diner-cheap but also not expensive.
