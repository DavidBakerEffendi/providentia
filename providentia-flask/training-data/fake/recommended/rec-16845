I went to JB's for the first time last Friday after hearing rave reviews about the place. It was super crowded, which is good for business but bad for personal space. Despite how many people were clamoring for drinks, the bartender was great, and I didn't have to wait very long at all for a drink. The music selection was solid, but I think that the pool table in the middle of the room is a bad idea when there are so many people looking for a place to stand. I thought it was odd that they don't serve Yuengling because I was under the assumption that it's a Philly staple. However, they had Troegs which is delicious enough anyway and tastes pretty similar to my favorite beer ever... Hoegaarden.
