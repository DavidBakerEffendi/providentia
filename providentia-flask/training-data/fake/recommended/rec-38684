One of the best meals I've ever had was at Hot Tomatoes. We stayed in Hartford on the way back from Boston and figured we'd try dinner here (short drive from the hotel). I had the Chilean sea bass, and was hands down the best I've ever had. Cooked perfectly and the sauce could have been served to me in a cup I'd drink it. My girlfriend claimed her dinner there was one of the best she's had, so I know it's not just me. Have been trying to figure out a way to get back to Hartford just to eat there again.
