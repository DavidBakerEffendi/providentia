Mood cafe is pretty awesome. If you are into chaat, you MUST go here. My friend and I opted for the samosa chaat and we were quite happy. The amount of flavor packed into these dishes is incredible - I LOVE tamarind...mmmmmm I will say that the spice level (at least for us ) was a little lower than expected. I ordered my usual medium and probably could have taken it up a notch.
