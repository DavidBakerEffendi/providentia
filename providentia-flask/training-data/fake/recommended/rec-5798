The space is deceptively large and inviting and the service was close to one of the best I've experienced. I went quite awhile ago so I don't remember what I ordered but I remember the food being tasty. What I do remember was the sangria which was close to the best I've had also - many interesting types too. I've heard great reviews about their brunch so I am adding that to the list.
