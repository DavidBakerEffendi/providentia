This is one of those great debates, and everyone has their own opinion on the matter. I couldn't wait to get my butt to Philly on my last trip to the east coast just to try these cheesesteaks for myself. I tried both Pat's and Geno's back to back, 'with and provolone'. Pat's lacked in flavor compared to Geno's, and didn't have quite the same bite. I was only around long enough to try one sandwich each, and I'm sure there are some things worth trying more than what I had -- but I'll have to wait and see til the next time I'm in Philly to try it again.
