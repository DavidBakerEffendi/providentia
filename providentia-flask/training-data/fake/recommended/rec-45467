Eh.  It's a new option on the busy Rt. 1 corridor for lunch. The wait is usually pretty long, which means it's (1) temporarily super-new-novilty-popular, (2) they're still figuring out the kitchen or (3) all the food really is made to order.  I'll let you guess which two of those three are really the case.   Very few of menu items can be made vegetarian.  The "large" portion isn't that big and the "small" isn't that small.  Like PF Changs, they don't cook the spice level order, but leave you with a dizzying array of sauces to DIY.   Between the brand new Qdoba next door and Trader Joes, for a strip mall parking is actually at a premium during lunch.
