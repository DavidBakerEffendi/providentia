Great choice for restaurant week- had chicken over barley (moist and lemony and perfectly cooked still with a little bite to the grain) and tilefish with pistachios and baby bok choy.  Dessert was somewhat underwhelming (almond financier) but totally pleasant.  Would love to go back and try more dishes- very creative menu options. Waitstaff was super accommodating and attentive- deliciously fruity bright green olive oil served at table with fresh crusty bread.   Seating was a little tight (went on a Wednesday evening, reservation for 6:30, by 7pm the place was packed).  Beautiful setting, romantically lit, great location.  Can't beat it.
