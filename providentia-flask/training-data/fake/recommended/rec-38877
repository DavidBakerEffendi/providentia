Delicious! Ate here every day I was in New York this weekend! Rack of lamb was perfectly cooked and complemented nicely with a side of marinated vegetables. The blueberry salad is bomb! Juicy blueberries, crunchy almonds, and mild soft cheese all give great texture to a very fresh plate of greens. Nice wine selection too. The omelet was a solid choice for brunch with a side of bacon and a bloody mary. Lovely patio in the back. The staff here is very helpful and friendly. Chad gave us excellent recommendations. I can't wait to go back and see what they have on the menu next time! Definitely check it out!
