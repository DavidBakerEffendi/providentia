My bf and I love this place for brunch on weekends. It has a wonderful selection of crepes. I really like the one with figs, goat cheese and carmelized onions. My bf gets different options each time. They have great french pressed coffee as well as lattes. I also recommend the dessert crepes if you have room for it. Decor is cute and cozy.
