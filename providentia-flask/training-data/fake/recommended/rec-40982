Another good job to the growing restuarant-ing options in the area. Once you walk in, it feels like you're no longer in the 'hood. The decor is simply chic.  The wait staff is pure hipster (its fun for out of towners).  The booze mixology is a nice bonus.  They got some fun mixes. They got moonshine. The last time I had moonshine....well, we'll save that for another time.  The food is fresh, hot, and simple. No complaints
