Graffiti is a dining experience to remember. Reservations are a must as there is seating for only 4 tables. You will most likely be sharing a table with other diners. If everyone embraces it, you will all have an enjoyable time together. All the dishes have a superb fusion of flavors and textures. My favorites were the ginger scallops, the duck portobello and the foie gras. The servers are very knowledgeable about the menu and are super friendly. Cons - The chili shrimp isn't that tasty.
