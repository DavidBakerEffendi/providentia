Philly's got the cheesesteak and they've also got roast pork. I'm jealous. The roast pork here is delicious. We had the roast pork with broccoli rabe and sharp provolone. Three ingredients. One happy customer. The strong cheese helps keep the bitterness of the rabe under wraps. The pork was juicy and mouth-wateringly tasty. Quick tip - the to-go line was wrapped around the entire store, but the "eat-in" (at the attached bar) was wide open. Don't miss the attached bar, if there's an open seat, sit down and they'll take your order right away.
