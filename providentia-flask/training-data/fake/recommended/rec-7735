This is a nice Lebanese slash Mediterranean cuisine. I made reservations just in case but there were plenty of empty seating everywhere. But either way, just do the reservations to get the nice seating. They have two other sections, one is a more casual seating area and the other has a bar with some lounge seating. If you want to bring a date, then obviously settle with the place cloth seating where I was at. It felt a little weird at first since I was obviously eating by myself and I was seating in between two couples despite having a whole room filled with many place cloth tables everywhere else. Anyways, they started me off with some complimentary labne, a strained yogurt dish with pita chips and olives. Basically it's chips and dip. Not bad, the yogurt was nice and chilled. yelp.com/biz_photos/B55O… I started off with their Fattoush salad. yelp.com/biz_photos/B55O… Had a nice lemon vinaigrette sauce. Everything there was fresh. From the greens, tomatoes and onions. It was a very large bowl. Plus it came with some really warm pita. Just too big for one person. For the main meal, I chose the beef shawarma. Came in with beef, lamb, tomatoes and onions. Nice and juicy. yelp.com/biz_photos/B55O… The juices oozed out so you know its nice and tender. Overall a very nice experience, romantic for others, but doot di doot di doo for me. Wish I could have stayed a little longer to get some dessert but all I have been doing since arriving in the NYC was eat so I was already full coming into this place. Good stuff!!!
