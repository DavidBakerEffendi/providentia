I hate to give Morning Glory such a negative review, but they were so lame today that I really felt I had to post something.  The food is decent enough and you already know that you'll be waiting outside 30 minutes at least...okay, no problem.  But today, after waiting outside, we were finally seated and then...just ignored.   I could say the service was bad, but in fact it was non-existent.  We waited an interminably LONG length of time to have someone take our order, but no one ever showed up. We flagged down the host a few times to let him know that we were ready to order and he said that he's let our waiter know, but he never did.  We watched as the seemingly only waiter in the place took the orders of people who were seated after us, but he never even walked anywhere near us or  looked in our direction. Finally, we left.  We told the manager and she offered a half-hearted apology, but did not attempt to rectify the situation at all.  The sole waiter finally appeared and said, "Gee, I didn't notice you guys were there" and said that we should have flagged him down, like it was somehow our own fault.   Honestly, if you don't mind being treated like you're invisible or insignificant, by all means, go to Morning Glory.  They are just too busy and understaffed to care one way or the other.  I know I won't be back.
