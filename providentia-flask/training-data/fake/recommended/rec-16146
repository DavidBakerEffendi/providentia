I met the chief Laurent, I promised to try his restaurant and I wanted also to discover Williamsburg. It was absolutely GREAT ! The restaurant is so typical from south of France with the decoration on the wall, all the postcards, the flowers, the colors ... The food was excellent, I took a couscous (special of the day) and my friends took crepes: Very tasty and so authentic. The service is also very warm. As we say in French "Bonne continuation" to Laurent, his wife and all the team !
