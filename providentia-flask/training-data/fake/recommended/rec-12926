I've been twice, the first time I got oatmeal and the second time I got the pumpkin pancakes. The oatmeal was nothing fancy, then again I don't know if there if a way to make amazing oatmeal (gold flakes?). The pancakes, on the other hand, were something else. Definitely need to go in hungry, the pancakes are really dense. We compared it to the density and texture of a crustless pumpkin pie. The flavor itself wasn't overwhelming, which I really liked. Surprisingly, the yogurt went perfectly with the pancakes, I found myself barely using the maple syrup. I'd go again when I get the need for a super hearty and warm brunch. I also ordered a side of poached eggs, which tasted worryingly lemon-like.
