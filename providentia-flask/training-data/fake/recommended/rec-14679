grimaldi's is awesome, but if you're only going to go to one pizza place, go to lombardi's. unless you're more interested in location, in which case grimaldi's totally wins. also, especially if you have people in town, the most lovely new york evening starts in manhattan, and then involves walking over the brooklyn bridge, eating amazing pizza at grimaldi's (although you will wait an incredibly long time and you will be kinda rushed through), then sauntering over to the brooklyn ice cream factory for an ice cream cone, sitting on the patio overlooking the river and the skyline, enjoying the scenery, and digesting the copious amounts of dairy you will now have in your system.
