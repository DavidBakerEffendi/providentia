Just had brunch here today. For 19.95$ you get a drink (bloody mary, champagne cocktail or sangria), soup or salad, choice of entree and dessert. The Bayou crepe with alligator is delicious, I've had it twice. The sweet potato fritters and wings with homemade blue cheese are a-maz-ing. They were also really accommodating about dessert, they offered us a fruit salad instead of the sweet (but delicious banana bread pudding) options on the menu. Go!
