I don't usually give 5 star reviews but I thoroughly enjoyed this dinner. I went on a night where they were serving a paleo menu and it was amazing. Â Such a nice atmosphere. Very small and I would definitely make a reservation. We supplemented the specials with ravioli and their radicchio salad and both were great. I don't believe the special menu items are available all the time but they were fantastic. I tried beef heart for the first time which was pretty cool (for those of you who aren't that adventurous they didn't have other weird things on the menu but beef heart looks like think bacon and tasted amazing). The main menu was a lot of fish and I didn't really see any other meat so I'm not sure I would go back unless the menu switched up (I don't like fish) It's also byob which is always a win in my book and there's a store where you can buy cold beer right next door.
