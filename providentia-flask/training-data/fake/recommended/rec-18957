I was sorely disappointed with my latest trip to Chez Moi. Usually, their food and drinks are amazing and their service is acceptable. Food and drinks are usually fast and delicious. Unfortunately, my last visit was terrible. On this last occasion, my friends and I went to have a few drinks and some snacks and we were welcomed with THE WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED AT ANY NEW YORK ESTABLISHMENT! Our server, Rachel, was rude to us as soon as we sat down. She rushed our initial orders and took them with a sour look on her face. Our water bottle was covered in dirt or coffee (who knows what it really was) and our water glasses were dirty. Our drinks took at least 15 minutes to be delivered to us and our food actually came before OUR drinks. She would come and take away our drinks and not even ask if we wanted a refill. She threw down our check without asking if we were finished and gave us an attitude when we asked to split the check. She said she couldn't (or rather that the computer doesn't do that) so we started doing the math for her. She then came back a minute or two later with split checks and threw them in our faces. She actually hit my friend's face in the process. We were appalled and I was very disappointed because I usually love this place. I fear I will not return knowing she works there.
