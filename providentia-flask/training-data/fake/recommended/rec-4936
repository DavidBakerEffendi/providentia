Dined at Fare last night with another couple. Food, service, atmosphere were all top notch. The menu is excellent, and the server's recommendations were just right. Prices for food & wine (they have a nice bar too) are very reasonable, given the very high quality of ingredients. This is the most Celiac-friendly restaurant I've been to in the state of PA, so if you have a gluten intolerance, I highly recommend FARE. The three people who dined with me all felt their food was excellent. This is my new favorite restaurant in Philly.
