I don't know why I haven't written a review before. I've eaten here so many times. It's in my overall top 10 list of best restaurants ever.

I was there for a late breakfast this morning and had The Homeboy. Words just don't do this bowl justice, so here are some new ones: Awesometacular. Radiculous. Sweetalicious. And the tater tots.. oh man, the tater tots.
