Okay I've been hearing so many good reviews from Yelp and from friends. I decided to check it out myself. One star for the decor. One star for it being BYO. I ordered the Papaya Salad, Red Chicken Curry, the Chicken Larb, and the Satay Chicken Skewers. The Papaya Salad was mediocre, I definitely had better. The Chicken Curry was pretty good judging from a person that loves curry and tried many. The Satay Chicken Skewers were very disappointing, first of all it was not cut correctly. Meat especially chicken that is being skewered should be cut against the grain that way it is easier to pull apart. Second it was VERY dry and small. Chicken breast is fairly inexpensive and they only gave me four very small pieces of chicken . Last meal was the Larb, it wasn't bad but it wasn't particularly good. Overall I'd give this place a 3, one for the decor, one for it being BYO, and one extra star for the curry. On another note, it's CASH-ONLY
