Oh my where is the old management?????? Loved the food when the old owners managed it. Dropped in one of these nights for dinner. I liked only the panner tikka masala (Appetizer). They have to push there bottoms a lot up!!!!! Time management has to improve and also the service. Disappointment!!!!!!!!
