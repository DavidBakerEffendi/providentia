Was my first time here.  Was not really a fan of their eggs benedict.  I ordered the Ultimate Eggs Benedict.  Sounds cool right?  NOT!   The description sounded tempting with a combination of a thick piece of french toast, a pancake, and the eggs with bacon and a piece of ham.  What I did not realize was that they freaking stacked them on top of each other.  For real.  I like toast and I love pancakes but I love them separately with some syrup and butter.  I do not want them topped with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce.  It just isn't right.  The ham was a pretty thick piece but it felt kinds dry and tougher to eat - it just didn't have that sear that it should have.  It was also kind of pricy at $14 bucks and it came with a salad.  I have eaten eggs benedict a lot and I expect hash browns or home fries with it, not a salad (which looked kind of cheap).  The place itself was nice and the service was good (nothing outstanding about either). I plan to come back at some point for other meals but I won't ever order this dish again.
