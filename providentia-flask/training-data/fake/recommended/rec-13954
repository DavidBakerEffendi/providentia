A line up to the door on a Tuesday 8pm...Tuesday?...  why?... Eventually 2 people got up from the bar when we were waiting, and we happily sat there. 1 Bistro burger, 1 Cheeseburger, 2 french fries, 2 beers... I admit I died to get a piece of the chili the guys sitting next to us ordered, mainly because we were still waiting starving... Burgers are OK, not the greatest that I've had, but I've got nothing to say negative about them either; nothing special about the french fries. Definitely not worth waiting a line that long; but was it cheap? yes; did it satisfy our burger craving? yes.  Would come back if I see the place empty.
