One:  I don't eat a bars, I drink at them.  I might get some food there, after a few beers, but by and large, I drink at bars, I don't go there for Koo-Scene.  This is a biergarten and no mistake.  Even if you Speche wenig deutsch, but like German beer, then go.  They have TWO scwartz biers on tap ( along with lager and weissbiers) and they serve them in Marchsteifel, Mass, pint glasses, and pilsener, so name a few.  The bartenders are too ready to help you out with your choice, so if you're a novice, then fear not.  The crowd seemed to be be on the younger, hipper side, with punk hair, those stupid fedoras that became popular in new york some time ago, and are infecting the rest of the country slowly (Hey, live and let live, but wearing a hat is NOT a hair style).  But they were cool and lively, so it made for a mellow interesting night.  They played some misfits on the bar stereo, so I did not have to resort to singing 'Bier her' or 'Trinke Kamarad!'  They are flying the German flag inside the bar and in their hearts, which means Freizeit and bruderlichkeit, which I what philadelphia is all about, ja?
