better than geno's, worse than pretty much every where else in the city.  if you're coming in to visit the city and want a cheesesteak, do yourself a favor, go to john's roast pork, jim's, dellasandro's, chubby's, reading terminal, some pizza place, etc.   good things: the hours, cheese fries, hot peppers, and the fact you can say you ate there. bad things:  cheesesteaks, prices
