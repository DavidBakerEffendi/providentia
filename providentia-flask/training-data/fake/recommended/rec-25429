The place definitely lives up to the Yelp reviews. The chicken mole, the nachos (I'm a sucker for nachos, leave me alone), the chiles rellenos... everything was really, really great, right down to the salsa. I brought a bottle of tequila and some margarita mix and they mixed it for me, no problem, although they do apparently sell their own mix which I'll try next time. Â  Needless to say, service was flawless, our -- waitress? Owner? Maddy? I have no idea, but whoever she is, she is as friendly and welcoming as can be. 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish they had a liquor license and a little bit of atmosphere - because if they did, it would clearly be the best Mexican restaurant in the state. Wishful thinking, for now...
