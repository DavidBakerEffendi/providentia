the CORN!  really we don't need to talk about much else, except that it makes the rest of your meal seem pointless.  i did not want my ordinary huevos rancheros (which were good btw) after that corn.  the service is friendly.  the tables are tiny.  best bruch in nyc!  ooh and the potatoes are good too.
