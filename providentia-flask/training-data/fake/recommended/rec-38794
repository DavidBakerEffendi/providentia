Had to try Jacob's Pickles after so many great reviews! GLAD I DID! :) Had to wait about 40 mins for a table, but it wasn't too bad. I took the time to visit a street fair in the meanwhile. They text you and you have five minutes to get back. Easy Peasy. I ordered the Chicken and Pancakes. Absolutely Delicious! The chicken was a combination of sweet and spicy. So very delicious. I asked for ketchup and their homemade mustard, but really didn't need it; the chicken can stand on its own. My friend had the Mushroom Gravy Smothered Chicken and she loved it. I had some of the biscuit and it was AMAZING.... holy crap. I was gonna go out later that night so I skipped drinks, but my friend had the Rosemary Vodka Lemonade and it was delicious!! Next time I visit, I will def order that. Go to Jacob's Pancakes. It is very worth the wait!! :)
