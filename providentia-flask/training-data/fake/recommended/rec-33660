Kudos to Grimaldi's for building such a strong brand and presence in NYC tour guide books - clearly the only reasons there's ALWAYS a line out the door (I should know - I live a couple of blocks away.) Used to be a huge fan and have watched in horror as the sad thing that happens to most culinary successes in this city happened - a complete slide downhill. This pizza truly does NOT taste good anymore by any objective standard. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because takeaway takes 10-15 minutes despite the lines. I'll gladly take advantage of the speed again when the product gets better!
