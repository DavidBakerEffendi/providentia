After a wedding and then a few drinks downtown we made our way down Crown to this marvelous late night window. The aroma of meat cooking filled the air and my nostrils. The menu made my mouth water. I decided on splitting with my wife, the Rick Rueben and on a recommendation from my foodie friend the Squeaky Bubble(sorry if that's not correct). HOLY COW! Delicious. Highly recommend checking this place out.
