I've eaten specifically at Manzo (meat specialty, more of a restaurant than another dining enclave at Eataly); Crudo (bar area / casual seating area); and the pasta/pizza section. Manzo can be pricey. service can be slow. food is amazing. had striploin carpaccio with foie gras and greens. then the tagliata as entree with polenta side. they overcooked the tagliata a smidgin. asked for medium rare - came more medium. should have asked for rare. polenta was good, but not amazing in my opinion. Crudo - do not get the steamers. they were filled with sand, inedible. we complained at the chef screamed at the manager to make sure the waiters educated the customers. as we were seated right at the bar, we could hear everything, as the open kitchen is directly in front of us. most unpleasant. i guess their sign says it all - "the customer is not always right". i would beg to differ. anyhow, they said they want to maintain the full flavor of the steamers and therefore do not de-sand them. the raw fish is not that great at crudo, but loved the cooked fish and loved the raw clams and oysters. I would note that at crudo, if you ask for balsamic with your olive oil to dip your bread, only crudo has this delicious thick balsamic paste that's truly delightful. when we were seated at Manzo, they didn't have access to this, even though Crudo was only a few feet away -.- Pasta/pizza - the spaghetti is very plain. much prefer the spaghetti at scarpetta.
