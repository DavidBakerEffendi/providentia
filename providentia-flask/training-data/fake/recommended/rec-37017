Nothing gets better than bottomless drinks and latin food. I made a 2 pm reservation and arrived 15 mins early, but the waitress still sat me and my bf promptly. She sat us downstairs which was jam packed on the weekend before Christmas. It wasn't an issue when I asked our waitress for a table upstairs. It took her two minutes to seat us comfortably upstairs near the window within eye shot of the bar. Win! Cuba is one of my favorite spots to eat brunch in NYC. This past weekend, I ordered the Tortilla Cubana minus the chorizo for my entree and a side of Â tostones rellenos (shrimp w/plaintains). Both were delicious! My favorite drink is the white sangria! It's sweet and potent. I will definitely be returning to Cuba once i'm in the city!
