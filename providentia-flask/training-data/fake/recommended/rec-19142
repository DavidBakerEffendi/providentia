After a lengthy debate with my local hosts about where to dine for lunch, after ruling out a relatively local place known for it's Mediterranean style food and especially its lemon chicken orzo soup, it was settled that we'd go to a different spot because it had rockin' sandwiches. Along for the ride, I said, hey, why not?  You're the boss.  (A figure of speech.  Literally.) So, imagine my confusion when we sit down and the first thing I see is a bunch of lamb entrees and a lemon chicken orzo soup.  WTF?!  I'm so confused. Well, it just so happens that this place Snack is an annex of some sort to the other place we were considering, even though no one knew it when we were debating.  What are the odds?  I mean, I'm in the biggest eating city in the world, and my two compatriots are essentially debating the merits of the same place??? The lamb sandwich was amazing.  What is it about lamb in NYC right now?  Two times in like 14 hours.  And the soup was very refreshing and flavorful. This is a super cute little spot with seating for no more than about 15 people, so be prepared to wait if you're there during prime time. Oh, and the minty fresh lemonade hit the spot on this warm day, too. (OK, so Russ already told the story, but I like my version better. Ha.)
