Drunk? Check. Hungry? Slightly. Ready for a giant plate of food for $5 or $6 depending on what you want? Always. Line is always long, but it moves quickly. Guys at the cart are still in a good mood around 10pm, but don't expect them to be later on in the night because of all the rowdy people and the long hours. There are no words to describe the chicken and rice with loads of white sauce (mayo/ranch-based) and bbq sauce. It tastes like creamy heaven in your mouth. Wash it down with a beer and feel that slick, guilty, greasy goodness in the morning when you wake up hungover as hell.
