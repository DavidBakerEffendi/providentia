Oh my gosh this place is amazing!  I came here with the BF and our favorite couple who just moved to the area.  The food was all really good (the lobster roll only comes in second to the one I ate in Maine) and the half price pitchers of mixed drinks during happy hour were dangerous.  I was partial to the Dark and Stormy but I definitely over did it and ended up having really bad heart burn later.  The backyard is the perfect atmosphere for having a low key meal with friends and eating seafood with your hands.  I would come here a thousand times and recommend it to anyone who is in the area and looking for something delicious.
