Dudes...cool your jets. They're just fries. The new location is a lot better than the old one. It's a little bigger, and it's not right across from Alpha Delta, so it's much easier to resist your inevitable Wenzel temptation. Other than that, not much is different. The bartenders are still pretty cool, and the craft beers aren't bad. A good horse to have in the stable.
