The restaurant decor itself looks very classy and elegant; however, the music turns it into more of a bar scene and less upscale -- my friends and I had a hard time conversing even though we were screaming across the table. My friends and I came here for dinner + drinks. We made reservations, but later deemed it unnecessary since there were plenty of empty tables waiting to be filled. We started off with the fries with two dipping sauces (ketchup was the third, but it doesn't count as a dipping sauce) -- the sauces were mayo based thus obviously very addicting. The fries themselves were crispy and delicious. I ordered the grilled pizza (because the word "truffle oil" caught my eye). The pizza was pretty good, but the crust was overly cheesy and the crust not crispy enough. For my drink, I opted for the sunset mojito. It was spectacular, but pretty pricy -- next time I'm going to start getting my drink on during happy hour. Overall, a decent place to eat and drink, but probably would not return anytime soon
