We decided to try out this new restaurant and are really glad we did. The decor is cool and the vibe is great. The music -- including Journey, Def Leopard, and John Cougar Mellancamp--was a blast. As other reviewers have mentioned, staff was friendly and inviting. They have a fun cocktail list and a good beer selection, including some local favorites. I had the Not Your Usual (or something cute like that) Old Fashioned. The bartender dining with said it was pretty close to a standard Old Fashioned, but no matter what you call it, it was tasty. Ordered a second which was stronger than the first (less fruit), so a little inconsistent, but both good. Tried out two of the three taco options. The fish wasn't as flavorful as I'd like but the aioli was good. The Korean beef tacos were excellent. Great flavor and just enough spice. Will definitely get the Korean beef tacos again, maybe with a jalape√±o cocktail next time. While some devout Southerners may be distraught that the chicken and waffles are served sandwich style, the flavor and textures were great. The maple was just perfect and the chicken wonderfully crisp. The slaw belonged the two together. We will definitely be back, and look forward to trying out brunch too!
