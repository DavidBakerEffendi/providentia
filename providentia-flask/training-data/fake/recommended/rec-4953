Ever since I had hakka style chinese food in Canada,  I have been  trying to find a similar type restaurant in Jersey with no luck... until now.   This is the best fusion restaurant in NJ. The best dishes were chicken with black bean sauce and Tilapia with green curry sauce.   The two appetizers we tried,  chili basil potatoes and crispy okra,  were also fantastic. Added bonus was the pan ice cream.  Awesome stuff.
