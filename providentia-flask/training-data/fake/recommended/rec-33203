A walk down Castleton Avenue in Staten Island is not exactly full of pleasant sights and joy. It is a bit destitute, with many empty lots and shuttered buildings. Opening the door to this friendly bierhaus is welcome respite though, with a crowd of people and friendly staff to greet you. The draught beers are exclusively German, and with ten to choose from, should satisfy. Big half-liter sizes were all $4, except for the Weihenstephaner hefeweiss which was $5. We had little room in our stomachs, but wanted to sample more than one wurste, so asked if the bartender could combine two plates for us, so that we could try both the bratwurst and weisswurst. He happily obliged and brought us the plate shown above ($9.95). The white veal weisswurst was definitely our favorite, perfectly bursting with juice and seasoned to perfection. They are best accompanied by the sweet mustard (s√ºer senf), a healthy scoop on every bite. The bratwurst was also tasty, with a nice skin and eaten with the spicy mustard (scharfer senf).
