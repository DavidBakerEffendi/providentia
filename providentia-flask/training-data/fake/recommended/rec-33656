I don't know much about Korean food, but the hanger steak ssam was awesome.  It's just steak and onions that you wrap in lettuce and eat like a burrito.  Comes with killer green ginger sauce that makes you go "mmmm". The Pork Buns are pretty much identical to the ones you can get at the other Momofuku, which is fine by me.  They're delicious. I also really love that the only soft drink you can get here is Dr. Pepper.  It's the only soft drink I love, and Momofuku read my mind.  Few people understand its incredible complexity of flavor. You may be seated next to or at the same table with famous indie-rockers, so be prepared to look... you know... nonchalant yet passionate.
