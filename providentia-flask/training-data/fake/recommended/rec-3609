There is nothing quite like bombing in on one of your friend's last client meetings. Hey, I had my reasons. Happy hour here is pretty great for midtown though that lasts until 7pm: $5 wine, $5 Shock Top/Bronx Ale/or Mother's Milk (All fairly quality beers), and $6 Pomegranate White Cosmos or Bohemian Rhapsodys (which you do not need to sing the song to acquire). I expensed to my delight a Bohemian Rhapsody that tasted kind of like a gin version of a mojito. Interesting. Not the best. Now that I think about it I should have just got a gin and tonic and asked for a cucumber. But it was of a medium tier - Bombay - and not too shabby. My friend downed an interesting Passion Fruit margarita that came in a hi-ball glass after her several old fashioneds which explains events later. Our clients had beer and cosmos. Too girly for me. I like the ambience of the place. It's pretty laid back and great for doing work apparently. Wink. Prices are again pretty cheap and reasonable. Staff was pretty solid as well because they actually asked if I liked my drink or not after they had made it. That is a rarity in this city.
