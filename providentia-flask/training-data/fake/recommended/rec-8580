Excellent place to come for a quick bite if you're in the downtown Princeton area.  It's cash only, and there isn't any seating, but the food is good and cheap.   For me, a good hoagie/sub shop must have good bread, and that's what hoagie haven has.  Lightly toasted, airy, and flavorful.  It provides an excellent base for whatever goes in it.   The cheesesteak with fried egg is a classic for me.  If not that, the gyro/souvlaki is always good as are pretty much anything on the hot side of the menu.  The cold cuts are decent, but nothing special.   Service is quick and generally friendly.  For fast eats in Princeton, especially during late night, Hoagie Haven can't be beat.
