Let me start by saying that the "hood" is a little sketchy.  We were serenaded by a "she devil" riding a 3 wheeled ghetto blaster.  Very bizarre to say the least. I don't know that I'd qualify this as a "Brewery" as the name states.  I suppose you can buy a beer, but you'll be standing to drink it and probably outside at that.  However, the pizza is GOOD! We both had a slice of the Artichoke which is their main pizza.  The crust was a little thick for me, but the slice itself was really good.  Think warmed artichoke and Parmesan cheese dip on pizza dough.  It is messy though, we both dripped it on us, so exercise caution when eating!
