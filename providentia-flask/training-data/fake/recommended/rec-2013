I thought it was good, but I also felt they could have done a better job with the salsa and guacamole one was to thin and the other was far to chunky making both hard to scoop with a tortilla chip. Also, the tortillas were very oiled and didnt drain them very well. But, the rest of the meal was good and the service was very very good. We end up having to move due to the cold coming in through the front door and they accommodated us immediately, and the food also arrived very prompt. Â I do intend on giving it another try.
