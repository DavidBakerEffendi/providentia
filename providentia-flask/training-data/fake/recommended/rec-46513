rightfully one of new york's most beloved gastronomic institutions.  $55 five-course lunch is my favorite fine dining deal in the whole of the city.  yes, even over the $28 2-course lunch at jean-georges.  this is seasonal american cuisine at it's absolute finest.  i ordered two additional desserts on top of the tasting menu dessert because the meal was so fantastic i didn't want to stop eating.   all good things (in flatiron) come from danny meyer.
