I liked the place but after actually living in Spain, tapas restaurants in NYC all seem overpriced and unauthentic. The good stuff was: fantastic service (thankfully after over an hour's wait), cozy comfortable ambiance, yummy wine, lots of menu options. The food was a bit disappointing (these dishes are just better in Spain) and the portions were super small. I know tapas is supposed to be small servings, but we were a group of four and it was difficult to share each tapa between us. The best dish we had were the peppers, which were a special of the day. Small green peppers (with a few spicy ones) roasted and then doused with olive oil and salt. This was based on a typical dish from Galicia and they were delicious. The cheese plate was the biggest disappointment. Â Super small pieces of very average tasting cheese.
