Five stars for food. Four stars for service. Decor and ambiance were somewhere between three and four stars. I can't speak for the landlubbing-variety proteins, but the fish dishes were fantastic. I had perfectly cooked halibut and my wife had the tilefish, which she claimed tasted like "a giant, delicious fish stick." Nice flavor combinations in the accompaniments to the fish too: things like artichokes, black trumpet mushrooms, pistachios, farro & english peas. Do yourself a favor and try the dark chocolate souffle, which you need to order at the start of your meal. It comes with a little pitcher of coffee sauce to pour into the center and is a fitting finish to a great meal.
