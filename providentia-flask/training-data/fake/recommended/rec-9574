Great open space with amazing decor!!! Pretty impressive and I didn't even get to see the back room which seemed like they had space for live music. Not even sure how to describe this other than a pretty upscale Wild Wild West bar open in the Greenwich village area! I love the wood decor. But ok, you didn't come here only cause it looks nice, and frankly, neither did I, so on to the food and drinks. Well... The truth is it was above average but below amazing (except for their fire wood chicken wings, those were just too good to be true!!). The drinks are pretty good, but the place was so packed it took over ten minutes between us ordering our drinks and when they arrived our table. also the table we actually sat at was very very small, actually the two dishes we ordered and our drinks took almost all the table space. The seating was also pretty tight as I kept elbowing the woman behind me by mistake every so often and it just was not comfortable. I think this place will do very well. the bar seemed like a great place to be at but sadly was super packed. They place is pretty new so I would like to come try it out in a few months and see how it goes! :) This is a second date type place, and could become a regular for many!
