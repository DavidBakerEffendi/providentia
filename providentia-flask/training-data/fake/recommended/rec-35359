I think Grimaldi's is completely over rated coming from a native NY'er. I've definitely had better pizza in Long Island and Manhattan. Because the wait is so long, the first bite of the pizza is delicious... any other bite following that is just okay... I would give it a higher rating if the line wasnt so long. But overall... i think it was just okay.
