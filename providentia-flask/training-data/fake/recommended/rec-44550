So here we go... First parking around the place excellent found a spot as soon as I reached the location. The wait for a table was about 5 minutes for a group of 11 (on a Saturday night). The inside of Amy's is definitely not the prettiest but hey we are here to eat not to look at decor and so on. Corn bread was served almost immediately as we were seated, oh yeah love me some corn bread! So here is what was ordered, I had the Obama, the fried chicken with double mac and cheese. I had double mac and cheese because I just love mac and cheese. The chicken was magnificent (I usually don't refer to food as magnificent but it was) the mac and cheese was good it could been baked a little longer to get that crispy top but overall it was good. So around the table we go... From what the group had to say the fried chicken wings were great the mashed potatoes were also really good, candied yams spot on, the pan seared salmon was delicious. Now we have that special person who goes to a chicken place and orders a steak WTF, anyway he said it was just ok (duh it's like going to Burger King and ordering a pizza with an egg roll, ya big dummy!). He also had the waffles which he said were good, next time I go I will try them because yes there will be a next time! The portions were tremendous, even the biggest boys of the group were struggling to finish their food. The only downfall to the food is that you get full (which isn't so bad) and then want to take a nap! (bad when you have to drive home). They should have a dessert menu with different kinds of pillows and blankets. The bill was amazing with gratuity included it was only 210 bucks!
