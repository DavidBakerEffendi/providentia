definately great soup. I had the lobster, shrimp, salmon bisque. it was definately good but it's quite heavy for the stomach. the soup literally sticks to the back of your spoon. It definitely taste good but too salty for me, it was balanced out with good soup bread. I didn't give it 5 stars b/c I felt that they need to give more bread. I ordered the large, cost $4.90 and it was quite filling for me. I still had 1/2 remaining and was soon hungry again. Definitely love the fruit idea, i got a medium banana (ripe) and it was a great way to end the meal. I got there at 1:30-2pm and there was no line at all.
