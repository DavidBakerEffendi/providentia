They have a wide variety here of empanadas, with a lot non-meat choices. The dessert empanadas are pretty good, too. I don't even know of that many places that sell dessert empanadas. I had the chocolate and banana one and it was served warm. Place is really small and cramped, though and the lines can get long.
