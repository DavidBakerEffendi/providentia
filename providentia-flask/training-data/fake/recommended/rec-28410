Rude waitstaff with something to prove.  Don't take my word for it read some of the other reviews posted.  It's really too bad, because I really want to like this place.  I think the reason for the super high reviews is due to the fact that there is really no other non ethnic competition within a mile and people are grateful to have a place to go.  Rude monopoly!
