I love Alice's Arbor!  The food is wonderful.  I have never had a bad meal there.  The atmosphere is great.  You just get a nice laid back feel when you walk in.  The staff is always friendly and helpful and have a smile.   A great selection of wines! The only drawback I have is that whenever we have sat in the back, there are always flies buzzing around.  Can't quite figure that out...otherwise I would have given this place 5 stars!
