Based on all the raving reviews, adding mine seems futile. Nevertheless, I shall share my two cents! Having been working in NYC for nearly a year and hearing nothing but praise about this place, I had to try it out. It was Friday 6:30 pm, slightly drizzling, my stomach craving for only small portion. With only one person ahead in line surprisingly, got the gyro in 2 min. The guys accommodate your needs: extra veggies, more or less of their 2 signature sauces: white and VERY red hot. For $4, the quick meal was heavenly! Of note, when I walked a block up to 54th St, I see the same Halal guys but with 20-30 people waiting in line. Next time I visit the area, I will try their signature lamb and chicken combo platter and maybe wait in line 15-30 mins just for the experience. Until my next review update, 5 stars hands down!
