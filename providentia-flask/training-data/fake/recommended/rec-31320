Back when they was called Ember Room, I enjoyed this restaurant. Celebrated my birthday last year and the guests was all pleased with the food. So glad I ate here. Still have the pictures of the lovely dinner. Has been added to my favs. Will go back to the new location. This is one of those go to spots. Will never fail you.
