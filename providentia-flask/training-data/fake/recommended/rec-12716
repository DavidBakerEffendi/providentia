The blueberry pancakes are as good as everybody says: perfect crispy eges, tender fluffy interior -- moist but not batter-y, good tart berrys, and utterly addictive warm maple butter is like a runny butterscotch. The coffee was a nice dark/city roast.  I ordered rosemary sausage and was underwhelmed.  There was not much flavor beyond the pork; absent were even a hint of salt, black pepper, and rosemary.  Next time I will try the sugar bacon. Also, next time I will skip the $3.50 fresh-squeeze OJ. I arrived at 8:30 on the first sub-freezing wintery Sunday morning of the season expecting the doors to have opened at 8AM only to find that Sunday opening is at 9AM.  There was already a short line and I waited the half hour in the blustery cold.  When the doors opened there was a line a good ways down the block and I got a single seat at the counter.  By the time my food arrived I heard the hostess informing guests at the door that there was a two hour wait.When I return with my family it will be for breakfast for dinner.
