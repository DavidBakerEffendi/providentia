Came here for brunch today. There was a little wait which wasn't surprising since every time I walk by its always crowded with people. When I went in one of the servers just told me to sit anywhere I want, which was a little odd. There weren't any seats available for 2, so we waited about 5 minutes until someone left. The place seemed a bit cozy and it was roomy. There were a lot of students there and it wasn't too loud. The food also came out within 10 minutes or so. Our server was polite and filled out water pretty often. Okay on to the food! I got the pumpkin pancakes with the yogurt sauce and a cappuccino. The cappuccino was good however my pancakes seemed like they were undercooked. The texture was a bit gooey and the yogurt sauce was kinda tangy. I like my pancakes fluffy and these weren't. It felt like I was eating a very moist pound cake. It wasn't bad, but I would rather go somewhere else for pancakes. My friend ordered the breakfast sandwich and didn't enjoy it cause there wasn't anything special about it. She told me she could've just made it at home and saved money. Well I hope this review was helpful and everyone has different tastes, so if you like the food enjoy!!!
