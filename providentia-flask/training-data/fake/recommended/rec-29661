Let's face it, Italian restaurants are pretty much a dime a dozen these days... and for good reason.  They're less expensive and pretty much universally liked by everyone's taste buds.  The difference between Benito One and these places is not only the quality of the food, but the amazing ambiance that accompanies it.  In my opinion, Benito One epitomizes the Italian dining experience. It has the old school authentic Italian dining pace that you would expect if you were in Italy.  Not slow, but deliberate making every moment meaningful.  The decor is equally fitting as it gives this place a very comforting home-like feel. The staff are all well versed in Italian food and culture which allows you to ask questions and feel comfortable that you're getting the best advice, recommendation or answer possible.  Basically what I'm getting at is that it's pretty hard to separate one Italian restaurant from another, but Benito One does that in virtually every category.  If you venture into Little Italy, do yourself a favor and eat here.  It's a must and I guarantee you'll love it.
