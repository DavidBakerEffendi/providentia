The roast beef is so good at John's Deli that it's the only thing I ordered the first dozen times I was there. I recommend getting the roast beef with onions and getting the gravy on the side. The onions are nice big pieces and they give you a lot of them. The gravy is black and delicious. Everything I've had at John's Deli is excellent. The shrimp parm was great. Nice big pieces of breaded shrimp. The fried ravioli's are addicting and the potato croquettes are top notch. The staff is very friendly and often offer samples of the food to entice you to order something besides the amazing roast beef. If you leave a tip in the jar all the workers will shout out "Thank you Subway", which is believed to have originated from the original store in Brooklyn, were tips served as subway fare. Whether that's the case or not, it's nice to know the tip I leave is appreciated and not just expected. Go to John's Deli.
