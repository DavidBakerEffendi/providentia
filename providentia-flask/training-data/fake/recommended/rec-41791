LOVED their pizza! Looking forward to trying it with some of their toppings, but honestly, you don't even need it. There is something about the combination of cheeses, olive oil and fresh basil that makes the pie amazing. The only reason I take 1 star off is the wait. Knew ahead of time there is always one, but I think I was a bit miffed that it seemed they forgot about my pizza for a while as some people that came well after me got their orders first. Although upon further investigation, I'm learning you've got to be on point when you're there and make sure they don't forget about you. Just make sure you're within De Marco's line of sight so you don't wait forever. All things considered though wait wasn't horrible, I think only about just under an hour since we got there just before it opened. Can't wait to try MD Kitchen a few doors down!
