Hype? Maybe. I ordered a Classic with American medium well. In retrospect - I should have tried it medium. The burger was on the dry side and although it was tasty and properly cooked, it lacked texture. I blame the patty itself. After the fancy decor, long line and multiple assurances that this would be the best burger I would ever have, I didn't expect a pre-shaped patty. I enjoy the ritual of the condiments almost as much as the burger itself. I really like a hamburger topped with lettuce, tomato and onion w/ my own at the table mix of mayo and yellow mustard. There was a good sized slice of tomato and onion. The lettuce was puny, resembling endive. I did ask for more lettuce and got an identical piece to supplement it. The condiments were good - just not enough lettuce. My daughter had grilled cheese Â - which was served charred pretty near black. The charred side served face down. She ate it without complaint and enjoyed it. She's 5. Fries were good. They were served warm, not hot. Not enough big fries, lots of the dregs of the fryer fries. Luck of the draw, some people like that. I ate them all. Like that dipping sauce. Over all I don't think this burger met my expectations. I find the best place to get a burger is at your favorite tried and tested local pub or diner.
