The price was great.  Service - okay.  Food - good. To elaborate: I brought some of my friends here for a small high school reunion.  It took a while for the waiters to come to us.  In fact, I had to wave them over.  The food was pretty yummy (I liked my pad see ew - though the chicken was kind of dry).  But my major complaint was that my one friend who was not very familiar with Thai cuisine asked the waiter if the dish he was eyeing was popular with most customers... well it was WAY too exotic for all our paletes, and it truly seemed like the waiter was just trying to make him order as quickly as possibly and not actually paying attention to his question. So conclusion: Pretty good, especially for its price.  But I feel like Hell's Kitchen Thai food is much better.
