Since I started working in the city, I've been to all the so called amazing pizza places. Lombardi's, Joe's, Grimaldi's, and Ray's (the actual one) I'll tell you why I like this the best. The ingredients are fresh and the crust usually comes out crisp and tasty. (obviously there are some anomalies of course) Your tables are actually far enough not to be on top of other people's conversations. When I went to Grimaldi's, even though the pizza is compareable the seating was horrendous. I'm ok with common dining but that was a little ridiculous . At Lombardi's however I've never had a problem having lunch or dinner with friends and actually having a conversation and eating a really well made pizza. It's a great place to eat even though it's a little touristy.
