Penang's an absolute gem if you're looking for some good Char Kway Teow.  After my return from a six month jaunt out in SE Asia, I haven't found a place that has replicated this classic Malaysian/Singaporean dish as well as this place.  I completely agree with Yee Gan's analysis of the food and the tastes really remind me of my hawker days in Singapore.  I originally came here to see if they had any Lor Mee but unfortunately their 'version' wasn't what I was expecting (my friend got it) Prices are reasonable and portions were pretty good... you shouldn't leave here hungry..  The Roti Canai was pretty good and reminds me a lot of Chinese "jwa bing" (sp?)  The sauce was a bit too watery for my tastes but still had some of the flavor nonetheless.  Would recommend it as a good starter to some Malaysian food. Pros: Ample space, Char Kway Teow that still makes my mouth water Cons: Watery curry dip/sauce for the Roti Canai Verdict: The Char Kway Teow is awesome.  Nuf said.
