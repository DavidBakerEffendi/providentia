Absolutely loved it. Went for an anniversary dinner. Made a mention of this on the phone when originally booking two weeks prior and they remembered to add a special message to our dessert plate without any additional prompting. Drinks were delicious and hand crafted. Good was great. We're not oyster people but per reviews we tried them. Best most delicious oysters I've ever had. The washu beef sliders were deliciously juicy and plumb. Branzino was perfectly seasoned and cooked amazingly. The short rib sashimi was delicious but small and unfilling. The double smoked bacon was great but too decadent for two people. Would've been better for four sharing. The pickled cauliflower was also delicious. Can't wait to go back. My wife added her name to their system when we paid the check. The exclusivity is nice.
