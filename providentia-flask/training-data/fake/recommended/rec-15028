I am just outside of Philly for business, so we took a trip into the city tonight for a quick dinner before dropping a colleague off at the airport.  I found Khyber Pass on Yelp by searching gastropubs open at 4:00 pm.  It was a great choice! When we first stepped in, I was definitely taken aback...not quite the decor I was expecting.  But once we settled in to the Old City establishment, I felt quite comfortable.  We each had a few different microbrews on tap (and being from Cleveland, I was impressed that they had a Great Lakes selection available), all quite reasonably priced...not even taking the happy hour discount into account.  Good start! For food, we had quite a range...I had a small spinach salad and a grilled chicken po' boy with SP fries.  All very good.  One had the spinach salad with grilled gulf oysters and a side of mac & cheese, the other had the fried chicken with onion rings.  Everyone was very pleased, very good. It was a little slow when we first arrived...but acceptable being that it was 4:40 pm on a Tuesday afternoon.  By the time we left at 6:30, the bar was packed and most of the tables in the dining room were full. I will definitely return next time I'm in town!!
