Ambience is nice but this is a strictly thai establishment. The servers and hostess speak thai... so of you want vietnamese food I would pass on this.  I had the pho bo and the shrimp spring rolls.  I have not tried the thai food so my rating is based on the vietnamese food. I'll give it an additional start for the ambience and $5 drinks starting from 5 till close on wednesday ladies night - cucumber and lychee   martini and a bellini and mimosa
