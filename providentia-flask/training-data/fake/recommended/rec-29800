Found this place on Yelp and thought I'd take a chance since I live nearby - I was not disappointed. Yummy nibbles and a great wine selection. Chris, the up stairs bartender was nothing short of awesome. He made great wine & food recommendations, and was also fun to hang out with on a quiet Tuesday night. He even pulled out Jenga - maybe it's the nerd in me, but I thoroughly enjoyed drinking wine and beating my date at Jenga. On a side note, you should really try the Marcel Lapierre - Beaujolais (Gamay). Chris served it chilled, which was a new experience for me - who would have ever thought to chill red wine? ...well, at least not me. I'm definitely going back.
