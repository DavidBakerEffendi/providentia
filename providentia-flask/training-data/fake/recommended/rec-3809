The food at Tom's is basic diner food, maybe nothing to write home about. But when you're looking for diner food, that's what you want. A classic meal where you know what you're getting. What sets Tom's apart is the service. Gus, the former owner, should write a book on how to make customers feel important and satisfied with their experience, plenty of places could learn a lot from him. Come before noon on a weekend to miss the worst of the lines, and have a complicmentary cookie and coffee while you wait.
