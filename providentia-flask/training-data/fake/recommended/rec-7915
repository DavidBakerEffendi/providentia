I have been wanting to come here for a quite a while. I was lucky enough to have HipCityVeg on Saturday afternoon. I got the crispy ranch chicken sandwich, my boyfriend went for the veg burger, and we split sweet potato fries and a vanilla milkshake. The chicken tasted so real that I can't belive it wasn't! A little pricey, but won't break the bank. I really liked the ambience and the music they had playing was refreshing. Employees were very friendly and patient. I'll definitely come back here again.
