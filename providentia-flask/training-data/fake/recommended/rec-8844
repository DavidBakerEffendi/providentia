Bo ssam is an insane amount of meat. I totally recommend getting 10 people together for this meal. Leftovers for DAYS..... Good cocktails. Decent beers to pair with the pork. Late night dining is key to avoiding the massive crowds. EDIT: ate the leftovers today. May qualify as the best cold leftover meal ever eaten.
