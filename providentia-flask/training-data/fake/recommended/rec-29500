In a world where an apathetic shrug was a gold medal this place would easily be a 5 star restaurant unfortunately apathetic shrugs are not worth much is the reviewers world unless they are reviewing a The Smiths dance off and Arena Diner is lacking in everything. Formerly a small doughnut place Arena Diner has been transformed in a smaller diner that seems to be made for holding something smaller...possibly doughnuts, either way it is cramped and upsetting to be in. The food is...food. I don't know what you want but if its a signature dish you will be hard pressed, everything seems to be shipped in on the "Diner food." delivery truck what would be fine if they didn't scorch or deep fry it with malice. The only credit it can get from me involves it's wait staff. They were doing their darnedest to make my experience salvageable but alas I just wasn't feeling it. Verdict is this place is small and bland. I would suggest it to elderly elves and conservative dwarfs.
