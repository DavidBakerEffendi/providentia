Finally getting around to providing an update even though I have been back 3 times since i wrote the first review.  Since then I have had the Cheeseburger 3 times and the fries once.  Can i just say "What is up with those fries?"  I mean "come on..." your burger is great and the mandatory accompaniment is just nasty.  OK, maybe not a good idea to start off on a bad note however, this place has more than made up for itself. Well i have been back numerous times and that is because i stuck to what this place is known for and havent ventured far from it.  Beer and Burgers.  The burger is probably the most respectable burger i have had in NYC on many levels.  Maybe not the most decadent or the most of anything but it is a tasty burger. Greater than the sum of it's parts is what makes this so respectable.  It is in fact a burger bun of better than average quality, cheese, meat, bacon, letttuce, tomato, onion made to order as you would like.  Have anyone of those components on its own and it wouldnt stand out much, but put them together and you have the quintessential good old American burger that isnt too soft and isnt too greasy.   The meat i believe is griddle cooked then broiled to give it some direct flame, cheese is American and thoroughly melted, and everything else is plain old. The price is what a burger should cost considering it is NYC and that is why it is the most respectable.  Biting into this burger reminds me of having a burger from my BBQ's back home and if it were anymore expensive would it taste less good? No.... but i would probably eat here less and complain about how pricey it is.
