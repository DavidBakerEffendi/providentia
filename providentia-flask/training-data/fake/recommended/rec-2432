read the instructions... Â ready set go. (then u can use the same instructions by geno's) but i recommend to go on a hot summer night or when its really busy so your steak's muscle fibers are completely broken down and not so chewy and the onions are well done and with all the people its much more enjoyable. but anyway it's a phenomenon to experience 'n with geno's across the street it's worth the visit.
