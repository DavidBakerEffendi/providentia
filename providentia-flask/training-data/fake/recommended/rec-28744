ORGASM fucking love this place just went there last night and got the classic beef with tomato sauce for naked balls which they put bread and cheese with. then i got the special which was a reuben sandwich basically but in meatball form. the reuben especially i died. PLUS their concord grape lemonade is crazy good. i can't even i had so much fun the atmosphere is amazing. the crowd seems to be 22 years old a little older. even though i''m younger than that though i felt like i was very welcome.
