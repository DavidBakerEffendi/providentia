Before I sat down, I had no idea about the restaurant's tapas-like concept. Given the pricing, I was expecting regular dinner sizes. My friend and I definitely paid more than I expected (since we ordered 4 plates), but it was well worth it. Our waitress gave us the run down on the menu. The listing of dishes is positioned in a way where the lighter fare is at the top and the heavier fare is at the bottom. This was quite helpful in deciding what to get and how we should pace our meal. The following is what we had in the order they arrived: SHAVED HUDSON VALLEY FOIS GRAS: The taste of the shaved fois gras over the mandarin oranges and BACON BRITTLE somehow overshadowed the intense guilt I felt over eating fois gras! UNI TOAST: On top of a piece of brioche toast (probably 6 inches, at most) was a layer of yuzu gel (tasted a bit seafood-y), lardo (which I kind of liken to prosciutto), truffle oil, and some greens. This wasn't bad but it my least favorite part of the meal. PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND MUSSELS: The overall taste was good (the broth had bits of chorizo in it and was awesome), but the mussels might have been overcooked. They were a bit too small for my liking. The grilled bread they served it with was perfect when dipped into the broth. LONG ISLAND DUCK BREAST: By far, the best duck I've had! A perfectly cooked medium rare duck breast surrounded by lychee with a 'sweet and sour jus.' Loved all those things together. It also came with some grilled frisee but I didn't really care for that. All in all, a great experience! Would definitely come back (with a smaller appetite).
