Dear Ippudo, You had me at pork buns. I came for your famous ramen, but was left unsatisfied with the noodles. The broth on the other hand was very good. A second order of pork buns to go with my soup and I was happy. I will be back for your pork buns anytime I'm in the city. Sincerely, Grace, pork bun fan for life P.S. Props to all the ninja like wait staff! Especially the one who noticed I was pregnant and allowed me the use of the employee bathroom so I wouldn't have to walk down and back up all those stairs just to get to the bathroom.
