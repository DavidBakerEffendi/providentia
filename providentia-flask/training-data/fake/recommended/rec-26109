Service is everything for me as of late.  When it's really bad, well, I'll never return.  Decor is trendy cliche stuff -- what you would think of when you hear of a New York restaurant.  Dining is super cramped and walking around to get to the bathroom is a huge nuisance. But yes, the service.  They forgot our order.  It didn't print out.  We saw tables around us who came after get their plates.  Not once did our server come to check on us.  In fact, I was never really sure who our server was.  40 minutes later, we finally get our food when we were able to flag down the hostess of all people.  We were given a comped order of spring rolls, which quite frankly, was insufficient for what we had experienced.  But, naturally, everyone else's plate comes to my table except for mine!  My massaman curry was nowhere to be found for 10 minutes.  I finally get the attention of a server, who rushes back to see where the heck my curry was.  He brings it back.  But wait, where's my jasmine rice?  Another 5 minutes before that comes out.  And then to top it off, the bus boy drops a dirty fork on my back as he's collecting my dish.  Ahhhhhhh.   As for my massaman curry, it was solid.  Nothing particularly remarkable.  The rest of my table enjoyed their dishes, particularly the pad thai.  And, the lychee sangria was excellent. Alas, I really see no reason to ever come here again.  There are too many better options on 9th Avenue, that are similarly priced and have better service (Ariana, Nook, etc.)
