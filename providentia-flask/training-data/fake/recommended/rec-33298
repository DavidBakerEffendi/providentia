Really awesome euro deli & grocery- the troubadour sandwich is great, smart duck is also delish. I cannot wait to try more. The half sandwich easily filled me. The behind the counter staff are pleasant, helpful, and work at the speed of light. Boyfriend says to mention prices are beyond reasonable considering the quality- great pick if u r playing pinball at Modern Pinball two doors down!
