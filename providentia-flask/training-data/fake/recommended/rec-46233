Last night was the first and last time I will ever go to the east Hanover diner. The server was friendly enough. I ordered the appetizer platter and the potatoes came out cold, and the rest of the food was just poor quality. When I wanted to send it back and order something new, the manager gave me a whole bunch of problems and literally got into my face about it. He also wanted to charge me for my uneaten meal. Very unprofessional and obviously don't know how to run a business. Last time I checked, the customer is always right. Next time you're hungry late at night, go anywhere else. Worst dining experience of my life. When I was leaving the manager actually grabbed a stack of receipts and literally waved them in my face. I don't know what type of business works like that but I suggest NEVER GO TO THIS DINER!!!!!!
