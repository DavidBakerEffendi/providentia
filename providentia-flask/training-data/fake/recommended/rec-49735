So far, THE Best eatery I've been to in NYC. I was walking around shopping and saw this place around dinner. I dropped in and got several things recommended by other yelpers. I don't even like fish tacos but I ordered one and it was amazing. Only $3.50 but I'd gladly pay 10$ if they increased the price. I also got the break room burger which is an amazing seasoned angus beef patty, onion ring, one egg, lettuce and tomato. It seemed like an odd combination but one of the best burgers I've ever had. I also go the mint lemonade, which seemed interesting, and it was really refreshing/sweet without being overly packed with sugar. I normally don't go to a restaurant twice in this city but I will definitely be a regular.
