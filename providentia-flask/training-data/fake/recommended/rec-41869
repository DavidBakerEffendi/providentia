We have ordered from here once--we recently moved to Bloomfield and do our grocery shopping at the Stop & Shop across the street, I went inside to grab a menu for future reference once and this is the CLEANEST chinese take out place EVER!! The staff also was super friendly and looking to help. The food we ordered at a later date was good--not great. The chicken with string beans and shrimp with broccoli were tasty and fresh. The fried rice was alright. The steamed dumplings could have used more filling--lots of dough and very little meat. I know they deliver but my boyfriend picked up the food the one time we ordered and still was shocked that they keep the place that clean all the time--the staff was very very nice and apologetic that the food wasn't ready on time when he arrived as they had received a lot of calls in the meantime. He said they had a flat screen tv to keep him entertained while he waited so he didn't have a problem with it, especially because everyone was so nice. Food is appropriately priced as well. We'll order again for sure, but will probably still look around. The take out places in Bergen County were fantastic so the prior bar was set pretty high!
