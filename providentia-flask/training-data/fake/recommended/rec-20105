I've only been here for brunch, but boy, was it is brunch to remember. My roommate has the eggs benedict, and I had the egg biscuit meal. Both were extremely fresh, full of flavor, and good-sized portions. We also split some of the side dishes which were equally pleasing. Who knew I loved brussel sprouts? Apparently the chef at Anella. Their use of local, fresh veggies is awesome. The decor is really cute and the atmosphere was laid back. The waitress was really attentive, and they didn't rush us out. One of my neighborhood favs!
