Food is good, nothing to really rave and rant about. Traditional Italian food and bar style pizza. Real thin crust. I can finish a pie to myself and still have room for seconds. The white pie is real good. Beer selection is mediocre, nothing special. You're definitely better off sitting at the bar before the restaurant area. They have a bunch of hi-def big screen t.v.s by the bar, usually with a sports game on. There is a whole lot of sports memorabilia on the walls. Its an Italian restaurant with a sports atmosphere.
