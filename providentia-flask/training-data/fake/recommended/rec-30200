my rating is going to go against everything i'm about to state in this review.. as a restaurant, this place is AMAZING.. the food is incredible !! the drinks they come up with are great but in sayin' all this, this place treats their employees like SH*T !!! now, not all the management is like this, but there's some f*cked up sh*t going on behind the delicious curtains, mainly pretentious nonsense.. and believe me, this place is incredibly pretentious.. who you are and who you know will surely effect how you'll be treated/served.. i guess a lot of places are like this in NYC but it really sucks that a place that serves such great food, has some socially ugly sh*t going on in the background...
