HELL NO! I understand that you want to cash as many people as possible, but consider opening up a bigger restaurant instead of pushing people out just because they already ate... Here: 5 of us got in. Big table in the back, wine (definitely not so special) and overpriced dinner (portions are so small for these prices!). Food tastes ok, but portions are really small and there are many other places around the neighborhood where you can eat much better for same money. We had drinks, then appetizers and main courses. After dinner our waitress came up and asked if we want more drinks. With our glasses still half full, we said thanks we're good for now. Then some tall dude showed up and informed us that we need to move to the bar because they need our table. My friend said "but buddy, there's no room for 5 people at the bar" And he's like "you'll make it, we really need this table" We paid, left, and I am never going back. Thank you.
