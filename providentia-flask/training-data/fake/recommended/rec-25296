I have eaten here once a week since they opened. The place changed both my perception of what ramen is...and in all honestly my life...in a positive way. I am a better and happier person in general knowing Ippudo is there waiting for me. The wait is a pain- but as I am sure many mentioned - they will take down your cell and txt/call you. I always simply plan ahead and show up an hr or so before I want to eat. Ippudo- I love you.
