This tucked away spot in Brewerytown is great for breakfast and surprisingly affordable, considering the healthy angle. We've already had a turkey sausage sandwich on everything bagel, hot cakes and beef bacon, and a mango strawberry smoothie, all equally delectable. As long as we reside in the area, we will frequent iMunch, and suggest you do the same, whether passing through or not.
