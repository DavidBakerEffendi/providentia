I've been to Fare three times, once for dinner and twice for lunch.  It's been quite inconsistent each visit.  My first visit was back when they first opened.  Their dishes sounded and looked great, but they lacked seasoning and variety in textures.  The pork dish I had was extremely dry and under-seasoned.  The cocktails, however, were wonderful.  I figured this was due to growing pains and returned the next two times were for lunch.  While there are a some good items on the menu (the flatbreads are delicious and the fennel & leek appetizer was great).  But again, there was a lot of inconsistency.  The beet salad had two many different flavors that did not work together.  The vegetarian sandwich was nice and simple, but almost too simple for the price.  Their gluten-free deserts are very dry- this does not have to be the case just because they're gluten-free. The service is very nice, although slow at lunch (one poor hostess/waitress for the entire room).  The atmosphere is also nice, although they need to work on the music.  Just because the room becomes more crowded doesn't mean you have to turn up the volume of the music.  That's not why we're here.
