Loved everything about Bouley! I thought the decor was elegant and warm and reminded me of dinner at home not a restaurant.  Although my at home meals usually don't include five star service and truffles.  We opted to order off the regular menu not the tasting.  We ordered 3 courses but I felt like we had five.  Our first taste-the amouche Bouche was a rhubarb froth with lobster and a crema all delightful and a cracker with a crema and truffles.  I could have eaten another one it was so tasty and delicious.  Needless to say my appetite was anxious to try something else.  I couldn't wait for the porcini flan and forager mushrooms to arrive.  Amazing and yes more truffle on top!  Lots of crab and a earthy porcini flavor.  The forager mushrooms were perfectly executed and might have been some of the tastiest mushrooms I've ever eaten.  We moved along to our entrees of Colorado lamb and Long Island duck.  The lamb was tasty and tender and the three sauces were all different but delicious.  I loved the mint it complimented the lamb perfectly.  The duck breast was cooked perfectly but and the compliments on the plate added the wow factor.  It was served over a fig purée with duck prosciutto.  The side of vanilla bean fingerling potato purée was so unique and different and we loved it. It was my birthday so you know I was getting dessert! What I didn't know was I would be having three.  We ordered our dessert and were greeted by a coconut soup to cleanse our palette followed by my chocolate soufflé and my fiancé's flan.  The soufflé was perfect!  The waiter then came over with another treat! A birthday parfait with amaretto ice cream and fresh fruit.  I was stuffed, but Bouley wanted to feed me more with a tray of Petit fours. Little rich chocolates.   The wine list was exceptional! It was pricey but well worth it if you enjoy gourmet food well executed!   Oh yeah lemon pound cake to enjoy for breakfast the next day when we left!
