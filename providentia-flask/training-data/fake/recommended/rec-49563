Not worth the wait or the hype. I waited for 45 minutes on a saturday at 4:30pm. Finally got a seat and ordered the miso ramen with extra pork. The pork was just all fat and i've had better at Â Minca or Ramen Takumi. The soup was truely good but that was it. The noodles seemed undercooked and not as good as Ippudo. Would i go back again? probably not.
