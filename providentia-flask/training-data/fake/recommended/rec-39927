This place is awesome. It has the freshest sushi in the New Haven area; whether you like basic rolls or sashimi or more complex crazy rolls you'll love Jerry-San's. Decoration is kitschy as it gets, but service and food are great. Yes, I've tried almost every sushi spot between Branford and West Haven and this is the best.
