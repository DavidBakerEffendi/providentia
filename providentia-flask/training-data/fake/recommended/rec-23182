First entering the restaurant I was impressed by the decor and elegance of the burger joint. The wait was acceptable for what they offer. The turn around for tables were quite efficient. My girlfriend and I waited approximately 25 minutes with no hassle. We both conversed about how the place captures an eclectic home. You can tell the owner strategically placed every item to balance the room. My GF suggested this spot due to the vast amount of reviews. We love the fact that there are 2 floors to this restaurant and 2 bars. The burgers offered are decently priced in terms of location and the sauces given are divine. My gf ordered the 5 ducks burger and I the manly burger no cheese please "lactose intolerant here." The staff were friendly and always ready to make your experience a memorable one. I totally forgot I am love sweet potato fries, love them they obviously put brown sugar on top. Love the place and love the food. Will return! Good Job Umami.
