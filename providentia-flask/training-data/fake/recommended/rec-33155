I went there yesterday night with my friend and came out all satisfied. Each of us had two arepas and shared an appetizer.  The arepas were delicious and well prepared.  She closed her eyes for every bite she gave to the arepas, which is a good sign that she was enjoying them, not on crack. The place is small but very clean and the environment is great.  It gives customers a Venezuelan feel.   Yuca guasacaca is must for appetizer.  Overall, this restaurant deserves my stars and it worth driving there from Brooklyn.
