I was there at the end of their lunch time and my God they didn't really want me there. Wish they had just told me they were closing, but they didn't so I ended up with a pretty rushed, lackluster experience. The waitress sucked and was fighting with the other one, which gave me some entertainment, I just hope they tone it down when there are more people in the place! The fish was yummy though and the environment, other than the fight club waitress scene, was really pretty nice. Overall I think Brooklyn (and in many ways NYC in general) miss the boat a bit sushi-wise, but I'd come back here to try again based on the fish alone!
