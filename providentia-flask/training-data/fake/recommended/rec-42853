Kafana serves the kind of food that you'll end up craving over and over again. I've been multiple times now; usually as a table of 2 or 4 and I've tried most of the menu. I've never had a below par dish. Their feta and spinach pie is something that I never have room to eat but always want to order a slice to take away for the next day! Stand out dishes include the bean stew with sausage, the bacon wrapped chicken liver, the Serbian burger, the mixed grill, the cheese and meat platters, the cheese with bread...I could probably just list the entire menu here! Oh, and the red pepper dip that you get with the complimentary bread is delicious. Service is super relaxed (the guys just hang out at the bar in-between serving) but attentive. (I'm not one to be constantly fawned over at a restaurant and you shouldn't be either!) After trying a bottle of wine that we'd ordered and not really liking it, the waitress allowed us to pick another one straight away without any qualms. Would highly recommend! Cash only.
