Nice little neighborhood restaurant.  Bread has a nice crust, is served slightly toasted and comes to the table hot.  Pasta was al dente and not mushy.  Marinara had a nice tang and wasn't too sweet but either from condensation or lack of draining the pasta their was a good deal of water at the bottom of the plate which ruined the consistency of the sauce after a bit.  Meatballs were good but not great.  I prefer them seared with a bit of a crust on the outside from browning them and with a bit more spice.  Customers on both sides of me brought friends and talked up the restaurant quite a bit.  Tony is as loud and boisterous behind the counter as he is warm and inviting when he comes out to greet his customers, many of which he knew by name.  I am sure I will give it another try.
