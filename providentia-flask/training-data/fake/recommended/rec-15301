I just went this past weekend and I have to say it was one of the best cheesesteaks I have ever had. The fries were really good too. We asked a tourguide at the visitor's center where the best place for cheesesteaks were and was told Sonny's. Me and my family were not disappointed. Everyone was friendly there too.
