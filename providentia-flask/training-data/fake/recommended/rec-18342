Love, love, love.  Go-to place when the slider craving hits (at least once a week!).  This place is one of the top reasons I could never go vegetarian.  I don't even know what to say that hasn't been mentioned.  $2 sliders, $3 fries, $4 beer = happy stomach AND happy wallet.  :D :D  (you can also get a bottle of wine for $20 or a glass for $5). I am especially attached to the chipotle ketchup.  The fries are friggin' delicious and not too greasy.  The sliders, juicy and perfect.  So far, I haven't had any trouble getting a seat.  There is a table area near the door, a bar, and a bigger lounge-ish area in the back.  And there's a cool red accented decor going on. Cannot wait to try their shakes.  It's just hard to come here and NOT have the sliders, fries, and beer.  And by then, I'm not sure I can stomach a shake.  SUCH A DILEMMA.
