Three delicious courses+ $28= STEAL. I didn't know this place existed til my mom told me about it. It's in a great area (Kip's Bay) right on the East River and it would be great to sit outside and eat lunch in nice weather (whenever that happens) and watch the boats and dead bodies float by. The service was competent..not too personable, and it seemed that the restaurant was mostly empty, but the food was really good..lamb empenadas, PORK BELLY SANDWICH ON PRETZEL BREAD..yes I put that in capital letters...and beignets (not as good as Cafe du Monde but it was nice to get my beignet fix).
