Do yourself a favor and GO HERE. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting for being so chic. The selection of beer and wine is outstanding and is constantly changing with an emphasis on quality (a big reason why I can't wait to go back to try their oysters). Best of all, the bartenders are the greatest guys around. Friendly and funny, they will make you feel at home. Thrilled a place like this found its way into the neighborhood. Good possibility we will become regulars here.
