The service is polite, fast and attentive.  Crispy fried chicken with butter pickles, stout brisket with parsnip puree and a side of the most delicious brussell sprouts I've ever tasted.  I wanted to try the celery root fries, but was sad to see they were not on the menu.  At my request, the bartender made me a mocktail mojito, which was wonderful.  And, it was reduced in price, lovely, at $6.  I will return with friends, but best to go early for parties less than 5, since they dont reserve for 2 and tables and bar space were scarce towards the end of our meal.
