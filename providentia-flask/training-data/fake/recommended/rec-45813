After climbing at the new Metrorock Station in Essex stopped by for dinner at 9:30pm Saturday. Got a great table right away near the hearth, so it was nice and warm :) Decor is very nice. Felt like being in a castle. Was nice to watch them make all the pizzas. Evolution salad was very tasty. Then a revolution pizza, which was a nice thin crust not burned the way Bertuccis does. Flavor was more of a blend than tastes of mushroom or onion.
