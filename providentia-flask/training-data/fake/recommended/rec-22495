I walked in on a frigid January afternoon at 5:15 pm. There were two people seated at tables and an employee appeared to sell me a cup of tea at the register. When I went to sit down, she told me they were "actually closed". Oh well, I won't be back. Wish I'd asked to return the cup of tea. It was a stale chamomile bag and hardly worth drinking without a place to sit and read my book. Â Only in New York will people sell you a cup of tea before they tell you they're closed!
