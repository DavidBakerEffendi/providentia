Johnny Brenda's upstairs is first of all BEAUTIFUL. Its an awesome space to hear music and have a brew. As a bar.... A fun place to hang out. Play pool. Grab a good burger and fries. Sit outside if you want to. Â It can get a bit crowded and you may be waiting a while to get service. But all in all a good time.
