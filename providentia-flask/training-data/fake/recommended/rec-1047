I've had many cheesesteaks but not one compared to this one.    The meat melted in my mouth!   Way better than the tourist traps a few miles away.   Fries could have stayed in the fryer a tad longer Roll.   5 stars Steak 5 stars Cheese 5 stars Fries 4 stars Don't be swayed by what the place looks like.   It's clean and I'd much rather see a place invest more in their product than in their advertising! UPDATE 3/12/14 visited Philip's a second time this time a different guy was working the grill.  The larger guy was working the fries.  Again the fries were slightly under done (for my liking) but the steak was over done and lost its ability to melt in my mouth (took some effort to chew it up) I guess I'll have 2 go one more time before I cross it off my list.  I drove 30 minutes for this cheesesteak and it wasn't worth it this time. roll 5 stars steak 3 stars cheese 5 stars fries 3 stars
