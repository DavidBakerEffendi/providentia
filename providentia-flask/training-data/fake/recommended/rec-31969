OMG!!! Best Burger on Staten Island! Huge burger on an english muffin. I always get the bacon cheeseburger, their bacon is soooo tasty! I love the waffle fries, but my boyfriend always gets the sweet potato fries (I usually steal a few...so good!) always have specials, good beer selection. Great stop during the St Patty's day parade.
