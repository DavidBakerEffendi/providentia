Under new management. New interior decor. Jazz nights every couple weeks. Food still a bit pricier than it could be but overall a great restaurant that is frequently overlooked due to its proximity to the more upscale and pricier Peppercorns. Masala remains a great, more affordable alternative for folks looking for a decent dinner before a Bushnell show or Charter Oak Center performance. Valet parking is also now available on weekend nights, though parking anywhere near here on Main, Capitol, or Buckingham is perfectly safe and of little concern for most.
