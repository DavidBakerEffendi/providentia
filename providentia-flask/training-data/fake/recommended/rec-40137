If Southwark was in my neighborhood I'd be there weekly....then again if it were in my neighborhood, the place would be full of hipsters, making it not as good, so I'm glad it is where it is! Went there for late night, after dinner drinks and had a blast! The bartenders were funny and the service was better than 90% of the bars I've been to in Philly. The atmosphere was very nice, fun, unique, but wasn't overbearing. I've only been once, so it may be too early to tell, but I think this is my new favorite bar!
