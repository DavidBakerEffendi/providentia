I'm still trying to decide if it is a good or bad thing that I live down the street from Yuca Bar... Yuca Bar is always a go to choice for dinner with my boyfriend or happy hour with friends after work. I have probably tried every tapas item on their menu and have not once been disappointed (except for the arepas- but I think that is just because I'm not really an arepa fan...). Some of my favorites are the pork taquitos, calamari, and of course- guacamole. I usually pair my food with a glass of AMAZING red sangria or one of the strongest margaritas I have had in the city. This place never disappoints- the ambiance, the food, the service- always top notch. Yuca Bar can be enjoyed year round but my favorite is a warm spring weekday night.
