I've been addicted to this place! This is my third to eat here but this time was so impressed because I didn't have to wait for the line,I came here around 6:00pm but compared with the first time I came it was the similar time, I had to wait like 45mins up to an hour! But food is always delicious and flavorful!! One thing that I would recommend, should come eat early they're opened the dinner time.
