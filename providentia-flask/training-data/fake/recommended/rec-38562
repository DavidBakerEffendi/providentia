I have to give it 4 stars, but there are some caveats. It's 4 stars because the outdoor Beer Garden is a great way to hang out, period.  Amazing more people haven't thought of this.  (Steven Starr clearly deserves his successes!) That said, it is fairly pricey; the food options are limited. But it's a lot of fun.  And some of the German menu items (schnitzel anyone?) are a nice change of pace.
