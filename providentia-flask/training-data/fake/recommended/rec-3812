Showed up at 8pm on a tuesday with three of my friends, didn't have to wait an eternity even though i thought one of my friends was going to grab any plate that went by. A little awkward waiting and ending up being the bathroom monitors for everyone, but oh well. We each had bistro burgers, fries and beers. The burger was delicious and the bacon was of course the icing on the little burger cake. Mine was cooked medium, which I sometimes fear, but it was perfect. Fries were what I expected, and the 2 beers didn't hurt either. Able to have good, hilarious conversation with 3 people I hadn't seen in awhile, and didn't feel like I was cramped in somewhere. For a cheap dinner out in Manhattan, I don't think much would beat it for me. I'm just glad someone told me cash only ahead of time, because i am notorious for never having cash on me.
