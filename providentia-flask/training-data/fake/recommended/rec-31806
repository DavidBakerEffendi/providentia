If you love beer, what are you waiting for? You could get a beer once a day for a year and still not have tried them all. Have an idea of what you're in the mood for but don't know which one to get? No problem, our waiter was incredibly knowledgeable about what beers tasted like what and had great recommendations. And they know how to serve beer as well, my g/f wanted to try a chocolate stout, however they had just opened a new keg and it wasn't just right yet, so the waiter recommended something that he thought she'd also enjoy instead of her getting a brew he wasn't sure was at the right temperature. He was spot on. Food is also very good. I recommend the mussels. The ONLY problem with this place is it gets incredibly crowded very quickly, so much so that after 1 drink you just want to get out because there's nowhere to even stand without getting in the way of the wait staff. I guess that's a good problem for them though.
