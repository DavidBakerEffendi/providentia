My family and I were 45 min late for our reservation due to traffic around the Holidays.  The maitre d was very understanding and found a table within 5 minutes, despite being fully booked.  I was very impressed. The STEAK FRITES were phenomenal.  Easily one of the best steaks I've had in my life.  Every bite was incredibly juicy and tender.  I asked for the herb butter infusion and bernaise sauce on the side.  The herb butter was easily my favorite as it didn't over power the steak.   I would also recommend the shepherd's pie.  The mashed potatoes were CREAMY beyond belief.  They could even be served as an entire meal.  They're that good.  MUST TRY.
