so i've eaten here a bunch of times now and still prefer the take out.  the service is inconsistent. the girl up front never smiles or greets with a smile, it seems a drudgery that someone else walked in. not good. we sat out back which is always nice.  the waiter was really pleasant and attentive, then he dropped off after our apps.  we only saw the bus boy.  nobody came over to check in after our sammys arrived.  it's just disappointing. but i'll forever be a fan as their 'nini's are superb, which is why i give them 4 stars.
