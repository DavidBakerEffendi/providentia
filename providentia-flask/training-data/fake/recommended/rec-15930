So I've been on a bit of a yelp-hiatus for a while trying to cook more on my own and eat healthier and mroe vegetablier, but I had a chance to eat at this gem here for a friends birthday.  How does 'all-you-can-eat' go wrong?  It can't.  In fact, 6 pots of mussels, some fries and some leffe blond will attest to that.  I am definitely willing to go back to try some of their other food, but their monday special for 22 bones is hard to pass.  It was so good I had to get back onto yelp and share the experience.  If you do go for the monday special, then I really recommend the white wine shallot & the tomato basil, which is pretty much a marinara sauce.  You can try all their different flavors, but since i was going for the distance, I kept it light with the white wine shallot. It's a nice cozy spot good enough for a big party, or even a light date night.  The staff was very friendly and attentive and didn't bother too much during our time there.   No regrets here so make your reservations with confidence, whether it be a mussel eating contest or a nice meal for two.
