Do you want quality food that doesn't force you to unload your life savings? Because this is where you get quality food that doesn't force you to unload your life savings. (/Archer meme reference) But honestly, coming from a poor graduate student with a budget-conscious mindset living in the upper east side, this is gold. Pure gold. I've had the pad thai, pad see-ew (take out), moo dang (take out), and sampled my friend's dishes. Each of these dishes were excellent--but caveat here: I don't often eat Thai food, but this is good enough for me to write a review (that's n = 3 for you science/engineering/math people). The interior has a cozy feeling, and service was great. I'm not sure I've had my glass more than half empty since the waitress would come by so often. Lunch specials are killers, too, especially for those working near the NYP hospital (see what I did there? killer, hospital--I'll go home now). Entree, soup/salad, AND an appetizer for ~$9. Excellent portions, too. For how much food they give you for the amount you spend, this is by far one of the best restaurants on the upper east side that maximizes the food-to-money ratio. And I'm all about the cheap food.
