We went into Chowpatty just expecting to get a quick post-lunch dessert and left with $37 worth of sweets! The cashier and the employees were very friendly and patient while we took our time ordering. They offer samples on the counter so you can taste each type of sweet before ordering it. Though my family has a long history with Indian sweets, I myself don't have as much a taste for or experience with them. I've never seen samples offered in the few sweets stores I've visited in India or NYC, and according to my sister who is much more knowledgeable in this field, this is not common practice. That's why I feel that this place is especially awesome for rookies to the Indian sweet world, like me, since customers can get a sense of what they are ordering and feel safe in trying new things! Even without this detail, the sweets were delicious and the employees are very helpful. I would recommend this sweet shop!
