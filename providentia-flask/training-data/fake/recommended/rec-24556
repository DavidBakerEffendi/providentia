You can't really go wrong with upscale comfort food. Although the were closed for a couple of weeks for renovation and besides moving the restrooms downstairs and converting two separate into one unisex, Im not seeing a lot of change in decor. Food always good, drinks are decent enough, white grape martini is always tasty. Mac attack which is a tasting of three types of mac an cheese featuring one drizzled with truffle oil is a must try at least once!.  Came here last night had grilled swordfish on a bed of polenta, the lady had short ribs  both of which were ten shades of tasty!.Always have a good time here,  it's usually somewhat loud but so am I.
