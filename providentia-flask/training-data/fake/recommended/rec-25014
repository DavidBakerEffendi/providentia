I've been a huge fan of both Bayou and Beso restaurants, so when I heard the owner took over the property that formerly housed RH Tuggs, I couldn't wait to try it!  I went on a Thursday night with 3 of my girlfriends. We had high expectations and we were not disappointed.  We had reservations.  Two of us were a few minutes late and we were seated promptly once the entire party arrived, they would not seat half the party, but there was a nice bar or a cozy seating area for waiting. The decor, food and service were great. We split 5 or 6 appetizers, 1 salad, 3 entrees and 5 deserts.  Yeah, that's alot to order for 4 ladies, so I guess you could say the portions were a bit on the smaller side. The only dish that I felt really should've been larger was the fondue desert.  We were left with a good amount of yummy warm chocolate with nothing to dip in it.  For $11.00, they should throw in some more banana and strawberries, but that is really my only criticism.   I can't recall everything that we ordered, but I had the Tuna entree and it was great.  My friends split some kind of a seafood grill for 2 and they enjoyed it. One of the deserts was so good that we ordered another to share.  It was some kind of chocolate cake.  The coffee was great too! The place full on a Thursday night, so I would imagine that you're gonna need a reservation for a Friday or Saturday night.
