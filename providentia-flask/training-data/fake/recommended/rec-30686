One of the best lunches I've ever had, before the city started to melt. Cute unpretentious little cafe for lunch / brunch. Tasty savory whole wheat crepes with traditional ingredients. Fresh mint iced tea. Super friendly family style service. Great quiet outdoor lunch spot solo or with a good friend. Don't let the douchebags find it, unless they already have and Im one of them...
