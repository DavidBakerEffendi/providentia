Showed up here on a Saturday night for a birthday party. The space is huge and the courtyard is pretty awesome. The food looks good especially the pretzels and we will come back another time to check all of that out. I have read many good things about this place especially their HH specials and since we moving less than 1/2 a mile away we will be spending some time here in the future. The courtyard was continuously packed the whole time we were there but we were able to find some tables inside near the front. The addition of the random drunk Jengas everywhere is pretty cool and definitely provides hours of entertainment. The beers are huge and the liquor drinks while limited are good as well. The bartenders are conversational and cool and their prices aren't terrible. All in all I would say that this was a really good 1st visit to Frankford and it most certainly won't be our last.
