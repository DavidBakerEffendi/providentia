This is a review I should have posted a couple of years ago. Because I was born and raised in Texas I am a harsh critic when it comes to any food remotely considered Mexican or Tex-Mex. I still haven't found a go-to Mexican spot in NYC. It's like searching for the Holy Grail. I like Gueros. It is good for Brooklyn. I wish the place was a bit larger but they serve flavorful tacos and are in walking distance of my house. Score! Today I had a bloody Maria while I waited for my order. Great spice although not enough alcohol. The avocado and jalepeno taco is by far my favorite. Today they weren't as good as they normally are. I'm not sure if that means they are falling off or just having an off day. I will still patronize Gueros and just assume they are having an off day.
