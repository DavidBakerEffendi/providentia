If one food place is certainly recession-proof, Prosperity Dumpling is wearing the Kevlar vest and brushing the dirt off the shoulder.  At these prices it's a very cheap way to keep the belly full. For a buck you get five dumplings, fried or steamed.  They also serve soup and a few other items.  Really though, it's about the dumplings. As an added bonus, you can buy a bag of 50 frozen dumplings to take home for $8!  And that, fellow Yelpers, is just what I did.
