Just had my first experience at Bartaco and I can't WAIT to go back! We had a seat outside on the patio and the weather was absolutely perfect. There were lovely flower boxes lining the other side of the wall which attracted several bees but it wasn't a big deal... Had the Bluepoint Toasted Lager beer which was VERY tasty... especially considering our surprise when it arrived in a can! (I'm still a bit skeptical about having good beer from a can... and I did ask for a glass to drink it out of... but this actually WAS good beer!) The food was absolutely fantastic... we had the baja fish, the pork belly, the wild boar, the spicy chorizo, the sesame ribeye and the chicken tacos... for sides we had the grilled corn, the stewed beans with pork and the spicy cucumber salad... every single thing was amazing and fresh... especially good was the baja fish which was clearly not plucked from a warming area... it was hot and crispy in a wonderfully flavorful batter and not at all greasy... The service was among the best I've experienced lately... helpful, pleasant, attentive without being annoying - even the manager came over to clear the dishes and ask how things were... We will definitely be returning customers - without a doubt!
