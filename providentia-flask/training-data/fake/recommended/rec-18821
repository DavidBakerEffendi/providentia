Throughout the years I had always avoided 'restaurant row' because it looked touristy and mediocre.  That being said, a friend and I met here last night for dinner, and I realized I shouldn't have judged this book by its cover.  Dinner was very good, all in all it was a nice evening. The introductory bread was great, as well as the olives.  I'm a sucker for good olives, and these were mm mm mmm.  (What was that in the marinade, lemon juice?  Almond oil?  Something had a great, buttery, unique flavor.)  I had a rack of lamb which was well salted, nicely seasoned, and well grilled too.  It was atop some peas and mint, a great accompaniment to the lamb.  The portion was generous, as well.  My friend had pepper-encrusted tuna... I'm not a huge fish-eater, and even I had to admit it was tasty.  For dessert we shared a chocolate bread pudding which was the right size and not as heavy as it looked. The most impressive thing to me was the wine list.  There's a huge list of wines for only $25 a bottle, and these weren't wines of the 'Yellow Tail' variety.  I recognized several bottles that I had bought myself in stores, and the markup was very slim, compared to the norm.  That being said, they also had a separate list of more expensive wines, and that wasn't small either.  Cool. Some small gripes:  the space where you wait for your table to get ready is small and people are constantly saying "excuse me, excuse me", often from two directions at once.  I guess the answer is to wait outside.  The noise level at the beginning of the evening was also pretty clangy and dinny, louder than it needed to be.  I guess most of the blame for this goes on the clientele, not the restaurant.  The service was fine, but a tad clumsy, neither spectacular nor terrible. I would happily go back.
