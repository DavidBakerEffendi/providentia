Went here for the first time since it opened with a client.  I had the rigatoni with meatballs and italian sausage and my client had black linguini and shaved fennel salad.  Both dishes were great.  Front door guy was friendly and helpful (we had our food to go) and I will definitely be taking more clients here to eat.
