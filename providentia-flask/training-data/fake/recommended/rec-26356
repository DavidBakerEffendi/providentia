This is my go-to place for anything from casual get togethers to celebration dinners. The setting is whimsical and sweet, like you've actually set foot in a garden tea party. I've never actually been there in summer, but I'm sure sitting outside would be lovely. Definitely try the cheese plates to start. All the entrees are good.
