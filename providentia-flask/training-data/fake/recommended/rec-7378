I'm a hardcore meat-eater.  I also love animals, all things furry.  Therein lies the dilemma, do I turn a blind eye or do I become a cranky vegetarian wanker? Taim may be the only place that has made me pause to reconsider different forms of sustenance.  I was introduced to this gem by a vegetarian date; see, there is a purpose to everyone you meet. *Thanks so much!*  That Harissa Falafel sandwich, hot damn, is delicious and fulfilling.  Every part of the sandwich plays an integral part and makes sense. A long line is expected, but the orders are pumped out rather quickly.  They are very efficient with enough staff making sandwiches and because of it, nothing is left sitting out for too long.  It is probably best to grab and go since the joint is small and the line takes up half the space.  Besides, I've always found it a bit jarring to stare into a mirror while stuffing myself silly; I can see the disapproval of my feeding face.
