Came here while visiting New York when the SF Giants were in town. My sister and I waited for about half an hour for our table. Our waiter was nice and told us a little bit about Grimaldi's before taking our drink orders. We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, and mushrooms. The two foreigners sitting to our left had a complaint about their uncooked sausage in their pizza, but the waiter just took it out of their fork and probably tossed it out. No complimentary drinks or meal? What's up with that? The waiter didn't even have the nerve to apologize. Is this how you treat your customers? Overall, our pizza was good but the way the waiter handled the foreigners was unacceptable. Either apologize for your mistake or comp a drink or the whole meal. Avoidance no problems never lead to future returns.
