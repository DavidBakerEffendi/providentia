This place is one giant step up for Hartford.  It's just what was lacking for many, many years.  The food is fantastic and cooked to perfection and the wait staff is well-trained, friendly and very knowledgeable.  We have tried a lot of really good steakhouses, but this is our favorite.  My wife and I used to frequent J. Gilbert's in downtown Glastonbury on a weekly basis because it was right around the corner from us, but we have abandoned it for Capital Grille.  It is so worth the ride into Hartford.  The dry-aged steaks and sides are all delicious, and even their seafood is cooked to perfection.  The drinks are wonderful and, although they have the best wine cellar in this area, their wines by the glass are terrific. My wife and I went to dinner there last night for our anniversary and enjoyed it immensely.  Our wait person, Martha, was awesome and very helpful in helping us pick out what we wanted to eat, as well as what wine to have with our dinners.  We didn't want to have more than a glass each, so it would have been easy for Martha to suggest a $15 or $18 dollar glass of wine, but she was very thoughtful and suggested moderately priced wines that were great. For excellent food, service, drinks and atmosphere, this is the place to go.
