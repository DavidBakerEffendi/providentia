Meh...not impressed. I give 3 stars since the bread was amazing, and the flavor of my "steak" was not bad either. However, I ordered a chicken cheesesteak. I was expecting a thin, wafer sliced chicken, maybe chopped up a bit, with onions and cheese. What I get: diced chicken breast with cheese and onions. I complain, and explain what I expected. A traditional looking cheesesteak. He says they use real chicken. Fair enough, but this looked just like cut up chicken breast. I could have made this at home. I wonder if the cheesesteaks are better? And do they use wafer sliced steak, or just cut up a regular steak??
