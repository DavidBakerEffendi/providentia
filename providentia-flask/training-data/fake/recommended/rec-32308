I've had plenty of cheese steaks, and I must say that Cosmi's always leaves my tummy doing the happy dance. They also make great chicken cheese steaks and their french fries are perfectly cooked (not greasy, soggy, over cooked/burnt like some other places). The customer service has always been consistently friendly when we've ordered take-out or delivery.
