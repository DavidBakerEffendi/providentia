I'm always a little hesitant when I give a place 5 stars, but they deserve it, not just because their food is good.... but because they specialize in chocolate, and their food is good. They have such a unique and quirky flair about them, somehow it just works! After walking around the city trying to find a place that wasn't serving brunch or soup only, we stumbled upon this spot by the spell out sweet chocolate :) We ordered fish tacos, steak paninis, spinach artichoke dip, a waffle sandwich, and grilled chicken burger. The platters sound pretty regular, but they presentation was awesome and everything was cooked perfectly. You couldn't go to your regular burger joint or applebees to get what we got. We had to try something chocolate, so we ordered the chocolate and caramel hot cocoa as well as the Mexican dark hot chocolate that had a little kick to it. The waffle fries were amazing too with their chilli/cocoa powder. Everything was filling and we left with boxes. Conclusion... yeah I'd definitely go back
