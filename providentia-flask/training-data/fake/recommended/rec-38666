We used to love Hot Tomato's years ago, long before its reincarnation at Union Place. We decided to try it again with a couple of friends. Unfortunately, this is not the Hot Tomato's of old. If you park across the street in the $10 lot, Hot Tomato's will comp you the garlic bread. Or should I say the artery clogging cheese bread. The garlic bread used to be a delicate combination of Italian cheeses. Now you can barely taste the garlic there is so much cheese. We had the wedge salad and a Boston salad special. All in all, the salad portions were large (definitely sharable) and we had no complaints. However, the entrees are a different story. My wife had the Shrimp Malta. You know those little bottles of capers? I swear her dish had an entire bottle of them. The noodles were al dente, but the dish was so salty from the capers to be almost inedible. I went with the Brooklyn Ragu. While the menu description sounded interesting, the result is basically spaghetti and meatballs. There was no creamy ricotta cheese topping and the sauce was watery. Certainly nothing at all like Grandma's gravy. Yuck. Two drinks, a salad, two entrees, 2 coffees, tip and tax set me back $81. This was NOT WORTH THE PRICE. I will not be returning to Hot Tomato's.
