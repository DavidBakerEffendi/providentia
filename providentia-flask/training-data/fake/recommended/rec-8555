B2 is a welcoming neighborhood cafe with a surprisingly wide and delicious selection of sandwiches, cookies, and other treats. The coffee is so-so, but the baked goods rock my world. Service here is never rushed- so don't pop in when you're on a tight schedule. Enjoy the slow pace and the animal and vegan friendly space. I love the variety of people I see here- artists sketching, kids playing, dogs resting. Set me up with a bagel sandwich and a seat by the window, and I can easily read and eavesdrop for hours.
