Ok, if I could eat at Empanada every day for the rest of my life, I'd be one happy lady. Seriously, this was one of my favorite meals that I have ever had.  The empanadas were out of this world delicious.  The crust was flaky, crispy, soft, not too thick.. just the most perfect thing ever. My favorite was the Cuban, but honestly, I don't think you can go wrong here.  They have TONS of different flavors, so you can have a different experience every time that you come. Also, they are SUPER affordable.  I honestly couldn't believe the check when we got it.
