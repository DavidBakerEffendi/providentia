I've read much about this place and been wanting to try it. My parents tend to return to he same places over and over so for my Mom's birthday I decided to bring them somewhere new. Dinner begins at 5:00. We arrived at about 5:30. There were very few people in the restaurant. We were seated promptly. However....the service was not exemplary. We were missing to place settings until we pointed it out. Server did not show up very often throughout the night. She was very pleasant, but often just missing. Our food.....our party of 6 waited nearly an hour to revive food. Considering the number of dinners seated ahead of us and our menu selections this seemed excessive. Three of us ordered the North Carolina BBQ. I'm fairly certain this cooked earlier in the day so it is simply plated when ordered. Two us ordered Mac & cheese. Not sure if this made to order or preprepared. Either way, not a one hour meal. One us ordered a turkey burger. Likely the longest prep time, but not an hour. Once the food arrived, Fantastic! The food was amazing. I loved the BBQ pork. The corn bread was to die for. Total cost for 6 (2 children and 2 alcoholic beverages) $165.00
