I had my doubts about misconduct tavern due to a 5 minute visit involving a bar crawl and some red headed sluts (the shot!). This preconceived notion turned out to be totally wrong. I had a great time. Was there for a birthday.... called 10 minutes ahead for seating, we walked in and they had a table for 15 waiting for us but the place was full minus our table. The waitress started taking our drink order from a vast slection of bottled beer and some draft. She stated she was new, only been there a week... this could have been a bad sign. It wasn't we enjoyed great service, never had to wait for a drink, the waitress was attentive and we enjoyed ourselves. Not to mention that had great food. Most of us ordered the mac and cheese, you could have it plain, or with a variety of toppings ranging from tomatoes, crabmeat, garlic, bacon, mushrooms, etc. Some of the other in our party had the burger, veggie burger, and chicken fingers. There wasn't a complaint in the place only sighs of delight over their french fries. They were even nice enough to accommodate my friend who wanted turkey added to the brie and pear sandwich. Overall it was a great experience and if they can handle a rowdy party of 15, they should be able to handle anything. I would highly recommend it to anyone who asked... yummm :o) Side Note: They did not add a gratuity for our party of 15, I know some people prefer it when they don't add a gratuity, so I thought it was worth mentioning
