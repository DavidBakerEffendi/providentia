I really enjoyed this restaurant this past weekend.  My husband and I called for a reservation on Friday night around 7 and they had a 9:30 reservation available.   I ordered the white tuna tempura and the scallop sashimi.  Both were delicious.  I haven't found these specific dishes around where I live so I enjoyed being able to try something new.   The restaurant wasn't too loud and I liked the atmosphere. I would definitely come here again.
