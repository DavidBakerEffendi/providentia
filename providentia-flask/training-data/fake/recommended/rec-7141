Walked in without a reservation on a Monday night. Sat at the counter overlooking the kitchen and enjoyed one of the most interesting and unpretentious adventures I've had in a NYC restaurant. The menu is exciting, but doesn't adequately describe the food -- beautiful but not prissy, spicy, fragrant, fresh and somehow familiar and new at the same time. My daughter and I shared four dishes and each was its own distinct experience. Portions are fair for the price, and generous for "small plates." Only the pork jowls were a let-down -- not a hint of crisp -- but the accompanying caramelized lime-chili brussels sprouts (we were told a seasonal substitute for watermelon) more than compensated. Staff are professional and completely at ease. From start to finish, Pig and Khao is confident, and it should be. This place is a find.
