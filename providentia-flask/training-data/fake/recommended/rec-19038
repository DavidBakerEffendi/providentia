Was presented with fresh, clean napkin (I had not realized mine had dropped on the floor). We were on the wait list for brunch. Instead of chaos though, they were very organized in getting us from our bloody marys to a table. We were not rushed. All the food we ordered, ricotta, ouves mosterne and french toast were all winners. High quality, fresh flavors. It was a fantastic experience. I look forward to going back and trying other items.
