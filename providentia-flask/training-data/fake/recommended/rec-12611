This place was pretty good! I'm not even big on toppings on my pancakes but these blueberry pancakes were really delish! I also got the fried chicken sandwich. It came with fries and coleslaw. No complaints on that either. Oh you may want to add more of their special mayo to the sandwich. I'll be back to this place!
