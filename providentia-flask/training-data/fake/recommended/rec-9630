I give this restaurant five stars. The food is amazing. The sangria is a must have! The decor is trending. The waiters and other staff that work here are super friendly. The restaurant had a C grade for a very long time. Yet I still went because I didn't find any fault on why it had been given a C grade. The restaurant now has an A grade. I truly don't understand if this so call grading is true. I have been going to A graded restaurants and did not enjoyed the food or the service. I took a chance and went to this restaurant because it was highly recommended. Guess it's best to take a friends advice than these paper grades displayed on front windows. :)
