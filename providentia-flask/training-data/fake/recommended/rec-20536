I have nothing else to add about Jerry's hardships and magnificent, resilient character. He's a charming and very mellow guy who shouldn't be in those shoes. I find it amusing that he's parked outside of NYU's school for business. Regardless, I'm not rating him on his story, but on his food. I was having a wonderful day and pulled out my phone to see where I could top off a decent sushi avocado roll, which was followed by a fantastic espresso (no, I'm not pregnant). Torsu seemed interesting and unusual and "cheap eats" enough for me. I couldn't decide, but with Jerry's help, got the 16 (whatever it was called) which was a spicy (meh, a bit mild for me) dish with chicken, veggies, and brown rice ($6, hands down, solid price for lunch in the area). I sat down in Washington Square, and dug into a very generous meal. Â The flavors seemed too simple and plain and first, but the mellowness of the food was appreciated after a few bites. It has definitely got a great taste and texture and the mild heat keeps it interesting. Sometimes, a meal doesn't have to wow you to be perfect. I reserve five stars for food that blows my mind, but I think I'll give Jerry another shot or 4 to wow me.
