My second in the Tap Room Series... On a particularly subfreezing, single digit night, my friend Brendan invited me to have drinks at the Memphis taproom in Fishtown. I'm primarily a South and West Philly guy, never really understood the hype of anything north of Spring Garden, but lately I've been trying real hard to expand my geography. I have to start with the bikeride. I bike everyday to and from work and anywhere else in between, regardless of the atmospheric conditions. As a rule, at least for the last 2 years, I don't bike if I'm going to be drinking more than a beer or two. So I head up 5th st, ride through the tunnel, make a right on Girard and instead of turning left on Frankford, I keep going straight until the road splits 3 ways into 95, Richmond Ave, and Aramingo Ave. I choose Richmond and realize I am now on an entrance ramp to a high speed highway. After scaring the sh*t out of myself, I make a left at Ridge, a full 10 blocks north of the bar. After finally figuring out my bearings, I make to the pub and my poor friend Brendan (who also is a Yelper) was all alone, nobody else had shown. I go for the Yards Brawler, and its great. The bartender priced most of the Draught beers at $2 because new stuff was coming the next day. "Boasting superior taste and champion flavor, the Brawler is crafted in the style of English session ales. This malt-forward, ruby colored ale is great for when you want to go a few rounds." That was a little blurb from beersuggest.com, they can describe taste better than I. Thanks guys! You have to get the deep-fried Pickles! The batter is flakey like whole wheat flour, but is buttery like fried chicken! Seriously, its all I ate because you get huge, stiff spears (thats what she said). After that, the rest of the party showed, and I got tipsy on discounted Christmas beers! In conclusion, this place is comfy and has much promise, I must come and have a full meal soon! PS The PBC Xmas beer is not good at all!
