I was pleasantly surprised by their wine selection. I couldn't believe they carried the Angeline Pinot Noir (which I love). Major Highlights: * You can warm up right next to a wood-fired oven (crucial during lengthy Vermont winters) * The "Punctuated Equilibrium" - It's a greek pizza and it's insanely good. You will keep coming back for it, mark my words.
