It's 3 and 1/2 stars for me. I came here on a Â Saturday at noon and there was no AC. It was 88 degrees outside! I had the highly rated meat loaf sandwich. It was good but I did not fancy the ciabatta bread that much. Maybe it was too hard and dense? Overall good experience. They also have yummy virgin cocktails like the Dylan Temple.
