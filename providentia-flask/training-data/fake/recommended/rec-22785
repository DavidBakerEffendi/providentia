Love this place! They give you sooo many side dishes and may I suggest the seafood soondubu if you don't feel like eating bbq for the day? I find that it can be cheaper to just order 2 orders of meat for bbq and a side of soup or cold noodles rather than getting the combo for a group of 3 (or more). The service here is quite great. If you're a first timer don't worry! They give you directions on how to grill the meat and then pretty much leave you at it. Usually Friday and Saturdays are the busiest which can make it a pain (re: really really long wait times) if you didn't make a reservation before hand.
