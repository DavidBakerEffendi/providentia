Live latin music which puts this place high on my list of places to go dancing. They play all types of music including salsa,  cumbia,  bachata,  merengue,  reggaton,  and pop. Women are free and $5 cover for men (I hate covers). Drinks range are $7 for shota, mix drinks are $10. This is rather pricey for the area hence the lower rating,  cover fee + high priced drinks dont mix well in my book. The crowd is an older crowd but very lively. The servers are very cheerful as are the entertainers. They serve food  night and you can call to reserve a table, friends say the food is very good, their menu is online. The layout is a dance floor near the stage surrounded by many dining tables and two full bars. Not the best ambiance but the music makes up for all. Definitely come here for to dance, eat, and have good times with friends.
