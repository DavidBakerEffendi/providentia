I keep going back in hopes that I'll fall in love with this place.  Fail.  Overall I would give it 5 stars if it was completely based on ambiance and price but the food has failed to impress me.  The Moroccan cous cous was dry and bland considering it had such flavorful ingredients, the salmon pot pie was overcooked and the bruschetta was a pile of capers with a few pieces of tomato thrown in there.  That being said, the place itself is charming, you definitely don't feel like you're in Manhattan and there is a great trendy crowd, just wish the food was better!
