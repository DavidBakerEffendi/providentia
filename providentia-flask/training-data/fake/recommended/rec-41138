Hmmmm. I have heard that this place was fantastic, but my experience was just ok. The bar, people, atmosphere were very nice. Food....disappointed. I usually order spicy noodle at any Thai restaurant, and this one was not good at all. It was very salty and the type of noodle they used was not the same as other places. It may work for somebody, though. I have tasted chicken and broccoli that my friend ordered, it was very salty too. Everything on the menu was very very affordable. Thai iced tea was wonderful!
