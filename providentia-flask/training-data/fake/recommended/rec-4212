I was in town for a conference and Bill's was on the way between my hotel and the convention center.  What a gem for quick stop-in breakfasts!  Fast, friendly service (I've never been called "sweetie" that many times in a single visit anywhere), and the prices were great.  Very affordable for fresh, hot bacon-egg-and-cheese bagels, or even the full breakfast special (which I was hard pressed to finish).  If you like good, unfussy diner grub, Bill's gets my vote.
