went here on a sunday evening..The service was superb and the food divine. we had lamb tagine with couscous and a burger with salad. The lamb was done just as I like it! fall of the bone tender. I am not a big burger fan but this was delicious,juicy and tender( I dont care for hard food or those that require a lifetime of chewing before I am able to swallow). We also had the hummus with pita bread and masala sauce on the side for appetizer. Our waiter kept filling our water glasses in impressive fashion. Even other servers passing by asked if everything was ok with our meal!..Definitely a must do in the Burg!! p.s. the decor is great with enclosed garden area for dining.
