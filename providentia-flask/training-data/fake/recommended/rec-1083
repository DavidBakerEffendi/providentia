If you are going here, I would definitely recommend the Shack stack burger. A beef burger with a veggie patty as well. The veggie patty consists of mushrooms stuffed with cheese. It is amazing. The fries however, are alright,they could use more cheese, and they were a bit salty. My husband got the double stack burger, and that was pretty salty as well. Â The shakes are amazing though !
