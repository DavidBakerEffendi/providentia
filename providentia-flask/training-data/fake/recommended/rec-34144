I really enjoy this spot. The atmosphere is cool and laid back and the food is pretty and delicious. My fav is the lamb pops. It's is a small plate portion but very flavorful. I have had the duck sliders, yum and the steak tostadas which were a delight as well .Their creamy polenta is like a hug on your insides. This place is a great neighborhood hang out that you will return to often. The servers and the owner are so friendly and attentive if you come back a couple of times, it will definately Â have a "Cheers" bar feeling for you with the friendly staff welcoming you and calling you by your name. Sweet!
