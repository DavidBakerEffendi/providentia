The ambiance is nice... a few of the drinks and the grits need perfecting (I don't want to have to season, I just want to eat)! The hostess was discriminatory but, the other staff compensated for her snarky demeanor. The food was tasty as we finished it all. F.Y.I: The portions are definitely for you to delight in but, not indulge!
