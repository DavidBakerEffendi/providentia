Fare has only gotten better since it opened a year or so ago. The first couple of times I went to Fare, I thought the quality of the food was average, decently priced and nothing that special with plates that were on the small side. Their drink menu has always been reasonably priced with excellent drinks, especially the martinis. I went to Fare Friday night with 4 girlfriends for Fairmount Restaurant Week. For $30, we each got an appetizer, entree and dessert. The portions were much larger than I remember. And maybe we just ordered different items than a year ago, but everything we had was a nice portion. Four out of five of us had the flatbreads as appetizers and they were large enough to be a meal. I was full after just the appetizer. I wish I would have saved half to take home but my veggie flatbread was so good that I devoured the entire thing. The Bluefish special was delicious. I also tried my friend's salmon and it was also very good. I had this lemon shortbread thing for dessert and it was delicious. I also tried the vegan cheesecake and I don't understand how you can make a vegan dessert taste so good. The ambiance is wonderful. It is a great date place but also a great place to go with a few friends. Service was very good. We did have a Friday reservation for 8pm and had to wait 15 minutes so the manager (who is ridiculously handsome and nice) brought us complimentary cocktails while we waited. It rained unexpectedly and they usually have outside seating so we think that is why there was a short wait but the manager and staff were all very attentive. My favorite things about Fare are the martinis and flatbreads. Even non-martini drinkers like the Very Clean Martini. A year ago, I didn't care to come back. But after my experience on Friday, I hope to meet friends again there in the near future for another great dining experience. This now may be my favorite restaurant in Fairmount.
