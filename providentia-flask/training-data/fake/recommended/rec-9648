Was hoping for more, unfortunately found this to be an average 3 star place.   The patatas bravas was pretty good - I can see myself ordering this again with a few glasses of wine.  As was the lamb chops - again could be inclined to revisit this at some point.  However, these two were pretty average overall by humble standards relative to my past Spanish Tapas experiences.  And finally we had the  Paquetitos de jamón.  Was really rooting for this one...was not good in the opinions of myself and my date.  It was salty and the flavor was a little strange.   The space itself is pretty nice- the wine was good and nice spot to hang at the bar.  The table service was ok - our server was nice enough but didn't check up on us and we definitely had questions.   So - given the quality, portion sizes (I know it's tapas), prices and expectations, it did not bubble over into the 4 star category in my book.
