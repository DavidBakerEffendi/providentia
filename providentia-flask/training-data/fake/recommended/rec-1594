without a doubt, the BEST BURGER i have ever had. we got the bronte and the whaleys to share. the burgers are served on ciabatta bread rather than a typical hamburger bun. the bread was crispy and perfect. the hamburger meat was FRESH, and cooked just right, medium rare without us even having to request it. the bronte was sweet because of the sweet chili, very good, but the whaleys was AMAZING (tomato, lettuce, BEET, PINEAPPLE, FRIED EGG, and ketchup - you have all these ingredients that sound gross together and you would never think to put in a burger, but it works! and its DELICIOUS!!!)...omg burger HEAVEN. my bf is not big on beets, but he gave it a 5 star rating! this was served with a side of salad (healthy! good! but it was drenched in dressing, bad!) it was a good satisfying size and the price was great for such a delicious meal ($11 for bronte, $12.50 for whaleys). we also tried the pineapple/mint shake which was different, refreshing, and not too sweet. the place is teeny tiny but we went in at a good time (2pm on a rainy Saturday) so we didn't have to wait. i'm usually not a big burger person, i never "crave" burgers, but this, this is definately crave-worthy.
