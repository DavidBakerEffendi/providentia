I used to live 3 blocks from this spot, and it's one of the places I miss the most from the East Village. My go-to sandwich is the East Side Ink, which has plenty of roast beef and cheese, but the best part are the jalapenos. A certifiable sinus drainer. Other standouts: Pho Real, the John Kerry, and the Italian sub. Please open a Chelsea location!
