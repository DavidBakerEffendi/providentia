Glad I found this place, food was amazing, nice location. We got two sandwiches and split them. I had half PBnJ which was pork belly, tomato jam, and arugula. Then half KoreanReuben with pastrami, kimchi, gojuchang mayo. Definitely the two best sandwiches I have had in awhile. I would highly recommend this place. Fries were good. Â I also had a small raspberry pastry dessert. Good times.
