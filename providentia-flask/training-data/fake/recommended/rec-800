PATS FTW! I come here every time I go to philly! Love their cheesesteaks. Wiz is bomb compared to genos which is too watered down and drippy. Definitely give this pace a try! Parking can get hard to find since it is kind in a downtown neighborhood area. Keep in minddd CASH ONLY buy there is an ATM if you need across the street.
