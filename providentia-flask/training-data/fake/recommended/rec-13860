Came here for dinner with a few friends. We ordered appetizers & mains - they were all pretty average. Apparently the best dish on the menu is the chicken. It was served pretty dry, though seasoned well. The kale that came with it was drenched in oil. Â  The waiter wasn't the friendliest so it made the meal less enjoyable too.
