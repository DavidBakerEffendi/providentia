A great little spot with great Belgian brews on tap.  I showed up near closing so no food for me.  Just really was looking for a night cap and the Delirium Noel on draft was perfect.  The place was a bit slow on Monday night and it was great to sit at the bar and watch tv and just unwind after a long day.  I'll be back for the food soon.
