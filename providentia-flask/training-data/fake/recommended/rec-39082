The most overrated, underwhelming crud I've eaten. Subway competes head on with them and that's an insult. I was all excited to go to Pat's. I took a field trip with some friends, we waited for an hour with building anticipation, placed our order according to protocol and waited again. We practically ran over to the picnic tables with our armful of grub. We threw it all down on the table and tore into the bag. We each grabbed our order and took a huge bite. Chewed, thought, and each in turn said, "this is it?" We were crushed. Like getting coal in your christmas stocking. I've had better cheesesteaks in NYC by far. We didn't even finish them. The whiz tastes and looks like plastic. The "steak" was chewy and tough. The fries were soggy. No wonder they are angry in Philly. The bread was okay. Their only claim to fame and it stinks. Now they only have the Liberty Bell to chime about. DON'T waste your time. The pictures in these reviews are more ghastly than crime scene photos. They should draw chalk outlines around the sandwiches. The only thing I can say that we may have done wrong, we weren't falldown drunk when we went. That may be the problem.
