i'm happy to report that i had an experience that is also not consistent with the other reviews which hopefully means this place is getting its act together (or that it wasnt that bad in the first place). we went with 12 people on a saturday night at 7pm. we were told, by a very nice server, there would be at least an hour wait but the bar was open and very convivial and reminded us all (southerners and australians mostly) of lovely and relaxed beach restaurants with broad views and horizontal sunlight. and it was hot as hell outside but the fans were on full blast and we were drinking pitchers of coronitas for 11 bucks, on ice, with limes, pure fun. we ordered some very good raw oysters and spicy shrimps to snack on and chilled out with our friends. a little over an hour into our wait they brought us to our tables on the deck, open air, cooler breeze by this point, string lights overhead, with a view of the harbor and the statue. we ordered more buckets of coronitas from our man alex, who was great, then the northeastern steam pot, a million blue crabs, fish and chips, fried scallops, fried oysters, mac and cheese, all of which was cooked very well and super delicious. the fried oysters and scallops were a giant hit and the crabs and lobsters were perfectly steamed and all was very reasonably priced. we were there from 7 to 11 and had an absolutely great time. we'll go back again and probably soon and probably once a month forever. there is not a place in new york like this place where you can sit outside at picnic, eat fried oysters and crabs that are brilliant and dont cost one million dollars, watch the sun set, chill out. a bunch of the red hook crowd is already hating on it, yelpers are clearly piling on, but i think this place deserves a visit.
