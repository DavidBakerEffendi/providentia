Loved this place, although it is probably one of the most cramped seating arrangement ever. Â  Get the grilled octopus, fantastic, along with the warm pitas, with hummus. The wait is long, but there is a nice bar across the street you can wait in, and the hostess will come and get you. Miss this place a lot
