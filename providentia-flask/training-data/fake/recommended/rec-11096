Another cozy restaurant on a great street.  Market Table was a small, intimate restaurant with wooden tables and large windows.  People watching, even on rainy days is still fun at this restaurant.  I started out with a nice glass of Sauvignon blanc while I waited for my date and I also had time to peep on to other peoples tables and see what everyone else was ordering. I was told by the manager that these were the best items on the menu: appetizers: - beef carpaccio -  homemade cavatelli   - warm octopus salad We ordered the beef carpaccio and it was absolutely delicious.  It was paired with a lovely green salad and french fries- yum!  The dressing on top was also incredible.  What a lovely dish. Entrees: - crispy pork cutlet - sautéed skate wing - whole grilled bronzino  (whole fish- bone in) I ordered the special which was a Grouper with yummy mushroom risotto.  Wow the grouper was awesome.  Very tender, white fish, and grilled to perfection.  It had a smokey taste to it as well that added to the flavor of the dish.  My boyfriend had the salmon and it looked great as well. Both fish that we ordered were incredible.  The next I am back and I going to have the cavatelli and the branzino- bone in yaya!
