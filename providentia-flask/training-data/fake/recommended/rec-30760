It is with a heavy heart that I write this review. I have lived in town for 17 years and have gotten my fish for Christmas Eve here for 17 years. Each year I know I spend more then I should on fish but I tell myself "it's a special meal and the fish should be the best" so I spend a little extra. Well, this year they outdid themselves. My order was 2lbs of cooked large shrimp, 3lbs cleaned raw jumbo shrimp and 1lb of seafood salad.......drumroll.......$215.00! Could not believe the price. This year was at least $70.00 more then last year and I ordered more last year! I left my order there on the table and told them they were ridiculous . Walked out empty handed, never to walk in again. They are taking advantage of the holiday. Shame on you Caldwell Seafood!
