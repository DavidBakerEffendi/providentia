Very sub-par at best.  I would rate it 1 star for the food, but bumped it up to 2 because our waitress was awesome and really helpful. The decor is very cute.  The best thing you get is the free salsa verde!  The black beans tasted like straight vinegar and the "drunken beans" are very similar to the taste of baked beans.
