I have been to Ssam Bar twice - both times for lunch.  The first time I was with a colleague and we ordered the octopus salad, pork buns, and salmon buns.  The octopus salad was incredible, especially the little potato balls.  The pork buns were equally delicious, as was the salmon.  The salmon had a great sauce that I really enjoyed.  The second time I came with a group and we ordered a bunch of dishes including the duck dumplings, fuji apple kimchi (this was amazing!  the bacon!  OMG), the momofuku ssam and the duck over rice.  All in all everything was really good, and I love the ambiance at the restaurant as well.  A little less hectic than Noodle Bar.
