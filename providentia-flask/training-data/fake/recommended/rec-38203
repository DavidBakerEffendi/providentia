I have to be honest. I'm not a big fan of this spot. I've been there about 7 or 8 times over the last five years. I just don't think it's a high quality place. The owner is very nice. But I just think she's kind of out of it a bit. She doesn't realize she needs a fresh kick in the butt. 50% of the time the service is ok. There's this really slow heavy set woman who doesn't really do it for me. The food isn't to die for. The setting is urban and honest but a bit sad. Prefer other spots.
