Frankford Hall is a great indoor/outdoor hangout all year round. You can hop on a ping pong table over the summer, or cuddle by a fire pit on a cool winter evening. And you can always jump in on a round of jumbling towers! Various sizes of beer to choose from, but the half liter is always a fun choice. While they do have dinner options available, I'd recommend just going for the bar snacks. Split a giant Bavarian pretzel with a friend. And don't overlook the Cheese Sp√§tzle- a decliously cheesy, gooey gnocchi-like dish. Definitely my favorite bar in this area!
