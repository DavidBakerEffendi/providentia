I've come here several times and have usually liked it, even waiting an hour and a half for brunch. Last night, a friend from out of town wanted to try it having never been. Dinner was good and can't say the service was terrible (although it's never that great or friendly). After paying our bill, we sat for a moment digesting and drinking the rest of our water. Apparently that pissed off our host. We were in the middle of a conversation when he abruptly came over, leaned in and explained to us that if we were all settled, we need to leave as he has people waiting for our table. um. I've heard of restaurants rushing you out of there, especially if they are bursting at the seams with people (which they weren't) but never has it been so rudely forced on me. I didn't realize the service ends as soon as I sign the bill. The food is good but so not worth this shitty attitude. That was pretty much my last visit there.
