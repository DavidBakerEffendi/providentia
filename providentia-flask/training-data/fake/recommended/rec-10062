east of gowanus, west of park slope, north of greenwood and in the middle of nowhere this place is a kind of an anomaly, even eccentric. i have eaten here many times in the last few years and i end wanting to come back. not trendy, not sophisticated, not expensive, not fast, not corporate. palo santo has a rural down to earth feeling and taste, often inspired, sometimes experimental not always perfect but i can feel the care that is behind whatever they do. above all, honest.
