I work right near this place and have dined here so much that a review is in order. I have been here for both lunch and dinner and so far this place has never failed me. If you're looking for a fancy lounge bar environment where you can take a date, a girls night dinner, or a visiting friend to show off NYC, this is definitely the place to go. They have a sophisticated lounge and bar area where you can have drinks before or after dinner, and the food is Mediterranean/Turkish with a modern flair. Price is on the higher side of average consider in the neighborhood, quality of food and plating preparation.
