One does not simply walk into Sunday brunch at Penelope. In the couple times I've been here, it seems unless you go close to opening time you will wait.  Significantly. The food is very good though.  Worth waiting an hour at the door, that's debatable. Prix-Fixe came with an apple-cider mimosa or pomegranate Bellini this time around.  Salmon Wrapped poached eggs and nutella french toast are quite good, as is the raspberry sour cream coffee cake. There's a reason people flock here, it's good value.
