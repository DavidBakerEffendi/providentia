Please note: Bring cash, absolutely no credit cards!! The biscuits are buttery, pancakes fluffy, and french toast is to die for. The autumn egg scramble (wild mushrooms and goat cheese) is fabulous. Don't forget to save some of your toast/biscuit for the raspberry jam that comes in the little silver pot... Â it's tart and not too sweet (I usually don't like jellies/jams b/c of their sweetness). I'm not sure that there's anything on the menu that isn't good. They lose one star due to wait time, and the bacon could be better (it's crispy and all, but I like my bacon thick cut and peppery). My advice is to go when you're not quite hungry, and by the time you get seated, you'll be ravenous.
