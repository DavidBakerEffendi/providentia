Been there twice now and both times I have enjoyed my food thoroughly. I ordered the kurobuta katsu curry rice the first time and it came with a cabbage salad. The katsu was very juicy and delicious. I ate the whole thing in a few minutes. The cabbage salad was refreshing and different from what I'm normally used to but it was also quite good. The second time I came for dinner and I ordered the curry udon. It was very flavorful with a lot of pepper. Other than the katsu and scallions on top, there wasn't anything else in the curry. I kind of wished there was some vegetable in it but that's ok. There was never any wait when I went but there was also a line when I left. I like to count myself lucky. The service was okay. Â Waiters kept walking by but couldn't seem to see our hands raised unless you're almost waving it in their face. Otherwise decent place and I would come back. Oh. The prices are a little pricey too. $16 for a bowl of soup? And almost $20 for curry rice. :/
