This place is FANTASTIC. I went twice in just the span of three days. The first time I went on a Saturday night with a group of friends. We just happened to stumble upon Nai and went in. Little did we know there was a live flamenco show going on! The show made the restaurant way too loud to have proper conversation, but the tapas made up for it. All of the food was great. That first night we had: -Squid in its own ink (FANTASTIC! Especially if you use the appetizer bread and dip it in the ink) -Caracoles (escargot in a sauce, this was great too) -Some kind of chorizo, which I didn't get to try -Beef empanadas (good) I went again with a friend on a Monday at around 5PM and the place was quieter. There was no flamenco show and there were a lot of free tables. This is the ideal time to go for someone like me, who doesn't enjoy very loud places. This time we had: -Bacalaitos (AWESOME!) -Beef empanadas -The squid in its own ink -Blood sausage (GREAT) -Some kind of potato dish (which I didn't try) Everything I've had here is so full of flavor and well cooked. It really makes me trust Â them. But the best part? Their food is always served HOT! I'm the kind of person who needs all their food to be served at a very high temperature in order to enjoy it. I can't stand when something is served cold, or even when it's served warm. Everything I had at Nai was very hot, just the way I like it. The service was also great both times. We didn't have to wait too long for our food, and our waiters were very kind and attentive on both occasions. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. I can't wait to return to try the rest of their dishes!
