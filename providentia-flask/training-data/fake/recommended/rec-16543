Came here for my birthday. Small tables, great staff, and got to meet Chef Mehta! We ordered everything off the menu...twice. It was that good. The Chef was nice enough and sent a couple rounds of shots since we were celebrating. The service was fantastic and on point. I'd definitely come back again...
