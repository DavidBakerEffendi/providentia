Mediocrity at best- To start the service wasn't very customer oriented, the hostess gave us attitude about changing where we wanted to sit in an empty restaurant. We sit down and get served what taste like bagged cold tortilla chips, sauces were average. After look at the menu we waited a half hour for the waiter to take our order. We ordered some margaritas they were really good and had the trio of wings they were fried nicely and good sauce. I had the tilapia tacos it was a very large portion meal the idea was nice but the execution was sloppy ! Less is more. My friend had the quesadilla and they were also a large portion the flavor was there but presentation wasn't as good. Our bill came to about $60 complete with 7 $1 charges that include pico, guacamole, sour cream, cheese, to be a Mexican place I thought some things would come standard. I may return if I'm with friends for good drinks and maybe wings but it wouldn't be my first choice for a Mexican spot.
