OK, I'm totally guessing that this is the Halal Cart I ate at today... I had my first falafel. It was great - I got it with the hot sauce, which turned out to be not as hot as I thought it would be, but that was okay. It balanced out the flavor of what I'm gonna guess was hummus inside, and the explosion of textures and tastes in my mouth was pretty amazing. Falafels. I am sold. But I think I liked my friend's lamb gyro just a little better ;) It was a good food experience though, for sure. I'm going to be on the lookout for the perfect falafel once I get back to California.
