I am so happy to have found this place, and now it's my go to restaurant! Finding somewhere that uses coconut oil and serves only real food that's grain free is extremely rare.  Paleo is a lifestyle, and this restaurant does a wonderful job of providing healthy and delicious food to its patrons.  The prices are reasonable, and the portions are huge. I love the meatloaf, sweet potatoes, and veggie dishes, and can't wait to keep trying more items on their menu.
