My friend and I were looking for a brunch place near Brooklyn Museum with good prices. We found Tom's and probably enjoyed the trip there more than our trip to the museum. Yes, there was a line and an unusual bit of a wait at eleven a.m. We figured that there must be delicious foods inside. This was very true! I ordered the two eggs and two pancakes and so did my friend. The pancakes were to die for! Tom's even offered flavored butters, however the pancakes are so good you don't even need them. The eggs were cooked just right and the bacon was good too. I can't wait to go back!
