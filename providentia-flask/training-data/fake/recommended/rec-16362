Jessica and I really enjoyed this spot. We love the design of the place, the decor, and the counter ordering. I appreciate that they're serving wine-on-tap and saving that bottle waste. The menu was quirky, and in a very good way, coupling burgers and sushi. The person who served us was friendly. I'll look forward to returning and having the sweet potato fries again!
