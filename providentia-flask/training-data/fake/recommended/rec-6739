I'm disappointed that I waited 6 months to try this place now. It's a beautiful place with excellent decor and atmosphere. The service was excellent - only one slip and they rectified it immediately. The food was very good. It is a seasonal menu so best to check it out on line. We had the four course menu and the food was perfectly executed. The food clearly had thought put into it from a flavor profile also. Unlike other high priced restaurants in Princeton (yes Elements I'm talking about you), this one actually delivers with excellent service, perfect presentation, thoughtful flavor and perfect execution. Wine pairing was good but I did think a tad over priced for the wine pairing (two levels a regular and grande for different quality of wine). Technically probably only 4 stars compared to other places I've eaten like Le Bernardin however for Princeton no doubt this is a 5. Figure $300 for 2 people with wine tasting (that was 4 courses plus a cheese course plus tea plus champagne at the beginning).
