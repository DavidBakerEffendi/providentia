This is my favorite Izakaya that I've found in Manhattan.  When I first started going a while ago, it was pretty much only Japanese people eating here.  It used to be somewhat secretive because of it's location and the fact that they didn't have a blatant sign out there.  Now, something happened and there are many different people coming here.  it's been harder to get a table recently.  They used to make you ring a doorbell and now you can just come right on in.  Still, Japanese people eat here all the time and that's how I knew it would be good.  The kinds of flavors you encounter here are out of this world.  The bone-in ribeyes, the chicken skins, the chicken livers, the kimchi, the sake, the beer, the rice balls filled with pork...the menu is too big to list.  You have to just check it out.  Everything they serve yakitori style is awesome.  It's also one of the more casual and reasonably priced Izakayas around.  I've taken people here who have been to Japan and they claim that the atmosphere and taste of the food all feel authentically Japanese.  It truly feels to them like an actual Japanese pub here in Manhattan.
