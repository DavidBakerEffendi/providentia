I had brunch here w/ some friends on Saturday. A friend's cinnamon bun had something that looked like mold on it. After inspecting it w/ the waiter, we couldn't figure out what it was. He took it back to show someone. The manager came by to apologize & gave us a complimentary basket of freshly baked breads & pastries. Eggs Benedict: 4/5 - Despite the cinnamon bun mishap, my friends enjoyed the rest of their food & I enjoyed mine. Service: 4/5 - The waiter was very friendly & attentive. Ambience: 4/5
