Went for dinner on a Tuesday night. Me and my guest ordered the Filet and it was extremely good. The piece of meat was excellent and perfectly cooked. The sauce with it was really good, as was the side veggies and potatoes. The table bread was also decent, especially when dipped in the steak sauce. The service was good and the ambience was ok, could have been slightly bigger but wasn't a drawback from the experience. The wine selection was good and reasonably priced as far as mark ups go. I would certainly go back, even if just for the steak.
