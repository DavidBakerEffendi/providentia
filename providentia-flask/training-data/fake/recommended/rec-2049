I desperately needed a break from studying for finals, and figured it was as good a time as any to use my Living Social voucher for Doc Magrogan's that I had been hoarding. Even though it was a weeknight, I was worried that like many establishments that offer daily deals, they wouldn't want to take my same-day reservation, but they were more than happy to have us come in within half an hour of my call. We ended up ordering their large seafood platter to share, and they accommodated our request for more fresh oysters instead of fresh clams (icky). The oysters were okay, and I'm pretty sure they were all the same type. The rest of the seafood was okay too, but I would have appreciated a more interesting sauce than just vinegar to go with it. On our awesome server's recommendation, I had the seafood bouillabaisse and it was delicious. The boyfriend had a lobster roll, which was solidly good, but nothing compared to Neptune Oyster in Boston. Their cocktail selection looked pretty neat, but alas I had to study afterwards so didn't get to try any, but we did indulge in some dessert and that might have been my favorite part of the meal. I had a delightfully tart raspberry vanilla parfait and the boyfriend had some kind of mousse that was also very good. We ended up dropping another $60 (plus tip) on top of our $50 voucher. Not sure if it was worth it for an establishment that's basically an upscale Chili's, but would probably go back for their happy hour or if another deal came up.
