My family and I love this place. It has a casual family atmosphere, the owners are very sweet and the staff is friendly. We've ordered takeout or eaten in on dozens of occasions and the food is delicious every time. Their baked stuffed sole and stuffed mushrooms are incredible - they have the best seafood stuffing. The food portions are huge, too, and can last you several meals. The only odd thing about this place that I've noticed is that the desserts often have a strange hint of onion flavor, most often if you order them to-go. I don't know if it's maybe because they store them in a place that they also store onions or peppers or something. But besides that, as I said, the other food is great.
