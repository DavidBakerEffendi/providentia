We went based on Yelp reviews with two others who need gluten free pizza - both the GF and the regular pizza lived up to the reviews! Started with Â arugula salad and avocado with balsamic drizzle- Fantastic! Great location with a garage right there in case the street is full - tucked away in the alley with a small quiet patio in back. Love that many foods are local and farm to table - but most of all loved the pizza!
