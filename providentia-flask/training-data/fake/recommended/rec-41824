I've been here about 6 times now-twice for dinner, two Trufflepaloozas and twice for brunch and holy schmoke and a pancake it is GOOOD. The ambiance fits the whole TribeCa image and the waitstaff and servers are all polished without being snooty. I have been here on really crowded nights and you can feel a bit cramped but what do you expect when its friggin Trufflepalooza? The weather has been all sheisty lately but if you can get seat in the courtyard, it is perfection. They also have a fantastic beer selection-if you have not tried Left Hand Milk Stout, do not deny yourself any longer! Now the food: I could wax poetic about the Sheep's Milk Ricotta and grilled bread (not toast ;) but I'll spare you. Just order it. What I like most about this place is that foods I traditionally dislike, HATE even, I LOVE here. I was not a truffle/mushroom fan, hated scallops, and did not do raw meats but the dishes here are just top notch delicious and I couldn't help but enjoy them-the steak tartar was startlingly good. The orecchiette pasta with duck sausage and broccoli rabe is a favorite but you can do no wrong with anything on the menu. For brunch, the zucchini frittata is perfectly portioned and scrumptious and the uova al forno is hearty and very tasty. Everything on the dessert menu is amazing. Â I think the prices are fair for each plate, (more on the pricey side if I have to choose) but it's hard to limit yourself to only one plate so it can get expensive pretty quickly but I think fully worth the food and dining experience. Ladies if you are taken here on a first (or in my case, second date), you know the man is serious and is a keeper ;)
