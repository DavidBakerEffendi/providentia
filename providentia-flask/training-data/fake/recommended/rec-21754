The food is SO incredibly delicious. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. For brunch, I had the Biscuits & Gravy with bechamel, ground Berkshire pork and Piment d'espellete. I'm from the Midwest and not used to B&Gs like this, but it was heavenly. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. My boyfriends loves the Chicken Sandwich- braised chicken, pickled Â veggies, farmstead cheese, agave-beer mustard on a pretzel bun. They have a wide selection of oysters as well and lovely wines. One of our favorite meals in all of NYC!
