A classic Village eatery and bar.  If you want a real New York Tavern with welcoming staff and consistently great food!  Pork chops to die for (go for the au Gratin potatoes).  Tin ceiling, brick walls and hardwood floors give this place the classic NY feel.   If you're in the West Village, check out Tavern on Jane.
