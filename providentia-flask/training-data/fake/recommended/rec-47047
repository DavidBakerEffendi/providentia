I just finished the Paesano sandwich and after wiping a little excess juice from my hands, I sat down to write this review about how much I enjoyed this place.  Then I fell asleep. These sandwiches don't look that large, but after the first bite you can tell from the flavor and high quality of ingredients, you'll be very full and very happy with every penny spent.  The portions are generous, the fillings were jam packed between the bread, but I could still taste the individual flavors of each. The down side is it was slightly messy, but really, is that a downside? Service was friendly and attentive.  It was basically bar seating, no tables, so don't bring a big group.
