I'm in love!  The food was delicious and the service was amazing!  The waiters made sure everything was okay, explained menu items to us, and even suggested how certain things should be eaten.  The restaurant looked neat, clean and the food seemed to be fresh.   I agree with the previous post that the garlic naan was delicious!  My friend and I both ordered chicken dishes (medium heat) and two appetizers.  Everything was tasty and I think we left the restuarant happier than when we arrived.  It was an all-around wonderful dining experience.  I'm planning to go back again this week.
