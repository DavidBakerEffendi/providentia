OH MY GOD!  Beware of the sauce.  When they say spicy, they mean SPICY!    I'm going to leave this review short and straight to the point, this is the only halal cart in NYC city worth going to.  Yes, the line is SUPER long and there are other carts nearby with shorter lines.  If you want to be a dummy, by all means, go to the other carts to avoid the line.  You can lie to yourself and believe that they all taste the same.  Well they don't, sorry to break it to you.  That's almost like saying, "all Asians are the same."   I will be back.  This time, however, I will not drown the my plate with extra sauce.  I had to drink 2 bottles of water and I was still dying.
