I base my review 90% on quality of food vs. overall experience. I visited Cuban Pete's last year and was not impressed being that I grew up on authentic Cuban food. I decided to give it a 2nd chance recently. Sadly, I was still not impressed. I ordered the Pollo Cubano and my boyfriend ordered the Ropa Vieja. Both dishes were not impressive at all to say the least. If you are interested in authethic Cuban food this is not the place. The atmosphere is fun and enjoyable. Besides the atmosphere I have nothing else positive to say.
