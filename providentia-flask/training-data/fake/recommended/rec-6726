Delicious veggie udon!!  Very friendly staff, too.  I asked if I could pay extra for adding tofu, and they threw it in no charge.   The only thing is that the food court has this looping elevator music that after about 10 minutes makes you want to jump out a window.  But it only makes me respect the Teriyaki Boy staff more.  Kudos, guys.
