Perfect for special occasions, but loud!  The Steak Tartare is amazing, as was everything else on the menu we tried! The food and service are superb. For light drinkers like us, the ability to buy quality ultra-dry champagne by the glass is bonus. My Fiancé (I proposed to her here) had the Mixed Field Greens salad followed by the Homemade Linguini; I had the Steak Tartare followed by the Duck Confit. Everything was fabulous. Initially I was brought the wrong duck dish (Duck Pie), which I started eating since, I didn't know there was more than one duck entree. But the attentive staff soon realized the mistake and replaced the dish. Surprisingly, it was even better than the Duck Confit! I was stunned that our waiter knew how to operate a big full-frame DSLR and was able to take a few excellent shots of the occasion. It seems like this restaurant, for good reason, is the site of many proposals. We're definitely going back, hopefully soon.
