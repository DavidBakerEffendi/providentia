My first visit to Paulie Gee's.  Pizza was great (King Harry), but I think I liked the space even better.  The rustic look/feel and terrific music selection make for a great atmosphere.  You can tell that a lot of time went into picking and laying out all the pieces.  My favorite item was the old school wash basin.  I will definitely be back.  Looking forward to their new location in Hampden (Bmore).
