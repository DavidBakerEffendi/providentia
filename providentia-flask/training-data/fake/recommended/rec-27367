I recently got delivery from Kyoto Sushi V and did my ordering online. It was very easy to order online and they called me to confirm the order. My food was delivered in 30 minutes or less. I received the correct order and I was pleased with the quality and size. I got a spicy tuna roll, spicy yellow-tail roll, and spicy salmon roll. All very good. They are also reasonably priced. My only (and very minor) complaint is that I requested extra soy sauce, and I got what I would get with a typical order. It didn't bother me much because I did end up having enough. I would definitely order from them again!
