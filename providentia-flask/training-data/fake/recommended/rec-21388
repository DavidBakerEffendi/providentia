Solid spot for breakfast. Got the sausage egg and cheese with blue cheese crumbles and it was really good. The staff was very accomodating for our party of 8 people- they actually asked a couple if they didn't mind moving to make room for all of us to sit together. The couple agreed and were comped free desserts, which I thought was very cool of the staff. I'll definitely come back if I'm in the area.
