I guess for Philly this is a choice but having lived elsewhere the prices are high unless you plan on eating before or afterward.  The food we had was very good but my main complaint was the server who rattled off all the specials and the prices (seemed weird- it isn't a diner, AKA "Flo") and when one of our dishes arrived he announced, "here is your $25 platter".....never had that happen..anywhere.  Also when he picked up signed check he opened it up at the table and said oh that's ok.  Good food weird service!  I think they need to up the quantity or lower the prices and get some ideas from Japanese Sushi places in other cities.  If you want a taste it's ok but for dinner not my choice. First time-last time!  I'll keep on going to Center City (15th Street)-that's a real Japanese restaurant.
