So I was in search of a to go Portuguese restaurant that makes some good chicken, rice and fries.  I drove by this place and noticed it just opened, because it looks very new.  There were many prior establishments here on a yearly basis.  I think firepitt is here for good.  I recommended this place to a lot of my fiends because the food is simply that good and priced reasonably.  I would have given this place a 5, but noticed they are not consistent with their service.  I think they know their food is that good so they could care less about their service.  I mostly always do pickup and noticed sometimes they include bread and hot sauce in my bag and sometimes they don't.  Also, a couple of times my chicken cutlets were very dry that it wasn't edible.  This doesn't happen often, but it did happen twice. Overall their food is very good, the fries are amazing and the rice is perfect.  I do like this place better than any Other Portuguese restaurant in my area due to a combination of food quality and affordability.
