Went here for dinner with my husband and aunt.  We had to wait a bit but it wasn't too bad, and the food was worth waiting for! Crispy crunchy fried calamari, baby shark, salmon, lemon potatoes - oh my!!!  The food was fresh and delicious.  We had coffee and the complimentary galactobouriko too - de-scrumptious!  I was surprised how reasonable our final bill was as well.  I highly recommend the Taverna!!
