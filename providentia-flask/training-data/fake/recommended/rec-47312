A NOTE TO THE OWNER:  This was our first time dining at EV. I have to say that we enjoyed the food...... but didn't appreciate the weak and unprofessional service from our waitress.  We arrived early in the evening, around 7:00, when the restaurant was about 20% full.  The staff spent most of their time hanging out at the entrance to the kitchen, avoiding eye contact with customers and chatting with one another.   We had drinks, appetizers, entree and desert.  All the food was excellently prepared but NOT once did our waitress stop by to ask if "everything was OK", "if we were enjoying our food", "if she could get us anything", etc.  They messed up one of our orders (for which she apologized and blamed the Kitchen's....again, a bit lame and unprofessional); however, what she couldn't grasp was that the problem could have been easily solved in seconds if she had bothered to check back with her customer's before they finished their meal.   I can't help but believe that there aren't bad employees, just bad managers.  My feeling is that our waitress simply didn't know what she was supposed to do, which is likely due to weak and/or absentee management.  On the evening we were their, the Owner was absent and the manager spent all his time with his back to the customers distracting his employees while he engaged in personal conversation with the wait staff.....
