Buster's is now open for dinner so...why are you reading this...? GO! This evening's sumptuous repast consisted of broiled snapper over quinoa with veggies. It was, as Buster's food always is, out of this world. There was a key lime pie for dessert that even I (who won't touch a dessert that doesn't start with "choco...") was knocked out by--killer graham cracker crust! There are too many Starbucks, Subways, and (Christ!) even a Domino's in this 'hood. Support local, homegrown, and GREAT spots like Buster's.
