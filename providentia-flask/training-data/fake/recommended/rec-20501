We're lucky to live close by, so this is our "go to" restaurant when we're too tired to cook. The Thai dumpling appetizers are a favorite of ours, my wife likes the Pad Thai Chicken, and there's always something interesting on the Specials board. The last special I had was Thai Paella, which is seafood paella with Thai spices. I love Spanish Valencian paella, and this was even better (except I wished I had some Red Sangria to go with it.)  The staff is always friendly and the service is very good ( never a long wait between courses .)  If alcohol were available I'd give this place a 5 star, being BYOB makes it a little less convenient as some planning is necessary ( and it's kind of hard to bring Sangria with you.) For the price you can't beat it! Update: The more we eat here the more we love it. Upgrading to 5 stars. FYI the Foodtown down the street has a very good selection of wine and beer, so a brisk walk (remember to cross at the crosswalks) will get you your drink of choice.
