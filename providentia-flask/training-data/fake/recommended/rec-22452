I dont pretend to be a sushi expert since i generally drown everything in wasabi, but i think Zento is a great little spot in Old City.  The inside is dimly lit,  has high ceilings and exposed brick walls making it a very good spot to bring a special someone.  Zento is BYOB and they also have a full bar.  There is no corkage fee during the week, but otherwise i believe its $10/bottle.   The waitress who helped us was very friendly and attentive.  They are also on restaurant.com so $25 coupons are available for around $5 which is great.  I'll definitely be back!
