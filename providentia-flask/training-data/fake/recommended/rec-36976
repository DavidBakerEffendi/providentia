In SoHo, I'm happy.  For at least a day.  And that is a lot.  (for me, these days).  Great coffee.  The wine list makes sense.   Bistro perfection.   Inspirational design.  Nice place for a memorable dinner.   I recommend the roasted beets and the Balthazar salad.  The waitpeople are helpful and kind.   I can't wait to visit next month, even if it's for work.  Spring Street, you are near urban-perfection, I miss you, some days.  And that is a lot, (for me, these days).
