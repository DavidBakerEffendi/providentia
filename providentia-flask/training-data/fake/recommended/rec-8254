This morning I was all up on that pastry case like a fat kid on cake. I started off at A Little Something Bakery in West Hartford (and got some treats), then headed for First and Last to see if they had any quick-selling cheese danish muffins left. Scored two! But even better, they had all kinds of tasty things I've never seen there before: ricotta croissants, cheddar chive scones, and ... (drumroll) ... cheese danishes with pumpkin puree on them. Yessss!!! I got 'em all. My most successful raid of the First and Last bakery case yet. At $2.25 each, all of those were reasonably priced, or even cheap-ish for the high quality. I will say that breakfast sandwiches (risen to $6.50 now!) and other things run pretty pricey. Occasionally painfully slow to get kitchen orders out (but usually pretty fast), and frequently not-great pastry selection (particularly as it gets later in the day -- but GREAT if you get there early enough). All in all, a place I've loved for years and look forward to every time I'm in town (but forgive them for disappointing every so often), and best to get there early.
