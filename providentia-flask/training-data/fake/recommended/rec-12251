This is an update. The beers are great and I love the themed nights. I was prompted to write an updated review after the Pork Roll Festival. It was a great event for the city. I loved the limited menu today and I hope you will add some of them to the everyday menu...especially the Porkrollita! My favorite dish now is the chicken salad. Paired very well with a tall glass of Pabst!
