So obviously I'm in the minority here.  I'm not saying it's a bad restaurant, but just like the 2 stars say I've just experienced better.  They do get a couple things right but overall just left me wanting more.   We'll start with what was right.  The staff was very friendly.  Lots of friendly smiles and very attentive.  Had the wings two ways which was fried well.  Crispy without being dry.  The soy garlic has a nice flavor while the other one was basically a well fried wing with some red pepper flakes which worked better than I expected.   But it's a ramen house so of course that's what you're there for and unfortunately that's where things went south. I had the ani ramen and added the egg and the flavored oils.  I will say that the noodles were done correctly and had good flavor, but that was the only thing that I found enjoyable.  The first bite of pork I had was cold which was remedied easily enough by pushing it into the broth but the real issue is that it just wasn't that flavorful.  When you compare it with Ramen houses like Ippudo in NY or Menya Sandaime in Fort Lee it just doesn't compare.  It's harder and blander.  The broth is OK, but nothing special.  The ambiance is nice and trendy but doesn't give you a ramen house feel.   Again, not a bad place, but there's definitely significantly better places out there.  If you've only had ramen at some japanese restaurants that don't specialize in it then this place might impress you, but if you've been to some of the better ramen houses it'll leave you disappointed, especially with all the high reviews.
