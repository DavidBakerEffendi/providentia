Love this place. My hubby and I had dinner here and the experience was great! Reminded me very much of an traditional Parisian restaurant with ambience and all. We didn't need a reservation, the manager (I believe he was the mgr) seated us right away. He was very friendly and accommodating. Our server was nice and attentive as well. The restaurant is small and quaint, just like a traditional French restaurant in Paris. Atmosphere is warm and homey with classic pictures on white walls and candles lit on tables. It's romantic but you can easily go with friends as well. I had the pan seared half chicken. It was absolutely delicious! A great recommend. I had a glass of silky Bordeaux that paired well with my meal. My hubby had roasted salmon which was devine. It was more on the lighter side which was perfect and was exactly what he was looking for. I definitely will be back to try the steak frites and dessert (we didn't have room) when I visit NYC again. They looked amazing! I absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious French cuisine with great ambiance! Yum yum
