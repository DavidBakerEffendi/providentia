The food was excellent and the place is lovely. the only reason for 4 versus 5 stars is that we arrived a few minutes before they opened at 11:00am and they left us hanging for a while instead of seating us and they kind of forgot about us, so we had to go back up to the hostess and ask her to seat us.
