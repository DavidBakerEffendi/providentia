My family and I had our New Years Eve dinner at this lovely inn. From making the reservation to leaving after dinner this place was remarkable. When I called on the 30th to reconfirm our reservation I found that the message for our reservation was cut short by their answering machine and although there was this mishap they were happy to have us as their guests. Thus the beginning of a wonderful experience with the owners of The Inn at Weathersfield. Â  We were running late due to the weather and we called to tell them we would be there in 10 minutes, their only concern was for our safety. Driving down the long driveway into the property, the inn looked the epitome of a New England wonderland. Walking through the entrance there was the warmth and fragrance of the fires in the hearths giving a cosy and homey ambience. It took a few minutes before someone addressed us, but the reception area was so charming we looked around until a lovely woman walked through the dining room to great us. The prix fixe menu was exactly the one that you would hope to be created to celebrate New Year's Eve - exceptional - and the service efficient and comfortable without being intrusive. Piano music wafting though the room added to the remarkable atmosphere. After our pleasurable dinner we walked into the other dining area to enjoy the art, furnishings and character of the room. A gentleman approached us and asked if we had visited before and after finding it was our first visit he escorted us downstairs to view the Chef's Table in the wine cellar. A handsome room to enjoy a momentous, private dining experience with friends and family. The warmth and friendliness of this inn's management needs to be noted. We will return to stay on our next visit to the Okemo area to enjoy either the summer or winter activities in Vermont.
