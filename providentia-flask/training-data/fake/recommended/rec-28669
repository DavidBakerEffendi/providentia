the food is pretty good. the portions are very tiny and the food is overpriced for what you're getting. for example, the microscopic eggplant appetizer for $8 was good but not worth the price. my very pricey $29 fish entree had nicely cooked fish, but was also small and served with cold polenta. if you're in the mood for middle eastern, i'd skip this place and go to cafe mogador instead (which is better priced and consistently delicious).
