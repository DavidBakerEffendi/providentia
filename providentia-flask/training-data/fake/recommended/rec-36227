I live far, far away from New York City and the deliciousness that is Balthazar, but honestly, I've talked more people into eating there than I have many of the places in my hometown of Austin, Texas, and here's why: They boast a beautiful, well-stocked bar with what I feel are reasonable prices. And their bartender staff is professional and quick, and their drinks are excellently made. Their menu is delectable. Favorite dish? WIthout question: The Carmelized Onion Goat Cheese Tart (my stomach is growling just thinking about it). Creamy and delicious, with Â just a slight twang? I could eat this appetizer as my main course without issue. Other high notes from the menu: The mussels (as someone who was not previously a fan of shellfish, this dish was the turning point for me), the steak tartar (perfectly spiced, absolutely fresh, and amazing). Sure, it gets stupidly busy, and I've had to get reservations for dinner at 10PM once, but, as a foodie, Balthazar is my food heaven away from home, and it's never failed to impress me. I count it among my favorite restaurants, period.
