Work nearby so me and my co-workers come here every so often.    Senoritas serves your standard fare and has good lunch specials (Chips and salsa, entree, sopapillas, and a drink for $7!).  The service is usually pretty attentive and they are always friendly. As an overall mexican restaurant, it is an average (or maybe slightly above average) joint.  But compared to all the sh*tty places in the wonderful town of Bloomfield, it is one of the best in the area!
