Stay away unless you like paying way to much for fair food and not much of it.  I got the fish and chips and it was the most expensive plate of fries I have every paid for at $24.  Yes, I said fries because it came with just e tiny strips of friend white fish.  I was truly shocked and in awe at the three tiny pieces of fish.  I ate it in pain, which was my fault, but they did leave me with a comment card so I saw that as an open door and I let them have it.  I had heard good things about this place from my hotel and walked out truly in disappointment....told the hotel staff and they said they would rethink the recommendation.  My friend had the fried chicken and waffles...said it was OK but would have been happier with KFC and would have cost a third of the price.  This place is overhiped and appears to be a place for hipsters to gather.
