My husband and I were fortunate to experience Brooklyn Crab about a month ago. we couldn't have enjoyed it more! we had two different orders of crab which were good along with creative cocktails. The playful casual ambience on all three levels and friendly and helpful waitstaff really made the difference for us. and it didn't hurt that it's right next door to Fairway. we're looking forward to going back.
