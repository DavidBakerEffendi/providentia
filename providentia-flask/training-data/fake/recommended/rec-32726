Love Mooyah!  It's like Five Guys, but stepped up a notch. The burgers are good (I get a single rather than a double and it's more than enough).  The freestyle Coke machine and the milkshakes are a great addition.  Now they also offer combos, so you don't have to get the ginormous order of fries, you can get a slightly smaller batch on your tray with your burger.   Negatives - I cannot seem to get them to put enough lettuce or pickles on the burger - ever!!  Last time I went I actually went so far as to request double lettuce and double pickles.  I got 2 pickles and a sparse bit of white lettuce.  Not so great.  I like the burger without it but they would be at 4 stars if they actually made it the way I ordered it. The location is convenient and the dining room is large.  The staff is always friendly and the food comes out quick.  If you sign up for text alerts you get notified of specials like Mooyah for Twoyah Tuesdays where you can buy one burger and get one free. I hope they expand with more locations.  I like it better than Five Guys, but have a Five Guys close by in Middletown and don't always want to drive 20 minutes for a fast food burger.  It's great when you're in the neighborhood though.
