OK...I want to be honest and give a helpful review. I LOVE HH! But---if you want a 5 star experience there are a few things you need to do: 1. BRING CASH! 2. Don't go there for a sandwich you can get any any other subshop, that's not what they do best! 3. Go for one of the HH crazy concoction subs, but read what is on it. Customize yours. (Ex: I get the Wake Up Call without Pork Roll[never been a fan]and ketchup instead of hot sauce) 4. Don't be afraid of the queue, they know how to get you out the door quickly. Pick out your beverage while you are waiting, as they have quite an impressive selection! 5. You can step to the side after giving your order, maybe even pay at the register, but don't wander far, as you will be asked what condiments you would like on your sub. 6. Enjoy an out of the ordinary taste treat...we are not talking gourmet food by any stretch, but this is THE place for late night, cheap eats. That's the niche they have carved, and they do it best. Where else in Princeton are you going to get fried eggs with your bacon cheesesteak/burger? It's a taste like no other, and if it is for you, you will be craving it at least once a month! So, please don't go and order a chicken, eggplant or meatball parm, and then give the place 3 stars because it didn't live up to the hype. The other subs are all edible and very worth the money (A whole 12" Eggplant Parm for $6?? C'mon!) ***If you don't get the first sub choice right, come back one more time and try something different!!***
