So my meal here was actually excellent and I'm not really sure why there are so many negative reviews. I can only assume that Heirloom must be fairly hit and miss, which for this price is obviously hugely frustrating. Consequently, I'm holding off on a more extensive review until I manage to go one or two more times and get a sense for this restaurant's consistency. That might be a while because Heirloom is pretty pricey. In fact, my main/only complaint based on the one meal I've had so far would be that the food is a bit overpriced for fairly conventional (if very well-prepared) contemporary American selections, by New Haven standards anyway. Anyway, price aside, the one meal I've had here so far was fantastic and I was thinking about my plate for days. We started out with the Roast Octopus appetizer ("lots of garlic, chilies & lime, oregano citronette") which was very flavorful and chewy. For entrees, Bella Farms Duck Breast ("charred artichokes, porcini, pearl onions, salsa verde & a fried duck egg") and the Whole Roasted Branzino ("lime, mint, oregano, sea salt & pesto pantesco"). The duck breast was excellent! A++. My dining partner kept on stealing bites. Desserts on the neighboring table looked good, but I'm not a huge dessert person so I didn't try any. Drinks I've had here have been moderately strong. Date didn't like his drink but I can't recall what it was (guess it must not have been memorable), but I've liked mine for the most part. I had a pretty good Negroni once and all the wine I've ordered has been fabulous. I recently ordered some fancy-looking cocktail that from the ingredients list I expected to be exciting but that turned out to be basically just a gin martini though. Ambiance is great, service is great, love the commitment to local/organic ingredients. 4.5 stars.
