Great place! I really enjoyed myself here. Started out by the bar for a few drinks and it was a good time. Cool, hip scene atmosphere. I was thinking maybe we should have eaten at the bar but we ended up going to a table. Tables were tight but they make up for it with food. Very good, started out with the Burrata (Fantastic!!!!) and fried zucchini. Â Then I went on to pan roast cod which really hit the spot. Everything was just so fresh, you really tasted it. Finished the night with a pistachio dessert which was incredible!!! Definitely a place to try if on the west side.
