The food is tasty enough (even if overly buttered, especially the grits had way too much). It wasn't anything you couldn't get at the many other chicken and barbecue places across the city, without the trek into Bed-Stuy. The location is very small and they've crammed more tables than it is supposed to hold. Not only is this annoying as you have to get up from your table and pull it out for people to pass, but it's probably a fire hazard and they should be fined by the fire marshall. I witnessed them seat two fat women at a tiny table crammed against another table and sticking into the aisle, and one of the women only had half a bench seat to sit on (the bench was obviously designed to hold one less person so there would be space to, say, breathe. The wait staff made no apologies for the accommodations, so either they don't notice, don't care, or just don't understand the rules of actual southern hospitality. Funny for a place serving southern food.
