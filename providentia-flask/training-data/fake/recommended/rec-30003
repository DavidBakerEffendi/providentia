3* for the decor 4* for the service 4* for the food 2* for the value Blue Point has a good atmosphere. It's cosy, and not too fancy. The fish varies from acceptable to excellent. I had the cod, which was great; my wife had a filet of chilean sea bass, which was also great. My mom-in-law had battered trout, which was just OK. I'd say the fish is definitely good quality, but there isn't a huge amount of imagination put in to making the dishes really memorable.The main issue is the price: you are looking at paying $22 - $40 per fish and one potato, plus extra for sides. It adds up quickly, but it's a BYOB, so you can save a little money there. Early reservations definitely recommended.
