How nice to find a friendly place to stop and have breakfast when you are traveling away from home. My wife and I were traveling through and found your restaurant by chance. How nice to stop in at a local venue and not feel like the outsiders. Of course, we are the outsiders, but we never felt that way as we chatted with Carrie and everyone else in the restaurant. We both ordered breakfasts and --- farm eggs, great; the breads (toast) thick, fresh; bacon, thicker sliced and better than the city; homefries, not sure what they seasoned them with, but they were great; coffee, kept being refilled without asking. If this place was nearby, we could skip our usual stops and go here for breakfasts. Thanks! We'll stop in again!
