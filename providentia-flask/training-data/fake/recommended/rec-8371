I love their food. I had mango chicken with brown rice. This is definitely going to be my staple order. This was absolutely delicious. I also had the chicken nuggets everyone was raving about. It is soooooo good. It tastes like actual chicken. The sauce was great. Delivery was under 15 minutes. If I can cook this stuff at home, I would b a permanent vegeterian. I wonder how many calories I induced today???
