I brought my friend here for his birthday dinner. we walked in around 6PM on a Saturday night. There were four people seated at the big bar area in the front and perhaps five tables seated in Â the large rear dinning room, otherwise it was EMPTY. The hostesses were juvenile and rude. They asked if we had reservations and I said no but if they could possibly fit us in. They were unfriendly and curt, telling us they were booked up completely. I said it's not that busy now are you sure something could not be managed; and they said no all booked up. The place was more than half empty and the way we were handled was so unprofessional and full of attitude. No attempt to be accommodating or remotely polite. I have been to Japan and this is not at all the way customers are treated, anywhere. So sad that they feel they can get away with that because their food is lovely.
