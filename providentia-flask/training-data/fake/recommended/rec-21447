The space is very cozy and intimate. I really dig the open kitchen and ambiance of the restaurant. I met up with an old friend on Monday night for a 7:30 reservation, and the dining room was completely full when we arrived. We started with a bottle of the Pinot Noir, which was good but a touch too heavy for my preference. For appetizers, we got the fried bay oysters. The oysters were a little heavily breaded and fried a little too long and took away from the soft texture in the middle. The flavors of the rest of the dish were good though, especially the pickled mustard seed. For entrees, we got the lobster roe spaghetti alla chitarra after hearing good things about it. While the pasta was perfectly cooked and the spicy tomato sauce was perfect, the capers/olives/seasoning made the dish so salty we couldn't finish it. Such a disappointment. I got the fried chicken sandwich, which was juicy and delicious, though I could've done without the toast. My friend got the short rib, which was also a little overly salted but still good. My friend and I hadn't seen each other in about 5-6 years, so we had a lot to catch up on. As it got closer to 10 p.m., the diners started filing out and no new ones were being seated. Most restaurants stop seating around closing time, but I guess they don't here. That made it kind of awkward for us as we were the only ones left at 9:30, even though I don't think a 2 hour dinner is extraordinarily long. Perhaps it was a Monday thing. The wait staff was really kind though and still offered us dessert at the end of our meal, and they did not rush us in any way. The menu is a little limited, and so many of the items we got were overly salted, which is a pet peeve of mine, so I'm not sure that I would return soon.
