I've been here for dinner twice. Everything is delicious. Things that sound pretentious ("pomegranate vinaigrette" on the leek tart) turn out to be sincere revelations (intense red garnets of juice and flavor). It is a safe place to take a well-heeled, picky vegetarian guest. Â Servers were really nice too. One star off because last time I was here, their bathroom backed up as I was leaving and the smell was horrible.
