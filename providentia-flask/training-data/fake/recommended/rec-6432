I have been to Pylos 3 or 4 times now and it never fails to disappoint on any level. The food is absolutely fantastic, the service is always top notch, and the ambiance is warm and cozy. I always enjoy the Moussaka as an appetizer and any of their bone-in meals are amazing. Low and slow and fall right off the bone. I was their recently on a Sunday night with my brother. We got there late at 1015 and they still seated us happily, but let us know the kitchen would close at 11. While I have been to other places that get slightly annoyed if you are pushing their closing time, our server was delightful, and gave us some excellent wine recommendations as neither of us new too much about Greek wines. I could go on and on but again, Pylos is always solid and never disappoints.
