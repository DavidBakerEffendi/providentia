I stopped by last night with my buddy Bob. First time since I had that delicious takeout burger back in November. Two Issues: 1. It took WAY TOO LONG for a server to acknowledge us at our table. Geez... Wtf? 2. When the server set down glasses of water, his hands were wrapped around the tops of the glasses instead of the middle. That reflects poor training and bad management. What the hell? You're bussing tables, touching peoples' dirty plates, etc, then handing us drinks with your hands on the tops of our glasses? Don't you all care that your guests not get sick? I'll take a guess the answer is "no." This is basic Waiting On Tables 101. I expect much better. The burger was tasty. I didn't get high off this one. (Maybe that only happens once?) Some of the wow factor was gone this time. Not sure why...
