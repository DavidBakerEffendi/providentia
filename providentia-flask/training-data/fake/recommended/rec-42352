I've been here once before for brunch and once for dinner more recently.  I have to say it did not disappoint.  It may be a little on the pricey side, but for the excellent service and food that was executed and presented well... it's worth it.  It's a cute date place, although you should try to make reservations ahead of time (fairly small space).  For dinner, we ordered the lobster appetizer, which was perfectly cooked.  I had the veal entree and K had the pork with black beans.  They were both pretty good, but not mind-blowing (hence only the four star rating).  Their chocolate souffle was oozing with delicious gooeyness.  It is definitely a must-have for chocolate lovers.   Side note:  Their white bread is amazing.  Almost cake-like.  The buttery spreads that came with the bread were a nice touch.  (1. apricot/lentil spread 2. french butter spread 3. blue cheese spread)  I usually only have one piece of bread before a meal, but I had THREE whole pieces!  It was just that good.
