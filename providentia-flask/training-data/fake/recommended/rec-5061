I tried, twice, to like this place. The first time was within a week of opening - they were out of items on the menu (brisket), the service was poor, and the wine had a strange flavor. I decided that I would give it another shot today, since it was a great day to sit outside in the sun...bad choice. I can't speak to the food quality or quantity as we were seated, given menus, and not spoken to again. We sat for 15 minutes just waiting...for water, or silverware, or someone to take our drink order...nothing! Â Note that this was 130pm on a Tuesday, and there were probably only 15-20 other patrons dining. After being ignored, we walked out. I'm done with this place...there are way too many delicious options within a few blocks.
