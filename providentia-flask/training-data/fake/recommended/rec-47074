Just had a superb saturday-morning breakfast at Sabrinas--we try to go to one of the great breakfast places near us each weekend--and this weekend was Sabrinas, and, super as always!!! I had the Barking Chihuaha breakfast burrito, and my fiancee had an egg-white omelette with spinach, goat cheese, carmelized pears, carmelized leeks--something called the "90 day celebrity diet' omelette off the breakfast menu--both were tremendous!! We got there at 8:30, and there were still several tables available inside and outside--by the time we left at 9:15 the inside was full.   Service was wonderful, our server was quick, funny, and kept us full on coffee!  Was great!!!!!
