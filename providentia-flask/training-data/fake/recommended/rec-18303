Great food, great drinks, and friendly staff. Prices were fair for what we got and the portion sizes were great too. Â The menu is simple and not overly complicated, but has enough to keep everyone happy. It took me 6 months of living a block away to try this place and I feel like an idiot for not going sooner. Stop in if you're around you won't be disappointed.
