Great concept and execution! The food tastes very authentic even though many ingredients are not traditional indian ingredients (arugula, avocado, jack cheese!). Their dosas (especially chilly chees dosa and premium masala dosa) are excellent, Sambhar is very good, samosas are very much like homemade samosas I grew up with. Overall, very impressed. Now they have missed some of the ingredients once or twice e.g. the smoked paneer roll didn't have paneer, so they are not perfect, but still they deserver 4-4.5 stars overall.
