The food here is GREAT but the 45-60 minute wait for the table coupled with the unfriendly staff and mismanagement of logistics can turn you off. You should also be prepared to spend $75-$100 per head. Not bad by Manhattan standards but this is Astoria. It's the most popular place in the neighborhood so they can pretty much charge whatever they want. If there's no line, go for it. If there is one and you are hungry pass because you will be grumpy by the time you sit down.
