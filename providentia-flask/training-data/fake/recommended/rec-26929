I'm really surprised there are only 5 reviews for this place given how long it's been around.  This place is fantastic.  Wife and I went here last weekend, which was the first really warm weekend of the year.  All the tables outside were taken, but there was space inside. I had the crepe with steak, mushrooms, and spinach - it was really good.  Wife had a crepe with chicken, mozarella, red pepper, and mushrooms - it was ok as the chicken was a bit dry.  We then shared a crepe with berries, which was great. The waitress was very attentive, though I think it's because the food takes a long time to get to the table, and she distracts you from thinking about the time between ordering and eating. I gave the place 4-stars because despite it being fantastic, I reserve 5-stars for the truly awesome experiences.  It might not be fair to a place like Bonjour Montclair, but 4-stars is still a strong review.
