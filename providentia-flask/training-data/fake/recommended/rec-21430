Wandered in after catching a movie in Union Square to a very crowded bar. The tables in the back were packed and people were standing around in huge winter coats getting in the servers' way. The vibe was really relaxed and cool but really it was cramped in there. I wondered if it was worth it to wait around for a table, but boy am I glad I did. The food here is really high quality, can eat every day kind of food. I went with a southern theme for my dinner, ordering the buttermilk fried chicken served with a corn muffin and a spinach and pear salad with almonds. I also ordered a side of the buttermilk biscuits because I wanted a biscuit with my chicken. The chicken was really crunchy outside, really well cooked and juicy inside. You get two pieces: one breast and one thigh/drumstick, but both were so meaty I couldn't finish it all. The salad was a perfect, light accompaniment to the chicken and the corn muffin was buttery and not dry at all. I'm so glad I ordered my side of biscuit because it came with a special butter: cherries, brandy, and sage butter. I had no idea those three ingredients mixed in butter would yield such a delicious spread, but it was so yummy I would go back just to taste that again. Husband ordered the gnocchi with brussel sprouts, chestnuts, with a balsamic sauce. He loved it but I thought it was just okay because the balsamic overpowered the gnocchi for me. We ordered the peanut brittle to go but I haven't tried this yet. Will report back. Really good, fresh food that is made well. Can't wait to go back to try other dishes. Oh but we didn't get any cookies to go...will make sure to ask for it next time.
