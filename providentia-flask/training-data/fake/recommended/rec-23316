Little Fish proves the old adage that smaller is better. A friend and I had dinner here on a weeknight. The food was great, and the intimate space was charming. For you foodies, the kitchen is right there in the (small) dining room. I am still dreaming about the king crab in sweet-sour broth and the ginger pot de creme with kumquat marmalade. Highly recommended!
