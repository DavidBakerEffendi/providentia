Wow.  What more can you say.  This is Colicchio's shining star.  I have done the Craft restaurants many times, and they are good, but this place is great, mostly due to Chef Sisha Ortuzar. Food was excellent.  In my opinion, currently the best in the city. Keep in mind the place is a little out of the way, but worth the trip.  For pasta we tried the squid ink chitarra and mascarpone ravioli, if these do not give you a foodie head-rush from the flavor explosions, I don't know what will.  Simply two of the best pasta dishes I have had.  We also tried the flatiron steak, which was really good, it is steak so you either cook it right or you do not, and for this cut is was great.  However it was the brisket cake that they served with this, that was the highlight, again flavor explosion head-rush.  For dessert we had the beignets, these were good, but should have additional dipping sauces.  We also had the black forest sundae which was very good.  Will definitely be back.
