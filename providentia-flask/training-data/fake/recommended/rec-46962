Best seafood spot in the city. Went to RW last week and had a phenomenal meal. Sampled a couple a oysters on the half, new england clam chowder (the white), clams casino, and the calamari...  everything fresh and gimmick-free... nothing pretentious.. who needs the whole dog and pony show?  just good chit. for the entree I went with the lobster roll, and it more than lived up to the billing... just do it... it'll blow ur hair back
