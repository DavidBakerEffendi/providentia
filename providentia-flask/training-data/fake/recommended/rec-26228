Very quiet Monday night in here which made it for a cozy dinner for me and my girlfriend.  The waiter was super attentive and friendly.  The food here is a hit.  My pork with ensalada brought back memories of  my recent trip to Chile.  The raw oysters and fish tacos were the perfect appetizers.  My girlfriend ordered the special drink with beer and chili paste but didn't like it.  Fortunately, the waiter took it off the bill and gave us complimentary dessert.  Because the waiter knew how to treat customers, I will definitely come back here.
