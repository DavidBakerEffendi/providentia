Yet another brunch review.  First time here.  Thought it was very good value and very interesting menu.  Three of us went.  This place used to be highly ignorable, but now is very upscale looking with very fair prices for ALL meals.  And 24-hour service.  I would give five stars except waitress never came back to ask "how's everything".  Duck burger, chicken panko sandwich and crabcake benedict..., ALL GREAT!  Those who gave two stars or less, get a grip.   Owner needs to wake up his staff a bit, but all was well in the end.
