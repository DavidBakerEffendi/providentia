I have been here before and the food was good, but the service has always been subpar.  Last night I was craving some Japanese bar food and being from the Financial District where there isn't any, I decided to come here since it's close to where I'm working.   We got sat and received no menus for the first 10 minutes and no server came to greet us.  I finally got the hostess's attention and she found us a menu, saying that they're low on menus.  We decided on what to eat and sat waiting for our server to ask us for our drink and food order for another 10 minutes.  I finally got the attention of a server and he came and took our order.   We ordered a variety of food, including sashimi, squid, udon, tofu, clams, and some skewers. After he took our order, another group got sat next to us.  The sashimi came after 5 or 10 minutes.  The squid came after another 10 minutes after the sashimi. Then nothing came after that.  The other group in the meantime got all their dishes.  They ordered after our sashimi came.  I asked a server why our food was not coming out since our server was nowhere to be found.  I was starving and we have already been waiting for 35-40 mintues.  She went back to check and said some bs excuse like our food took longer to cook than the other group's.  I asked her why our tofu and noodle took longer to cook than their tofu and noodle dishes.  She couldn't give me a good answer.   Within 10 minutes of complaining, all our food came out.  I think they forgot our order.  I was starving and ate everything even though the food was okay, not great.  I got very nauseous after eating the food.  My boyfriend's stomach wasn't feeling very good either.  I could only assume it's because the cooking of the food was rushed and the meat was undercooked.  The grilled clams were pretty raw.  I didn't wait 50 minutes to get served undercooked food.  I was very disappointed and am never going back there.
