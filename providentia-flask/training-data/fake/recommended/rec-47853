This review is for Bru Room, not the nightclub or bar area.   This is my first stop anytime I end up in New Haven.  The red pie is great, and the white mashed is always ordered.  The salad is a great way to start the meal and I use it as the basis of the salad I make at home.   I will not compare it to other high quality New Haven places because when you live in Texas, any of them would be places you would beg to have the chance and eat.   The beer is fine, nothing ever too interesting, but it serves to the masses.
