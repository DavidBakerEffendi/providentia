This place was great! We were seated right at our reservation time, 9pm. Our waitress was very helpful as we attempted to understand the various food items. I ordered the arak and fresh meadow (i think this is what it was - gin, st. germain, cucumber, and mint). Both were delicious and highly recommended. Get the arak only if you like anise (liquorice, sambuca, absinthe). We get many dishes to enjoy our meal tapas style: Brussel sprouts - very good, brussel sprouts and walnuts go well together Falafel - some of the best falafel i've ever had Jalpeno "Hommus" - easily the best hummus I've ever had, creamy and flavorful Mouhamara - delicious flavors, again highly recommended Melted Haloumi - amazing haloumi, creamy, not too salty, and perfectly melted Warm Eggplants - slightly sweet, slightly savory, slightly crispy, slightly chewy, all delicious Semolina Gnocci - gnocci was very good and the sauce was light, airy, and creamy at the same time Lamb Shank Makloubeh - it was cooked very well, but we thought the flavors weren't amazing. We wish we'd ordered the lamb kebab instead Overall, the food was excellent. Although the ambiance and noise level were awesome, I found the seats rather uncomfortable and the table small (a drink was even spilled because we were cramped). These were both major negatives for me. Other than that, I highly recommend this place!
