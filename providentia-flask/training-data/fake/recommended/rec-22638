If waiting 1/2 hour & overpaying for average pizza served by kidults with beards and too many meaningless tattoos who are failed suburban garage rock band members or talentless play-doh sculptors is your idea of a good time - then jump on the hipster train (L) and head on down to Robertas gentrification pizza parlor. It's a place where you'll hear nasal-toned "like,yah" 's all day and night out of the mouths of the kewlest parentally supported transplants on earth. But there is a dress code: Converse all-stars, ski hat and scarf (summer only), paint stained Mr Rogers sweaters (to show youre an artist), and jeans so tight that your nuts fuse into one. Oh, one last thing: The Beard Hair & Cigarette Ash Pizza is to die for - only $14.00!!! That's a scoreeee dayuuuuuude! Wash it down with a locally crafted microbrew made in a Bushwick loft by a 35 year old boy with a $100,000 liberal arts degree who works as a barista.
