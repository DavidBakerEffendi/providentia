I came in here half expecting this place to be over-hyped, but i was proven to be SO WRONG. The blueberry pancakes with maple butter will seriously change your life! The pancakes were served piping hot, and had the perfect fluff and consistency. The maple butter really makes the entire thing ridiculously amazing. I mean, I don't even really love pancakes that much, nor do I like blueberry in my pancakes, but it was really probably one of the best things I ate in NY. I was really stuffed about half way through my stack, but i finished it all anyways because I just couldn't get enough! I also had the sugar-cured bacon, and that was also crispy and delicious. The pancakes were the star of the show though. I was lucky to visit during the weekday, so the wait was nothing terrible. Absolute MUST eat in NY! [Cash Only!]
