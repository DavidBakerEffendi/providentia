A great Chinese joint in West Hartford. I would suggest picking up or getting delivery despite a few tables insides. Very easy ordering and a friendly staff. Black Bamboo does a great job with their meat selections and flavors. The way they cook their meals keeps the food from being too greasy or making you regret your decision to order Chinese!
