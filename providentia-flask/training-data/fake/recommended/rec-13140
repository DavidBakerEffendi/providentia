what a cute store and fab food. i was visiting my sister in ny and we did a falafel taste test between here and Mamoun. Taim is more expensive but worth it. We got the falafel platter and side of fried eggplant. the falafel platter was A LOT of food. They were nice and let us sub out one of them for the special. We got the green, spicy, and beets. All three flavors were really good. we also subbed out for the baba ganoush which was not overly roasted which i don't like. the fried eggplant was a bit over oily but otherwise tasted really good as well. it was just the right level of tenderness. wil be back next time i visit.
