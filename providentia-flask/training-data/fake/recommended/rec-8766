The food is here good, not great, and our server rushed us throughout the night. The cozy decor is a nice touch, but I have found most of the dishes here to be underwhelming for its Williamsburg hype. The mac and cheese is decent (DuMont's is better), and the fried pig tails tasted like deep fried chicken fingers you find at a sports bar. Impress your out-of-town guests by going elsewhere for dinner.
