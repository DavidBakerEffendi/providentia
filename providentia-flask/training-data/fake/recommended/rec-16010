I live a few blocks from this spot, what can I say there are more Thai restaurants in my neighborhood than Thailand itself.  At least this one isn't called YUM YUM YUM 3 or something. Anyway, I really like the decor of this restaurant, it reminds me of Qi.  We had a party of 6 and we were seated right away.  We ordered 3 appetizers, 2 bottles of wine, cocktails and main dishes and the bill was definitely very affordable.   I enjoyed the curry puffs.  The dumplings were mediocre and the chicken satay was a little bland for me.  I got pad kee mao with chicken.  The chicken to noodle ratio was surprisingly good.  I could actually find pieces of chicken and they were large.   However, a girl in our party found her wine glass to smell like dish soap and we promptly notified our waiter, he made a weird face and then returned with new glasses/new wine.   I actually wasn't drinking because I was recovering from a nasty cold but I probably wouldn't have minded the soapy wine lol.
