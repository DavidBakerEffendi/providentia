the most absurd sandwiches you will ever encounter.  and i mean that in the best way possible.  these babies are crafted with care and it shows. i've never been during lunch, so i can't vouch for the service then, but otherwise the staff is fantastic, very sweet and chatty.  in fact, just yesterday, while waiting for my turkey reuben, i had the pleasure of learning about the 2 different sides of the aluminum foil they use to wrap  the sammies in.  go to koch's, you may just learn something.
