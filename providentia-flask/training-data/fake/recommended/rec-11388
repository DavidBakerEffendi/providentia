Sabrina's Cafe is a staple which I take all those who come to visit. The atmosphere is comfortable and laid back. Filled with vibrant colors and a charming staff, it is nearly impossible not to fall head over heals for this place. Although the french toast is one for the books, the build-your-own omelette has to be my favorite. Instead of the yummy home fries, I love to substitute the sweet potato french fries (which are sprinkled with powdered sugar!). Everything I have ever had here is amazing, even down to the bread (which comes from LeBus bakery). The overall quirkiness of this location is what supplies makes it. Right down to the individually different coffee mugs.
