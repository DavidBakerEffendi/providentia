This place was absolutely fantastic. I've been really into going out to brunch each Sunday and trying out new places, and this one had been on my list. It was real busy, but the staff is so quick and friendly they made sure we were all seated as soon as possible and offered everyone drinks while we were waiting.  My girlfriend and I got a seat straight away at the window and our server was great.  He was extremely nice even though he obviously had a million things to do.  I got the special, a sort of western omelet with onions, jalapenos, tomatoes, and some other zesty goodies with a side of AMAZING potato fries and ketchup.  My girlfriend got the bacon stack:  toasted country white bread topped with bacon, tomato, arugula, sunny side up eggs and pecorino romano.  Both were so delicious.  We ate all of it.  the prices are so reasonable too, it's great if you're on a budget.   I also hear their milkshakes are the best.  Can't wait to try!
