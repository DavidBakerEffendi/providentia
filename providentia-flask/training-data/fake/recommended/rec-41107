Living in Brooklyn for 5 years has really made me particular when it comes to Caribbean cuisine.  Recently I've moved to NJ and I wanted to find a good spot.  I've been to this place a few times now and I must say it's pretty darn good.  Curry goat is my favorite dish and is what I usually order.  The give good portions and the curry has a little kick to it.  However I have also tried the curry and jerk chicken.  Overall I like the curry better than the jerk.  The jerk just wasn't spicy enough and the pieces weren't very meaty.   Quick tip:  The service takes a while which is why I usually call it in.
