A delightful fun place to have Sunday Brunch.  Food is all freshly prepared and delicious.  Be sure to make reservations ahead of time, or you may not get in.   Great place for a first date, blind date, anniversary, etc.   Dining at Baba Olga's is an experience.  Yes, the food is delicious, but the atmosphere is also interesting and unique.  I would say it to be a relaxed adult environment.  This is not a place for kids, unless well behaved.  If you have loud and/or unruly children, or you don't want to keep an eye on them, please do us all a favor and leave them at home or take them to the park where they'd probably rather be.
