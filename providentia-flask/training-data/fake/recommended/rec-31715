I loved the place..the atmosphere was great, the music low enough so you can have a concersation; the prices reasonable; the service impeccable.  My friend and I started with the Caribbean salad; fresh, cold, excellent followed by the Mambo Tilapia with a side of Casavva..fantastic.  We then had the Guava dessert with one of the special teas.  If we had consumed alcohol we would have paid over $55 a person, here with our BYOB Wine it was quite reasonable for two people and we had a fantastic time.  Would recommend to everyone.
