We used to live steps away from this lovely little gem, the best ever margaritas with so many choices, yummy food, good service, reasonable prices, cool happy hour, Christmas lights anytime of the year, whats not to love.... I visit Southern California very often & the margaritas here blow the rest away. I bring my out of town friends here & they love it too!
