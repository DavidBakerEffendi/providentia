Good food although I'm not sure it's worth the wait on a weekend. I went for brunch on a Sunday and the place was understaffed and somewhat inattentive. Food itself was decent, I got the shrimp and grits and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. Thick cut bacon is also delicious. The space itself is pretty in the front but I wouldn't call the seating particularly comfortable at the back.
