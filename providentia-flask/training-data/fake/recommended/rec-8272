Went here for restaurant week with an 8-top and should have known better. We were put at the worst table in the restaurant and were largely ignored for our two hour lunch. The food was mediocre and much of it looked like it had been prepared for children. We were waited on by Melissa who was nice enough but did not seem to have any experience waiting tables (she admitted to having "forgotten" about drink orders). We should have known they would be auto-gratting the tip at 18% because there were serious discussions of it being well below that. Will never go back to Pacifico regardless of it being restaurant week. On top of it all they would only allow us to pay using 4 cards (I thought this was America?) and seemed upset at us for attending their restaurant week lunch. Despite being in good company and keeping things light, tempers were flaring by the end of the meal. Easily the worst lunch ever. The only saving grace was the passion fruit sorbet, which was very flavorful (too flavorful for some in our party to handle).
