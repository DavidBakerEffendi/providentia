Anytime someone visits from out of town we try to take them here. The guacamole is awesome and they have some great drinks . The only drawback is it is almost ALWAYS crowded and you end up at the bar...if you can find standing room . But at least there is a rotating bicycle to watch and a photo booth to entertain you if you feel so inclined.
