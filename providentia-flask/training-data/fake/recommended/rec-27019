I just listed Asiana House in my Yelp profile as the last meal I would have before I die. I think that means I LOVE the place. The house rolls are all amazing and the deep fired tofu and seaweed salad are excellent. The service is not overly fast but well worth the wait. Heading there for my birthday in a couple of weeks! Yay me.
