Love Love Love this place!!!  Everytime we are thinking about going out for dinner - the first place we think of is Uva.  This place has awesome atmosphere, outside in the front, inside, downstairs, and out in the back.  It is so romantic inside, dimly lit, brick walls - I want my future home to look like this place!  I have been to this place so many times I couldn't even guess how many.  It is reasonably priced and good portions - not too small and not too big.  The food is fantastic!  The calamari apps is one of my favs as well as the meatballs.  The fresh mozzerella with fava beans and peppers is awesome as well as the mozzerella wrapped in proscioutto.  The cheese and meat selection is great and I love their olives!  The bread they give you is so good!  We recently tried the Sardinian ultra flat bread and it was amazing!!!  All of the pasta is so good and fresh and I love the scallops!  Everything I ever had here was amazing!  :)
