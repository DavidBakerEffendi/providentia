I have been here once and loved it.  It's cute, traditional and charming.  Their menus are handwritten which adds a nice touch. I ordered the spinach gnocchi in Gorgonzola sauce.  One of the best gnocchi I ever had.  It's light but at the same time so divine.  The Gorgonzola sauce isn't strongly flavored with gorgonzola.  I'm actually not a fan of blue cheese or gorgonzola but this sauce is mild.  I would not have known it was gorgonzola from the taste. Definitely a great place to try!
