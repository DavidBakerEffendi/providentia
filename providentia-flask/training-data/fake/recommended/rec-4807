Finally made it to Frankford Hall Friday night after hearing so much about this place via friends, and Yelp. The beer was good and my Spicy Bauernwurst (mainly the spicy mustard served with it) accompanied each other well. The fries were not bad neither. My friends and I sat, drank, ate, and played Jenga. I was labeled a lightweight because I was only able to put down a single liter. I think I am going smaller next time to try a few more.
