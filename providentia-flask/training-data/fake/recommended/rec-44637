Just ordered a Rye Manhattan. Fairly cliche but it's what I wanted. The atmosphere was quite nice. It was extraordinarily busy yet the bartender was attentive. The Manhattan wasn't great: a slight rancid or perhaps slightly over - bitter taste left me disappointed. I'm assuming bad vermouth over too much Angostura, Â but I'm not an expert. Crystal mixing ware was impressive and although not an extensive bar, they featured some slightly outside the norm craft liquors.
