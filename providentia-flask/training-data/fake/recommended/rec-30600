I lovelove their lunch specials - appetizer + entree for $7? awesome.  especially since the restaurant decor is so nice (in stark contrast to the sparse digs of the other thai restaurants on 9th).  i also like how you can get brown rice as a substitute to white rice for no charge. yay. everytime i've been here though, the service has been slow and pretty much non-existent.  it's why it cannot be 5 stars.  if you go to this place with the mindset that you may have to put in some effort to get the attention of the one waitress that is apparently working the entire restaurant in order to order, get some more water, get the check, etcetc. instead of expecting normal, standard service.. well, then you won't be disappointed.  I suppose paying $7 for a good thai meal in pretty nice ambience makes the poor service a bit more excusable.
