Uhm, nothing special. The portions are big, but taste are just normal. I went for brunch at 11:00 am and waited for 20-30 minutes for 2 ppl. The place was pretty crowed but I think it was the only place that the local people said it was a good place for brunch walking distance from our hotel. I will not come back, nothing special at all. Over all good service but okay food and price.
