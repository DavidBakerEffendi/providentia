A little torn about this place. Pros Intimate spot with cool chandelier in a box Accommodated my large party of 9 and let us sit when not everyone was there. (Did I mention I hate chronic late people?) All of my friends' dishes were great Food arrived quickly Reasonable price Cons Waiters a bit slow My friend had a problem with chair The Room Service Pad Thai I ordered looked like a tumor and tasted like...crap?
