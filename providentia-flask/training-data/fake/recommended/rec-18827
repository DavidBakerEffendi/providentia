I constantly feel judged here. When I come with my family, who all speak French fluently (yes, I'm the black sheep) we are part of the gang, and receive wonderful, friendly service. When I've come with other friends, I feel half ignored. The food is pretty good, but not mindblowing. Being that the owner is from Paris (or nearby) you can definitely get the French vibe. If you like the slightly arrogant demeanor and small portions of a true French restaurant, then you'll love this place. I also wanted to comment that I was a bit disappointed that they did not allow me to make any substitutions on the vegetables I wanted in my crepe, which I found strange. For my future crepe fix, I'm heading to Shade in the Village.
