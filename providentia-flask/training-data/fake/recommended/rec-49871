Wow!  Wow!  Wow! I read the reviews of this great little place and just had to see for myself.  The place is a tiny piece of Heaven in West Philly.  Hassan, the owner/chef is probably the most gracious, and wanting to please host I have ever met.  He has a great disposition and said, from the beginning, if this isn't the best Lassi you have ever had, don't pay for it and he'll make you another.  If the Chatt isn't fantastic and you don't love it, don't pay for it either. Well, needless to say I paid for both!  He has many different varieties, combination of Lassi's as well as different combos of Chatt.  He gave me a wonderful education on Chatt and said that he would make me a vegetarian chatt.  I have eaten at many Indian restaurants, but have never had Chatt. The meal was delicious!  It was so good, that I got a second order to take home to my wife. By all means, even if you go out of your way, to go the Mood Café!!!
