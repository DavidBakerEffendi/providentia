Two friends from New Haven brought me here last Sunday afternoon for dinner. We all had their sushi and I tried their beef negamaki. All of our rolls were fine as was the negamaki. You'd think the half-price menu would bring in more people, but it was a third filled in their regular tables. No one at the Hibachi tables. But i'd definately ask to go back there the next time i'm in New Haven.
