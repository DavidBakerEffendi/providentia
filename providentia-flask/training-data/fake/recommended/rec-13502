I've always loved Cheese Steaks sandwiches so imagine my anticipation of what was to be my first official Philly Cheese steak! My friend who was going to Uni in Philly at the time brought me to Pat's and all I recall is her coaching me while we were in line to ensure I ordered the right thing as to not piss off the folks who work there. She told me to either order a Whiz-wit or a whiz-wit-out. Uh...how come I couldn't order a provolone-wit? I was told Whiz is the way to go so I went with the whiz and that would have been a fine choice if the meat tasted better. The meat tasted too bland and too much like meat. i prefer my meat seasoned. Next time, I'm getting a provolone-wit or trying out Geno's!
