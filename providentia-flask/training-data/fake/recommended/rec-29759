I had the truffle burger and I'd come back to try it again. The only thing is that it came out slightly room temp, although was medium rare. The bun was very soft and tender and the beef patty just melted in my mouth. Very nice taste that is smooth and savory. Had the secret tots, these were huge and actually mashed potatoes shaped into fat cylinders and deep fried. Ask for the sauces. The one I like the most was the habanero one. Also had the closing bell, which I thoroughly enjoyed.
