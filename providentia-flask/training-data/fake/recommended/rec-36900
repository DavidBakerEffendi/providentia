I am new in NYC nowadays, and I am exploring as many places as I can while splitting my life between West and East Coast. Yes, I am bi-coastal. I had lunch sitting at the bar because Â the entire restaurant was filled beyond capacity. The ambiance was nice, maybe a little loud, but still very unique. I found this place being a little pretentious though, and for some reason, it happens most of the time in French Restaurants, and not only in those in NYC. The food was good, but not excellent. for the price I paid. The service was great, but again not impeccable. On the unique side, if you want to step back into the '50s, please use the Restaurant bathroom. A nice middle-aged african american man will welcome you inside the toilet. He will literally watch your back while you use the urinal (some men might have a problem performing in front of him), and then as soon as you wash your hands he will give you a clean towel to dry them with. The idea of employing african americans to work in the toilet of an upper scale french restaurant is either very dated or borderline racist. I wasn't impressed with this picture, but I am sure many other customers might disagree with me. Bottom line, always wash your hands.
