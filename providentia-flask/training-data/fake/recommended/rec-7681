I thought Ilili was very good. In particular, I was impressed with the fresh, rich, smokey flavor of the baba ganoush and hummus which put it this food just a notch above your typical lower priced middle eastern restaurant. In addition, the whole fish cooked in mustard sauce was excellent. Chicken kabobs tasted very slightly underdone, but they were seasoned well and we didn't get food poisoning, so, I can't really complain. The little square falafel were a nice touch and our dessert of light airy filo in a bird's nest pattern encircling rich creamy mousse + rose water was unique and well worth the extra calories. Ilili has a stylish soothing ambience and seems like it would be a good place to go on a date. It's worth mentioning that this meal was completely comped for me and as a result I cannot fully comment on the value. That being said, in my experience this type of cuisine is easy to come by - good quality for reasonable prices throughout the city. I got the impression that our bill was somewhat high (food, not liquor) and I generally don't like to splurge on cuisines that are easily accessible. It's akin to P.F. Chang's - the food is alright, but why bother when you can get excellent (and more authentic) Chinese food in China town for next to nothing. In sum, I'd happily go back to Ilili but wouldn't splurge and would focus on the more exotic dishes that are unique to Ilili.
