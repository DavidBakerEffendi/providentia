I have visited The Elbow Room twice in two weeks while on business here in Hartford.  My first experience was last Tuesday and excellent in all ways, the food was superb and the service was fantastic.  They have an eclectic menu with some very tasty entrees and sides to die for.  I had the grilled salmon over a root vegetable and potato hash with sautéed snap peas and a cranberry, maple-mustard glaze which was cooked perfectly and was a rather large portion for the price.  Even though the kitchen had closed by the time we were ready for dessert, the waiter personally put together the ginger cake finale for us and, like the rest of the meal, it was absolutely fantastic.  The waiter was the taller young man with very short, almost non-existent, hair.  I wish I remember his name.  He was attentive and made every effort to make our visit enjoyable. On my second visit last night (Tuesday), we had the cute (read HOT blonde) waitress who was quite the opposite.  She ignored us most of the night, could not remember parts of the order, and even though we were just a little past the closing of the kitchen, she rudely said that she could not serve dessert.  She was also doing duty as the bartender, and I think the younger crowd of young men were distracting her. However, the food was once again fantastic.  I had the pan seared sea scallops with a pancetta bacon and roasted garlic risotto cake that was all extremely good and highly recommended by this diner.  By the time the check arrived, the waiter from last week stepped in to help because not only were we agitated by the waitresses poor service, but the woman in the table beside us was upset as well.
