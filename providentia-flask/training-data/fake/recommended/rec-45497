I've been a longtime customer. Food is consistently good and the service cheerful and effective. They can get really busy and if you are the impatient type, just crack open another beer, enjoy the salsa, and talk to your table mates. Before you know it you will be eating good food. Â Otherwise, go for the take-out option and order in advance.
