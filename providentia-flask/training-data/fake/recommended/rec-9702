The place is very cool. Huge, actually. Dark and hip. We had the ceviche mixto (very good) the cause (incredible), the jalea (which was too big because the portion was a whole one and not a half like it should correspond for two people). The yuca was very hard and not edible, though. Aside from that, fast service and nice staff.
