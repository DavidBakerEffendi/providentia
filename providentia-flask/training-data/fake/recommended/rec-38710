before deciding to go here, we knew two things-- the garlic bread was a must, and the service would be just as noteworthy.  the garlic bread was ok-- really, it's garlic bread-- but the staff and service were truly extraordinary.  right from the moment we walked in the door (literally), the staff made us smile... having lived in europe for a number of years, i've learned that service is secondary to food.  but the people at hot tomato's were that good.  to say they were friendly would be an understatement.  they visited with us, laughed with us, and really made our night out that much more of a memory. the food was good, too.  the spasta was delish and the grilled mahi special was outstanding.
