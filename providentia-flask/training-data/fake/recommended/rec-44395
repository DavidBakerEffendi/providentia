Have to agree with previous reviewer. It's just a local hole in the wall short order joint. Prices are reasonable, especially the $4 special of a chicken patty (decent), Cole slaw (standard), and fries (pretty darn good). Also ordered a strawberry milkshake and it was quite yummy. Tastes like real ice cream.
