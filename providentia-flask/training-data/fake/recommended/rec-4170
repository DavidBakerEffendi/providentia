Nom Nom! This delicious ramen house definitely lives up to it's name.  On a recent cold and rainy day in Philly I was itching for a good bowl of ramen. By way of yelp and word of mouth I decided to try out Nom Nom. Parking in the area was fairly easy and the staff was very warm and welcoming.  Perfect. I ordered the karai since I am a big fan of spicy miso and it was all that I hoped for. Served piping hot, a good blend of creamy miso broth with a great kick, tender pork,  plenty of al dente noodles and veggies with the perfect soft boiled egg. I drool at the thought of it as I write this. I did sample the shoyu but wasn't a fan, to be fair I never like that flavor at any ramen spot. I have been to many ramen joints but I have to say this is second only to Hapa Ramen in SF and just above Ken Ken Ramen in SF because Nom Nom offers a spicy option. I'm so excited to add Nom Nom to my list of regular spots. I'm a happy bird! They don't take credit cards but do accept "Level Up" the mobile app you can link to a credit card. I've noticed a lot of places in Philly are starting to use this so in my opinion it's worth looking into. All in all I can't say enough about Nom Nom and I'm happy to have this be my 100th review!
