When it comes to Joya, I'm rather boring. It's beef pad see ew and thai spare ribs every time. This place is good, cheap and they have some badass Thai gangsters in the kitchen stunnin' with blue tinted sunglasses. My only qualms? Almost always crowded. And unless the owner is there, there's a rather bitchy queen manning the front who seems a bit too self-absorbed to pay attention to who's where on the list. Also, why are the take out portions so much smaller than the dine in portions? Seems a little suspicious to me... I would get up off the couch and go complain to someone if I weren't so grossly full. Oh well, there's always next time.
