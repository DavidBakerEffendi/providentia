This place is not bad nor great. It's average food with average atmosphere. It's more of a hang out spot to drink at or catch a show upstairs and it's usually full of hipsters. But food is editable, service is slow and many of my orders have been made wrong or way over cooked in the past. It's the kind of place you just have to try for yourself and see if you like it.
