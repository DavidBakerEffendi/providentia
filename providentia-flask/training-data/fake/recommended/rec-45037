I think Market table is often overshadowed by its more popular sister restaurant Little Owl, but based just on one-time dining at both, I have to say I liked MT better.   We came in at 9 and scored seats at the bar within a few minutes.  Ordered three appetizers and an entree to share.  We started with the beet salad, beef carpaccio and gnocchi.   Beet salad was very good but you can't really mess up beets and goat cheese.  The carpaccio was excellent; the flavor of the horseradish sauce was not too overpowering, and the crunchy crispy french fry salad was the perfect texture combination with the silky carpaccio. The gnocchi was very light, more cheesy than potato-ey, and it came in a soupy sauce with braised lamb, olives and escarole.  A unique combination of ingredients I wouldn't have expected to be good together but the flavors worked very well.   For the entree we had the seared halibut with butternut squash risotto, and even though at this point I was getting full, I couldn't help but keep stuffing my face because the fish was cooked perfectly - crispy on top and flaky and juicy inside -  and fused so well with the sweet and creamy flavors of the risotto. Service was fine, our bartender/server wasn't terribly personable but everything came out quickly and she was just fine. 4.5 stars for Market table!
