My best friend and I were visiting NYC and decided to eat in Little Italy. We saw that this place got good reviews, so we chose to stop in here. Small, ambient restaurant. The server was friendly and immediately opened the door for us and sat us by the window so we could people-watch. When the bread was served, it didn't seem fresh and was not warmed. I took a butter out of the basket to find that it was already open with no butter inside, and when I grabbed another butter, it was also open with only half the butter inside. On the third try, I finally found one that wasn't already open. I know we should've said something, but we ignored it in hopes that things wouldn't get worse. We ordered an appetizer, which I think was baked clams? I already forgot... and they were good, but not anything extraordinary. We split a chicken picatta, and it was also good, but not spectacular. Good thing we split the main entree though because it was the perfect portion for us. Overall, I think the atmosphere and the service were good, but the food was okay. I don't think we'll specifically come back to eat here on our next visit to NY but try another place in Little Italy instead.
