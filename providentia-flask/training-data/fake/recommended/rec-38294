I have been traveling to Burlington each week for the past 6 months and this is a regular spot for me. I haven't tried much on the menu, but that is because their house-smoked wings are critical to my existence!!! Their Kobe beef burger is also very good. The service can be a bit slow when sitting on the patio, but hey, you are their to enjoy, so relax and have fun!!! If you want really fast service, sit at the bar or order to go.
