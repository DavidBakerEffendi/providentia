I have eaten here and also visited with several large groups. I agree that the service can been less than satisfactory, hence the trio of stars. That being said, Franz is the man - super nice guy and he will take good care of you. hopefully he gets bumped up into the role of bartender or manager soon, in light of their recent staffing "changes"... he deserves it, having handled our large groups with ease and good humor. The food is generally pretty damn good as well. Franz gets 4 stars, the food 4 as well, but unfortunately the rest of the staff brings down the house ... not in a good way.
