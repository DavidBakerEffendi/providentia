The BEST blueberry pancakes in my life!  And I'm a big pancake person, sad, but true.... My friends and I trekked blocks to eat at the place and, though it is a little small,  it was well worth the wait. What makes these pancakes so bomb.com is the maple butter syrup that they serve warm and ready. I just saw that February is their pancake month, so if you're ever out in the LES around that time of the year, do yourself a favor and make your way to this pancake haven. to.die.for! and while you're at it.... have a blueberry smash cocktail with your breakfast, nothing like a nice sweet drink to top off your morning!
