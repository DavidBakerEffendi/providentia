Truth be told, we order from Ruthies at least once a week, if not more. Food is amazing...literally everything is good--we've yet to be disappointed. Great prices, no problems with picking up--service is timely. Eating there is great also--the small indoor area with the vintage 50s tables is fun and the back patio is nice in good weather. The blues bands that play there are seriously good. I also love it because it's off the beaten path in Montclair and the crowd it attracts is definitely not ibanker/soccer moms :) The only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars is the owner, Eric. He's a total grump. We eat there all the time and he acts like he barely knows us (and we're nice people). I don't expect to be his best friend or anything, but civility would be nice. He's never been unprofessional towards us, but he welcomes with a grimace. The place would be much warmer and friendlier if he stayed in the back, cooking his amazing food.
