I went here because my friend recommended me to try out. I went on a sunday for brunch, the wait wasn't that long even though the place was full, the servers were quick and very on to point and moving fast. I tried the La Sultan which was very tasty, while my partner tried the banana with neutella (well, this on can't go wrong) The presentation was great and made me want to try other savory crepes as well. I am glad I tried it out and can't wait to go back again!
