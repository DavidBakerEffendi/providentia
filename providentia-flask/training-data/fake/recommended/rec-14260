I had been on a quest to find the best tasting burger in NYC and I have found it.  If you are in the mood for a hearty burger...corner bistro is the place to go.  Their bistro burger comes with all the right fixins - a juicy 8oz patty with cheese, lettuce, tomato and bacon strips.  Now normally I'm not a fan of bacon but it's a must have accessory to this great burger.  While you're at it, order up a McSorley's ale to go with it.
