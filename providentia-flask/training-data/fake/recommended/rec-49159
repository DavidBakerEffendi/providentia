Joseph Leonard turned out to be one of the better dining experiences I have had yet this year for the following reasons: 1. The food. Simple dishes with complex flavor. Seasonally appropriate and just plain delicious. 2. The service. Fantastic. Sat at the "chefs counter" and enjoyed watching all the dishes being prepared, as well as participating in playful banter with The Expo. 3. Finally (perhaps, most importantly), the drinks! Our friend, The Expo, explained that no one has ever drank through the enter drink list in one sitting. My boyfriend and I interpreted that as a challenge we were more than eager to take on. The Tuk Tuk and the K'Naan were especially memorable. I usually shy away from going out for dinner in the West Village on a Saturday because it is often too annoying to enjoy. Even though Joseph Leonard was packed with usual weekend riffraff, the overall dining experience was so exceptional, I barely noticed. Not that I would have noticed much anyway after six cocktails.
