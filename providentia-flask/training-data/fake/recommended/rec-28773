I ordered 2 half hoagies for my daughter and myself after hearing good stuff about this place. I ordered a turkey and cheese with the typical hoagie fixings and my daughter ordered a ham and cheese. They use boars head lunch meat which is good because it is high quality. However I was appalled when I opened my hoagie they stuffed it with so much meat the bread broke and it wasn't even edible until I took 3/4 of the stuff they put on it off. Now some people would think wth why is she complaining, I know how the typical american society is more is better BUT that's not for me. I cannot enjoy a hoagie I cannot bite into, I cannot enjoy a hoagie when you got a pound of meat on it and it's so heavy the bread breaks - really what flavors are you even tasting if your eating a monster hoagie. More is not always better more does not mean more flavor. Â  This place is a joke.
