I've been to Watkins twice now, once for drinks and once for dinner. Both times were enjoyable! The beer lists is quite good. I had a Mad Elf on my first visit and, frankly, Watkins probably earned 2 stars right there. I had a Jameson and ginger ale on my second visit. It was kind of big and had a little too much booze in it, but I guess I got my money's worth. The food is pretty good. I had the burger - brussels sprouts on top were a nice touch, but it probably would have benefitted from some kind of sauce. My girlfriend had the ostrich cheesesteak, which was really good. The decor is very warm and welcoming. Wood paneling might not be chic, but it's cozy for sure. I hear there's a badass game room upstairs. I haven't been up there, but I have a feeling that that will eventually add the final star to this review.
