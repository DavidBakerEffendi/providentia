4 stars hands down for the service and attention (aside from the fact our waiter had trouble with 3 credit cards) 4 stars hands down for the decor, ambiance, and interesting fluctuation of lighting from dim to semi dim throughout the night. Food however falls a little flat here with 3.  The food was good, just not as good as I would expect.  Compared to other restaurants of it's ilk in terms of "classiness, price, and food", I couldn't rate ilili on par.  With special attention to the Brussel Sprouts everyone raves about, they were good, but no where near what I thought about the Brussel Sprouts from Alta. Currently, I have a 3 star rating and I'm wavering on whether or not to round up to the 4 star based on overall experience...but I truly think a restaurant review on yelp should reflect the entire experience with main emphasis on the food.  For that, I can not at this time justify rounding up....that is until I give ilili a second chance.
