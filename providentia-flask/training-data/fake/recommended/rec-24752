Just delicious and perfect for healthy and/or veggie of that's what you're into (don't worry, if it's not they have chicken and beef too!). This place reminds me of a local healthy veggie style chipotle, sans Mexican. There's a counter where you order, you can have a bowl or a wrap and you are able to add all the fixins of your choice plus delicious dressings to top it off! The bowls are about $8 and is a very filling lunch or a light dinner. Love trying all the different combos here!
