Had a meal here with a few friends on a Wednesday night, after making reservations day of. We were immediately welcomed by the staff and kindly taken care of by Jacques. Starting with the cheese plate, we chose 3 varieties with some suggestion from our server; all of which were exceptional, a must order to begin any meal. Subsequently, we settled on the mussels and raced to the bottom, each of us eyeing the broth and bread. Each dip was a tastefully balanced portion of leek, garlic and creme that we sucked up with three bags of bread total...which Jacques was happy to serve. For entrees, the trout was pan-roasted perfectly, retaining its texture while being both flaky and tender. The roasted duck leg and house salade were also exceptional. Food, service and atmosphere at Amelie are all on point.
