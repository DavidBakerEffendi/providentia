It was good and probably worth visiting at least once.  Personally, I had higher expectations.  I didn't think the flavors quite delivered their potential although the portions were generous and we didn't leave hungry.  The waiter brought my husband the wrong meal and we didn't catch the error until we saw someone at another table with what he should have had.  THe waiter didn't seem surprised...it was like he had hoped we didn't realize it.  But he did hook us up with some great wine to make up for it, so that was okay.  Again, I am a Top Chef fan so I was eager to sample what I expected to be amazing, but walked away unimpressed.
