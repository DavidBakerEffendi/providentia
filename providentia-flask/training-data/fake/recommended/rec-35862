Cute space. The food was decent (didn't care much for the pickles which are over-hyped) but the service had much to be desired. We waited for 10 minutes while the table promised to us sat empty and uncleared. Then our waitress, who was only mildly pleasant, explained that restaurant couldn't substitute the roasted potatoes for potato salad. Fair enough, no substitutions are pretty common in this city. But the real kicker was that I asked for an extra side of Russian Dressing for my reuben sandwich (super fatty but pretty amazing) she told me that there was only one more side left and they needed to save it. Given that Russian dressing is a combination of ketchup and mayonnaise, I suppose I could have just asked for that and made it from scratch at my table but I was so baffled I just let is slide. Maybe there is something special they add to their Russian dressing? I will give this place another chance. The food was promising but please don't tell me you can't come up with an extra dollop of mayoniase and ketchup mixed together. Ridiculous.
