i love sandwiches and banh mis definitely fall into my top 5 for sure. joju met all of my expectations and then some. i came here for my anniversary dinner with my boo (thats right, kids. i stay classy) because it was a popular place that came up on my yelp feed. Â we each ordered a sandwich (the joju monster and the bulgogi bomb me) and the kimchi fries. for the price and the portions everything was pretty spot on! the joju monster was a perfect balance of the pickled vegetables cutting the fat of the pate and egg with the acidity. and the bomb me was a great flavor combo of sweet, salty and spicy. the kimchi fries were great as well! although there was a bit too much of the pickled carrots but i easily looked past it all as i shoveled it into my mouth. HA! i took off a star for the terrible music playing in the background ruining my foodie experience. and the awful and strong smell of chlorine, making me slightly nauseated that i had to move by the door in the already tight space. A+ for the food and service. C- for the atmosphere.
