This place is a safe haven of good clean food for paleo and health conscious people! It's kind of like a cafeteria with hot stations, deli, soups, deserts, and also things like smoothies and coffee. Eat in or take out. Foods are gluten and grain free for the most part with cooking oils being coconut and olive. Everything is really clearly labeled with ingredients. I had the take away deli Brussels sprouts and stuffed portabella mushroom. Also the chocolate chia mashable bowl - amazingness of chia pudding paleo cookies and cashew cream. When can they open one of these in SF?! I'd be there everyday :)
