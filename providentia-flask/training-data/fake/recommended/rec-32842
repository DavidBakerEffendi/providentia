I have been going to Tinga for years and have nothing but love for this establishment....I gave it 4 stars because i rarely if ever would give 5...the only con about this place is that it is tiny and you are eating with hardly any elbow room to spare....other than that the food is always fresh and the portions are on point..I will recommend Tinga to everybody i know
