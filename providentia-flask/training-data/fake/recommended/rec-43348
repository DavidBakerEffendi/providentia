Met some friends for lunch here today.  Haven't been in about 5 years.  The place was crowded and noisy.  I ordered the tilapia and avocado salad.  It was delicious but a bit pricey and I was hungry about an hour later.  Service was slow, but the wait staff was very friendly.  Won't be rushing back here...
