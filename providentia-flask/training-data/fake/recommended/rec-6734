Since April 2014 under new ownership. The trains are gone but the space is cleaned up, bright and freshly painted A nicely run deli that's does all the traditional deli fare for both breakfast and lunch. The staff is friendly and a peek in the back reveals a clean kitchen that is doing everything right. I always order an egg sandwich with either bacon or sausage and the occasional sub sandwich. Â Breakfast sandwiches come with a bag of chips, that's cool. The coffee is good and consistent. I am looking forward to trying more and eating here more often.
