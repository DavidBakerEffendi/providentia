This place is beyond delicious! The rolls are very flavorful and well presented. I truly believe this place will end up expanding...or at least I hope so! It's very small inside and the place is popular. So, if you come here and there are no tables open, you can always take it to go and eat at the park around the corner ;) I really liked the mighty green roll and the kiwi roll. Those were my top favorites but also tried the mushroom roll and the one with mango - they were both awesome too so you really can't go wrong here. I love the vegan sushi concept and hope to see this place pop up on the west coast! I would take a star off because the rolls are a little small if you ask me...they could add a little more rice at the price they are asking. But I think it's just the norm here in NY :)
