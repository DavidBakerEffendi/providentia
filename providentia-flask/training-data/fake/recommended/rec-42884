I came to Casa Mono with two of my friends and we heard that it was hard to get a reservation here. I can't speak from experience of attempting to make one as our friend handled that but let me tell you that this place is very small so understandably so. We were seated immediately and when browsing the menu, I saw a bottle of wine from Galicia. This place definitely struck me as a true Spanish restaurant (from Spain). I was taken aback though when I told my friends "Hey! Look. There is a bottle of wine from where my father is from...Galicia." I also went on to state that it was a small place is Northern Spain. Well, our waitress overheard me and interrupted me by saying "Mmm.. No it's not. It's actually quite big." I was like... ummm? Okay? Unnecessary really. My father is FROM Galicia. I have BEEN there. She proceeded to state that she studied there. My friends both looked at me with shocked looks on their faces. It was a really rude way to interrupt me and the way she said it caused me to get a little offended. That's my deduction of a star. It made the entire evening awkward. Food. Amazing. Like, really good. I posted pictures. We ordered many dishes and I don't even think I have them all listed/shown via photos but here we go... + Pan con tomate ... YES. + Beets + FLAKE CRUDO ... YES. + Scallops ... YES. Quail (I didn't try - friends said it was amazing) Mussels (Also did not try - friends also stated it was amazing) + Toasted angel hair I waited months to write this review and I hate when I do that because I would love to go into greater detail but I am rarely impressed with NYC restaurants because they are generally are pretty spectacular but this one is a must-try for NYC. Bear the wait, don't eat for days, and get ready to feast.
