I used to live on Dean Street, but I moved away many years ago.  My friend still lives in the neighborhood and told me about this spot.  I went in and was immediately greeted.  I ordered the 1lb crab platter with potatoes and corn to go.  OMGGGG.  I made a complete pig of myself when I got home.  It was so good.  Everything was cooked to perfection; not oily, not salty, just damn good food.  NOM NOM
