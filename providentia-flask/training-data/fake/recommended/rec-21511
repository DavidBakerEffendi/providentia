I have not been to Frankford Hall since the summer.  I miss it.  It's def a bit of a frat boy hang out, but I always have a good time when I go.  If I'm playing uno, jenga or with a plain ole deck of cards, it always ends up being a good time.  Theres a ton of space and you never feel like people are rushing you for a table.   I'm not a huge fan of German food, so I am usually hungry and can't quite figure out what to eat.  The pretzels always do me in.  They seem like such a great idea, but its always more than I can eat.  My friends never seem to mind helping me out in such troubling times, so it never goes to waste.
