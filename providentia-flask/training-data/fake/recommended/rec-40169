We recently went for our first try at Aldine for the NYE 7:30 seating. It was $75/pp for 5 courses. Overall, dinner was very nice but we left unhappy and a little underwhelmed with the size of each course. We have dined at other restaurants with similar price points and felt extremely satisfied with our meals... this one left us wanting more (both a curse and a blessing I guess!) We added oysters and each had two drinks. In total, our bill was $150/pp. Each course was 3 or 4 bites, which is very very small. Even the entrée which was a lamb medallion, was given to us with 1  1/2 medallions... literally cut in half. For each of us. Like they couldn't give you two whole medallions? Did they run out of entrees that each diner was allotted only 1  1/2 medallions, each only being 2'' in diameter? (See pictures of Kwazi H.'s crusted lamb below - 1 1/2 medallions) It was bizarre and we left feeling a little empty haha!  The service was wonderful, our waitress was excellent and very friendly. I think we would try this again, not on a NYE night, and not a tasting menu. For now though, we'll probably revisit other restaurants in the area before going back to Aldine.
