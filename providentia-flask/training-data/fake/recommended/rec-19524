Wow what a gem this turned out to be.  Pietro's restaurant looked as good as the food they serve.  The old building has been rejuvenated with a red brick interior along with beautifully restored hard wood floors and wrought iron lighting fixtures throughout the lower and upper deck. The evening started with fresh baked bread with olive oil while we waited for our entree's. My companion had the Linguini fra Diavolo Frutti di Mare which consisted of shrimp, calamari, clams, mussels and of course the linguini in a spicy marinara sauce.  From what I sampled I can say I have never had a better fra diavolo sauce. I ordered a coal oven pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, onions and sliced tomato. The dough was extremely fresh and well backed. They also use slice of cheese on their pie and the vegetables were cooked just right. Nice and crisp through an through. Last but not least Pietro's has some of the best pepperoni I've had on a pizza in quite some time. The meal was divine. :) Afterwords we sat down in the bar for another hour and the staff was just great. I look forward to visiting Pietro's on a future trip to Philly.
