I feel as though I need to preface this review in order to provide context.  I have been to and lived in three of the four corners in this country over the last 15 years and have eaten in or at more restaurants, dive bars, street vendors and food trucks than I even care to remember.  My most recent trip to PA was relatively involuntary as my father-in-law was working in the area and we found ourselves sitting at a small dive bar just outside city center.  While the bar provided no food, delivery was an option and Sonny's was highly recommended.  Not only did the owner himself walk the steaks down by hand, he took the time to explain why these were fundamentally different from competing sandwiches in the area.  I took this with a grain of salt as I've heard these demands before, but one bite verified the claim.  These the best cheesesteaks in Philadelphia bar none.  These are the best sandwiches outside of New Orleans.   Now, if you want to go off and claim Geno's or Pat's are better, be my guest.  Just know you prefer a lower quality product served to you by someone who doesn't care what you think.   ...and who puts ketchup on a steak sandwich?  Philistines.
