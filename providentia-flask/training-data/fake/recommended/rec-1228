I always noticed that this place was busy, so I tried it out... I've come to the conclusion, I have NO IDEA why this place is busy... The food is mediocre... If these people stopped by to eat at Tokyo Sushi Hibachi Buffet on Street Rd in Bensalem, then these people wouldn't come back here, I'm thinking people are coming here because the location is convenient for them from work.
