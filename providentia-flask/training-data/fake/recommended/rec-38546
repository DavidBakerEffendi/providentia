I am a vegan and have been to Govinda's a couple of times before, exclusively to pick up dessert. Today I decided to try out the food options and had a "Chicken" cheesesteak, which appears to generally be wildly raved about. The "chicken" was actually some of the best meat alternative I've ever had; however, the sandwich as a composition was rather underwhelming. My sandwich was on a wheat roll and it came untoasted; I would have rather had the bread toasted, but the option was not extended to me. Additionally, the only items inside the bread were the "chicken," a few pieces of green pepper, soy cheese and mayo (which were indistinguishable by taste or consistency in the sandwich). Â "Chicken" good; sandwich mediocre. I would like to try the "chicken" in a different item, however; perhaps on a salad. In five-star news, the dessert is amazing and, unbelievably, completely vegan. I believe the dessert is shipped in from a vegan bakery, so I can't give Govinda's any direct props, other than for selling them at the store. I would echo other reviewers' commentary on the food wait; Govinda's To Go is "fast food," however, with only one person ahead of me in line, I waited about 10-12 minutes for my sandwich. I read another Yelper's review that suggested ordering ahead for pickup, so I may try that in the future. I've never dined in here, but the dining room isn't very impressive. The restaurant touts the enticing title "Govinda's Fine Dining," however, the "fine" qualifier may solely refer to the food and not the ambience. Overall, I'm not totally dissuaded from eating here again and I would try other items on the menu. Of course, I would never hesitate to return for the dessert.
