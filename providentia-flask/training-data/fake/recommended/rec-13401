I have heard how amazing the pancakes were so a friend and I decided to give it a try.  I had the blueberry pancakes which were so good I cannot even describe them - it's hard to imagine pancakes can be that good.  My friend had the chicken and waffles which were equally as tasty.  Overall, an enjoyable evening and I will be back for more!
