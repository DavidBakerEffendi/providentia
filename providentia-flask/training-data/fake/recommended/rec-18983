It's a bit far but worth the trip! It's a small hole in the wall with limited seating. The summer rolls were filled with fresh veggies, the grilled lemongrass pork banh mi will NOT disappoint, and the tom thit ram was mouth-watering good! Also, please try the coconut tapioca pudding! I don't even like coconut and I ate it all.
