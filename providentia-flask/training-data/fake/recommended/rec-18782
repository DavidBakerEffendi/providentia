Visited Bayou for the first time last Saturday night and was very pleased with the atmosphere, food, and service.  I have been to New Orleans a dozen times, so I was very happy to see the effort they made to recreate the decor in a style reminiscent of the French Quarter.  The appetizers and the entrees were delicious... and very reasonably priced.  I would definitely return to this neighborhood gem.
