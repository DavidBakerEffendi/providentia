This place is so innovative and fun, and the drinks are amazing!  The spicy tequila drink (I forget what it's called) was amazing and came with the cutest mini red chili pepper as garnish.  Also, their pickle backs are an ironic twist on molecular gastronomy, as the pickle juice comes in the form of an oval disc, somehow held together until you pop it in your mouth and it bursts open.  Amazing!  There's also a playful ambiance with the disco ball and the awesome music playing, and all the staff is so happy and obviously love their job.  Our waiter said he was having a "stellar" day, and when we asked why, he said he had been there all day working and loving it!  How nice to see! As far as the food goes, expect to be surprised if you've never been here before.  Nothing is what it seems, as all the menu items are so unique.  The best way to go about this place is family style, and get a selection of small plates and one or two large plates, and ordering more if you're still hungry.  We got the pork and beans, which were delicious, the passion fruit salad, the lamb breast, and the dumplings.  The prices are pretty reasonable and I'm glad I live right around the corner from this wonderful and unique establishment!
