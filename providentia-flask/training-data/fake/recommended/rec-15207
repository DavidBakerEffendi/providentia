Totally overrated. I prefer shake shack or Ruby's cafe better. The idea behind the restaurant sounds nice but they definitely didn't deliver. Tasted like the average hamburger. The duck burger didn't meet my expectations either. I though duck would have tasted better than beef, but not at umami burger.
