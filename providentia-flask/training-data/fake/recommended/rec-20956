Although my lunch date was AH-mazing and cute, the food, ambience and service was so so.  Would not recommend as the perfect lunch place find.   The wine by the glass however was fantastic! Food - I had beet salad appetizer, my date had a sandwich and I had the fish.  Everything was fine but nothing memorable at all and supportive of these other 5 star reviews.  For the price and choices in the vicinity, would have chosen something else. Ambience - yes, windows were nice, but no outdoor seating and our 2 person table was very close to the others - I'm used to close but this was too close for what I wanted out of the experience.     The windows do support some eye candy people watching if you are facing the right way.   Service - adequate but not engaging.  We are fun people and like to say hey to the wait staff, but this was all business.
