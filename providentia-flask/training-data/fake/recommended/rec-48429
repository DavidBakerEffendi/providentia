Oh, how I love to find new places to eat. This little gem is packed away on a residential portion of Union hidden among the pretty brownstones. You do not expect to walk in and find a beautiful, sun-filled space with rich wooden furniture. Menu is a la carte (at least for brunch) and cash only. Small-ish portions of things, but most were quite yummy. Service was kind of strange (5 waters for a table of 7), but everyone was very nice. I had brunch here the other day - I am looking forward to having a dinner here - supposed to have some very romantic atmosphere.
