We had lunch here this past Saturday and loved it! Come to think of it, I am yet to visit a bad Thai restaurant in NY! My wife and I went here to meet a friend for lunch. The decor is quite nondescript - nothing really stood out. The hostess who seated us seemd a bit pushy for us to get going with our order.. but that is where the gripes end! I ordered the Yellow Curry Rice (exxxtra spicy) with steamed dumplings. My wife and our friend both got the pineapple fried rice with the fried dumplings. First of all - ALWAYS get the fried dumplings!! They are WAYYYY better than the steamed ones (which are also REALLY good!) The Yellow Curry Rice was excellent. Everything was perfectly cooked and spiced jut right. Same was the case with my wife's rice dish. I thought it could have used some more pineapple, but maybe she ate all the pineapple before I tried it! If you're in the Theatre District and are looking for Thai food, look no further!
