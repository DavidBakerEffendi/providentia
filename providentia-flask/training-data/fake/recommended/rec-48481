Went in on a Thursday for a beer and a bite to eat to watch the NBA playoffs on a Thursday night.  I was the only basketball fan in the place but they were quick to change the channel at my request.  The decor is showing it's age but I was impressed on how clean it was in the bar.  Everyone seemed to know each other - local hangout  Good choice of beers, nachos were just okay, burger was good, service was great.  It's nothing that will blow you away but a good slice of Americana.
