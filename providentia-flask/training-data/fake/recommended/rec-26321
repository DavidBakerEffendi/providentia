I went here for lunch on a Sunday and the place filled up fast. I was craving for a bowl of hot and spicy tofu soup with various things you can order in it, like seafood or meat and this place does it for me! So of course, I ordered the popular tofu soup with seafood and beef, cracked an egg on top of it while the soup is still boiling when it arrives at my table. There's just something about a bowl of Korean tofu soup that I cannot resist! Oh and that fried fish as part of your banchan dishes, is sooo tasty, I can't stop eating it. My friend said she'll come just for their fish.
