You have to pay them to cook the meal yourself. Overpriced and terrible service. No direction given and the staff doesn't know the menu. The side dishes seemed to be refrigerated for a long time and we only received a portion of the 14 they said they offered. They also forgot to give my girlfriend her soup. She was disappointed just as much as I was. Wait staff is slow and very rude. Do not go here. Do not know how people liked this place. Go to China Pan down the road.
