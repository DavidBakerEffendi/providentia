I went to Aksam last night with a party of 9 for dinner.  I really liked the restaurant and I would go again.  Here's what I noticed: The Good:  The food at Aksam is really good.  Half of my friends are vegetarian, and there are many vegetarian options in the menu.  Also, the great thing about Aksam is that they have seitan already and you can ask them to incorporate it into your meal instead of meat.  I split a Med East Platter and a Chicken Orzo with my friend.  The Med East Platter is amazing!  The lentils are cooked perfectly and the spices were great.  The portions are generous.  The Orzo was a tad overcooked but was delicious in the morning cold.  Besides the food, the decor is really nice and the pricing very reasonable.  You can also do hookah! The Not-so Good: The service was not terrible, but not attentive enough to be called good.  We had made a reservation, but they chose to seat us awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant directly in front of the door which was drafty.  Also, because we were in between the bar, the door, the kitchen and the bathroom, there was a lot of outside motion around us.  Also, we had to ask for our water to be refilled several times.  It sounds demanding but that fact attests to the lack of attention given to us by the wait staff.  We also had the wrong bill given to us with food that we did not order.  Our bill was ~$130 and the original one given was for ~$175.   So make sure of your orders.   The good thing is that you can do separate cards which is very convenient in a large BYO setting. Overall, I liked the food and the atmosphere, but would have liked more attention from the waitstaff and more care taken into the bill.
