I simply love this place. We went there already several times (and this in NYC!) and were never disappointed. Great food, great wines and always a valuable recommendation from the servant. My personal favorite is the bagel with foie gras with a glas of champagne, but I also tried other dishes as the tuna tartare, the cheese selection or the little sweets with an espresso - all very delicious and highly recommended to be tried. Thanks to Mike and his team, you really created a place with great food and a great atmosphere. Thanks for the hospitality tonight. Â We had all we need for a great evening amongst friends.
