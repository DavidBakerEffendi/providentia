In Tomo, I've had both great sushi and the worst sushi I've had in Princeton, judging by fish quality. Â Nigeria Sushi cuts seemed pretty good. However, I'd certainly recommend trying their nabe or any other hot noodle soups. As a side note, the bubble tea also tasted pretty bad -- skip it and get one of the delicious bottled tea choices (ito-en). For chronically bad fish, this place sure gets a lot of take-out orders - I have had to wait about 45 minutes for my small order, even though there were only two people waiting for their food when I entered.
