This place is AWESOME.  The food at least.  It can definitely work on that humid/damp feel when you first walked in.  If it wasn't because the menu looked pretty enticing; we may have left bc it felt warm when we walked in. But atmosphere aside, the food was nothing short of amazing.  We started with the Spicy Pork Buns.  My hubs and I could've definitely had this spicier, but we can also handle quite a bit of spice; but the pork was super flavorful and just overall Yum. WE also got their "Ugly Duckling", it's balut.  There's so "fear factor" in it, but we're asian, very few food scare us; and once you get over what it really is; this was super yummy.  The soup in it was very flavorful and wow.  Yum..  Try it if you've never tried it before. I asked for recommendations, and she told me the Tocilog was really good.  I was unsure about the "ham" but she assured me that it tasted more like "pork chops" vs. ham.  It really did.  It was cut into small pieces, and complementing that with the egg & garlic rice; I finished my full meal and practically licked my plate clean.  My husband had the Crispy Pata.  This was good.  It tasted a combo of chinese roast pork, and slow cooked pork.  Flavor was GREAT, and overall great experience. I would definitely be coming back to try out more food!
