Neat little BYOB. Went with a group of 11- sampled every appetizer. Stand outs were the brie and peppered scallops. But really, you can't go wrong with any of them, just depends what tickles your fancy :-) Ordered the crab stuffed sole and it was GREAT! Every aspect of the meal just worked well together. Others noted that their meals were delicious as well, including the filet and seafood risotto. Would definitely go back if I was in the area again! PS. CASH ONLY!
