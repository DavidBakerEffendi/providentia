I had the Corvina com Vatapa and it was soooo yummy! I loved the different flavors that came through, especially in the Vatapa. Wish I could get this back in LA. For dessert, the coconut flan and passion fruit mousse were to die for! I will definitely come back when I'm in NYC again. Â The chef owner and staff were super friendly too.
