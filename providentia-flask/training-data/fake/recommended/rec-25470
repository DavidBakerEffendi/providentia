This wasn't a life-altering burger experience, but Umami Burger is among the best I've had. The spot is clean and sleek (and under a year old), with a cramped layout but generally friendly staff. The food is definitely not cheap but it is unique and very, very satisfying. They offer a few combinations, but I went with the Original: six ounces of Wagyu beef flavored with various umami boosters, including a hint of soy sauce and five spice, topped with a roasted tomato slice, caramelized onion, a parmesan crisp, and house made slightly sweet ketchup, sandwiched between a branded Portuguese bun. Really a great burger, but not quite up to the hype. I can see myself coming back for the truffle burger (or the devious Monte Cristo burger: covered with Gruyere and prosciutto between two halves of a deep fried vanilla custard soaked buns dusted with powdered sugar and a side of maple syrup).
