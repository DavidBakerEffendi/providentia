YES! Great date spot. I went here with a date, and from the start was impressed. We shared an AMAZING bottle of red wine (fruity and bright, I forget the name). Then, ordered this great in-house ricotta appetizer. For the meal, both of us had pasta, mine was the Cabonara. So amazing, rich, flavorful. I finished mine and my date's ;) Definitely will go back.
