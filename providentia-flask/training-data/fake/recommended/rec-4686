there's a certain warmth in my heart when i think of yorkside.  i love pizza in all its varied shapes and textures and tastes.  nary a pizza i've had that i didn't at least like.  blah blah blah, now i'm being verbose... basically, i like yorkside pizza.  i might even love it.  in and of itself, the pizza is decent.  it has a thicker crust than the new haven staples.  in fact, it's kind of lacking in any real character.  but it is what it needs to be - dough, sauce, and cheese.  and that's all i'm askin for when i roll in to yorkside at some ridiculous post-midnight hour. and there you have it, that's partly why i like yorkside so much.  it's on the way home from most boozin locales.  so most of the time (back in my glory days of binge drinking, followed by binge eating oh so long ago...), i just pop in after a (fill-in-adjective here) night on the town.  and yorkside, ever so dependably, always has slices ready to be reheated, plopped on that lovely green, red, and white paper plate, doused in crushed red pepper, and savagely devoured by me. i have yet to try their non-pizza food, unless ice cream counts (cappuccino crunch is my faaaaaaaaaaavourite).  but the pizza is enough for me.  and if you go during normal people hours or order a whole...  they've got some good flavours. for your accessibility, convenience, late-hours, and enabling my late-night eating...  i give you 4 cheesy, carb-ful stars!
