got to-go food from here on a few occasions.. whenever we get to-go they forget to give us an item & call us when we are half way home. i don't eat ribs but my boyfriend and his family really like them from here. the onion loaf is also delicious. whenever i get the chicken it is pretty dry. & the parking situation is always horrendous!
