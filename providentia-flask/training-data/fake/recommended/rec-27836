Wonderful new barbecue joint in Fort Greene/Clinton Hill. They are still working through their recipes, but their pulled pork and pork belly were amazing! Very flavorful, juicy and tender with a decent amount of smoke. The ribs were a bit less tender, but I really loved the rub they used, leading to a very flavorful crust. Their homemade barbecue sauces are also fantastic...I recommend the Tamarind sauce! Another standout item was the black bean side dish...yum! Very well spiced with pieces of pork barbecue mixed in. The portions were very generous and the prices were very reasonable for GOOD barbecue. The only negative was the location...it's on a section of Myrtle that is still in transition, so there aren't many things around it yet.
