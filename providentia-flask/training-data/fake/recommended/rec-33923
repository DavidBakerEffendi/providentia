Coming from one of the pickiest eater on the planet: When I first saw the menu for this place I had a mini-anxiety attack. Nothing looks normal about the ingredients on this menu, and nothing really sounded all THAT appetizing either. But, to my surprise (but not really, because I read yelp reviews) everything we tried was great! Here's what we had: E666s with bacon and culantro - i don't even eat devilied eggs at all and these were really good! Of course everything is better deep fried but there was no rotten egg smell or taste, the filling had a little kick and the outside was nice and crispy fried. Definitely a nice starter. Total of 2 eggs, each split in half. FAWN-TONS - I really wasn't so sure about how I would like venison but these were pretty much perfect. The outside was a crispy wonton and inside had very flavorful, non-gamey, taste with a hint of horseradish on top. Chicken & Woffals - the waitress started to tell us about the dish and mentioned chicken liver and I kindly asked her to stop right there - I don't want to know - just let me taste it. The waffle was awesome, crispy on the outside, very sweet. The chicken was a cornish hen and was broiled I think? Not fried. A little too much bone for me but still great. Flank - Kind of an average steak dish, served sliced and med-rare. SHOTS!! Get the spherical0-back!! A weird gusher-ey like chaser after a shot of their fine tequila. Kind of like an explosion in your mouth. Dessert - not much to choose from but why do you need anything other than an ice cream snickers bar? You don't. Staff - I can't say enough good thinks about Justin and Luke (partners and owners), they treated us like family and have some awesome ideas for the future. Can't wait to see what happens with this place - big things ahead.
