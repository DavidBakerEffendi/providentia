Delicious Vietnamese food in the West Village.  Their speciality banh mi's are a must, but they are a little more pricey at 8-9$.  I can't believe the classic is only 5$.  Worth every penny, even subway costs more!  Their portions are generous and I love how fresh everything is.  Pho & bun vermicelli and rice plates are a solid choice.  I docked a star only because I'm not a fan of the peanut sauce with the summer rolls :(  However, I visit this place at least once a week! Easy on the wallet and happy in my tummy. Great service too! It does get crowded around the lunch and dinner hours but the wait is never too long.
