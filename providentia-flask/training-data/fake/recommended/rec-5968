Just made the worthwhile trip to Chef Marc Vetri's third fantastic restaurant venture, Amis... Envisioned by Vetri with Gruber Design Associates, the 80-seat space is as unique as it is delightful with distressed zinc bar, repurposed tables, church-pew banquettes from Provenance, raw steel throughout and gorgeous faceted mirror pendants by way of Groundwork. Already a media darling after just two weeks, Amis is already planning to expand service to include lunch come March.
