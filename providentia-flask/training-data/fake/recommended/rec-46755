We've lived in Park Slope for a couple years, but for some reason we don't venture into the Gowanus area (below 4th Ave) very often. We went to this restaurant on a tip from a friend, and were so happy we took their advice. The food was incredibly tasty and high-quality. The ambiance is what I call "Brooklyn Industrial Chic" - super modern and clean, with a hip vibe. But my favorite part was the cocktail. I forgot the name, but it's fabulous: Beefeater, Prosecco, Blackberry Jam, Maraschino, St. Germain. I'd have it every day if I could. Highly recommend this place!
