Overpriced for what you're getting.  Claire was rude to me when I brought in a cup of herbal tea for colds with me from home which was unnecessary.  Their sandwiches are disgusting.  Their soy bbq chicken and marguerita pizza are pretty good but overpriced.  Their Lithuanian coffee cake is the only one that's worth it.  There always seem to be a bunch of screaming kids so I suppose it's child-friendly.   Credit cards only if you get something over $9 which is ridiculous so bring cash.
