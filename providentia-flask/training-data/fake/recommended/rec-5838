I've been to JP's 2 times now. The first night we lied and bailed on some friends at the Continental Midtown and headed to Jose's for drinks that we could actually afford. It was later at night so we walked right in at took seats at the bar. The bartender was sweet and funny, he chatted for a minute and was up on his beer knowledge. The second time we went earlier and the bar was packed. We stood by the front bar waiting for a table and only had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated. This time I'm pretty sure the bartender was also the owner; we asked to start a tab, he asked if we'd be moving to a table and we said yes but would close our tab before we were seated. When our table became available I went to let the bar know and the bartender called our waitress and asked her to move the tab over to our table. We ordered nachos and they were killer; crunchy, creamy, spicy, savory goodness. Yum! Other then those wonderful nachos, the best part of Jose's is the great music they play. It must be someone's iPod mix  because its Marvin Gaye, followed by Curtis Mayfield, followed by  Prince etc... All in all, it's a good time!
