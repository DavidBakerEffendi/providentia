I had never had a salad and fries with my omelet before, but it worked. It was very tasty. But after seeing other people's dishes, I must go back and get the pancakes. One of the interesting things about the restaurant is the curtain that protects the restaurant from the cold air outside. This is a big problem at many of the smaller restaurants. I will be going back when I come back to Brooklyn.
