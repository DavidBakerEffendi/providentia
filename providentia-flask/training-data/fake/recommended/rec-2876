Up until 2005, Koch's would have been an easy five stars.   But in 2005 Bob Koch, last of the Koches, passed away, and the business was sold to someone else. The food is not the same; the cold cuts are poorer quality and the sandwiches are not assembled with the same care.  Can't anyone put together a sandwich?  Maybe it sounds silly to say it, but no.  The Koches really knew sandwiches.  They were sandwich masters.  And they really cared about what they did.  The new guy, not so much. The experience isn't the same either, because the Koch brothers aren't there.  Last time I went in, while I was waiting, I had my laptop open.  "What are you doing?" asked the owner.  Just working, I said.  "Well, it looks kind of suspicious," he said.  Yeah, and screw you too.   The shop still has the same sign, and it still says "Koch's", but it's a lie.  Koch's is closed. Addendum 2011-09-20: I came home from work last week and my wife said "I'm never going to Koch's again".  She had taken my daughter I. and my daughter's friend Z. to Koch's for sandwiches.  The counter guy smiled at I. and said that he liked little girls.  Then he scowled at Z. and said "But I don't like little boys."  Z. was very hurt.  He is only five.
