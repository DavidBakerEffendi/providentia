The decor and atmosphere were authentic and welcoming. The waitress made an excellent saki recommendation and I appreciate the opportunity to taste it before I ordered. We have the garlic oysters, crab rice, hirame ponzu and chocolate souffl√©. It was all great! The only drawback is that we were looking for more of a sushi restaurant and they only had one plate of sashimi.
