Went here twice so far; first in Oct 2012 second in Nov 2012. Not enough great things to say. Food is great, its byob... Can't beat it! Atmosphere is a bit loud but that's a byob and an open space so you expect it a bit. Have had the oyster/mussel appetizer twice and will again. Pastas are fresh and amazing. Specials have looked/tastes great. Highly recommend this spot for a date night or group night up to 6 people.
