Carmines is a place that you definitely need to go to in a group.  If you come here with at least 6 people and an appetite for 8 you can actaully get to try a few different dishes.  We came in a group of 14 so we were able to try quite a few different dishes. First of all their dishes are MASSIVE.  We got a few appetizers, two plates fo calamari and a caesar salad as well as the zuchini fries.  Dinner consisted of about 7 different dishes that I could not possibly name every single one of them.  There was definitely eggplant parm, shrimp on angel hair, chicken scarpariello, broccoli and pasta and some other really good dishes.   I've lived in NY now for 17 years and have come here a total of maybe 6 times.  But everytime I come it is AMAZING! Great spot for groups and it is delicious
