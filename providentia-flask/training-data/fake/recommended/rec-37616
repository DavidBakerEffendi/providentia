Great Brunch is a complicated experience. Not only is it usually a hangover combatant, it also needs to serve those who just got back from yoga or a Sunday run. It requires walking a fine line between relaxed and playful, and experiential and engaging. Cafe Cluny is a good brunch place. Its brightly lit and well decorated in a sweet Parisian motif. You'll get all of the above in subtle measures. The menu is small, but thorough. Their mimosas are also small, but thorough. Their portions are appropriate. The coffee is hot and your cup is always full. They cook their eggs correctly, the hollandaise is yummy, their ingredients are fresh, and the combinations while not original, are nonetheless wonderful. It was a 100% lovely experience, right down the the dark chocolate chunks they serve after your bill is settled. Come here and enjoy it.
