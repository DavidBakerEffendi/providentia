they had a special when I went there with my relatives which at least half of my relatives ordered. The clear soup is soo yummy! The ikura, tamago and ebi aren't anything to get excited over but the shrimp tempura roll is the best i've ever had!!! They had a variety of rolls containing strange combinations like mango and ebi. My brother ordered the shabu shabu and he ate everything! and i mean everything, the waiter was so surprised when a 12 year old boy ordered an old man's dish and then finished it all by himself! oo and btw my brother isn't fat at all he is a skinny as an asian boy can be! Â It is really good and after you can walk to pinkberry just down the street.
