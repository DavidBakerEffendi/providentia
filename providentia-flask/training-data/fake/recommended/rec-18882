Best diner I've ever been to! I have been going here for 5 years ever since I moved to the area. They are open 24 hours, the food is great and the service is wonderful. Nice and clean with awesome prices too. I've never had a bad meal. Every friend I've brought has loved it too. I recommend the special breakfast pancakes or french toast (with the thick challah bread) 2 eggs and style and ham, bacon or sausage for $7. It's so good and the portions are so generous, I have yet to finish the whole thing. They also have a dessert case with the best cakes and pastries that will rival any bakery. Every meal I've had here is awesome! I moved 40 minutes away and I still come here.
