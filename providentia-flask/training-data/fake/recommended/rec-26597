Above is a really cool spot.  I went there for the first time this week.  It's located on top of a really nice local grocery store.  The decor is great and the staff is really nice.  They have an amazing outdoor space overlooking the NJ Transit tracks, which I personally think is really sweet.  I was mainly there for cocktails, but I sampled some small plates.  The braised lamb on crostini was superb.  The spare ribs were tender and phenomenal.  But the best by far was the cannoli.  The cannoli were so fresh and so perfect.  You could tell that they were 100% homemade and fresh that day.
