The atmosphere is quaint and authentic but the attitude is off-putting.  Ask for ketchup or salt for your burger and fries and find out how much you inconvenience you are.  We ordered 4 burgers - all medium - and they all came back rare!  But, by this time we learned not to question.  For a $17 burger, one should get a little more in the way of service.  Food is OK but stays with you. Bloody Marys are delicious.
