When I walked into Applewood, I first noticed a very romantic atmosphere.  I sat down looking towards the bar area and then noticed two gentlemen with very distinguishable facial hair, oddly feeling I was either transported into a fancy Western-European Saloon.  She ordered the drink of the day which included gin, orange bitters, and some other type of alcohol.  I ordered the "Green Tea" which wasn't nearly as strong as my date's. The bread came with three different kinds of spreads and the most prominent was the garlic butter.  The others lacked flavor of any kind.  Our Seared scallops with almonds and honey was divine.  We waited a while for our entrees to come out and it was pretty good.  The lamb was perfectly cooked and the beef short rib was flavorfully and (slow) braised to perfection.  Despite the slow dinner service, I'd come back again for another special occassion.
