What a pleasant surprise!  It's gorgeous inside!  I'm a sucker for the sparkly crystal chandaliers that adore the almost Victorian interior with robin's egg blue walls, mirrors and white frames, all of which give this place a feeling unlike most little Thai joints in the city.  A+ on the cool decor! The food was pretty good too, good pad thai and spring rolls.
