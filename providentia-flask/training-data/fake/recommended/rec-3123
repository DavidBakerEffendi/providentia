recommended by the owner of my favorite santa fe restaurant, we finally got here after weeks of delay. sat down and already knew what to order... the jalapeno corn bead, came out in a hottttttttttttttttt pan from a good graciousssssssss oven (yum-even though could have a stronger kick) the delectable crunchy mac and cheese..mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....felt like it was  made with tender love over the stove top then shoved into the good gracious oven for a few magical moments...it was yums and the country fried steak which wasn't all that to be honest, could barely taste the steak from all that starch but nonetheless very good and worth a try esp for those who loves a goood ol' fry. wonderful service, wonderful ambience, dope asssssssssssssssss decor and folks working there are nonetheless good gracious awesomeness. next time i gotta bring an army of homies here so we can sit on them long ass bench tables, it  kinda carries that medieval feel, makes me want to pound my mason jar'red water and hold up my shining fork and knife and make a dope ass cypher with our utensils while waiting for the soon to melt in your mouth oh my god "is that usher singing to us?" oh my goddddddddddddddddd, food of heaven.
