One word: underwhelmed. The problem with this restaurant is that the food never catches up to the menu. The menu seems creative and flavors seem intriguing but then when your food arrives it's just "meh." We ordered the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella appetizer which was baked and topped with a tomato sauce and breadcrumbs. The breadcrumbs were lost in a sauce which tasted like Ragu. The prosciutto tasted like bacon- not prosciutto. Overall, nothing was delicious except the Baci mousse dessert which was incredible. Otherwise everything else was generic and lacked flavor. The worst part was that it was not great or terrible, just middle of the road. In the middle of our meal, our waiter seemed to vanish and we didn't see him again the rest of the night. Another server took over and she was very nice but it was only after I made eye contact with her did she come to see what we needed. I suggest wine and dessert and forget everything else because you wouldn't miss it if you skipped it.
