It's the simple things in life. Like waking up drunk on a Saturday morning, firing up a little Black Ops, and not moving again until Cosmi knocks on your door to deliver a steaming hot sandwich on a seeded roll. I've gotten pretty good recently. Give me the Skorpion with a silencer and red dot sight, and motherfuckers are going to die. I also need the marathon perk so I can burn ass past all the campers who hide and try to pick you off from the shadows. Fuck you, campers. But what is this? If you listen close, you might hear sleigh bells, the gentle crunch of freshly fallen snow under skids, and perhaps the impatient hoof-falls of eager quadrupeds. Hark! Who is that rapping on my chamber door? Could it be. . .Yes. It must be Cosmi -- no one I know will have awakened before 1pm. And if there's one thing that will rouse me from the sofa now it is the promise of roast pork with sharp provolone and spinach on a seeded roll. Â  His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry! His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! "Heavens, Cosmi! It's deadly cold out there! You must be chilled to the bone -- pray, come in, warm yourself by the fire for a spell." "Bless your heart, but I must decline. I have other boys and girls to visit, with not much time! Lots of hangovers as bad as the pox; for you, must eat, and return to the xbox!" And with that, he returned to the blistering, blustering winter wind; He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight, "Happy gaming to all, and to all a good-night!"
