Small, charming, intimate, and great for people watching in Nolita if you can score an outdoor table on a nice day.  The Avocado on Seven Grain Toast dusted with red pepper flakes, is simple, yet delicious.  The Arugula with beets, apples, olives, walnuts and goat cheese is fresh and flavorful - and under 9 bucks.  The staff is lovely, and the khaki dresses which serve as uniform for the waitresses, add to the whole ambiance.  I don't think it will be too long before I've tried just about every item on the menu - taking a look around is dangerous - you'll want to try one of everything.
