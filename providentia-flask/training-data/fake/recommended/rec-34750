It's hard to find a good and clean South Indian restaurant in Northwest Jersey. Recently, a sweet shop closed down and was turned into a South Indian Restaurant under new management. Finally, my prayers have been answered. It's located in a strip mall off Rt. 46 West and it's between Party city and a convenient store. It has minimal decor but it's spacious and clean; very important. I've been to other restaurants and cleanliness always seems to be an issue but not here. I've been here twice and enjoyed my meal both times. On my first visit, I had this Kerala dish called Vegetable Aviyal with appam. The Aviyal dish is gravy based and it was sufficient for me. In fact, I had mine doggy bagged because I couldn't finish it. I would say that the curries are served in good portions. On my second visit, Â I tried the lamb biryani and enjoyed it very much. The meat was cooked thoroughly and seasoned well with the rice. It tasted as good as the biryani from Hyderabad (known for veg and non veg biryani). My friend had appam and chicken chetinad. He felt that while the appam were good, they were also small and pricey. I hope this place sticks around. I would love to dine here again. Just a couple things for improvement: 1) Create a better website with a menu. 2) Spruce up the decor a bit; it's a bit plain.
