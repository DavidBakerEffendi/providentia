There is one word I'll use to sum up Tia Pol:  Unapologetic. There are many more inventive tapas bars in New York City.  There are those that go out of their way to bend the rules and leave you only with the slightest impression that the food your eating is a cousin of the classing Spanish cuisine.  This is not Tia Pol. The menu - as well as the atmosphere - sticks to true classic and Tia Pol doesn't apologize for it.  They just do what they do well. It's small.  It's loud.  It coveys that "WOW, this is New York"-type feeling that all the tourists seem to love.  You'll have to wait for a table - often for a long period of time - but the service is good and food even better. Their good red Sangria recipe is a good way to start (albeit $30 a pitcher), as are some of the house cured olives.   Fried Chickpeas are good to pop in your mouth, but a bit heavy, in my opinion.   As for the more substantial dishes:  The croquettes are light and crispy on the outside and deliciously gooey and tasty on the inside.  The Bravas are superb, depite a creamier sauce than I've ever encountered.   Chorizo with sherry was tasty, but have fallen short of similar dishes I've tasted in Spain many times.  Cockles in white wine and garlic broth were mouthwatering.   A very memorable octopus salad with fingerling potatoes was tender, tasty and quite generous when it came to portion size. The surprise of the night was at dessert.  The leche frita - basque style fried custard with drunken cherries - could best be described as "custard croquettes".  Similar to a ham croquette, they were filled with delicious, gooey hot custard on the inside.  Beware:  They are heavy. Do I think Tia Pol is as good as Mercat, for example?  No.  But it is well deserving of four stars to recognize its classic Spanish tapas roots and fine service.  I'll be back...
