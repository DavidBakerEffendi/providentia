Good food. Ordered nachos, hot open-faced roast beef sandwich w/mashed potatoes, and french onion soup- for delivery 45 minutes before closing. Food arrived when I was told it would, was hot, and actually had forks, knives & spoons. Soup wasn't incredible, but for delivered french onion, totally acceptable. Nachos (thankfully) had actual melted cheese, not whiz, were loaded with olives & jalape√±os, and accompanied by good fresh salsa. I didn't eat the sandwich, but was told it was very good. Will definitely order from here again.
