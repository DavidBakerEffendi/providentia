First time in New York and I yelped restaurants in Time Square. Carmine's popped up and so we decided to go here. The wait was 1.5 hours... but the bar area was first come first serve. Since there was only 2, the bar was suitable. The service was great and the food was amazing. FYI: each dish can feed up to 3-4 people! We ordered a salad and pasta dish and had way too much leftovers.
