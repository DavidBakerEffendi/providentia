The rumors are true, the food here truly is top-notch. Everything from the french toast, to the eggs, to the grits, to the sugar cured bacon (drools) was fantastic. Very fresh, very tasty. And although good, I still believe the best pancakes in the Tri-State belong to Brownstone Diner in Jersey City. But, all-in-all, Clinton St. provides one fantastic meal. Having said that, I have to give it 4 stars because of the egregious wait times. Clinton St. is a small place, so it's really no fault of their own. If you can curb your hunger and visit during off-peak hours, I'd recommend it in a heart beat. Otherwise, there isn't a single eatery in all of Manhattan worth waiting 3-hours for a meal, no matter how good that sugar cured bacon may be.
