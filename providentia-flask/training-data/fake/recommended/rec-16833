My girlfriend was trying to decide where we wanted to go for her birthday and decided to try Umai because the menu seemed to have some options for non-sushi eaters (in the rest of our group) and that Umai was BYO. After sitting down, our wine and sake were put on ice for us and they brought us wine and sake glasses. We ordered miso soup, veggie dumpling soup, and edamame (not explicitly on the menu).  Everything was good. For dinner, I ordered the king kong roll (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, cucumber, & avocado), a yellowtail roll, and kinmedai/goldeneye snapper nigir.  I was surprised to only get 1 piece of nigiri, since I thought nigiri was traditionally served in pairs.  I was happy with everyone I ordered and the portion size was good. My girlfriend ordered the eternal sunshine roll (panko sea bass, watercress, salmon, avacado, apricot-miso, blueberry-balsamic, and crushed pine nuts) and a spicy tuna roll.  I think the eternal sunshine roll was the highlight of the meal.  It was really really good. For dessert we shared a banana spring roll; banana, ice cream, and red beans... and odd combination, but good.  They were also nice and brought it out with a candle for her birthday. We really liked the atmosphere of the place; it was dark and cozy. My only complaints were: - They had the sushi bar, but no stools/chairs.  When just the two of us go out for sushi, we enjoy sitting at the bar and watching them make our sushi.  This doesn't seem to be an option here. - Service seemed a bit slow at times.  It looked like they only had one waiter for the whole place, so I think he was stretched a bit thin.
