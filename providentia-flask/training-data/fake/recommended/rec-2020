I'm not going to lie, them Eastcoasters know how to make a good sandwich. The cheesestake sandwich is quite literally a perfect sandwich, great combination of cheese and steak resulting in a full flavored sandwich that is both savory and complex. I'm not sure how to explain it, its like a perfect symphony of salt, sugar and grease. Not to mention the great textures from the tender steak and fresh bread. I absolutely love this sandwich. All the hype is real guys. If you're in the East Coast you have to head to Pat's, find that impossible parking space, stand in the wrap around the building queue and spend $10 for a sandwich. You'll leave quite satisfied with everything in life.
