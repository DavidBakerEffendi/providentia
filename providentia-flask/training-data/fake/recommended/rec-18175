I absolutely love this wine, cheese and beer bar!  They have 2 locations.  The staff is extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  I have been there several times and I always have the server recommend a cheese.  I have never been disapointed with their recommendations. The selections on the menu change and our always great!   They have a regular menu as well that I have tried, good, but not near as amazing as their cheese selections! The staff works together to wait on you which is nice because you are never waiting and they are very attentive to asking you for your next drink when you finish.  I do have to say it is pricey, it is not somewhere the average person like me could go on a regular basis.  But when I do get to go on a few special occassions or when I have the extra cash I have never been disapointed and am eager to go again soon!
