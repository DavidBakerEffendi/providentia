Hands down the best hand pulled noodle shop! Absolutely love small family run shops. This is perfect for those chilly nights, so get yourself downtown and treat yourself to a bowl. Not expensive at all for starters!!!! I love getting the house special #2 with hand pulled noodles. It comes with chicken, shrimp, beef and an egg. I also like the classic beef bowl and my friend likes the house special #1, which is a bunch of different beef. The roast pork is also good, I like to add an egg. The pork dumplings are so good too!! Everyone must try this place once in their life
