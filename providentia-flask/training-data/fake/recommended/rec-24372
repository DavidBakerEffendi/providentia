This is the 2nd time we ate at Calabrese. First time we had pizza bites and they were awesome and then grinders which were really skimpy..tasty but skimpy with little meat, cheese, etc.  So we gave it another try.  We had a buy one, get one meal coupon and decided to go back again.  It was horrible, terrible, I cannot even explain how bad.  A Friday night at 7:30 and we were the only people in the place. We ordered 2 dinners with soup.  The beef vegetable soup was awful, some kind of spice or something like chemical taste.  We were afraid of getting sick, so we did not eat it.  Waiter came over and asked if we were all set and wanted dessert and we had not even received our dinners yet..what???  No one pays attention at this place. One ordered veal parm and got chicken parm, the sauce on the pasta was watery with big chunks of tomatoes that did not look too fresh.  I ordered chicken marsala which was tart and lemony and not any kind of marsala I ever tasted before and I asked for it over pasta and the pasta came on the side with that same horrible tasting red/watery sauce. Waiter said it would take 10 minutes to remake, I said forget it. And they overload every single dish with parsley flakes...soup, pasta, meals, everything with parsley to hide the looks and taste of the dish.  I would never recommend this place..not worth the money and takes way too long to get your meal (and we were the only ones in the place).  The waiter said try the pizza since they don't usually mess that up....what's up with that?  Thank god we had one meal for free because of the coupon or we would have put up a big stink to pay for food that was not edible..
