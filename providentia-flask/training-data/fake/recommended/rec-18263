We went for Mother's Day Brunch and the experience in a word was awful. First, the lady at the door asked me for my name and number and proceeded to tell us our party had arrived. She showed us to a table where another family was sitting. I told her that I didn't know these people. She said I should wait outside until she resolved the issue. After 10 minutes I complained and she moved the family to another table. She then said we can sit down. I asked her to change the settings and water classes and she threw a fit. I said they were there for over 15 minutes and how do I know they didn't drink out of the glasses. That was the start. The food was subpar, basic waffles,French toast,eggs and 1 "carving station". Since we were almost last to get to the buffet, most of the trays were empty and we had to ask to get them refilled. The desert was Â non existent . On top of all that they added a 20% gratuity for non existent service. Stay away for these types of events.
