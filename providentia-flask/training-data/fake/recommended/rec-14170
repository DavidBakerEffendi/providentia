I miss Palo Santo. First, great dinners. I remember when it first opened and the chef/owner served up AMAZING chef's menu dinners. Everything was always perfect. Meats were cooked perfectly, savory, and never over-seasoned. Get the chicken offal grilled on skewers. Perfect latin street food! But the BRUNCH is TO DIE FOR. Every time I went, I always left stuffed. I loved the various fish (soft shell crab, even!) on grits, and the oh-so-delicious hash. The potato hash is also amazing, as is the whole baked plantain, served with sour cream topped with brown sugar. Mmmm!!! The decor is a little funny, with the knick knacks in the tables. They look too shiny when compared with the rustic decor.
