For some reason, this is currently the highest rated Vietnamese restaurant in Chinatown, at least according to Yelp. Unfortunately, I didn't even get to try the food. I write a blog called Pho Across America, where I go and eat pho in every state. I was really surprised that Bo Ky's menu only had two types of pho, and they were hidden in the middle of the disorganized menu. What a lack of variety! I just wanted to order a basic Pho Tai, but the aggressive server was hounding me about what type of noodles I wanted. I just wanted regular pho noodles, but somehow we could not communicate. It got to the point where I was just so turned off and uncomfortable that I wanted to leave. My first impression of Bo Ky was that it was surprisingly busy for such a dingy looking restaurant. The food here must be very good, because the service and atmosphere certainly won't bring in customers.. I can usually put up with a lot to give the food a try, but I just felt so unwanted here.
