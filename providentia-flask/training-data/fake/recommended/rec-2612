Ok, I know they may have been the first, but Pat's, like Geno's, makes a shitty steak.  They are oily and just not good, the lines can be massive, and you have to eat outside or in your car.  Any pizzeria in the city or suburbs will make you a steak 10 times better, and with 10 times less attitude.  Go to Jim's at 4th and South if you want a well-known tourist place, they make a decent steak and there's a dining room on the second floor, all around way better than Pat's or Geno's.  Just like Flavor Flav said, don't believe the hype.
