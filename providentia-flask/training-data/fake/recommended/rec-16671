If you want to go to an authentic Japanese cafe in NYC, you should go to Cha-An. I had a lunch special and matcha there, and it was excellent. (Eel donburi was super good!!) I went there several times on weekend, and it was too crowded that I couldn't get in. It is too bad that place it too small!!
