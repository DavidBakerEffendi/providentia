Our experience at In Riva was really great.  I went in with a little trepidation after having read all of the reviews about great food but poor service.  I don't know what all of those people were talking about or who they were served by, but the service on Saturday night was wonderful.  The hosts were very friendly and our server was incredibly attentive.  The servers were dressed pretty casually as were most of the patrons.  I saw no signs of snobbiness, aloofness, or misery.  Maybe we got lucky, but we had a great experience.  We tried one Vasi (bruschetta), one small plate, one pasta, and one pizza.  The meatballs were by far the best thing we ate and probably the best I've ever eaten.  The rest of our food was delicious as well and I felt like I needed to be rolled home.  I'm pretty certain we'll be back again.
