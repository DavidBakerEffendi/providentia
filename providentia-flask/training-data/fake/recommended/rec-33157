Il Bambino is an excellent place. I live only a few blocks away, and it has become a staple for us. This place is great for a quick lunch, a casual dinner with a bottle of wine, or a delicious brunch. The staff there is great - always very friendly and casual. Good service when you sit down. Speedy food when you take out. When we eat in at Il Bambino, we usually order a starter - we've really enjoyed the Baby String Beans (smothered in cheese and truffle oil - it's not a healthy option, but it's really really good) and the Marinated Sardines (really tasty drizzle of chili and tomato). As for the actual paninis, we've had so many great ones! The Mortadella is my personal favorite, with the Chicken Cutlet (with spicy mayo) coming in a close second. Friends have really loved the Bresaola and the Italian Meatloaf. Their brunch paninis are also amazing. The smoked bacon, scrambled eggs, artisan cheddar, truffle oil - what amounts to a really fancy bacon, egg, and cheese - is awesome. As is the Weekend Debris and Piggy Got Back. Great place. Much more than your average panini.
