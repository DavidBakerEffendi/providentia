We were originally in line for Grimaldi's, but with my grandparents and my aunt waiting a few blocks down, we were not looking for a 1+ hour wait for a togo order, so we went next door, to Juliana's. What some people fail to realize as they wait FOREVER at Grimaldi's is that the original owner of Grimaldi's opened up and works at Juliana's. She even came out and talked to some of us as we waited for our pizza to be ready. She made Grimaldi's what it is today, and then sold the name, and started Juliana's. So, by dining at Juliana's, you are getting the authentic Grimaldi's. So, we ordered the margherita pizza which consists of marinara, cheese, and basil. Simple, yet very delectable. We also ordered the white pizza, which is pizza without any marinara sauce, cheese, and garlic. To my shocking surprise, it was actually pretty good. Although, I would of LOVED to try their marinara pizza, which is pizza with only marinara sauce. MY FAVORITE. If I'm ever back in NY, which I highly plan that I will be after this one week experience, I will definitely come back and dine here again.
