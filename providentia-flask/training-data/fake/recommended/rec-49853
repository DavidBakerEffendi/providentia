My boyfriend and I stopped in here last week and we each got an item from the lunch special menu. Each entree came with a soup, so I ordered the lentil and Joe ordered the tomato. The lentil was good, but the tomato was to die for. I'm not a big fan of tomato soup, but I would eat this every day for the rest of my life. The flavors were deep and complex, and you could tell a lot of love went into it. I can't remember what our entrees were called, but they were sizeable and delicious. We felt a bit under dressed for the atmosphere, so I wouldn't recommend sweats and teeshirts. The service was excellent, and the turkish coffee and small dessert we tried were the perfect end to the meal. Any time we find ourselves in the area again, we'll surely be paying them a visit.
