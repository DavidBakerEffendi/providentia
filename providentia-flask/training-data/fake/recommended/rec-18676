The food is great. The drinks are great. Let's talk about the service for a moment. I ordered one of their delicious cocktails across the street at Whiskey Soda Lounge, waiting for my table to be set up back at Pok Pok. Five minutes later, I was told it was ready so my friends and I grabbed our things and went back to the restaurant. Two of us brought our drinks along but they were immediately taken away by one of the waitresses at Pok Pok. When asked why, she said they didn't allow beverages to be moved from across the street, which seems all too confusing. First, they ask us to wait for our table at their bar across the street, order drinks (which are offered on both Whiskey and Pok's menus), come back and order food, but not let us finish the drinks we bought from them just minutes earlier. Will I go back? The wings tell me yes. I'd say skip the wait at their lounge and get boozy with the fun folks over at B61 instead.
