Ordered delivery. Food came reasonably fast. Food had very little taste and was not very hot. Also the two entrees did not  come with rice. This was a surprise as the order was 32 $. I called to ask if they forgot the rice and the man was rude and hung the phone up on me. Terrible customer service, just ok food, reasonable delivery time. I would not recommend anyone order from this restaurant. The food is hardly  above any corner Chinese food establishment found anywhere in the city.
