Don't believe the hype. This place just isn't good. Went here with some family over Thanksgiving break for a later lunch around 2pm. Place was packed, the waitress assigned our five person party to a booth meant for four, so we were rubbing elbows the whole time and uncomfortable. Service was slow. A Vermont native now living in Atlanta, I'm used to 5 minute long stoplights and slower service in general, but this was just bad. Didn't get water for 15 minutes after we sat down. Got drinks about a half hour after we sat down. The flatbread stunk. We got a couple of them, a plain cheese and one with some vegetables. It was thin, which is my favorite kind, but it was not crispy at all - floppy, soggy and plenty of hot grease to burn the top of your mouth. Three of five of us experienced stomach issues for the rest of the night after eating here. Burlington has many great restaurants, and this is not one of them. Avoid.
