Delicious and well-priced.  I will definitely go back. After a long walk from the Financial District on a cold and rainy Sunday night, Da Mikele delivered... The space itself was beautifully done; exposed brick, huge bar, and a very open space.  It's nice to have dinner and not be so cramped once in a while. I have to say, I'm not a big fan of Italian cuisine to begin with but this food was on point.  Right off the bat, the focaccia bread, which was delivered in sack was some of the best bread that I've ever had.  Really fresh and soft.  It was perfect and it didn't hurt that the olive oil was great too. I couldn't stop eating it.  I just wanted to dip it into everything... Here's what we ordered: Bottle of Pinot Noir Gnocchi Alla Sorrentina tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil Calamari In Umido Con Semi Di Finocchietto stewed calamari in tomato sauce, fennel seeds Sauté Di Cozze sauteed mussels, cherry tomatoes, white wine Risotto Con Gli Asparagi asparagus, parmigiano Saporita arugula, sun-dried tomates, black olives, prosciutto Nonna Lucia Or Grandmother's Pizza (michele's grandmother's original recipe. where it all started) filet of san marzano tomatoes, garlic, oregano and basil Risotto and gnocchi were both very creamy.  The calamari was great and not that chewy kind you get at some restaurants.  The mussels we didn't order but they accidently brought it out to us.  That doesn't suck and it was delicious, really fresh and sauce was very tasty.  The pizza was probably the only thing that I wouldn't order again.  Don't get me wrong, it was great but it doesn't compare to Mikele's other restaurant (Luzzo's).  Again, will definitely go back...
