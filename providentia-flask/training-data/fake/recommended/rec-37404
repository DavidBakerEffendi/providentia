I read Anella tried to have someone's review taken down?  We came here as a party of 8 one night and the hostess told us we'd have to pay a flat fee per person to eat.   Huh?  The place was empty, so we just broke up into two tables and had a kind of miserable dinner experience to avoid being gouged.
