Good bar in the theatre district, a place to step away from all the tourists in Times Square and Restaurant Row. They've got a pretty large space on 54th street with two levels, so I can imagine it getting packed at times. I've only been when business is slow, but I think that's when you'll best enjoy this place. They've got a really wide array of beers and the food is pretty darn good. Highly recommend the Three Monkeys Southern Style Chicken Wings.
