Cool vibe. It's set in an older build with brick inside, but also has a very modern vibe as well. Very cool! Very friendly staff as well. And on top of that, a GREAT menu. We had a variety of food for lunch from udon (veggie and tonkatsu) to bento and sushi rolls. All was put together expertly, looked great, and tasted even better. DEFINITELY a place I'd go back to!!
