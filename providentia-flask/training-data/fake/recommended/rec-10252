This is a great new Basque wine/tapas place in the e village.  They have a nice wine selection, though I opted for the red sangria which was delish. If you are into sherry, they have plenty of it (incl interesting sherry cocktails), so this is the place for you. The menu is kind of unique, but there is plenty to eat for everyone and the staff is very nice and knowledgeable and thru will explain it since its a bit unusual for nyc. My boyfriend had one of the fish plates which he enjoyed and I had some cheese and a few tapas..all very good. The artichoke spread was yummy.  I definitely recommend trying it out.
