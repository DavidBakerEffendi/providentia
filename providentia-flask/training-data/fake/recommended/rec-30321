We are visiting from S.F. And are food/wine/cocktail picky. To start with the bartenders were great, knowledgeable, friendly, and had great recommendations. The food was great too.  The only thing keeping this from being a four star review was that our 8:45 reservation became a 9:05 seating....  Did I mention how great the bar staff was?
