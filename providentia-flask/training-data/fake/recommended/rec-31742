Went there late night for some drinks and snacks.   Was greeted by the bartender (owner?) Mark who was very welcoming.  Sat at a gorgeous table in front of the open window and proceeded to eat and drink more than we wanted but everything was so wonderful and the music was FABULOUS!!!!   We had the shrimp quesadillas and chicken wings which were both delicious.  Then came dessert.  Omg.  The creme brûlée was one of the best I've ever eaten.  The drinks were original but simple.  I have to be honest and say I got plastered on some agave tequila drink that was light and refreshing.   The waitress was sweet and the bartender Mark was helpful and a genuinely nice guy.  2 appetizers, 4 drinks, 2 beers, 2 sodas and 2 desserts was only $60.00.  And there are three cute outside tables.   Lots of GF options as well.  Gluten free beer too!
