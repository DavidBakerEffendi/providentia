This place has the best Mediterranean food in the city hands down.  I highly recommend ordering several plates of different apps so you can enjoy the full experience.  They are nice sized and your pallet will thank you.  Reservations are a must and even then you will probably wait 20 min or so.  Hey the bar is a good place to wait anyway.  Packed most evenings and fri/sat are insane.  It can get loud but i assure you its worth it.  Wished i lived closer so i could eat there more.  The block its on also has great bars to enjoy both before for a pre meal buzz or after to help digest.  Dont miss out on a great place folks!!!!
