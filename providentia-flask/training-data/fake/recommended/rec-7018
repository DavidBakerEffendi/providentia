Let me start by saying that the food is amazing and if I were judging solely on the food, I'd give it five stars. The service, however, is another story. I've been here three times, and each time (with different servers), the wait has been excruciatingly long and my order was delivered wrong. Most recently, I ordered a pumpkin biscuit (the pumpkin biscuits are mindblowing btw), but was disappointed to be delivered a regular biscuit. Our server was nice, kind, and accommodating but ultimately incompetent. This may be a reflection of the fact that beehive oven is less than six months old and is still finding its sweet spot. I feel bad giving it two stars but I feel like the terrible service really needs to be acknowledged.
