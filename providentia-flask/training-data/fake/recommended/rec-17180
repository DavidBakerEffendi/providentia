Like the saying goes: the best things come in small packages. In this case "it ain't a lie". The Islands is a tiny restaurant that you would barely notice when passing by (driving). You walk in and you won't be impressed by the setup... The kitchen reminds me of the old time Caribbean kitchens in which grand ma's would whip up  anything thrown at them.  Well, the cook got some humongous shrimp thrown at her after I ordered " calypso shrimp".  In the raw, the shells were removed right before my very eyes and placed in an aged pan. Added was some kind of coconut mixture which (I'm smh in disbelief) must have been brought from the heavens.. In about 10 or 15 mins my meal was ready.  I asked what it was served with and she said the only thing it will be good with is white rice.... So white rice it was... I paid my best spent $14 and took my calypso shrimp to my quarters where I could sing my calypso    without being an annoyance...  The calypso shrimp from The Islands is  the reigning calypso king...
