The food is great! The prices are outrageous! The pizza was very very good as was the salad both house and Caesar.service was fine as is the decor I paid with tip $84 for a medium pizza $16 with 2 toppings($4 each) so $24 for a medium pizza.... Not even in Manhattan!!! A small personal size pizza with 2 toppings 2 salads and 2 beers 1 soda and we split a desert.i guess you pay for quality but family pizza night $84 seems about $20 too high want to come here weekly will probably monthly and without toppings beers and desert to bring the bill down to tolerable Good Luck the neighborhood needed a quality pizza place but ...jeez...
