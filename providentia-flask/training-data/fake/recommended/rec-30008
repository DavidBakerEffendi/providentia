This was our first visit to Eno Terra.  Went on a Monday night to celebrate son's birthday.  Restaurant was reasonably crowded, even on a Monday evening.  Was really impressed with the entire experience, from the hostess, to the very down to earth waitress, to the thoughtfully prepared food.  Some more traditional menu items mixed in with some excellent twists.  I started with a delicious, fresh heirloom tomato salad with crisp capers.  Perfect.  My husband and son had a mixed salami and cheese platter, which was both ample and delicious.  We had three different pasta dishes, all a bit different and all delicious.  We will defiinitely include this on our list of places to return.
