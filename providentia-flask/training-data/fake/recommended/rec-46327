3 times in 3 weeks.  I'm a fan.  Very small space which I've seen packed and relatively quiet + locals who pick up for dinner (brilliant, I would do this regularly if I were a full time TriBeCa resident).  This is not the place you go to for an amazing ambiance or service experience, but it's reasonable and the food is great. Highly recommend the bolognese, the tomato and mozarella salad, the spinach and ricotta dumplings (a special - which needs to be a regular menu item), and the chicken.  Mangia!
