I love this place.  I had the Monday night $28 deal with the fried chicken and the pecan pie dessert.  I accidentally got the salad rather than the appetizer I ordered and they let me keep both.  The food was awesome, but the staff particularly impressed me with how attentive and understanding they were with my badly behaved toddler.  Despite the fact that it got quite crowded after 7pm, they were quick to change the paper table cover after his spill, and were cool when he made a couple of mad dashes across the dining room.  The fried chicken plate was enough to share for the kiddo, and the popovers were simply orgasmic.
