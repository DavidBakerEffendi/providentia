I turned the ripe old age of 30 this week and decided to ring in the "dirty" at FDR (I like that nickname).  I've been walking by this place on the way to the gym for months now, wondering what they were doing in there (as it isn't that big).  Well they have done right.  The wall to wall white tile somehow gives off a coziness when paired with a place of this size.  They killed it on the atmosphere.  This place is will be crowded most nights with the affluents of the neighborhood, just like they pulled off at Pub & Kitchen. I am giving it four stars because they (wait-staff and owners (who were undoubtedly on hand to make sure everything was running smoothly on one of their first nights)) were awesome, and the oysters, beef tartare, and rib were all good.  For just opening, they did a pretty good job of keeping the flow going.  There isn't much room in there and this is definitely not a place you want to go and drink like P&K.  They did run out of there only veggie option, which was fine for us, but could be a dangerous thing to do with those crazy vegetarians. So for now, well done FDR.  I will be back again to see how things are once you have hit your stride. Tip #2: Don't bring your children to this place, bring them to Tinto apparently.
