Home made ketchup, amazing sausage, biscuits are the best, with jam on the table, always comes with side of fruit of the day, sometimes cinnamon baked apples! Great service, low price, good coffee. Get here early, there is always a line. Ps. ALL they do is breakfast... So you know they do it right.
