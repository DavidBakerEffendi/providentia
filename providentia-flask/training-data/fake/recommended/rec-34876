I don't get it. The pizza was not only not good, it was bad. I don't mind the wait and rude waiters if the pizza is going to be a mind blowing experience, but it was terrible. Thin crust pizza with flavorless sauce and yes they use real mozzarella cheese but it had no flavor and not enough salt. Tourist. Trap.
