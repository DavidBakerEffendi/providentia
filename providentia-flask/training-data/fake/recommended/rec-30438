The wait was not bad - which in NYC is a big plus. The food was great - I ordered the Fontina Omlette and we ordered the Pumpkin Pancakes to share for the table - it was tasty! The only downsides were that we were in the side room which was closed off and therefore pretty noisy. The service wasn't super speedy - which was ok since we weren't on a specific schedule - but I could see that it could bother some.
