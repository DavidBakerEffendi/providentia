Beware of the cleanliness of all plates and cups. Although food was typical diner food, it's nothing to write home about.  Their convenient location is the only plus, and certainly not their customer service.  On our recent visit for lunch, 3 out of 4 glasses of water they served has small bugs with wings in them. As if that wasn't bad enough, my 87 year old mother, who was finishing a cup of coffee, suddenly encountered a sweet and low wrapper in the bottom of the cup - and no one at the table uses sugar or sweet and low.  They served her coffee in a dirty cup!   The coffee being the last draw, we brought it to the attention of the owner, whose response was that they would take 2 sodas and the coffee off the bill.  Are you kidding me!!! They just lost our business and hopefully that of future customers who read this review.  I don't want to leave out, though, that our waiter was very good and quite attentive - but that won't make any of us go back.
