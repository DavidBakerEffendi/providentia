No complaints about the food, but the staff is lacking in professionalism.  I once ate here on a less than busy Sunday and was shocked to find one of the girls who worked the cash register painting her toes at one of the tables in between customers.  That was a first for me in any restaurant I have been too and makes me question the controls in place regarding the cleanliness of this place. I will look elsewhere for places to eat.
