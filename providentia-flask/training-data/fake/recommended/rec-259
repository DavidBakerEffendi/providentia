Order the fritanga and some maduros. Bogota does a fabulous job labeling the menu's gluten-free and vegan items, and they fry their empanadas in canola oil. Early week visits mean Happy Hour all day. Their coconut margaritas on the rocks are my personal jam, but I've yet to go wrong alcohol-wise. The coded menu will help you out Â once you're past your prime. Order another fritanga, it'll sober you up. The ribs are cooked in red wine, so order those too. The decor is on the kitschy side, but with my mouth so full of delicious meat, I barely noticed.
