Vintage is not Tria. Many places are not Tria. Only Tria can be Tria. But that's an okay thing, because Vintage is Vintage, and it's very different. It's warm, and attention to detail has been paid to the menu and to the setting. Vintage is welcoming, and with $3 happy hour house wines, Vintage serves lovely by the glass.
