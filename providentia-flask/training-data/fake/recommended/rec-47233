Unlike the others, I came here for dinner, not brunch, but my experience was just as great as most of the others. Even if you just slightly like hummus, I strongly encourage their hummus plate! It is delicious, and totally worth another visit just for their hummus. Yum! I also ordered the linguine with sauteed shrimp, but I thought it was just alright. Could definitely do better elsewhere. They have pretty good mashed potatoes, though. The restaurant itself is very nice. It is a large space, so you aren't sitting neck-to-neck with the people beside you. The staff is also attentive and cute. They gave off uber-positive vibes. Definitely recommend.
