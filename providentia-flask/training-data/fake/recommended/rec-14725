Nice little place to pick up some of the best empanadas in Queens. I have only been here once so I can only comment on the ones I had. I had the beef, the chicken, the pork, shrimp and of course because everyone says they are great I had to try the sweet plantain and mozzarella empanada. I must say they were all great and look forward to trying all the other ones they make. They make everything fresh and each different empanada in seperate bags so you can tell them apart which is nice. Parking is really easy around this place since it's mostly residential. Prices range from $1.25 and up per empanada.Not a bad deal for what you get in each empanada. They also have strange empanadas that I have yet to try like the pesto and cheese and sweet ones like the nutella and banana. I can't wait to get that one next. I didn't realize they make that until after I left with my empanadas. Bottom line: This place is a must try. Great for parties as well!!
