This is probably the shortest review I'm ever going to write. What we ordered: Buffalo Chicken Pizza - from several positive-ish reviews I'd read on yelp Sweet Potato Fries - from one good review I'd read on yelp Sweep potato fries were soggy, but edible. I wouldn't order them again, but that's because I'm not a fan of sweet potato fries unless they're done really well. Pizza was greasy, and looking at the chicken kind of scared me. A lot of people have complaints about the crust, but I kind of liked it. Did I feel like I was going to have a heart attack after eating my fill? Yes. Was it worth it? Probably not. But EBAs is convenient as hell.
