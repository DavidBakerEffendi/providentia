I've been to Adobe a few times & have always had a great meal, great drinks & a great time. The salsa is so fresh. The margaritas seem a little light on tequila but they do pack a punch - go for the Blue one.  The beer menu is extensive. I've seen a wide array of different groups of people.  Last week I got there at about 6:30 & it was filled with families with children having dinner and as it got later the crowd changed to more couples & singles.
