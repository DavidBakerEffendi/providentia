Great neighborhood dinner place. Great for a date or a small group of friends. An intimate environment and can get a little loud. Food is comforting and overall well executed. We had the soft pretzels and beer cheese to share (so addicting!) and the carbonara flatbread with a perfect egg on top was a lovely mix of creamy, salty and crunchy. My husband got the buttermilk fried chicken which was well seasoned and crispy and perfectly juicy. There was a salty Asian sauce which was a twist from their usual menu, I think, but we didn't necessarily think it added much to the dish. There was also a small side of grits. I had the slow roasted pork shoulder with fennel and creole mustard which I thought was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. You also get a complimentary bag of cookies. That night the flavor was ginger chipotle. Interesting but probably not something I would buy. Can't wait to come back to try the other things on the menu!
