Cool neighborhood spot. Definitely a loyal recurring crowd. So much so, new comers may find it cliqy. Gets cramped on Fri nights. Small lounge area at front doesn't really allow for lounging. Restaurant seated area in back more roomy. Decent drinks, cool staff. Try the jerk salmon. Trust me its so effin good w/ the black rice. If you're not a fan of spicy, make sure you mention to lighten the spices. The music can get deafeningly loud giving the impression of a club. Still, an okay weekend spot. Worth checking out
