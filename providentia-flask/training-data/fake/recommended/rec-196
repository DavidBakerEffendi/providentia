Friends and I were at Nai on Friday night. This restaurant has the perfect ambiance and amazing food. The four of us shared about 10 plates and it was more than enough food. My favorites were the shrimp in garlic and the fried feta cheese wrapped in ham. We also tried the meatballs, clams in spicy sauce, mussels, croquettes and patatas bravas. I would recommend all of these dishes! Hopefully we will be back to this restaurant next time we are in the city.
