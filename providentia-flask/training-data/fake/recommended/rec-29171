The food is very tasteful and at a very reasonable price . The portions are also very generous . I've had Peruvian food in Miami and NYC so this is not my first time . It was pretty crowded when we went for dinner but our waiter forgot to put one of our orders in and he did not notice until we flagged him down about 20 mins after getting everyone else's food . Other than that , I had a good experience here .
