Balls of meat. That's it! You certainly need to have balls to build a two hour wait restaurant out of it, but I have to admit they do make good stuff. I've been here once but my boyfriend is addicted to it. I got the chicken meatballs with mushroom gravy and one of the little sandwiches with a veggie burger in parmesan sauce. It's as good as it sounds, really. However, my boyfriend might be able to eat meatballs every week but for me the menu is a little short and that's why I'm giving them 4 stars. And 5 stars for the music and the ambience!
