My first Philly cheesesteak and the best I've had so far! I'm a girl from Cali so we don't have anything like a cheesesteak to compare it to. But my oh my, Sonny's was so damn good. I got the original cheesesteak with cheese wiz and onions and everything was PERFECTION. Bread was soft and moist but still had a bite to it, cheese wiz was smothered just perfectly to hold everything together and those caramelized onions.....mmmmmmmmm... Meat wasn't dry and everything tasted bomb.com they don't skimp on the meat either so get ready to be full.
