I went here with a friend of mine who is vegan, not knowing what I was in store for. The setting is cute, with nice seating upstairs, lit with small candles. My friend got the vegetable platter and loved it. I tried the Foule (like smashed up chili), which was also very good. I'm glad that I tried a new place and a different cuisine. They also have "more American" options if you are not as adventurous, like wraps and sandwiches. And the woman who ran the place was very sweet and hospitable. I'm sure that I will be back. Also, there were amazing looking chocolate chip cookies in the jar as the counter--but I resisted the temptation. Next time I wont.
