Having eaten here on a number of occasions, I can honestly say that I have never been even a tad disappointed.  At my last visit with a few friends, we were promptly greeted, seated and offered a drink and wine list.  Our meals were outstanding - salad (not drenched in some awful bottled dressing), delicious bread, gnocchi, an incredible branzino, a super chicken dish.  The wine list has many moderate choices and we were lucky enough to choose a fine wine at a most reasonable price.  I can't wait to go back!
