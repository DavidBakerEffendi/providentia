I really don't see what people like about this place. Did not enjoy any of the pizzas and pastas my friends ordered or I did myself. We expected so much more from a restaurant that's rated four and half stars. Service was fine, although I never got my refill diet coke. Paid 14 bucks for 3 tiny pieces of Calamari. I will never come back.
