Was in town looking at a few universities for my kid #1. After our visit, My husband and I said that we can't ride back up the NJ Turnpike without getting a philly cheese steak. I met a philly native a few weeks ago at my son's school and she suggested we head to Dalessandro's. We parked the car and saw a line 1/2 way down the block. Ok, the food must be delicio :) I knew we had to figure out how to order and to order quick (my husband and I are native New Yorker's so  being quick is natural to us. We ask for 3 cheese steaks.  the lil Ms behind the counter says salt, pepper, ketchup and mayo? I say, "ok throw  all of that on it". she says, it comes with a marinara sauce...what? My daughter says, just put mayo, salt and pepper. I guess that was the wrong thing to say so Lil Ms. tore off the order slip in such a way that I guess she was annoyed. She stared at my daughter and I stared directly back with the deadpan poker face (she was only taking the order) not on the grill. I play poker face games with a sort of Mr Grinch smile very well :) Anyhow, the cheese steak was a great eat riding back up the NJ Tpke...did I say when my husband reached the register the Big Ms. Mom was worse than the Lil Ms Daughter-lol. Philly is similar to New York and both of them need to remember this...You can't intimidate a New Yorker. So great sandwich with one star taken off for the 2 Ms personalities. NOTE: CASH ONLY
