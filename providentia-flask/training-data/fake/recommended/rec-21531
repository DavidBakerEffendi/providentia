First time in Philadelphia looking for a good Cheesesteak and figured I'd skip the mandatory Pat and Geno's tourist trap since it didn't get particularly good ratings on Yelp.  Chose Cosmi's due to the high rating, just a small no frills deli which is what i expected.  The cheesesteak was good, but didn't blow my mind.  The Italian cold cut however was exceptional.  There was one small table in doors and another out on the street, again it is not a restaurant just a deli.
