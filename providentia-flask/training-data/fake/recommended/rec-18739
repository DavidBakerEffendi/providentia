I had the Sheeps Milk Dumplings with tomato, pine nuts, and spicy lamb sausage and it was soo good! It wasn't spicy at all and it was the perfect portion after eating the spread/pita appetizer. The environment was nice, a bit loud, and they were packed on a Tuesday night which is always a good sign. Will definitely be coming back!
