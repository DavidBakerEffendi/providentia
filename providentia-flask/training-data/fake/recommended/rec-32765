Fantastic! Great food, great service!! Love this place! Highly recommended! Between the 4 of us tried many items on menu. One of my favorites is the spare ribs, which my daughter had. She loved it as well. I had the trio of tuna as my entree, fantastic, had Caesar salad for starter. Also excellent. My husband started with the lobster bisque, which was also great. Other highlights were chicken sliders, fried chicken dish, everyone enjoyed their meals. We also loved the Cabernet that was highlighted on drink menu. Have fun!
