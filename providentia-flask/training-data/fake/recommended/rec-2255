Great sandwich, but overpriced. I got the beef brisket with that smokey sharp provolone and peppers. Damn you smokey provolone! I've been fantasizing about you for a week now; you're the best I've ever had. Mmmm... I want you, I need you, my life is incomplete without you. Anyways, that brisket is pretty damn good too. Topped with a rich gravy, these sandwiches would be insulted by the mere thought of adding a condiment. This is a must eat establishment with several choices of meats: pork, roast beef, or the brisket. My one complaint is the price- $9.75 for my brisket w/ provolone and peppers. However, once you have this sandwich, price is not even a consideration. Enjoy and stay hungry my friends.
