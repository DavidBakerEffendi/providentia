This was one of the most enjoyable dinners I've had in awhile. The service and atmosphere here are phenomenal from the minute you walk through the door till the minute you leave. It Â felt very raw and earthy, but supremely refined -with woods, bricks, and metals. On the food side, my steak was absolutely delectable, prepared just as I ordered it. I will definitely be returning soon.
