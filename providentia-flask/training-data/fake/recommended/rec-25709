Great beer selection and they have cider as well for those of us who can't or don't want to drink beer. James the owner is nice, although his mom can be a little scary at times. I recommend the Mexican food on the menu, like the quesadilla, as the cooks are all Hispanic. For pizza there are probably better places, but Mad Greeks is good if you want your beer and food in the same place for a good price.
