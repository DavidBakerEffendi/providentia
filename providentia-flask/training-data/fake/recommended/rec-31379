The only reason I'm hesitant on giving this 4 stars is because I don't want it to become too popular and have a wait time on weekends. Love being able to walk in here on Saturday and know there will be an open table, but not empty where we feel like were eating alone and being watched by waitstaff. Friendly folks, great ambience and natural lighting. outdoor seating in summer is great. Food is better than your average diner and reasonably priced. coffee is great. but menu is limited. The specials are nice but pricey and not always available. We go almost every weekend.
