The duck skewer is pretty delicious.  The pork belly was too fatty, and I can't believe I'm saying this but, it was too pork-y tasting; it was unpleasant.  We tried the fried gizzards (meh), the wasabi shumai (I'm a big fan of wasabi, and I just found the wasabi in this to be waaay too strong; it was definitely offputting), and cod roe rice roll (decent, but not great), yellow tail collar (pretty delicious; it's moist & full of flavor).  Service was great and the atmosphere is definitely fun, but I wouldn't come back.
