I have not eaten here, so this is not about the food. Â I'd noted sometime back that Wednesday was jazz night here and finally got out the door and walked over. It was an odd night as it's Rosh Hashana and a lot of the usual jazz crowd was not there, so they said. There was a woman at the piano, a man singing and one couple in the restaurant at 9:00 PM. I ordered a glass of wine, but was told that I would be charged a $30 cover charge if I didn't order that in food. $30 for jazz is fine if I'm in New York and have albums by the artist, but this is Philadelphia. Come on. I promptly walked out.
