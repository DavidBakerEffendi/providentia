boyf says: lovely. fantastic selection of local and imported beers, representing a wide variety of different styles and regions. had a great list of general belgisch, sour and wild ales too. had the pan-fried shishito peppers which was a great appetizer, especially with the balsamic sauce and grilled lemon they provided. this, along with the coarse sea salt on the peppers themselves, made the appetizer quite addictive. i went with the tap burger for my main, which was motherfunking juicy and heavy on the yums. also tried some of the girlf's ricotta gnocchi, which i would definitely eat again (though in her opinion it was a little too heavy). huge, multifaceted venue, with pretty outdoor seating and a spacious, woody interior. kitchen looked professional and sparkling clean as well. service was a bit slow overall, but it was quite busy and the waiter was generally very attentive. overall, 4.5 stars.
