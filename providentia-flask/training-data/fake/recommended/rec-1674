Terrible!  I lived in Norristown for years.  My mother lived in Philly for years.  I've eaten good Philly steak sandwiches made by small "mom and pop" delis.   I came back to this part of the country in April of 2010.  Went to Genos for their famous steak sandwich.  I was appalled! The meat was gristly and the "cheese" is Cheez Whiz or something close.  It's ladled on.  I wish we had chosen Pat's instead of Geno's.  I don't know if Pat's is better, as we didn't eat there, but it couldn't possibly be worse. F.Y.I.:  There IS a line around Geno's but I cannot understand why unless it's because they are all new customers and have not eaten there before. Stay away!  We won't be back.
