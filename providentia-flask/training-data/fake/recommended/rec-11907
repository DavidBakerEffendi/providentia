it's like going on a culinary retreat. absolutely delightful. we've been here four times now, while today was the first visit for brunch. freshly made juices, salads with jicama, guava, chirimoya, thinly rolled cucumber, radish, queso cotija and a raspberry sauce. every traditional dish has been re-examined, reduced to its essentials and then reinvented, resulting in a meal that is playful, surprising and full of joy. really loved it. the huevos rancheros arrived looking like two pancakes, neatly stacked - the textures were amazing, from handmade tortillas and vegetables that each have their own signature. the menu calls the chilaquiles "el borracho" - again, a variety of flavors and textures, which transform over time as they interact with the broth and sauces - not unlike a dish that's pleasantly getting more and more drunk (on flavor). there was an inside-out quesadilla with huitlecoche and nopales. it's obvious that chef hugo puts so much care into each dish. the love for the work shines through. you can taste it. our meal ended with a flan brul√©e made from corn, side by side with a coffee flan and a spoonful of cranberries soaked in mezcal. terrific. i'd go back just to eat the warm, handmade tortillas. they are perfect.
