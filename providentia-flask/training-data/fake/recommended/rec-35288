I cannot BELIEVE the bad reviews for this little gem!! Every single roll I have gotten here has been amazing. Try the Hana Roll and the Rock n' Roll... so good! The fish is fresh, they restaurant is always full but I have never had to wait, and the prices can't be beat. The street they are on is full of sushi places, and this is the best one. The wait staff is also very friendly and attentive.
