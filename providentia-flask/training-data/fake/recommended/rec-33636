I was in there this past Sunday and the brunch was ruined by the waiter who was a total d-bag. If you see a hipster guy with like greasy jheri curl hair and bad earring (maybe southern drawl but more likely bs affect)-- that's him. btw I'm local so this isn't some out-of-towner whine. Place was packed (so much is forgivable with a decent attitude) but dude saunters over like he's doing us a big favor when he finally swings by to take our order. Was there with my girlfriend-- and parents (elderly but sharp). He talked down to my Mom as if she was developmentally disabled. Told my girlfriend they weren't "doing lattes" today although we saw people at the bar drinking them? His tone was terrible. He never fills the waters once. Never fills the coffees once. Never stopped by to ask if we needed anything at all-- although he passed right by the table non-stop. Every time I tried to flag him down he did the full ignore (obviously saw and heard me) and eventually when he stopped by he acted completely annoyed because I asked for more coffee at brunch. (Which by the way he poured half-full with a splashy finesse). Matched him to a tee. I've had bad service around town. I empathize with servers when they're overwhelmed-- but this guy was radiating jerkiness that it motivated me to post on this DAYS LATER. Hope he sees this and he changes his ways-- or somebody over there wakes up to the fact that you have an ahole server on staff. I'm an awfully nice guy. I've waited tables. I don't like writing stuff like this-- but that guy was simply over the top. Time for a career change, yo. Maybe something with computers?
