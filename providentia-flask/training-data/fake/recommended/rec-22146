Disappointed. Customer service? That concept went out of the window in this place. Japanese people are some of the most polite and nice people, yet this place embodies the exact opposite. The pretentious host at the main entrance, on a Monday, at 5 pm, tells me that the 3 of us couldn't sit at a table of 4 (mind you, where a chair would be vacant regardless or a booth would not be filled anyway) because I told him that our party may have another person joining us, which would still mean we would be sitting AT THE SAME TABLE OF 4. Idiot! He claimed that we could sit but if the other person came they would not be served. Um? EXCUSE ME? Does management know you're hurting business? UNACCEPTABLE. The service was also terrible, this girl who served us was just emotionless, no desire to be there clearly, and was pretty much the embodiment of a robot. No thanks. I will continue to go to the Union Sq. location and enjoy a better staff, better location, better ambiance and actually come to think of it...better food. This place lacks the very concept the original Union Sq. Ippudo created!
