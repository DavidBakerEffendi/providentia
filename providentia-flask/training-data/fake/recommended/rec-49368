This place is a beacon of hope in the grim financial district without any exciting vegan options. I just got a new job downtown and imagine that this place will be a regular for me. I went for the chick pea tuna sandwich. It came out in approximately 2 minutes in the heart of lunch hour, and was really well done! Can't wait to go back and try the other options! Nice job, Terri.
