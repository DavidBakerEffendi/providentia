Delicious tapas and great wine menu as well.  We had a fantastic server named Katie, apparently it was her first day at being a server and she did swimmingly :) Ordered the ensalada de alcachofa - crispy artichoke and white asparagus salad with lemon vinaigrette: smoky, earthy and refreshing all wrapped in one...the ensaladita de pulpo - octopus salad with white beans and romesco: great flavor but the octopus was missing a little bit of the chewy texture I usually like...the crema de hígado de pollo - chicken liver mousse with pedro ximenez was so decadent yet light and soo creamy...Who can mess up chorizo al jerez - chorizo cooked in sherry and rosemary...the least favorite was the paquetitos de jamón- serrano ham triangles with artichokes and manchego cheese: it was just a bit too salty for our taste...and you can't go wrong with the classic staple tortilla española - traditional spanish omelet with potatoes...luscious and delicious. Also had the crispy pig ear special of the night...hold bejesus was it amazing...savory with a sweet sticky bite....amazing   Can't wait to go back again soon!
