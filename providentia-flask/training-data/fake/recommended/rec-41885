I was so disappointed at the dinner I had here with my girlfriend. While I can't complain about the price with a $45 fixed price menu for 4 courses, everything else left something to be desired. After being crammed in next to the hostess while waiting to be seated, our table for 2 was basically shared elbow to elbow with the couple dining next to us. The food was interesting, but poorly seasoned. Their tomato sauce clearly has sugar in it, shame on you for an Italian restaurant. Also, many of their dishes are not accurately described on the menu. The duck breast may seem like a treat, but it is heavily crusted and over seasoned with anise or fennel so rather that a wonder piece of duck, you get slightly duck flavored licorice. I am always looking for a great italian place. My go to has always been La Viola, but I want to find someplace closer to home. It looks like I'm still looking.
