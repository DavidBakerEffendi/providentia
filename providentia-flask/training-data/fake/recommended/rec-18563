Being form California, I always use to hear people complain about how bad the Mexican food was in NYC... Since I moved here I've actually eaten at plenty of good Mexican places. Last night we decided to try Five Tacos because we always walk past and it looks cute...... The food did not taste bad but it felt like I was eating at an upscale Taco Bell but my friends and l would probably still prefer Taco Bell. My friend who doesn't cook mentioned that she makes better Mexican food out of the packet seasoning from the grocery store. The only item that was awful and inedible was the Guacamole! It was very acidic and it tasted old.. like when you make it a day before and let it sit in the fridge. We all decided we could never return here even super drunk... Â We did like the selection of beer.
