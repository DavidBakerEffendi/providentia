Came here for the first time with hubby and out of town guest.  It's nothing like the farmers market I miss from california but its busy and has lots of different foods, meats, cheeses, and baked goods to try.  We enjoyed cupcakes from the flying monkey stand.  Also had an apple dumpling from the amish stand which was ok.  We also bought some tasty specialty honey.  I would come back again. It's also nice to see the diversity of people in the market and families enjoying the food.  If you are walking to the market watch out for the drivers.  More dangerous than nyc drivers.
