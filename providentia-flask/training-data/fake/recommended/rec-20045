Absolutely love the decor!  It was the perfect atmosphere for a date. There were so many options on the menu, but when in Rome... so I ordered the Room Service Pad Thai.  Umm, I like mussels, but these mussels were HUGE.  They actually kind of scared me. There were more mussels and calamari than shrimp in the pad thai and it just wasn't my thing.  I didn't even try them, but my date did and he wasn't a fan.   The noodles were a dark purple so that was kind of interesting to see.  I just felt like the seafood wasn't that appetizing to me so next time I'll get the regular pad thai.   The guava mojito was delicious, but inconsistent.  I ordered 2, the first one was clear, the second one had more of a pinkish color.  Maybe they forgot to put the guava juice in it the first time?  Definitely did not stop me from drinking both :P
