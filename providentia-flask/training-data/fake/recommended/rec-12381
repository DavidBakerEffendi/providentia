I came here for brunch with a few girlfriends to catch up before Christmas vacation. We waited a while for a table but we didn't mind bc the food was supposed to be good. I honestly was notttt super impressed with this place. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but I'm not sure why it was so packed and well reviewed on yelp. I mean it wasn't bad at all but it was nothing to write home about. I came for brunch but was more in the mood for lunch so ordered the fish dish with a side of cheese grits. The cheese grits were good but not fantastic. The fish was very mediocre. My friends both ordered omelets which looked a lot better than my dish.
