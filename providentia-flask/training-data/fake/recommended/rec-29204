I visited this place for the first time while staying in Philly for a couple of weeks. It came highly recommended from a coworker, so I decided to give it a try. I had been to all the commercial spots like Pat's, Gino's, and Jim's, but I still felt that there had to be a better steak in the "Cheesesteak Capitol". I will tell you that I was highly impressed. The cheesesteak to bread and cheese ratio was perfect. The bread was just the right texture and matched with the sandwich perfectly. The staff was incredibly friendly and took pride getting to know every customer by name as they placed their order. There were people dining outside and inside. They were fast, and organized, considering the line was out the door. Delassandros made my cheesesteak experience a very good one, so much so that I went back twice in one week! I would recommend that if you want a good ole local hometown cheesesteak with a neighborhood feel, go to Delassandros and you WILL NOT be disappointed! I'm adding a pic of my son who is also a foodie and absolutely enjoyed the food! Thanks Delassandros and I look forward to our next visit!
