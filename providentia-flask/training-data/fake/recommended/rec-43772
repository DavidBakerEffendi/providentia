I have this saying "pasta makes everything better" and I was reminded of this mantra the moment I walked from the cold outside and into the garlic saturated air. The staff was friendly and very attentive. I got a pasta dish, which I'm guessing was homemade since it had a nice al dente firmness to it. This was a great choice form me and I topped off lunch with a cappuccino, yum!
