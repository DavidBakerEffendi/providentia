Johnny Brenda's is my happy place.  Not only do my awesome friends live right down the block, but it's also been such a great space to watch some of my favorite performances in the city.  Location is not ideal, but Girard is growing on me no doubt (especially when friends give me a ride out there).   Beers are cheap and tasty, bartenders are nice enough, and it's spacious enough for everyone to have their own social experiences (both upstairs and downstairs).  I've only eaten fries here, which were fine, but not really comparable to Monk's or Good Dog as far as bar fries go.  It's nice that they have so many veggie options on their menu but I can't stay I've tried anything.   But let's be honest - I don't come here for the food or drinks.  I come because the space upstairs is awesome and I love being so close to bands I really love.  Now to refresh my memory and give you a taste of who I've seen there..... the roster is as follows:  Fuyiya & Miyagi, Headlights, Caribou, Fleet Foxes, & the Rosebuds.   Oh yeah and one warning:  their shows always start really late & there's generally a fairly large gap between the opener and main act (not that that's unusual around Philly).
