I don't eat here enough.  Philly really has some great sandwiches and I think this is my favorite so far.  The roast pork and brisket are just damn good.  Good on a sandwich, on a salad, on whatever.  I always end up spending like 17 bucks on a meal there with the add on's, but I don't mind paying for quality.  The garlic and the hot peppers are must have.  Decent fries too.
