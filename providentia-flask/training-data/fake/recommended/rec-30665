Some people have missed the point of this place as I see it. It has gobs of character, just a homey, wood worn pub with an ineffable sense of warmth of charm, which is even more appealing because it's tucked in a real fancy pants part of the village. They have McSorley's on tap, but the Guiness came from a can which is the main reason that this place falls to 4 stars. The service is rather laissez faire, but that seems to be due in part to the relaxed atmosphere; you need to be ready to just chat with your friends at your own pace. The burgers are really special - they are huge, really juicy, and topped with perfectly crisped bacon. They do cook them in large batches in this specail looking oven, and mine was a little more medium than medium rare. Oh well it was delicious anyways. We noted that the drippings congealed into pools of semi-solid meat fat almost immediately on the plate, so they may be getting their flavor simply by using a really fattty beef mixture. Either way they taste great.
