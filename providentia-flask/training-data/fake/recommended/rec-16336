The dead rabbit is definitely (just) okay. Waited in the tight bar space for a table upstairs and tried one cocktail which was a bit too damn sweet. Once seated upstairs, found the room to be really small and really uncomfortably hot because the really small room was filled with really small tables that each had a really small oil lamp on them, so it was an oven. That aside, the drink was great - still too damn sweet - but it was done well. So yeah, very 'eh.
