One of the things that I really enjoy about a bar/pub is when there is a variety of beer of all different sorts. This place has dozens of beers of all kinds. It's not just your typical bud, bud light, bud light platinum, bud light lime kinda place. It's got so many different kinds that I can't really remember what their names are. I think once was called Left hand saw tooth or something like that and that was pretty darn good. I do enjoy beer and I guess in some ways you can call me a beer enthusiast, I swear I'm not an alcoholic. Seriously though if you're looking for a trendy places with good beer and bites. This place is for you. Enjoy!
