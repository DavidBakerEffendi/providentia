I had the pleasure of trying these dumplings on church street after hearing about them from my daughter for months. Mom you have to try them....they are amazing. So here we were after a day of shopping on church street and we came upon this cart. I must say I was nervous at first. If you are expecting perfectly shaped dumplings and nice silverware and plates with sauces....walk away....quick! If you are you expecting delicious dumplings all hand rolled by this lovely woman and are willing to eat out of a cardboard box while standing then be prepared for a nice treat. We sampled several different types...all were good. I like the ones with the cream cheese in them because it adds some moisture. I liked the crab, vegetable, and chicken ones. Mostly, I enjoyed chatting with the owner. A wonderful woman, making a hard living by hand rolling all her creations in the heat, cold and whatever else the Vermont climate throws at her. Standing all day. Whatever I paid for them was not enough. Enjoy! PS...I loved answering some of the questions below.....I wanted to be a comedian with some of the responses but I was afraid the humor would be lost on serious food shoppers from out of town.
