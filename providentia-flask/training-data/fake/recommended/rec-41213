The food was absolutely phenomenal.   If you've ever head the saying, "If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, its probably a duck" lets just say that doesn't apply here. This placed looked like an old school diner, felt like an old school diner, but there food - no wheres near diner quality. (And thats not to say diner quality is bad, I live for diners) I would compare diner food to greasy but delicious. This food on the other-hand, had a superb amount of finesse, was tasty as hell, could easily rival some of the finest restaurants in the city, and probably ha like .0000000002% grease. If your wondering well this all sounds nice, but what the hell did he eat, I started with some hors d'oeuvres which included if i remember correctly these fried risotto balls, little grilled cheese sandwiches, and an assortment of tempura.  Than for an appetizer I had an amazing mac and cheese, followed by the lemon chicken for dinner, and a nutuella pie for dessert. Yea, it was amazing. Seriously, just go, its worth it.
