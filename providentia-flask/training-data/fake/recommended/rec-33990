Went there with some friends from the neighborhood. Very cool place. Trendy, hip & casual in that Brooklyn kinda way.  Food is a fun and creative take on american comfort food with a hint of asia. Don't get fooled though. Food is very well prepared and I'm sure someone from the kitchen has gourmet experience/background. L o v e  the foie gras donuts (yes, that's right!) and the green peppers with different kinds of salt. Love the styling of the place. Very laid back, in that (again) hip casual Brooklyn way. Same goes with the friendly and honest service. The outside still has the previous owners storefront (west indian restaurant), so look carefully when going. If you're in Bed-stuy, or even Brooklyn - you gotta go.
