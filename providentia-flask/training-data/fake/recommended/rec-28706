I had Hu Kitchen cater a client lunch today.  WOW - their food really is that good .  We had the Rotisserie Chicken, the Chicken Tenders, Tuna Salad, Quinoa Salad, Miso Kale Salad, Cauliflower Puree, and an assortment of cookies and juices/teas.  Everything was truly delicious - super flavorful and not at all salty; very fresh and clearly made same-day; and absolutely satisfying and filling without leaving you feeling lethargic and bloated.  We had an assortment of people in the meeting and even the 'least healthy' among us was blown away and wished he could 'eat that food every day.'  Oh, and my personal favorite for dessert were their macaroons - better than any bakery I've tried... and I shamefully know my NYC baked goods.  Jessica, one of the owners, was a delight to work with as well.  I will definitely recommend Hu Kitchen to others for catering needs and can't wait to go to their restaurant with friends.  Thanks for an awesome addition to the city!
