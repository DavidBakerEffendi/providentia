I've been meaning to get here for a while.  Finally had an opportunity to come here for the prix fixe lunch.  You get 3 courses for $24.  It was okay... worthy of a 3 star rating.  But it's such a sexy spot, I'd go out of my way to come back... hence 4 stars. I had the crab salad appetizer (very good), skate (a little salty), and strawberry shortcake (meh).
