True french cuisine in Brooklyn! I love this place and always go here for occasions like Valentine's day or my anniversary, also a birthday once too. Reminds me of my time in Quebec City. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to try any real french cuisine and their onion soup is THE TRUTH! love it, everything is good here, nice romantic spot to sit by the window and have a beautiful, quiet meal. Last V-day, the air conditioner cover above me, fell on my head, but It's all good because they gave us some free drinks to make up for it, and they totally did! No bad blood here, love this place! :)
