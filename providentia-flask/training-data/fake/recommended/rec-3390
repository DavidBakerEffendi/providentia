Sunday afternoon, no wait! Awesome food as always. I preferred this location than the Queens because it wasn't loud. I love Pio Pio, this was my first at this particular location and I found the food wasn't as great as the Queens location but the GREEN sauce definitely makes everything better. The Empanadas size and portion for a appetizer was much better here. I would recommend PIO PIO to everyone!
