The dough is excellent (chewy without being thick) but I wasn't a fan o their toppings. My four cheese pizza tasted too rich with the Parmesan overwhelming all the other cheeses. Also, I prefer to have the basil added at the end so it stays fresh as opposed to cooked in with the cheeses. Service is good, room is nice, good drink list. I would've liked to give them a 3.5.
