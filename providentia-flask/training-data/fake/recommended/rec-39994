Had brunch ... Polite and fast service. I thought the food was well presented and it came from the kitchen pretty quickly too. Seemed a bit loud, but it's a pub ... right? Food was good overall, I don't get the 1-star reviews, I am a snob and found it all acceptable. We need more of this and a whole lot less Denny's. Beer with a bacon sandwich? That is winning my friends.
