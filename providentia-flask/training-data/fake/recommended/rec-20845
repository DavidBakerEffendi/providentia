12/26/14   So disappointed!  went there with a nice bottle of wine tonight thinking of having a nice dinner and relax,,  NOT!    we got there at 7:30, placed our order around 7:40,   ordered appi and dinner,,  asked the waitress to take her time with the order,,  she said no problem,,  how about we had our appi and dinners all done by 8:20!  Appi came by 7:50,,  as soon as we were done the dinner came out by 8:05,,  I said to her I thought I asked you to take your time and we didn't want to be rushed,,  her answer was I thought you didn't want all the food at once?  REALLY?   didn't relax! and felt rushed,, I ordered the eggplant ,  it was the worst I ever had,,  it was dry and cakeie,,     my husband had the veal parm,, said it was ok,, I've been here a few times and thought food was pretty good til tonight,, waitress was inexperienced,,  rushed us and I didn't like spending 60 bucks in 45 min on not so great food,,   guess I wont be going back,,, Donna F
