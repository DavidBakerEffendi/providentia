I come here for a lunch that's not too big but totally satisfying. Plenty of awesome combinations for hot dogs and sausages made to cover whatever you're craving. Delicious seasonal specials keeps things fresh, but you'll quickly grow a list of favorite ones from the huge list on display. Tasty fresh fries with just as crazy a list of dipping sauces. Cool, friendly staff on deck has helped make this place a favorite of mine.
