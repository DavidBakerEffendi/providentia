Wonderful food -- great addition to local dining and affordable for the quality.  Lovely service, owners truly want to please and have been careful to get the details right.  Sweetbreads were crispy and tasty, duck was cooked exactly right, sauces were spot on.   I had the flan and thought it was very good -- texture was excellent.  The bread pudding is gorgeous -- hint of liquor, with just the right bite. We'll be going back, many times!
