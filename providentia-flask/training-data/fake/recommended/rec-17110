Pretty good resturant. The place is very viberant and colorful. It really is hard to miss. Right under the south orange train. The staff were very friendly and inviting. They knew it was me and my boyfriends first time eating here so they were very helpful in getting us some tasty selections. Plus I got a 20% discount for using my college i.d on a monday (sweet). I ordered a beef and chicken taco with rice and beans, and my boyfriend got the wings and shrimp taco. When our food arrive i was shock. I thought that 2 tacos come per order when it was really one. And everything came with chips. So we had 6 different plates all with chips. I mean it was an abundance of food. That was tastey but i wish the guy would of told us its 1 taco per order and not 2. But anyway the beef taco was really good, all tacos come in a double hard and soft shell. All the ingrediants are fresh and made to order. The chicken taco i wasnt to fond of because i dont like chicken in a hard taco shell and it was a bit dry. The rice and beans i did not care for but it wasnt bad. THE WINGS ARE AWESOME! Its a must try. And the made to order chips were really good. They also have a salsa bar that can be kept up a bit with clealiness but the salsas were taste and fresh. I really loved the abundance of hot sauces they had too! Over 20 to choose from Any who, this place is really good for lunches, dates, and families. But very small. I will go back soon!
