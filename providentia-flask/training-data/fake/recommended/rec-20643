I came here for the first time over a year ago and really enjoyed the food. The sushi was fresh, the fish portions were generous, and the service was pleasant. I came back here with a friend to recreate that experience and unfortunately it was not quite as lovely. The portions shrank a considerable amount and the proportions were off. Too much rice and very little salmon. The rice needed more vinegar, it tasted almost completely plain. The spicy tuna had hardly any spice at all. The rice croquettes were tasty enough but far too small for its price tag. The pork Betty was absolutely delicious, but they did cut the portion in half, which you can tell from the photos. Now the service. It was peculiar... Our waiter was pretty annoying actually. I asked him if there was a brown rice option and he scolded me for asking, saying that "now, that wouldn't be authentically Japanese, now would it!" Are you kidding? This is a hipster fusion sushi shack. There's cilantro in my sushi. Why was there any need to scold me for asking a question? Next to us he scolded another customer for mispronouncing gyoza. He loudly pronounced back to her, "no no no. GYOZA. GYOZA. GYOOOOOZA. Not goyza!" There are far more tactful ways to educate your guests. There's education for other peoples sake and education for your own ego. His was obviously the latter. I can understand eagerness and persnickety passion, but his rudeness struck me as inhospitable. The busboy/food runner was far more personable. He gave us good advice and was gently informative. This place lost it's magic and replaced it with snobbery.
