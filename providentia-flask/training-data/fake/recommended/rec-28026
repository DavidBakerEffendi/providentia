So it is crowded but the food is worth it. The thing is that the wait is longer if you want to sit outside. The wait is significantly shorter if you sit inside but be prepared- it will be crazy loud. Octopus, fish, and the peasants salad. Never will fail you. But the odd thing is- they will run out if certain dishes mid-day. So...be wary if you are going for certain things, namely their fish specialties.
