My wife and I live down the road from this restaurant.  We went in tonight (Friday) and were pleasantly surprised!   The food was really good.  When we sat down we were given what I would imagine were plantain chips with very fresh salsa.  We split empanadas as an appetizer.  I would put these among the best empanadas I've had.  I got the charassco steak and my wife got chicken tacos.  Both were really great dishes, prepared to order.  I also got red beans on the side and they were very good. The restaurant closes at 9pm so on our way out, our waitress offered us pulled pork as they had some leftover.  We gladly accepted and tried some when we got home.  Also really good. Overall, my wife and I were very surprised by how good this restaurant was.  Mostly because from the outside, you would have no idea this place even existed.  I only noticed the new sign they put up recently.  The sign from the old restaurant that used to be there is still up, which says "Diner - Restaurant" which is confusing because this is neither and the new sign says "Cafe".  The outside of the building also looks old and could use a facelift because once you get inside the restaurant, the interior is all brand new!   Don't let the outside of this place fool you.  The Surrender Cafe is GREAT!  Please go here and frequent it because I want it to stay open.  The place was pretty empty when we were there, which truly is a shame.  It should be packed based upon the food quality! Oh, and they deliver too!
