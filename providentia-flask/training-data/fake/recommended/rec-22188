Ambiance: The restaurant was quite pleasant in appearance with traditional Afghan d√©cor. I believe there is a special option to also try traditional Afghan floor seating with a house platter if you would like, although we just ate at one of the small tables. Service: Excellent! It could be because we ate a very late lunch at 3PM and the place was otherwise not busy, but the service was wonderful and attentive, constantly re-filling our glasses and ensuring we had what we needed. Food: So first thing's first, we called ahead of time and the owner stated that the place was halal, despite the bar at the front. It was not listed anywhere on the menu, so everyone should discuss with the server/owner ahead of time. We tried the combination platter which was delicious. There was a side of brown rice and potatoes. The lamb was my favorite. I absolutely love Afghani white sauce, and I'm not quite sure that the sauce is authentic so even though I was disappointed it was not given with the meal, I did think the food was incredibly fresh and flavorful and grilled just right. But I did want some sauce! The potatoes were nice and flavorful and apparently the pumpkin was also delicious. We also split the platter between the two of us as we were not very hungry. Dessert: We had the most amazing Afghani chai. It has sugar added already so don't add any more before tasting it. We tried the baklava, which was not as good as some Turkish places, but ok, and the Firnee was delicious! If you like Firnee, I would suggest trying the firnee here. Each dessert could be split up between two people (if they aren't huge eaters).
