I give 3 stars because of their $2 beer, $1 oyster special and the awesome bartenders. Loved those guys! However, once we got seated things took a turn for the worst. We were waiting forever to get our beers. I could have walked over to the bar and gotten them myself but I thought that would have been rude. I should have done that because our waitress didn't have a problem being rude to us. After we were sitting there with no beers and mentioned about when our orders would be coming she blurted out that we just ordered 5 mins ago so it will be a while. Um ok... not how you talk to customers. They couldn't add chicken to the salad we ordered. Even after our waitress said she would check. They serve chicken with a sandwich but she said it's prepared differently. Not sure what that means. I wanted to walk over to Fairway and buy the chicken for the salad, but once again I thought that would be rude. The last thing to arrive were the oysters. That was weird because they don't need to be cooked. But once again there was an excuse that it takes a while to shock them. Um... it takes 2 seconds if you know how to do it. We did go to Fairway for desert. Thankfully I had good company and the view was out of this world so the service wasn't a total mood killer. But it just bothers me that anyone thinks it's acceptable to treat customers like that. If I come back, I'll stay by the bar.
