I was told once that Capricorn's love Capricorn's - the perfect match. I've been meeting all caps. Capricorns also like perfection and I think I like this place cause it's near perfection without over doing it. The drinks are fantastic creative, tasty, and fresh. The happy hour is PERFECTION. But let's not tell everyone, OK. I think we must of had 6 drinks total or more and the bill was $24. Yeah. If people knew we wouldn't be able to get a seat at the bar anymore. The decor is very very trendy. The bathrooms are all equipped with your own sink. - i like. Excellent appetizers a little to much on the fried side. But really flavorful. I will update when I come and have dinner here but for now I am sticking with the happy hours. Oh so happy. Cheers!
