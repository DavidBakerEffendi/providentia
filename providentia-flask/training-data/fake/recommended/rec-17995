It's so refreshing to find a restaurant like this. Timeless classic new york institution.  Chef Canora is true to himself and the cuisine that he's become so well known for.   Service: fine to good.  Not aloof or annoyingly attentive.  Our server steered us in the right direction and exhibited solid knowledge on both food and wine. Food: -Warm Autumn vegetables - everything you'd want a dish with this name to be... whipped honey ricotta, pumpkin seeds, roasted butternut squash... This is the food people dream about. -Ribbolita: soul warming and hearty.  Really delicious. -Porcini Trifolati: Great dish. -Canestri: solid pasta. Lots of textural elements, which is exactly what the server told me. -Duck Papardelle: Also really well executed.  Nothing crazy, but just all around yummy. -Grilled Quail: Just awesome.  An absolute must have. -Pork Loin w/ cotechino: also on the quails level.  My girlfriend had this and I took it away from her.  The cotechino is almost like a little condiment to accent the pork loin.  It tastes like it was made by the little old italian grandmother that everyone wishes they had. I will definitely be back there.  Maybe tomorrow or hopefully tonight in my dreams.  Absolute must try.
