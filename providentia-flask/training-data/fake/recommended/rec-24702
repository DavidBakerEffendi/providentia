One of my best meals in four years of living here.  Fah realz.   Came for New Year's Eve dinner and ordered the mushroom/parmesean app, braised short rib in polenta entrée, and trio of dark chocolate, sea salt and caramel sorbet for dessert.  Excellent wine list as well.   What propelled me to give the spot 5 stars was the service.  The waitstaff, hostess, and coat check were fantastic.  Our particular server on NYE (August) somehow noticed that a member of our dinner party was going downhill fast thanks to a combo of red wine + London jet lag, and got her entrée out within 3 minutes of her ordering.  Impressive and insightful.   Also, bravo for creating an ambiance where both daters and friends feel cozy and comfortable.
