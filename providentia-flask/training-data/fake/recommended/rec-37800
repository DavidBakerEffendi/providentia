Finally tried Shake Shack in Center City and absolutely loved it! Paid approximately $10 for a single SmokeShack burger and a side of fries, which is actually a lot less than some other chain burger places in Philadelphia. The burger was juicy and the sauce on it was delicious! Definitely going back soon
