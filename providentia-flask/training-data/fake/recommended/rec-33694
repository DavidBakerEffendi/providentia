i really liked it here. i got the tofu pad see ew and my friend got the curry chicken. she didn't think it was that great, so maybe stay away from that dish. but mine was very good imho. the service was friendly and the atmosphere was nice, and it wasn't too expensive. the glass of white i had was yummy too. all in all it was good! so good in fact that i am going to dinner there now!!
