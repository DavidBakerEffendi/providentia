This place is Amazing! I first came here with a girlfriend of mine who highly recommended this place. It's a very cute, cozy wine bar with a phenom menu! The wine is excellent and for the cheese lovers an interesting variety of cheese plates. The must-try's: Gnocchi...the best I've ever had! (believe the hype!) Nutella cake with hazelnut ice cream Tip: Reservations aren't accepted over the phone for a party of less than 5. However, we were able to score a rezo for 2 on open table! :)
