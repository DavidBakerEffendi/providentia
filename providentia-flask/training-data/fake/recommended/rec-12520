Went there today for my sons 5th birthday and the food was excellent. We had the blueberry pancakes-excellent-, custom omelette -excellent-, steak and eggs -excellent-, salmon scramble and southern breakfast- both excellent as well. The wait was short and the hostess was extremely nice to my son... Even putting a candle on his pancakes! He was thrilled! The waitress was very attentive as well. They were very nice and seated our large group close together 4 at a time. We came all the way from Los Angeles for graduations and were staying in uptown manhattan so getting there was a trek! It was totally worth it! Love this place and will be back.
