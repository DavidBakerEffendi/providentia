Nice ambiance, decent food, OK waitstaff, NOT the place to go if you have other plans for the day. Went in for Sunday brunch last weekend and ordered the "Gringo Burrito"; my boyfriend had the nutella/banana/caramel french toast. The food was OK but nothing spectacular and bit overpriced. By the time I got my first cup of coffee it was lukewarm and we waited 40 minutes for our food and about 10 minutes to receive the check after requesting it despite our expressed need to get going. Granted, it was busy and brunch is Â typically a leisurely event, however, 40 minutes is a stretch. Definitely not the place to go for unlimited mimosas unless you're looking to consume about 2!
