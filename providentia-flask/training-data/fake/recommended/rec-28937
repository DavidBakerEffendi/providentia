I decided to try this place because I saw a posted picture of the ricotta donuts with huckleberry jam dessert---which was sooooo good.  We even ate the remaining jam out of the cup. :)  I had the carrot soup, which was refreshing & tasty and also had the fettucine with pesto sauce appetizer.  The first few bites were great, but after all I tasted was salt!  I couldn't finish it.  Otherwise, my boyfriend's tuna appetizer was amazing & he reports it being the best tuna he's had.  The drink, the Visionary, had such a unique and delicious taste.  The bread that came with dinner was warm and similar to a croissant.  The melted butter on top just made it perfect.   Definitely would go back, but not ordering that fettuccine dish...  I'd like to go back when it's warm... the outside is so cute! :)
