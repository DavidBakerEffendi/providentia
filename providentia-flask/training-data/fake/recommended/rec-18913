Wings Over is my favorite wings place, however the Storrs one and Berlin one is better than the Hartford West one.  I love the honey bbq flavor, my favorite wing flavor.  My fiance likes hot, but he did not like their hot- no flavor to it at all, the place is just trying to get heat and not taste. The portions are ok, but if you go to Storrs wings you get a lot more for your money!
