Da Andrea was highly recommended by a friend that lives in NY.  My wife and I both enjoyed our dinners, I had the veal and spinach ravioli and my wife had the spaghetti.    The dinners were both delicious and the prices were very reasonable.  The decor of the restaurant felt cozy.  The owner, who we met, was warm and friendly.  Wish I could say the same about our waiter, a tall gentleman, who seemed more anxious to get our order and get us out, then to give us a good experience.  Would definitely return when we are in town.
