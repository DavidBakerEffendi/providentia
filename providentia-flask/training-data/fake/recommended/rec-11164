All my No. Libs homies have been raving about this place so I had to check it out.  It was a Sunday evening, we were seated at a table and then ignored for about 20mins...not the way to start off the meal.  Next, to add insult to injury, the lighting was soo bad that I couldn't even read the menu!!!  20/20 maybe not but I'm not 93 either!  When we finally got the servers attention we ordered the house margaritas which at $5 a pop, are a bargain, a bargain that you leave on the shelf!  The mix was awful and despite my request of no salt, no sugar, my glass arrived covered in enough salt to evoke immediate onset hypertension.  On to the meal, I ordered the chicken with bbq'd baked beans and veggies.  My chicken came out first and I thought my sides would be close behind.  I mean, the sides are part of the meal, right?  Silly rabbit, sides are apparently not meal accompaniments in this establishment...they never even made it to the table.  And this is the way I'll end this story....A swing and a miss.
