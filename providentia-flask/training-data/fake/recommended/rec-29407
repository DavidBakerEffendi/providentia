2178 reviews and still as high as 4.5 stars, that says something!!! I was in town for a birthday party, but couldn't resist the urge to stop by the cart before getting dinner with my friends.  So, I just got the gyro/sandwich - chicken & lamb combination with white sauce.  And by god jolly, I felt like I was in heaven for the 5 minutes it took me to assault the ginormous bundle of foil wrapped melt in your mouth pita stuffed with tender and juicy shredded chicken and lamb soaked with their white sauce topped off with some crunchy iceberg lettuce.....hhmmmm....hhhmmmm.....hhhmmmm so simple, yet so delicious. for that 5 minutes of heavenly experience, I had forgotten that it was 20F in NYC at the time with wind blowing around 10-15mph.  Needless to say, my fingers were begging me to retreat into the gloves once the subject of assault had seized to exist. New Yorkians have a rep of F*** U in your face type of attitude.  But, these guys working the cart in that freezing weather couldn't be any nicer.  They know that the tiny establishment they got going is a jewel of the city in its own rights, yet they were very humble in their customer service - whatever minimal that may be for a food cart.
