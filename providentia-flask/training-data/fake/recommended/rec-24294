It was time for another cheeseburger date and I decided to try Village Whiskey. I'd heard good things about this place (and have a deep and abiding love for Jose Garces) and it lived up to my expectations. The food was excellent. The service was excellent. The cocktails were excellent. The atmosphere is nice here. It's smaller than I expected but not noisy. There are high top tables with a booth on one side facing the bar. Everything is clean and well done. Our server was friendly and efficient. We both ordered the Village Burger and split the duck fat fries. I added bleu cheese to my burger and my friend added bacon. My burger was SO delicious. It was cooked exactly how I'd wanted and was super juicy. Sarah commented that her bacon was really good and perfectly cooked. The bun it came on was really soft and flavorful, somewhere between a kaiser and brioche. Our duck fat fries were delicious but the portion was small and I'm not sure they're worth $5. Adding the bleu cheese, my burger was $13. It was definitely $13 good, but I think it should come with something more than a soggy looking pickle. Ok fine, don't give us the fancy fries, but some greens on the side would be nice. I ordered the Ginger Rogers cocktail with gin, ginger, lemon, Fees Rhubarb, and sparkling rose. Lovely. It was very fresh tasting and crisp. I loved it. I love day drinking. We didn't sit at the bar, but the bartender seemed great. He had a good personality and sounded like he enjoys making cocktails, which always makes for a better bartender. Overall I loved it. You definitely pay for the Jose Garces experience, but what a great experience it is. It was the best burger I've had in Philly. Everyone should try it at least once.
