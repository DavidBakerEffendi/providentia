Got mussels. Terrible. Tastes like garbage from the bottom of the ocean. Chicken salad is bad too. Chicken is both over and under cooked with hard chewey pieces, as well as being dry and crumbly. Impressive if I didn't have to eat it. I think their pizza is good, just don't order anything else from the menu.
