My wife daughter and I had Easter dinner at Locanda Verde...all three of us were very happy with our choice. We were stuck in a killer traffic jam and were already late for our reservation, my wife calls and the hostess could have been more accommodating, our reservations would be held for us...and they were! We were seated immediately but my wife wasn't happy with the table, we were seated right across from the open kitchen but there was a cold constant stream of air blowing on us, and my wife is always cold. We get the hostess and there is no problem switching our table, in fact she took my wife to see the two available tables so she could choose. The second table was not only much warmer it also had a nice view of the street. As for the food...excellent! I had a pasta dish, I don't recall the name, but the pasta was al dente, done to perfection. Over the pasta was shredded pork and provolone. My wife and daughter each ordered red snapper which they both raved over. Lindsay ordered the Brussels sprouts, now she orders them everywhere she dines, makes them at her home to perfection...another rave. They each had a coffee that they loved and my wife and I shared the tiramisu, now this is not traditional tiramisu, it's more of an ice cream sundae with ladyfingers. The vanilla was good, the chocolate spectacular. One last thing, before dinner we did have a drink, my wife had a white wine that our waitress suggested, Debbie approved. I had a cocktail that has Mezcal in it's name, four liquors, Mezcal, Tequila, Vermouth and a fourth that I don't recall, I have never heard of it...excellent...strong! I so wanted a second but I did have to drive home. We loved the restaurant, stylish, comfortable except for one thing, Mr. DeNiro, what's with the metal chairs? A little cushion and this place would be perfect, we will be back to try their brunch.
