Me and my boyfriend have been two times.  We've walked/drove by here dozens of times but it wasn't until University City restaurant week that we went here (it was one of the participating restaurants) and we were curious.   To be honest, I would have never gone in here judging by the outside.  But I'm glad I did.  The food is very reasonably priced and also good the both times we have been there.  The menu is also very friendly to vegetarians.   Please note that unless a place is designed to be some type of entertainment centered place, I generally don't rate based on anything else except food.  Other people seem to really like this place besides it's a sort of neighborhood joint but I didn't take this into account (since I'm new around here).
