Was overcharged, They refuse to fix it! Food was mediocre at best. I used a crowdquest deal and paid the remaining with a card, but they just decided to charge me the full amount. I called the week after and emailed, but never got any response except, to call later. The food was over seasoned and congealed by the time it got to me. Overall I would not recommend this place.
