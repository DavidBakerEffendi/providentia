Huge beers at a reasonable price, endless jenga games and delicious bratwurst. You can't really beat Frankford Hall. Â I find this place is suitable to go to any day any time from a Sunday afternoon to a Saturday night. We always enjoy coming here and I was happy to discover that the heat lamps work well enough that you don't freeze outside when it's a bit chilly out. My only criticism would be that the food is a bit pricey.
