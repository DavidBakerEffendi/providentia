Met a friend here for lunch and had a really delicious meal. We tried the frutas guacamole, which is made with mango, peach and habanero, and topped with pomegranate seeds. It was delicious and a great twist on standard guac. At our server's recommendation, I ordered the suadero tacos. The brisket was fall-apart tender and the horseradish crema was delicious, I only wish the tacos weren't so teeny! Literally only two-biters, through the rice and beans portions that accompanied were massive. Great food, only wish the servings were a bit bigger!
