Waited for ~90 minutes for a table for 2. Ordered the Summer Rose Mimosa, bellini, black coffee, Omelette, and steak sandwich. The black coffee was really good (Rated by my bf, who is super anal about coffee). Other than that, our expectations were not met by the other food. Our waitress seemed to be very forgetful and forgot to bring coffee the first time around - we had to get another waiter to do it. He was a lot more attentive than she was. We would not be going back because it was super crowded, noisy, overrated, and super small so I almost knocked over our table on the way out to go the bathroom and when exiting the restaurant. P.S. No, I do not have a huge badonkadonk. =P
