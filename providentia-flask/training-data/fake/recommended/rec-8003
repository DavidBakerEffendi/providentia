I've been here twice already for brunch on a weekend and the food here is simply amazing. This place has been packed both days I've been. It seems there's a longer wait for parties of more than 2 (which luckily I've never been in). Service is decent, not slow and not memorable. This is what I've had: Eggs Florentine Norwegian Smoked Salmon Pumpkin Pancakes w Cinnamon Yogurt - AMAZING. I swear I could eat this FOREVER. I loved it all. Whenever anyone mentions brunch, this is where I take them. This is my default brunch place till it becomes way too trendy and I have to wait 3 hours for 2 seats like some other brunch place called Clinton Bakery.
