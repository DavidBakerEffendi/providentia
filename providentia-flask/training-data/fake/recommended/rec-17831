Okay...I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. Nice place with good food. I was skeptical at first because I though Ippudo would be another "popular" place due to word-of-mouth among the trendy 20-somethings who would flock to any venue that their friends are talking about simply because their friends are talking about it. To my relief it was not just another "Shake Shack." It is a special shack with good food. It is getting to be a bit too trendy and a bit too crowded for my taste. Popularity is not always a good thing. Good for business, I guess...If it were my biz, I would be ecstatic, but it isn't. So...Would I go back? Yes, maybe, IDK. If I happen to be in the neighborhood(?), or perhaps it would have to be a craving, or an invitation. I would not make a special trip just to go there. Let it be...been there, done that...
