I first ventured into this location be because I work nearby and was pleasantly surprised by how great the food was! Since then, I've returned many times. I would say the burgers and buns along with the sweet potato fries are the best items on the menu. The flavors are pretty unique and I definitely feel very full after having an order of a burger or bun and fries. However, the real reason for 5 stars is that the first time I went here, I got an order to go which was forgotten about. Once I let someone know, they immediately made my order and even gave a free ice cream sandwich! Happy customer :)
