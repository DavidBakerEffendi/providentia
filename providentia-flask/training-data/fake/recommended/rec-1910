The wait was about an hour long, it wasn't too bad to me since the weather was nice and I was hoping the cheese steak would live up to my expectation. I got the one with cheese whiz and mushroom and they were pretty good but I can't believe this was from Philly! I live in TX and I can get the same thing for half the price! I was pretty disappointed but it was nice to have the experience.
