While everyone's arguing about which joint serves the best taco in Sunset Park, all eyes are usually cast towards 5th Avenue. Here's a secret: The best taco is served on 4th ave at Tacos El Bronco. For really. The large taco ($2.50, i believe?) is a healthy serving of meat slathered with unbeatable guacamole. A friend got shrimp fajitas...the whole platter was dreamy and worth getting the next time. A large amount of well-cooked shrimp, melt-in-your-mouth peppers and onions... The service is nice, the place is sparse and clean....and it will see me again and again ang again.
