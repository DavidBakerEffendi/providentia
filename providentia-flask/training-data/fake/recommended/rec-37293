Mood Cafe is always my first stop when I visit Philly after a nice drive from Brooklyn. The Lassi flavors range from traditional to ecstatic. It's always great to bring a friend or friends to share because they always make enough to fill your cup and have enough left over to fill a smaller cup that you can trade with your friends. I have a hard time choosing anything other than the Pistachio/Almond Lassi. It's a great balance of rich yogurt, creamy almonds, and nutty pistachios that almost adds an umami flavor to the combination as the pistachios that they use are toasted with a bit of salt. I've recently ordered off the menu. Pistachio/Dates. Also a winner. The chewy pieces of dates sink to the bottom and wait for you to finish your drink before you can pick them out with a straw. It's hard to go wrong here. The owner is very vocal and knowledgable - if you order flavors that he doesn't think will work well together, he will recommend something better. Also, he's originally from Brooklyn. Bonus points for that.
