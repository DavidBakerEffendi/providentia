I really, really hate to do this. But it has to be done. Something has changed at Room Service. My order today was greasy and they really skimped on the chicken. They've also started adding star anis to their massaman curry. If you've never had star anis, it has a very distinct flavor that runs along the lines of black licorice. Ick. I really hate it, although some might like it.....so sorry to take back a star but there's so much good Thai food out there. I'm so disappointed.
