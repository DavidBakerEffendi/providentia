There is nothing particularly special about AJ's. It is a simple deli/newstand, doesn't really stand out. The sandwiches are standard fare, I had a turkey and provolone sub. The size is pretty decent, but flavor wise it is nothing special. They had a very limited selection of chips (just Bugles I think) when I was there.
