Pros: Request half-baked pizza for take out to bake again when ready to consume; 500F for 10 minutes.  Male waitstaff tend to be more accommodating on special request than the women waitstaff.  Specialty pizzas (i.e. white clam topping) taste better than traditional pizzas (i.e. pepperoni and cheese topping).  Parking lot. Cons: Skimped on the toppings, especially with pepperoni.  Didn't provide instructions on re-bake.
