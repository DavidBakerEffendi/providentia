This review is long over due!! If you decide to go to Pio Pio make sure u go to the hell kitchen location, it is the BEST!!. The food is superb and DELISH!! The staff are very nice and wonderful,  the drinks are great and STRONG!! My girls and I always have a great time and never leave disappointed! ! The restaurant is very beautiful and have that modern but sophisticated look, perfect for a date night or grabbing a bite to eat!! 5 stars feel but very affordable.  The portion are so big u can share it with another person!!!!
