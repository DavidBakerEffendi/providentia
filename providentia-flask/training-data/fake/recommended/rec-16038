This week we dined at Hearth for the fourth time in 12 months. For the fourth time, Heath left a lasting impression. This is our first YELP (sorry, Marco). Here's the deal, for those who do not want to read through my notes...Hens of the Woods. Again, I repeat...Hens of the Woods. Amazing. The best mushrooms we have ever tasted (4 times...). The ambiance at Hearth is attractive, well appointed and perfectly lit. The staff is attentive and kind. While the menu was simple, it is very impressive and includes local in season ingredients. The wine list was biblical--covering Old Testament and New. Simply stated, when in Manhattan, go to Hearth. Ciao!
