I gave four stars because they don't have coconut rice which I love oh so much. Â If they added this to the menu, they would totally be five stars. Their thai Iced tea is very yummy and they have very good food. They also have great decor and service. A fun place to go for a date or with girlfriends and a bottle or two of wine ;) I like to get their take out as well.
