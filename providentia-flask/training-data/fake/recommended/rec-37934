Bodhi Coffee is a relaxing atmosphere to enjoy a fabulous cup of coffee.  My fiancé and I stopped in for a quick cup one Sunday morning while visiting the famers market... the staff was  friendly and attentive and I highly recommend the everything bagel breakfast sandwich with the pesto and hardboiled egg.. delicious :) we definitely will be returning soon!
