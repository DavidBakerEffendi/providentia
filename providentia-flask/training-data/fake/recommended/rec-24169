My husband has been a fan since they first opened and were just a tiny spot.  Now they're slightly larger, a bit trendier/more expensive, but he still loves the food.  I am not an adventurous eater, but I did enjoy the angel shrimp appetizer and the crazy pineapple rice.  It came with tofu, which I tried and enjoyed.  Their tossed salad is one of the better ones around.  It's substantial and worth ordering.
