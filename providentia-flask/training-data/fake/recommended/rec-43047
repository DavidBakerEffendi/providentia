I am still dreaming about those brussel sprouts! So freaking good!!!! I literally could eat probably two orders of those things myself. I went with a friend and we ordered a bunch of small plates. Everything was great. Definitely did not dissapoint. Price was actually pretty reasonable too, since we ordered a 1/2 liter of wine. Inside is really cute. It's a lot bigger than you would expect.
