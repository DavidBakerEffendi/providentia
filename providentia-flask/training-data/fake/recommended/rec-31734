To be clear, as of April 2010, Basta Pasta in NYC is my favorite pasta "go-to" place outside of Italy and Toronto, Canada thus far. Italian Bistro outside NYC?  Parsippany, NJ?  I've worked around there and just couldn't imagine a good Italian restaurant there but hey my friends invited me and it sounded good based on the reviews, 4 stars on Yelp. Parking?  Easy. Finding the place?  Easy Ambiance/Atmosphere?  Nice, subdued.  Comfortable.  Classy without being ritzy. My friend ordered the appetizers. - Broccoli Rabe sauteed with fresh garlic.  Very good.  Very tasty. - Spinach sauteed with fresh garlic.  Good, but preferred the Broccoli Rabe. - Tuna Tartare - Very good.  Tasty. - Grilled Calamari - Okay. I ordered the Pappardelle con Salsiccia Pomodoro e Funghi - $15.95 (Wide fettuccini with Sausage, Fresh Tomatoes and Mushrooms). - Okay.  Pasta was fresh but they stuck together and could be more al dente.  I had a hard time separating the pasta.  The sauce was more of a traditional tomato pasta sauce than say just freshly crushed or stewed tomatoes, so I would've liked it to be lighter.  The sausage was good. If it were in NYC I would give Eccola 2-3 stars, but since its in Parsippany, NJ and there isn't a better Italian restaurant in the area that I have been to yet, I will give it 4-stars, yay!  I'm a fan if I was in the area looking for a good Italian restaurant.
