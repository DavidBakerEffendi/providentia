I liked the tapas bars in Spain and felt that  Tinto really replicated the feeling and atmosphere - Muy Magnifico!  The food was kicked up several notches - we had the expoisses cheese, mixto charcuterie, arugula ensalada as starters, followed by the Lamb and Prawns Brochetas - all providing a wonderful, and delicious meal.    And enough room for the Bananas y Azafran for desert with coffee and sherry -WOW!
