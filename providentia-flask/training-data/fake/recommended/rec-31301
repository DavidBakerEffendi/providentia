I really like this location. The scenery compliments the amazing food. It's very good for a nice dinner with friends or a date. Â I really enjoyed the calamari and the shrimp clay pot. It was very flavorful. The staff was very attentive as well. Much better than the Thai places around the area and much cleaner too!
