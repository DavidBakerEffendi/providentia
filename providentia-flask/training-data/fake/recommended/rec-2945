This is hands down one of my favorite restaurants ever.  I try to tell everyone I know that they absolutely need to try Modo Mio and if you don't I kind of just feel sorry for you.  The portions are small but the menu is designed this way so if you go make sure to order the menu tourista (1 from each course) otherwise I don't want to hear you complaining about how small the portions are. You can get an amazing dinner for two for just under $100 including a decent tip.  A meal of this quality or lesser quality at a Stephen Starr type restaurant in the city would easily go for 2 times as much.   Food in Phillly doesn't get much better and if you going for lunch check out their sandwich shop next door (Paesano's).  It is equally amazing.
