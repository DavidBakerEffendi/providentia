I have no complaints about this place. Good service, good atmosphere, good drink selection, good food, good prices. Private parking isn't available but we had no trouble finding parking on the street. Overall, one of the best upscale burger joints I've been to. Definitely worth a try if you love greasy American goodness. My boyfriend and I stopped here for lunch on our way through CT. Here's what we thought of what we got: turkey burger - lighter option, super delish duck fat fries - crispy and flavorful and yummy! definitely worth trying smothered burger - very rich bc of the gorgonzola cheese but sinfully delicious truffle fries - just OK, personally I don't think they are worth the extra money
