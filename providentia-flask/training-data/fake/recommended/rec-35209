Had mommy day brunch here and glad we did. The place concentrates on it's small menu and I think they execute it well.  The bread plate was great... We asked for two. Loved the original array - chocolate croissants, carrot cake, whole grain bread with real butter and preserves.  The duck hash was different and being a bit of a cook, it's nice to go out to eat items that aren't in your usual forte. Brother ordered beets and lentils (both sides) as his mains ... He was more than satisfied with the portion. My husband had the sausage breakfast sandwich... Hearty and filling. My mother had the mushroom frittata. She loved it too. We also ordered the pancakes for the table to share. I don't know what they did bc the texture was very different from your typical flapjacks, but we really adored them. Worth the extra flab, as my husband says. :) Service was attentive. Tad pricey but worth it. Come at opening time if you have a party bigger than 4. It gets packed fast and with good reason.
