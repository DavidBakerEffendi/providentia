Let's face it. When you're young and living in the city, brunch is about bloody marys and mimosas, not eggs benedict and lox. Sadly, it's rare to leave a truly satisfying Saturday or Sunday brunch without dropping at least $50 on (food and) beverages, given that the average BM or M is upwards of $7 or $8. Not at McCrossen's! Last week, I stumbled upon this GEM in the Art Museum area. On Saturdays and Sundays between 10:30 and 2:30, they have an all-you-can-drink brunch that deserves serious kudos. For $20, you get an entree and all of the bloodys and mimosas that you can drink. Too good to be true? I thought so. But it is! And it gets better! The setting alone is awesome. There is a bar with a great selection of draft beers, and a dining area as well. It was far from crowded, I think there were only two or three other tables full when we arrived (late) at 12:30. The service? Could not be beat. Bob - the bartender/waiter - was super nice and attentive. The food selection was a little limited, but very tasty. I had the "steak and eggs", which was techincally "hamburger and eggs", served on top of this delightful potato patty. My friends got omelets which they seemed to enjoy. As much as I'd like to avoid sounding like a lush, the star of the show was truly the bloody mary. Typically for me, it's one and done for bloodys, since they're so thick that they could be considered a meal in and of themselves. But this one was light, smooth, and delicious! When I told Bob that he'd be seeing this face again, I meant it. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up.
