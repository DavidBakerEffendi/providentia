I am a huge ramen fan and I visited this place because of so many good reviews and recommendations I had heard about. If I had to describe my experience in one word, I would say AVOID!  This place gives ramen joints a bad name...If you can stand waiting 1-2 hours for ramen during dinner time, then by all means GO HERE!  If you like uninspired, fairly bland broth flavored ramen, GO HERE!  If you like crappy service and wonder why they do not clean up tables quickly so that the next customer can come in and reduce the amount of time for turnover of a table, then GO HERE! We ordered the berkshire pork and crispy chicken as our appetizers and sampled a few of the Pork Ramen Classic and the Miso Ramen to get a flavor of the different standard offerings.  For the amount you are paying, the portion sizes were incredibly small.  The food was decent, but you can find better pork at Momofuku and the ramen itself is no better than stuff you find at Rai Rai Ken or Setagaya. There is one thing that this place is sorely lacking and that is a good house manager, who knows how to service people quickly and create the proper table turnover to maximize revenue.  Furthermore, the layout of the restaurant does not make sense at all, there is so much wasted space, along with those huge square booths, that they should have taken a page out of Design 101 to understand how to maximize the space. The one pleasant note was that I heard the Ippudo in Japan are much better and serve higher quality food.  Too bad we did not get the same in NY.
