I just moved to the city 2 weeks ago and I happen to stumble across this restaurant & wine bar.  I've been there twice and both times were delicious.  It's a good date atmosphere - low lighting, candle lit tables, small and quaint.  They have an extensive wine list, service was speedy and most importantly the food was delicious.  Everyone i went with raved about their meal.  The entrees are simple and well thought out.  I had the salmon and it was incredibly moist. The caprese salad appetizer was one of the best I've had.  We showed up on a friday night without reservations, as a party of five. They originally quoted us an hour and a half, but managed to get us in in ~30min. The only thing that was a turn off for me, was the calamari. It was very chewy and not served as i invisioned it would be.  The breadcrumbs (i assume thats what they were) had no flavor and was just a miss for me in general.   If your looking for casual, intimate, good food that's not too pricey, you should definitely check this place out!
