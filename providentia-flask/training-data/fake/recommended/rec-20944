Absolutely delighted with my regular slice. They had plenty of options to choose from, and the hotel nearby is in great proximity for their delivery. It is a godsend for anyone using the Irvington Bus Terminal or catching the 25 up Springfield Avenue. I felt like I was in Brooklyn but I was definitely in Irvington!
