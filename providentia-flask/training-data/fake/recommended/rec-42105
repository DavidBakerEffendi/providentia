I was visiting from Sacramento Â and a some friends suggested Cubana Social. We went on Saturday night. It was amazing. As much as I could talk about the food -I had the pork which was tasty, or the drinks- very cubany and delicious... the real thing going on at Cubana Social is the vibe. The whole place is a product of Williamsburg. A great mix of people filling up the place. The music was as if the soundtrack to The Buena Vista Social Club was playing in the background, instead, the band was bouncing cuban swing. The joint was loud with people and music. It was great. Go for the drinks. Go for the food. Go for the music. But most of all, go for the experience of all three. And bring your friends. JAM
