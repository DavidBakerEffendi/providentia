My first visit here was short but certainly sweet! My husband chose Red Owl Tavern to hang out after dinner. We were greeted promptly and our server was nice and kept checking on us even if we were just there to order drinks. They have such a friendly and comfortable atmosphere here. The second time, we ordered room service for breakfast from them. The food arrived to us a little cold but I'm not sure if that was due to Red Owl or the hotel for not sending us the food right away (it took a good 20-25 minutes for our food to arrive in our room). I think that if the food would've gotten to me right away my hollandaise would not have been so thick and the butter would not have set. I only ate about a quarter of it because of that and also because my english muffin was a little over toasted so it was bitter. Will I go back? Yes, for the drinks and for the nice vibe of the actual restaurant. I would definitely like to try their other food, dinner or lunch so that I can make another review. Special shout out to their management for reaching out to us, any place that pays that kind of attention to your experience is worth giving a second or third shot!
