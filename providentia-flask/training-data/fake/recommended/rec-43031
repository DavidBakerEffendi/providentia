First off, the food as mediocre. You barley get what you pay for. Now that that's out of the way, the drinks are amazingl. I had the "Martinez", which was one of the best drinks i've  had in NYC. It is a gin based drink, with moschino liquer (not to be confused with cherry liquer) and with absinthe bitters. The bar makes they're own bitters,  which was very interesting to learn; more importantly, it made a world of difference in the drink. It was a great combination of flavors and I highly reccomend it! Also, the service was great, especially for a bar.
