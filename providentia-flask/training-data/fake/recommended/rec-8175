As a Penn student in the early 90's, I frequented this place.  I remember I would have to phone my order in ahead of time, wait in line and while waiting indulge on free munchies (cookies, brownies etc) while waiting for my order to be filled.  As a New Yorker, I never thought I would find a good old fashion Jewish Deli while studying away from home.  This place  will always be a favorite.
