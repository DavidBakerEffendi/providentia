The staff is not great at service but they smile at least (which is a huge step above neighborhoods like Williamsburg).  The half off Tapas Tuesdays is amazing.  They get four stars for having great food.  Everything was good except avoid the calamari; not good at all.  Yuck.  But we tried everything on the menu and had wonderful experiences with everything else.  Enjoy!
