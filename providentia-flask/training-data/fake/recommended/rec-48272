We were horrified when chef Franco Frances instructed the waitress to inform us that the swordfish that we had to send back because it tasted fishy, would be added to our bill anyway.    He was uninterested that we were humiliated by this reaction and that he had ruined our birthday dinner.   When a chef takes this kind of feedback personally, and retaliates by embarrassing his patrons, it won't be long before clientele go elsewhere.  We are done with Pasticceria Bruno.   Shame on your Mr. Frances, and shame on your arrogance
