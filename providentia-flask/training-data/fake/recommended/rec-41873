Solid as always. Love their house cab - affordable at $8 a glass and excellent. Crab tacos are very unique, a little spicy, and perfect! Only slight disappointment was the shrimp pad thai - it has changed a little, and no longer comes with sprouts or peanuts...was a little odd just being noodle and a few shrimp.
