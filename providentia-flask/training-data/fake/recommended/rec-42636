I was really looking forward to dining here and experiencing a broad array of Brazilian food.  The reviews were great, I had a Groupon, so I figured this was the perfect opportunity.  We visited on a Tuesday night.  Maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe I'm just picky, or maybe it was just a slow night for them because the buffet options were limited and all the meats were dried out (except for the lamb) like they'd been sitting around warming for far too long. Maybe if they cooked larger pieces, they wouldn't dry out so fast.  I asked for med-rare, but med to med-well was about all they could offer.  The beef was very salty as well. As I stated, the buffet options appeared limited to me for a Brazilian restaurant, there were only about 8 different sides on it besides salad.   I enjoyed the quinoa and collards, black beans, rice cakes and lamb, but that was about it.  Didn't really eat much of the meat since most of it was so dry.  We ended up spending $60 for 3 people and I'm glad I had a Groupon, because I didn't enjoy it very much.  It's ok, but definitely no where near as good as a Fogo de Chao.  I've had great BraziIian food before and this is lacking in comparison.  I won't be returning.
