Great food, horrifying service. I wrote the first time off as a fluke- and Jacob himself ended up comping our meal, which was nice. The next 3 times that the service was awful... We said nothing. Today was the last straw- waited 20 minutes for drinks, then decided that the service wasn't worth paying for. We waited an additional 20 minutes for the check (for one drink each) and the waitress shrugged apathetically when we told her we were leaving. Totally done with this place.
