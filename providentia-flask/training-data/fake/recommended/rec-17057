L&B is easily the best pizza out there... As an original Brooklynite, I feel comfortable saying that and feel like I have a little authority when saying so... If you've never been there, you won't understand until you go... This 75 year old restaurant has a style all on its own... Still family owned today, the pizza is out of this world... Oh and to be clear, when I say pizza I mean the Sicilian slices... Don't waste your time on round slices... Their method of cheese then sauce on top is perfection... I myself crushed 6 slices yesterday with ease and then washed it down with a cup of classic spumoni (it's not ice cream, it's just spumoni) to finish the perfect lunch.  If you are anywhere remotely close to Brooklyn, do yourself a favor and pick up a slice or a sheet (they're not pies, they're sheets).   Having to say I'll be back is borderline insulting... Only question is how soon I will be back!
