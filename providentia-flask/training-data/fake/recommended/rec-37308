This is my favorite spot in Brooklyn. Always fresh and clean. Small and quiet but always quick service and polite.  There was a small error in my order and they removed the full amount of the panini. Amazing. You can't find a better spot to just grab a bite to eat.   I will continue to go here for an amazing meal. I have my whole family dining here and they're in love.   Beautiful presentations also! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!
