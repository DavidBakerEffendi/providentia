Went for the brunch on a Sunday, and was delighted with the service and the food. Make a reservation since the place gets packed because of the excellent dishes and its popularity. The food was well prepared, and tasty. All the brunch dishes were amazing. The bread basket superb, and the coffee excellent! Definitely a repeat restaurant, and highly recommended.
