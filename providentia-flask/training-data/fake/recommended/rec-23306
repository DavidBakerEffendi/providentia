This place has a bit of quintessential dive bar live music venue feel which i suppose is what it is going for however the prices are not quintessential dive bar prices. Their food and drinks are a bit expensive with beers around 6 bucks however their shows/music are great which I suppose is why there is a mark up. Â There is a pool table on the plus side.
