The service and the beer selection is the only reason this place did not get one star. The draught list was awesome, and the server was very pleasant, but the food was  AWFUL! Words cannot describe how bad it was. We first ordered hummus for an appetizer. What came out was a pile of mashed chick peas with some sort of slime on top of them acting as a cucumber garnish. The "hummus" had NO flavor or any added ingredients expect for the chick peas. I had to pile salt on for it to even have any kind of taste. For my entree I got a basic salad, how does one screw that up? It was very warm, uncomfortably warm for a salad. It was a hot summer night, and I wanted to go somewhere with a cold beer and refreshing salad.  It was at least 80 degrees in the restaurant and the food was sub par.  I will never be going back there ever again.
