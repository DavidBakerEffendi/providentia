This place was F U C K I N G incredible. While in philtha...I mean uhh Philadelphia, finding a breakfast/brunch place was like finding a needle in a pile of needles, some of which where rusty and old. However, there appeared to be a few gems. Under any normal circumstances, if you say the word brunch to me I would most likely chop you in the throat. Buttt I was with 3 sexy ladies and I figured I could make an exception. I read reviews and looked at the pics for sabrinas and it looked spot on.  So we made the hike. What was supposed be .9 miles was 1.2 miles away. And with 3 starving snitches biting at my heels every minute in the wet balmy fucking freezing weather seemed like an eternity. So we finally got there and with hungry stomachs we we're hoping it at least halfway lived up to the hype. The servers were super nice with a few hotties sporting tats and other counterculture accessories. Now to the food, OMFG, fish tacos???? As the only fish dish on the menu the statement of it's boldness needed no introduction. Dude no lie, best fucking fish tacos I ever had in my life. I only had em like 5 other times (not at taco bell) and for realisies...amazing. Fresh everything, cold pico, fresh guac, lime, grilled mahi mahi, spiciness, silly sauce, exploding with flavor I nearly exploded in my pants (the front side). With a new improved sense of self worth, i said fuck walking, I'm taking a cab, because I'm worth it. Thanks you sabrinas café, thank you.
