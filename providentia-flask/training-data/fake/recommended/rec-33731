Ordered the tuna, but was told, "I know it's on the menu but we haven't had it for months and probably won't get it back in."  Then ordered the Cod sandwich, which was a daily special.  Some reason the specials are more expensive than the standard menu items.  For $10, there was hardley any cod.  It was like eating a salad (lettuce, tomato, and onion) with tartar sauce on a long italian roll.  Horrible.  Told the waitress, she said she would let the kitchen know.  No manager is ever present here.  don't waste your time with the specials.....like most reviews say....stick with the burgers, fries, and beer.
