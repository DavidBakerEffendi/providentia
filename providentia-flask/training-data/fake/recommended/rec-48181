I moved back to Hudson County a year ago and menus for Fontana were included in our "Welcome Packet" from the manaagement company at the Alexan. I have been so pleased with EVERYTHING we have ordered from here ! The pizza, whether its veggie, pepperoni or seafood pizza (wow, something really special that we have had many times !) is excellent. The chicken wings are the best - meaty, flavorful, this family doesn't skimp ! The Tuscan Salad is a favorite with the thinly sliced muzz and always fresh greens -- other salads are equally delicious. The sandwiches, dinners and pastas and the sauteed spiniach w/garlic and oil, the breads....I have never had a bad meal - everything is flavorful and tasty, the portions are big (we order a dinner and could have it for two nights), prompt delivery and everything is always hot...we have ordered from here at least once or twice a week since we first moved back here. It is an established Bayonne restaurant that still delivers great quality and service at a great price. To pick up from there is also a pleasure...we order on our way home and its ready, piping hot and yummy...the family that owns it works hard and they have been very accomodating ...refreshing and a pleasure to give them our business. I agree with Kae S., people really should check this place out and write about it .
