I like going here for lunch. Nothing particularly great about it but they add the right amount of grease, MSG, sodium and sugar to make any meat delicious. Their home made iced tea tastes just like Lipton powdered iced tea but it's still good. Good change up from the 2 million sub shops within this town.
