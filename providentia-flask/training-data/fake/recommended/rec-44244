The food has been on a steep decline for a few years and is now bland and overpriced.  While I used to enjoy TG for its simple-but-good meals, the quality and care with which the food is prepared is no longer even acceptable, let alone good. You can get a far superior burger next door at Prime 16, and a better beer selection at, well, Prime 16. The menu is lazy and unimaginative. The service is inattentive, slow, and completely unapologetic. You get the feeling that the wait staff would rather be sitting at the bar texting their friends. Which is where you'll find them if you want to place your order.   While the outdoor patio--a unique find in downtown New Haven--is nice in good weather, I suspect that the their dumpster is hiding behind the fenced off area. On hot days the patio smells like rotting garbage and the tables and menus are sticky. This is all symptomatic of the I-don't-give-a-shit attitude that this place seems to have adopted. Save yourself the trouble and take your business to Prime 16. Aside from the outside seating, it has everything Temple Grill does not.
