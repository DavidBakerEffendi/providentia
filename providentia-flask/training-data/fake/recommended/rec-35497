This place is fantastic--good service, excellent ingredients with pasta often prepared in-house, and a refreshing lack of pretension. We particularly like the bucatini and the tiramisu, but nothing on the menu has disappointed yet. There are fewer and fewer reasons to come to the increasingly overhyped Greater Williamsburg, but this place is worth the trek.
