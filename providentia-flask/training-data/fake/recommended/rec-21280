Another spot that I had been looking forward to checking out for awhile... I have the cookbook that my friend Ryan and Tricia gave me for my birthday and I was ready to try all the food at the Ssam Bar, especially the pork buns. We asked the waiter what he recommended which were the pork sandwich and the spicy pork with rice cakes. Since what we wanted was on the lunch set menu the guy recommneded we go that route and I'm glad we did to save some cash. Unfortunately the pork sandwich was OK, the meat was pretty bland and the rice cake dish seemed to have way too much sauce, looked completely different from the cookbook. BUT the pork buns I must way were absolutely amazing, the meat just melt in your mouth and the buns were so soft! Not sure if some of the food is worth the price but I'm glad I tried a few different dishes. Definitely heading back for those pork buns.
