I have Â a love hate relationship with Mexican restaurants that try to be be high end. On one hand, good Mexican food is not hard to find in NYC and expensive Mexican food is theoretically an oximoron. I mean how much does it cost to buy rice, chips and avocado? Ofrenda is not a low end Mexican restaurant but it is not pretentious as well. The new hot spot located conviently on 7th Avenue across from another new Mexican restaurant is quite cozy with a wonderfully rustic interior. Beautiful hostesses with amazing accents greet and escorted us to our table. Surprisingly, we were able to hear ourselves talk even though the place was packed. We started off with Happy Hour Margaritas and chips with guacamole. Now chips and Guac are a deal breaker for me. If you don't start off on the right foot then leave the restaurant ASAP is what my Southwestern boyfriend Chad, always says. The chips at Ofrenda were delicious, crisp with a hint of salt. Guac was creamy with chunks of tomatoe and onion. Our server screwed up the drink orders but she was so sexy and had the most seductive accent, that we didn't care. She made up for it by returning with another round right away. We ordered the rellenos, the cheese fondue and the spicy shrimp as appetizers. They were all very good, particularly the spicy shrimp. For dinner, I had the lamb chops which I don't recommend. Lamb chops always sounds so good on paper but eating them is not practical. I had to pick them up and chew on the last remaining bits of meat. My friend, Gary, was none to pleased to see me stick my greasy hand back in the bowl of chips, but sorry Gary, I love me some chips. My friends had the steak, which was very good. Overall, the meal was fun, tasty and not very inexpensive. So if you're looking for a Mexican restaurant that ranks well above Taco Bell but not as high end as Dos Caminos, then Ofrenda has a lot to offer.
