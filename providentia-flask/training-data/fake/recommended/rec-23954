DiNics offers the best pork sandwich I've ever put in my mouth. Juicy tender slices of slow-cooked pork, nestled in a jus-soaked roll, topped with garlicky broccoli rabe. It's an explosion of flavor. My only small gripe: the only cheese they offer is sharp provolone. I hate sharp provolone. Before you say it, I'm Chinese - so I know, that's soooo un-American. However, even without cheese, the sandwich is mighty tasty. I hit up DiNics during my weekend trips to RTM, and the line for DiNic's so absurdly long. Don't let this discourage you. Get your ass in that line and get your hands on a sandwich. It's worth the wait. I love the roast pork sandwich so much that I have yet to try any of their other sandwiches! I must make myself do this on my next visit... maybe. Maybe the sausage, or roast beef... Or perhaps I'll just order another roast pork. Â =P
