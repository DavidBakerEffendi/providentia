Very good sushi located in the NJ suburbs.  Very nice ambience(asian decorations, bamboo, asian woods), lighting(dim but not too dim) and decorations, makes you feel relaxed and ready to enjoy the sushi.   Price: a little bit pricey, each piece of toro will cost you 6-7 dollars(they do give you a nice large piece though, about the size of a credit card, and about half an inch thick), other sashimi is 4-5 dollars each.  Smaller rolls are 9-10 dollars, and larger special rolls (3 inch diameter) are 13-15 dollars each.  They have a good variety of rolls, I always get at least one of the 007 roll, christmas roll is quite good as well.   Quality: fish freshness and quality of the cut are top notch for a suburban Japanese restaurant.  I have yet to find better quality fish outside of NYC restaurants that cost twice-three times as much.  The white tuna melts in your mouth, and the fatty tuna almost melts in your mouth while providing you with strong flavor with each bite. Overall, a great experience if you don't want to go to NYC and pay the NYC prices for sushi.
