Amazing! The lunch deal is the best! I eat a lot of Pad See Ew, and this one was great - wonderful flavor. So glad I received this menu in my letterbox. I don't remember seeing the restaurant in my travels, or hearing about it before. The Veggie Puffs (Curry Puffs without chicken) were amazing - chunky veggies, with a slight curry taste. And their cucumber sauce and peanut sauce are outstanding. I'll be back!
