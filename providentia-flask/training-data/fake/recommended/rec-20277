My wife and I love this place so much that we hired them to provide food for our wedding.  Delicious food made from fresh ingredients for a reasonable price.  Baby back ribs, chicken liver mousse, bacon-roasted almonds, corn bread . . . the fried chicken is also great.  A big thank you to owner Doug and chef Ryan, who happily put together a menu that our guests loved, and made things very easy for us. Nice atmosphere, staff generally handles customers pleasantly and efficiently. Drawbacks: - Place gets busy and only accepts reservations from parties of 5 or more - Some dishes can be pretty salty, so if you're very sensitive to that BC might not be the greatest place for you - A bit pricey, but you get very good value for your money.  Food is much tastier and more distinctive than most of the other many restaurants in the area.
