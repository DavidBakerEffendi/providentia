Had to try this place since I am a huge fan of lobster rolls! It's cool that they have an entire well of lobsters right by the entrance. Unfortunately, I cannot give them 5 stars because i do perfer Luke's Lobster. This place is also far to get to! I came here because i was on my way to Ikea. They have two areas. One area where you order your food, and a second area to sit.
