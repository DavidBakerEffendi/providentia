Really good, fresh food-- and as a vegetarian (I don't eat fish), I appreciate the vegetarian options. But 3 stars only, because my favorite dish of the few veggie options is the Farmer's Bowl. But man, is it expensive. $13 for what is essentially rice topped with a rather small helping of veggies and about 1/4 of an avocado? I live right across the street, but I only come to Silver Rice on rare occasion because I feel like I'm getting ripped off.
