What's not to love about this place? The decor, starting at the front door is amazing. The lanterns and rustic elements in the main dining area are so perfect and set a definite mood that makes your delicious meal even better. The staff was great- inviting and accommodating. The food and drinks were great. For dinner we started off with spring rolls, which are not typically my thing, but we ordered some because my husband likes them. The spring rolls here are so good, we almost fought over them. Just kidding... sort of. I don't think my husband anticipated as much sharing as he had to do. Hubs had pad thai for his entree and I had green curry. Both looked beautiful and were as good as any we've had. We were very happy with every aspect of our experience here!
