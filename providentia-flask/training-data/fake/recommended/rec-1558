Complete trash.  If you've ever eaten a cheesesteak in your life, avoid this place.  Just a tourist trap and hype machine.  Quizno's makes a much better cheesesteak.  In the question of pat's vs geno's, the answer is, who f*cking cares?  They both suck.  Went here 2 years ago with my brother.  Needless to say, i was excited, cuz i love food and heard so much about these two places.  I took a bite, looked at him, and started laughing.  Same with geno's, though.  I figured maybe i was mistaken, so i have gone back every time i've gone to philly for a concert or something (live in DC).  Nope.  Eaten here three or four times.  Wish i had my $30 back, so i could buy a grenade and blow the two places up. Maybe if i was blackout drunk.
