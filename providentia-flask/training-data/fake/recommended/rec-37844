I love this place. I'm from Philly and I agree that it's a trendy- cool place to go. I also agree that it is a bit overpriced but the food has great flavor and I keep going back. I love ALL mexican food from the gourmet to the basic. The guacamole here is amazing, both the classic one and the other innovative ones are worth trying. It always hits the spot. The food can be rich so be prepared for that. I'm also a fan of the chopped salad. I get it every time. I also appreciate the bright colors and party-like atmosphere of this place. It is loud and the bar is often crowded but most of the tables are far enough apart that you don't feel cramped. For the most part the service is great and I've never felt rushed. Advice for first timers: make a reservation. At least a few days in advance if you want to go on the weekend.
