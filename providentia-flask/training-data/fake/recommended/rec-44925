We were lucky to walk in toward the end of lunch and get a table.  Fresh, tasty, food; wonderful, easy-going service.  Our artichoke and fig salad was perfection, as was the duck entree and both desserts:  the raspberry beignet and the incredible apple crisp.  Great coffee.  Nothing stuffy or pretentious about this cozy spot...just great food.
