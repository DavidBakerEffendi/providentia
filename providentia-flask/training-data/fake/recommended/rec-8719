The food is great the customer service questionable its hard to tell if the counter person is rude or just being Jamaican? But the food is so good she can be wat Eva. I'm still gonna eat there I love the ackee, the butter fish, and the oxtail.rice is kinds dry but with the gravy its all good! Priced just right but u gonna spend about 20 food a good meal
