My initial feelings about Heirloom were positive as I walked into the lobby. It's a clean, modern atmosphere, which is something I personally enjoy. On this particular day, they had some live music playing. That's great, but I didn't buy tickets to a jazz show, I was there to eat lunch. Music in this scenario should have been limited to an ambient decibel level, one which allowed patrons to have a conversation with one another without yelling over the damn music. Moving on, the appetizers were pretty darn good. The warm local ricotta dip, and the bread served along with it, were excellente. For my entree, I ordered the huevos estudiados. In case any one is interested, here is the description, "Two Fried Eggs, CT Grassfed Chili, Spiced Pepper Jack Cheese, House Chips & Avocado Sauce" Sounds delicious right? Negative. What came instead was an absolutely enormous pile of what appeared to be canned sloppy joe mix with a fried egg on top. Next to that was an even bigger pile of "house chips". Somewhere, deep below that pile of chips, and pretty much on top of the sloppy joe mix was a measly scoop of avocado sauce. I don't even remember seeing or tasting the pepper jack cheese, I was so shocked by the sheer quantity of chili on the plate to even notice. Put simply, I enjoyed the appetizer, I did not like my main dish, and I would not return here again.
