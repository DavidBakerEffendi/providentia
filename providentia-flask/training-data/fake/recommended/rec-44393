Leunig's has a fabulous ambiance, a terrific location and is always a busy and lively spot.  Unfortunately, the food is just not that good.  The sweet potato fries are pretty good;  the salad always has includes a few rotten lettuce pieces;  the burger's good;  the entrees tend to be large, cheesy and mediocre.  Most of the waitstaff are nice, some not so much.  It's a great place for "drinks" and for a convenient, if somewhat unsatisfying, meal.  But, again, the ambiance and location canm't be beat.
