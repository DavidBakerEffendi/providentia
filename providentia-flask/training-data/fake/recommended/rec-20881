I happened to be in the neighborhood enjoying spa week when I walked passed the famed halal guys cart and the line was short! My wait time was about 5 minutes and the guys managing the cart where very orderly and quick with the line. I tried the half chicken/half lamb with rice but didnt taste my food until I got home (Brooklyn) because as soon as I got my order the rain came down in buckets. However, surprisingly my food was still warm when I got home. Also I noticed that everyone keeps pricing the cost at $6.00 but I was given $5.00 change from a $10.00 bill? maybe I was just lucky or he had no singles. I tried tasing everything seperately and truly understood why most of the reviews talk about the lamb - the delicious flavor! But in my opinion it didnt taste any different than lamb gyro meat that Ive had in the past when eaten alone. What I believe takes the taste up a notch is the white sauce- which tastes no different than any other than Ive tasted before BUT the halal guys heap it on and give you even more to take home. Most other halal stands that Ive been to do not allow that. I have been to only one other halal cart in Manhattan where the chicken meat itself was so delicious that the sauce wasnt needed. The flavor of the plain meat from this cart taste like typical chicken and lamb BUT everything together with lots of sauce is just pure deliciousness! I would definitely try them again in the future if I was in the area BUTonly if the line isnt long.
