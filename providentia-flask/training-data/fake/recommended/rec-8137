I'm writing this review solely based on the pork soy sauce noodles (with tea egg, of course!)...because it's the only thing I've gotten here before!  I have to say it's quite good...salty and hearty, especially with the fresh-made noodles.  I definitely come here for that, since a lot of other places don't offer that.  Don't forget the egg...I feel that it makes a big difference. Service is quick, but sometimes the place can be really crowded and cramped.  Oh well :) Still good, in my opinion.
