Soooooo good. Their BBQ is awesome and home made cornbread too! It's best to go in the summer and enjoy their picnic tables. There is very little indoor seating. It's a very casual place, the owner is very personable and a fast mover! The kitchen is open and you can watch her cook. They also cater, but I haven't tried their catering yet.
