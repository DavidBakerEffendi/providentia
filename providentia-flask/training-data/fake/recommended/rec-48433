Yum yum yum yum.  The decor makes you feel like you stepped into a cozy farmhouse in Vermont, but the food is just perfect.  I had an incredible tart and tangy roasted beet salad, and the white bean stew for an entree.  After dinner we shared the roasted pineapples with coconut ice cream and macadamia nuts.  Are you drooling yet?  It was insane.  For 2 wine-drinking chatty fools...we practically ate in silence.  It was that intense.
