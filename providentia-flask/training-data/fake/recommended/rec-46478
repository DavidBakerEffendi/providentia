Was this good or what? Started out with an almost hour long wait on a Monday night even though we did have a reservation. Everything was up from there, though! I passed the time having what I assume is their spin on a Manhattan - Old Overholt Rye, huckleberry jus, a touch of absinthe, and an orange rind. Yea, that passed the time just fine. We sat a table and I was excited to have a view into the kitchen for a possible Iron Chef sighting, but no such luck. Still fun to see all the kitchen wonder happening though! The tables themselves were beautiful - solid (cherry I think, it was pretty dark) and long. Our group of 5 was at the same table with a group of 4 but separated by a table plant. Clever, I thought. I wasn't very bold with my dinner choice. I was with work folk so I took their lead. But, it was delicious. I had a wonderful radicchio salad to start and then some of the best halibut I've ever tasted. I can't wait to go back here!
