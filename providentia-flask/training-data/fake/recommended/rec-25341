Since its opening, I've been to Fare twice.  The first time was during their first week open, and it was clear that some kinks were being worked out. I appreciate the fact that the management has taken everyones' feedback to heart. So, we were a party of 7 sitting in a square booth, which was fantastic because I'm sure we were the loudest group there, and isolation was good (a family outing...people shouting over one another to be heard...spirited discussions...baggage...drinks!) We had the very best service I've ever experienced.  I need to find out what her name is, because she was both attentive and entertaining without being even a little bit invasive. I would return there for her charm alone. The food was good!  I had the seitan and polenta and it was done really well. Other folks at the table ordered and enjoyed the duck confit, soft shell crab, lamb burger...I can't remember what else, but all were happy. Chocolate cakes were shared for dessert.  They were quite good! We also had a bottle of CA Pinot Noir and some fun cocktails, like the Water of Life (surprisingly strong with a very light touch of flavor). All good. So, in summation:  Good food, 4 Star service, good wine/cocktails, not insanely unhealthy dining out, Fare is getting better and better. We shall return.
