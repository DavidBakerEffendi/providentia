This is a very nice restaurant. Though the layout of it is quite strange, but the food is nothing short of amazing. The service is good as well. We had the pork belly, cod fish, lobster and baked Alaska and more. Since my visit was a while back I can't remember all of it. But the baked Alaska was definitely a must have if you are one for dessert. The portion of this place is quite good we ordered the tasting size so we could try more. Certainly not a everyday joint, but if you have a special occasion consider this the place.
