Two stars is a generous designation for this historic diner. While it's easy to be charmed by the old school ambience, the food was barely there. We ordered a chicken parm plate that was bland, a Athenia burger platter, plopped on top of a dismal, pretend Greek salad, and several soups which came from a can. The waitress was harried and the men's room smelled like one of those damp humid corners of Penn Station circa 1980. There must be better options in this charming town.
