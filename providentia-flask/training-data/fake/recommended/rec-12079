Our office is just down the street from Ramuntos, and we order from them frequently for many events, meetings, etc. What I can say for the pizza is that it is generally very good, and they have the best spicy buffalo chicken pizza I've ever had - I say this as someone that generally doesn't like chicken pizzas, but will always order this one from Ramuntos. Service on the other hand is a bit chilly and rushed at times. Not always the most friendly people to deal with - experience on the phone is quite curt when ordering; expect to get hung up on if they think you've finished, even if you haven't. If it wasn't for that, they would rate a full star higher.
