5 stars?  You betcha!  Definitely go for the lamb platter with both white and hot sauce.  You'll be licking the plate as you bumble away in your food/grease coma.  I recently paid a ridiculous amount to park while driving through NYC (even though I could have gone over the GWB to get to Conn.) just to have this food.  The parking wasn't worth the price, but the food made it all better!
