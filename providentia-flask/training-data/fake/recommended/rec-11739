Working man's bar with a kitchen. Like most restaurants in the Ironbound section of Newark this place specializes in Portuguese meat and fish. I usually get a simple house salad and some BBQ chicken. Everything is fresh and the waiters are super attentive. So what if they don't speak English? Almost everyone here has a few drinks with lunch. They have plenty if Portuguese wine although the locals take the cheap stuff with a spritz of seltzer or sprite.
