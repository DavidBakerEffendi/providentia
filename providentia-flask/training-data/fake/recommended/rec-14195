Pro: The pizza was fresh.  The flavors of the ingredients came out with each bite. The texture was consistent with the ingredients.  Open kitchen.  The price was reasonable.   Con:  The long wait.  The door man who kept flirting with all the ladies.  The restaurant is small. Everyone is packed in. Only 1 restroom.  Drinks are expensive.
