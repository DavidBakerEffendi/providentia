We are vegetarian and had the vegetable dumplings, the sesame pancake with veg., and the peanut noodles. The vegetable dumplings are nice, steamed not fried, with a really flavorful filling. I'm guessing the meat-filled fried dumplings are the main event because the sesame pancake is really what I would come back for... It's this sandwich where the bread is coated in sesame seeds and a little sweetness and then fried... The result is a bread with a crispy fried/toasty/sweet exterior with a soft interior... Really lovely. And they fill it with carrots and scallions which seem to be lightly pickled. Delicious. The peanut noodles are pretty basic and probably wouldn't have again. Four of us ate a lot of food... Including my omnivore boyfriend who had the pork and chives dumplings and a soup... And it came out to $26, drinks included.
