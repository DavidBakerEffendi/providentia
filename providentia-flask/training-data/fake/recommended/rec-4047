I've always been taught that you can judge the authenticity of a restaurant based on the demographic of its patrons. So if the customers at Big Wong's aren't indicator enough, take it from my parents who are really particular about their restaurants and myself that this place is a must-try if you're looking for real deal Chinese food. My parents are a big fan of the congee, and I prefer the duck noodle soup. In spite of the fairly rock bottom prices, they were pretty liberal with the amount of duck in the soup as opposed to some places that use the main ingredient more as a garnish. Only caveat is that the place is not known for its service. When my parents remarked that the salty congee doughnuts were cold, the waiter retorted that we never asked to have them heated. Word to the gastronomically inclined, they always should be served hot unless you're aiming for indigestion. Only caveat is that the place is not known for it's service. When my parents remarked that the I'm-blanking-on-it's-name-in-english (savory pastries that you eat with congee...chinese doughnuts?) were cold, the waiter retorted that we never asked to have them heated. Word to the gastronomically inclined, they alway should be served hot unless you're aiming for indigestion.
