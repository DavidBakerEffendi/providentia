Matt and Marie's is a great place to grab a bite to eat.  The first time I visited, I wasn't in the mood for a sandwich and ordered the Tuscan Bruschetta Salad. The salad was delicious and  big enough to serve as two meals.  The second time I visited, I ordered the Pieta Pastrami Sandwich, and I was happy to find that it was equally delicious.  I highly recommend Matt and Marie's to anyone looking for a good sandwich and salad.
