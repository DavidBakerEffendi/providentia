This restaurant used to be a good place. it is no longer the case. decor is dark. the floor is dirty and it looks like the policies of cleanliness are not in place here (it is a shame since most chains uphold standards). Â took a while to sit, a while to get service and the food was below standards. restaurant was not full. it was not a busy night. there are far better options in the area there.
