I received a nice apology from the manager, who noted that the service was off the night I went because it was the 4th of July.  I trust that he has educated his staff on appropriate customer relations in such a case, and that perhaps my experience was an anomaly. When we did get our burgers they were indeed good.  We'll probably try the onion rings instead of the sweet potato fries next time.
