The food is amazing as well as the decor and service of the restaurant.  I'm giving it 2 starts because on the Saturday night I went there something most have gone wrong with the ventilation system.  When we came out of the restaurant, our clothing was impregnated with smoke, grease and onions smell.  It was so bad that I had to rush home and wash whatever could be washed and sent the coats to the dry cleaners.  I honestly don't think I can go back there if I have to send my clothes for cleaning again.  I hope it was just that night since I have spoken to other people that have gone there before and did not have this bad experience.
