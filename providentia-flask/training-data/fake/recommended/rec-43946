Came to NY for business, and was thrilled to walk past Eataly on my way to catch a train. I grabbed a prosciutto crudo & arugula on focaccia sandwich for dinner.  It was outstanding!  I went back to get another one to throw in the fridge for lunch the next day. I loved the different sections.  So many luxurious food options that I couldn't take with me!  I did grab some organic tomatoes (that were promptly confiscated at the airport), some Arabica coffee, and orecchiette. I've yet to visit the Eataly in Chicago, but I'm thinking a trip soon is in order.
