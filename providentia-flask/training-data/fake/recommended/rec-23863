after hearing from my friends about this place...decided to try out...well...right from beginning...our server was just rude...he didnt even say hi...he just came up gave us menu...and he remained that way for the rest of the evening...now comes food...chicken liver rigatoni was amazing...but it was on bit of salty side...other appetizers...veal tongue and robiola...was also just OK...ended up ordering the daily special...slow roasted pork as my entree...which was so so bad...absolutely ZERO taste...poor presentation...must say...not going back here ever again...
