I decided to check this place out since I live so close and have been hearing awesome reviews of this place. I didn't try the Chinese food - I probably should next time. I wasn't really impressed with the Japanese fare. It was good but not great. Service was extremely slow. It was a Friday evening and there was nobody in the restaurant when we arrived. First, our waiter was not attentive. He hardly checked up on us. Then, it took forever for the sushi chef to make the sushi, although we kept on seeing many freshly made sushi orders leaving the restaurant to delivered?! We ordered the edamame and shumai to share. The shumai was good. I also ordered two rolls: Tokyo roll and the Spicy Salmon Roll. Both rolls were good, but nothing great. I have had better sushi though. The sushi rolls were just a little too big and quite frankly, it made chewing the roll a little difficult. Would I come back again? Maybe, just to try their Chinese cuisine.
