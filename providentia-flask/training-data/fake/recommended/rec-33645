Great Italian food! This isn't your plain old chicken-parmesan-lots-of-red-sauce-my-non-Italian-Â­mom-could-make-this-food-the-same-way type of place...this is legit. Don't let the unappetizing name of the restaurant turn you off. I have been here twice and have loved my meal each time! Some things to keep in mind: they are cash only (boo!), I never really know when they're going to be open (I don't think they're open for lunch b/c I went by one day and they were closed) and you're going to have to wait ~30-50 mins for a table if you go on the weekend. These drawbacks are the reason I've only eaten here twice.
