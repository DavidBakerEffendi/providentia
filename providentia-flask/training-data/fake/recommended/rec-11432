This place is about as Mexican as an Italian cow.  But then again, Italian cow is damn tasty.  Well, any cow is tasty.  But I digress. The point is, despite the Clint Eastwood posters on the wall (back before he was busy reforming Hmong teenagers and training female boxers), this place has pretty seriously tasty food and way tasty margaritas. I can't speak about table service, but every time I've been here, the service at the bar was great.  My margarita glass didn't remain unfilled for more than half a minute or so.  I've only ordered the burritos (fish a couple times, steak a couple times).  They're good, but much smaller than the head sized chunks of flatbread and meat you'd get at any of the chain burrito places.  I like them better though.  I'd rather my meal not be a competition between my stomach and three pounds of white rice.
