Went on a Saturday night, it was busy about a 20 minute wait but not too bad. We decided to eat at the bar - had the tomato pizza and the fig+speck (without the speck) and they were both REALLY good! It's not New Haven style pizza if that's what you're looking for but the topping combos for their pizzas work really well together. They also try to use fresh and local ingredients so a plus there too. There was also a fun atmosphere, great music in the background, definitely worth a try!
