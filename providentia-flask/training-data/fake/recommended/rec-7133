This BXL location is most definitely NOT similar to the BXL Zoute in Gramercy. It's got a british pub sort of vibe, dark and a bit grimy. Quite unexpected considering BXL Zoute is more upscale and trendy. BXL East has a strong focus on beer (somewhat obvious I suppose, as this seems to be a belgian bar?). The selection is good, I tried the house which was nice for my tastes -- I go for the average, not too light and not too dark. Me and my date both got mussels with frites. 2 pounds of mussels requires a pretty freaking huge pot, and it is a hefty order. But if you're determined like I was, you can definitely finish one on your own and have a satisfied belly. I got the marinieres, a light and more traditional version; my date got the grand mere which has bacon... and this is a case of "bacon makes things better." I was a little jealous, his was just a touch of creaminess and had a nice salty bacony bite. The frites were great -- very crispy and seasoned well, a small but important detail. The food was surprisingly yummy, but the service was about par with the ambience of the restaurant. For a place that specializes in something like mussels and frites, my expectations are a little higher. If I was looking for a place to eat, I probably wouldn't go back (although the lunch menu looks like a good deal). If I was in the area and wanted to grab a beer, it wouldn't be a bad choice.
