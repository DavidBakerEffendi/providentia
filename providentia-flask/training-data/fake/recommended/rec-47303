Sometimes the best places to eat in manhattan are the ones well off the beaten path. That is especially true of Extra Virgin, probably one of the finest seafood restaurants ive been to. I went here for lunch on a wednesday, and was thoroughly impressed by the meal. For an appitizer, we shared a fruito di mare platter, a pleasent collection of fried calamari, shrimp, and even fried zucchini. It was all perfrectly cooked, with a pleasent marinara sauce for dipping. My entree may be one of the best things ive EVER had, steamed mussels in a champagne and onion broth with tomatoes and fennel. The mussels were perfectly steamed, as expected, but the broth was the star. The bubbily sweetness of the champagne paired perfectly with the fennel and tomato, making for a truly addictive broth that I had to resist drinking out of the bowl. For desert, the peanut butter cup with ice cream was a bit hard to eat, but the berry cobbler with white chocolate ice cream was absolutely amazing. Also, the creme brulee was perfectly smooth with a perfectly crackly sugar crust. Price wise, its a bit pricey for lunch, with entrees between $14 and $20, but its well worth it for the truly great food, in a rather calm, residential, part of the city.
