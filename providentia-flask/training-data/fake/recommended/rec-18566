Hmm...it was tough to choose how many stars to give. The food was excellent. Like, seriously delicious- and we ordered a variety of small dishes, including the crab and avocado salad (incredible), the zucchini straws (not what we expected, but pretty great all the same), a pizzette, burger, cocktails, etc. HOWEVER. The service was god awful. Took 45 minutes for anything to hit our table., and then everything came at once. The waitress told us she "had no idea how we wanted it to come out" so she just "put it all in together". Â Drinks were never refilled. No one checked on us. The whole thing was a mess. 0 for service. 5 for food.
