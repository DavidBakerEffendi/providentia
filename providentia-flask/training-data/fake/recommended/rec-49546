I decided to go to Mediterranea to get some good food & smoke hookah only to find myself surrounding by other disgruntled patrons who did not want to be surrounded by hookah, and a terrible lack of service from the employees. First of all, if you are coming to a middle Eastern spot that promotes the smoke of hookah, then please do not come here if you are not comfortable with people smoking around you. At least 3 tables around us had customers complain of people smoking around them. For the rest of us that came here to eat and smoke hookah, I'm sure it was displeasing to see staff escort these patrons to other locations. So word to the wise: if you are not comfortable with being in an atmosphere of having people smoke hookah and various flavors of smoke come your way - then THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT PLACE FOR YOU. Â  BAD Meditteranean food. HORRIFIC Service. OVERPRICED hookah (seriously - you will not get any coal after getting your hookah - so once the hookah is finished - IT IS FINISHED) And don't expect to see your server. The chances are he'll disappear once he takes your order, and you will never see him after that. You'll be asking all the staff around you for things you need. Never going back again.
