I've been here twice - once for a bachelorette party, once for my birthday. Both were amazing. The other reviewers cover it pretty well so I just want to share a story about how good these people are: In July I had my birthday at Marrakesh and before dinner my roommate have me a present... A gorgeous bracelet. Well after eating all of the amazing food with my hands, we headed over to Brau Haus to get some beers. I realized then that I had lost my bracelet. I called Marrakesh right away and they immediately went to our table and found my bracelet. It was late, so I said I would pick it up the day after. Three months later, I'm eating on south street and thought... Maybe, JUST MAYBE, they would have my bracket still. I went to the restaurant, knocked on the door (it was in between the two seating times) a woman nicely opened the door and I explained my story to her. She, with heart warming eyes, replied "July was a long time ago" I said "I know" but smiled optimistically. Wouldn't you know, after about two minutes she returned, bracelet in hand. I couldn't have been happier or more grateful :) this restaurant is not only awesome, it is run by legitimately good people. You should support them.
