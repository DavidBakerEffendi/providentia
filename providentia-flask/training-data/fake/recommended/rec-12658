What can I say that others on Yelp have yet to say. This place is amazing. They're famous for a reason and it's because their food is bomb. My boyfriend and I tried this place after we saw Avenue Q and instantly fell in love. We loved it so much that we had to go again after another show we saw on Broadway. Our first time we ordered two combo plates. We didn't realize the portions were huge. We ended up having to throw half of it away. You pay 6$ for these huge plates of rice, lettuce, pita, chicken/gyro, and these amazing sauces. What a deal. Our second time around we were smart and only ordered one with only gyro. We both preferred the gyro meat because it was, in our opinion, more juicy and tender. I can't wait to come back to NYC and eat at Halal Guys again. Note: at first we were confused why there were so many Halal Guy carts in the span of the same area, we thought some of them were fakes. Although, we read later that the carts around it are the same company but people prefer the first one, which is the one in the corner of the street.
