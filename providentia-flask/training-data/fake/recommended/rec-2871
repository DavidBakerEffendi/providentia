I loved it!!!  What a charming restaurant!! Dined with a friend last night who has been before...nice, clean decor. The chairs were remarkably comfortable. The service was very very good - friendly, attentive and helpful.  The food was superb - simple, clean, flavorful. We each had 2 glasses of the Santa Barbara Chardonnay which was an excellent compliment. We shared a bunch of small plates (no surprise there, right? I'm into sharing!): * hot-smoked salmon, herbed tomatillo sauce * olive oil braised baby artichokes, English peas, Romano cheese * dayboat scallops, sweet pea puree, gremolata * avocado, grapefruit, watercress, bleu cheese, minted vinaigrette * roasted cauliflower, chick peas, cucumber, and dilled yogurt * chocolate cake * peach cobbler We left feeling full but not stuffed and I loved all of our selections! I already emailed my mom to check it out with her friends.
