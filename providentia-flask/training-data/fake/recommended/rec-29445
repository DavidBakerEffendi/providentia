Love Joya! This is why: 1. Inexpensive prices for large portions 2. Quick service 3. Good decor and fab garden area 4. Best curry dishes I've had in years (but ask for peppers to add spice) Picky points of meh: 1. Long waits at peak times (weekends) 2. Cash only - ok, I get that it helps to keep prices down but come on! Joya comforts me so!!!
