I made it a point to travel to NYC to try this place. We arrived on a Monday morning around 9am and there was no wait. I knew we were off to a good start. We ordered their famous blueberry pancakes and the Clinton St. Omelet with ham and tomatoes. The anticipation was killing me as a waited for what I expected to be a little piece of heaven. As the waitress placed the dishes on the table, I saw the beauty of each meal. The blueberry pancakes looked almost too perfect to eat. I went ahead and ate them anyway. They were amazingly fluffy, not dense at all, the flavors of the pancake, blueberries, and warm maple butter came together in perfect harmony. The textures that each of these components added to each bite made it even better. The omelet with hash browns and sourdough toast was colorful and inviting. The ham added the right amount of saltiness and bite to the omelet. The hash browns were incredibly tasty and well-presented. The toast got a dunk in the maple butter for good measure. My experience at the Clinton St. Baking Company was great. No wait, friendly service, and amazing food that will leave you craving it for days on. It is even worse when you live in Texas and all your body wants is a stack of those heavenly pancakes. Although $12 might seem a bit much for pancakes, they are absolutely worth it.
