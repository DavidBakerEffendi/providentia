The roast duck and wontons soup with noodles (B13 on their menu) was good. There was a lot of tender meat on the duck and the wontons were filled with shrimpy goodness. The "special vegetables with oyster sauce" was actually a heaping portion of Chinese broccoli, not that that's a bad thing at all! Only complaint is that I called in an order, and when I got to the restaurant to pick it up, they didn't have it and I had to order again. But they made it so fast that they probably knew better than I did that it would have been cold if they made it when I called.
