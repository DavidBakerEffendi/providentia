This place is okay.  Its a tourist place and pretty crowded so you may have to share tables.  Their Xiao Lung Bao is okay, I like Crystal Jade Lai Mein Xiao Lung Bao in Hong Kong better.   I went here a couple of times and the price is very reasonable but very crowded.  Both times I was here, I had to share tables.
