CARNA ASADA TACOS,  that all you need to take from this!  When I had them for the first time I literally said WOW!! My boyfriend and I went around East Village one night getting one of every taco that didn't have pork in it and we are never getting tacos from anywhere else again because compared to this place it will just disappoint. Sure other places had better chips and salsa and a more comfortable eating area, but these tacos are all you need to leave feeling great!
