3.5 it tastes good for street food. even if it was served in a little cafe i think i'd emjoy it too. but honestly.. everyone makes a big deal out if it. i dont really see what's so special about it.. it tastes like any other halal cart.. am i missing something?? the white sauce (aka "crack" sauce) really makes it so much better. haha. and of course my love for hot sauce really puts the final detail for a satisfying meal. it's cheap and quick-- relatively speaking without the long line.. i guess its one of those must tries if you're a tourist. :)) although i have never personally craved it.. a few of my friends always want it. but i must mention-- it's usually after a night of drinking or pre drinking. - -;;
