While in Philly, we decided to get an original Philly cheesesteak at Pat's.  The line was long, but went quickly. I got a steak 'wit' onions and provolone.  The meat was great, the roll was a perfect vehicle, but the provolone was not the best choice.  I shoulda got cheese whiz.  I will next time. I didn't get peppers on mine, but they looked good.  Again, next time. P.S. Geno's may have great signage, but don't be fooled.  My sister's BF got a steak from Pat's and another from Geno's, and he felt that Pat's was superior.
