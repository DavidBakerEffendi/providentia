This has become one of my go-to resturants in the neighborhood (slowly but surely beating out Bar Toto & Provini). I appreciate that the menu has a lighter take on Italian than a lot of the South Slope Italian joints, with a lot of flavorful veggies appearing in nearly every dish. The outdoor seating is delightful, as are the wait staff with their assortment of charming European accents and extremely friendly attitude. The menu is small-ish, but they have a lot of rotating specials, so there is always something new to try. Prices are quite reasonable too (especially the lunch special!).
