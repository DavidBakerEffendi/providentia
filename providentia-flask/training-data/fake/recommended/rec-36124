DELICIOUS LATE NIGHT STREET FOOD We arrived late in Manhattan and we were hungry and tired; Halal food cart on 53rd and 6th came to our rescue. Chicken over Rice We ordered the chicken and rice combo with white sauce and red hot sauce.  The chicken was freshly cooked in front of us and was full of spices.  The rice was also seasoned and it was accompanied by pita bread.  I doused the entire round aluminum container with white sauce and a little of the hot sauce.  I was pleasantly surprised to find an inexpensive satisfying meal in the middle of Manhattan.
