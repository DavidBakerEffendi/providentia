Came here by recommendation of my sister who had recently returned from Singapore in an attempt to be able to share in some of her dining experiences over there. Tried the Rambutan juice which was sweet with a subtle creaminess to it. I like how they removed the seeds as well. There are a number of dishes on the menu that are *almost* vegetarian. I'm usually wary of asking places to leave various ingredients out as to whether or not it'll mess up the actual flavor of the dish, or it would be a huge ordeal. That Banana Leaf includes dishes with seafood in it under the Vegetables section of the menu should give a hint that the definition of vegetarian might not match your own. For instance, the bean curd and egg whites has shrimp in it. I'm glad I found that out by asking before ordering. I instead ordered a Spicy Mango Tofu dish with coconut rice. The rice was great, but the tofu dish itself was only ok. The mango was not ripe, and the tofu a little on the tough side, which is common for a lot of Asian restaurants using packaged fried tofu. The sweetness of the sauce was overpowering, with nothing accompanying it to balance it out. The dish seemed to rely heavily on the sauce. It wasn't bad, but it didn't make me want to clean the plate, which I usually do. Out of all the dishes at the table, the Mee Goreng soup noodles was said to be great. It has shrimp in it or something, so I took their word for it. Banana Leaf is also BYOB and can recommend carry out places nearby. The redbean complimentary dessert is simple and a nice end to the meal. I think this place might be incredible for non-vegetarians. The staff/service here is great, although you need to just flag people down, with the exception of the owner (i think) who dropped by our table to see how things were, as well as helping us at the door. I think this place is probably a 4 or 5 star. I would take visiting friends here for sure, especially to give it a second shot for what I feel was probably an anomaly.
