Another awesome find! This place is superb! Food is excellent as well as the service! Place is pretty busy so go with reservations. My husband and I walked in as another restaurant we intended to goto was closed. We ended up eating at the bar but was still awesome! We had the steak tartar, raw bar, tomato bisque soup, brisket and the oh so yummy oxtail bone marrow fried rice! I would like my fingers twice on how good the food was!  They had excellent drink selections! But the bill was definitely very pricey but oh so worth it!  Highly recommend!
