I live right near Diner, and go there whenever I can afford it. It's not cheap, but it's easily worth it. I don't know who these folks are that are bad mouthing the food. The food is fresh and well prepared. The menu changes constantly, and the fixed items (cheeseburger) are more affordable. The atmosphere is very cool and comfortable.
