Hands down the best Ramen I have ever eaten.  The food here is amazing!  The noodles are cooked perfectly and the broth has a very flavorful.  I come here weekly now and crave it all of the time.  The staff is very friendly and attentive. I met the owner the other day and was very impressed with how nice and kind he was and his story of how he started the business was very interesting.  I usually order the Tonkotsu Chashumen Ramen bowl.  The vibe is very trendy and energetic.  I will continue to come back here to fulfill my cravings.
