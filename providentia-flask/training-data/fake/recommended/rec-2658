I can wax poetic on my infatuation with Thai cuisine and Sushi...but never have I once felt like it was time to create an Ode to Pinoy Fare. Well, honeys, there is a first time for everything! If you could imagine taking some of the classic staples of Filipino cuisine, good old "batang kalye pulutan" and kickin it with a bunch of hyper Asian NYC uber hipsters, what you would come up with is a business model made for success! It is about damn frikken time, mga Noypis! Filipino cuisine needed to be presented on the proper stage...not on Fear Factor as DARE foods. Come on now! Balut is an afrodesiac and a dusk time beer drinking companion that Filipinos have loved and cherished for milenia...Sorry, joe Rogan, but F_*K you for reducing it to such a novelty. At Maharlika, Sizzling Sisig, Balut, Lamb Shank Adobo and Chicken and Waffles are superstars! San Miguel and Red Horse are the house beers and I love it! Thanks to my good old friend for making sure that I was able to throw down on some good Pinoy cooking while sharing great conversation!
