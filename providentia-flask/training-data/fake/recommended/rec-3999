I'll devote a line to Cheryl's in this year's "what i'm thankful for" round at the Thanksgiving dinner table. Yeah, it's that good. There's now a Saturday 11:00 a.m. Cheryl's brunch tradition with 2 of my girlfriends. So we jog around Prospect Park and drown ourselves in pancakes and bloody marys to ruin what we've worked so hard on. Well, not just the strawberry pancakes (which are to die for and I've cleaned my plate of them, oh yes I have), but also the French toast, the chirizo fritata, the huevos rancheros and pretty much everything else on the menu. Ask to be seated in the garden out back. It's quite lovely. The service has been super swell every time. Maybe because 3 flirty girls knocking a few back before noon makes for repeated checkups on our table from both sides of the fence. Water's refilled and we're always given a chance to commend the cooks on a job well done. But we do find it hard to get the check, however. Do they not want the eye candy/entertainment to leave? Hmm. Be warned though. What seems like a phenomenal deal (and it is!) for an all inclusive $10-$12 meal + coffee + cocktail can quickly turn into spotting $25 if you continue to indulge. Pre fix includes just one drink of each and who can drink just one cup of coffee and naturally, just one bloody mary? Sheesh! There's crack in both! (again with my crack reference?)
