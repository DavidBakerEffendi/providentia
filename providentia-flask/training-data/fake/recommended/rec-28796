Have been several times and each time is better then the last! Beautiful layout if the restaurant and bar. Everything from the plates to the items on the menu has something special about them! The service is great and every waiter/waitress we've had has been very familiar with the menu as well as friendly and welcoming. You absolutely need to try the Salted Carmel Milkshake!! It's the most delicious milkshake I've ever had! The wings and onion rings are phenomenal appetizers both with a unique and savory dipping sauce. The Â fish tacos, Mac and cheese, brenners burger, and pizza are TO DIE FOR!!! Will absolutely be coming back to Max Brenners! A+ A+ A+
