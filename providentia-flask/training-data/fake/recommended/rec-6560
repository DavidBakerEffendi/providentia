calamari:  crunchy spinach with sauteed squid.  delightfully delicious.  it mimics that breaded texture without actual breading.  wonderful, but a little bit oily. cod:  i think i got the cod.  cooked well.  nothing too superb. risotto: nice textured and subtle flavors. hanger steak:  divine.  crispy edges, tender meat.   custard donuts:  i could've drank a pint of the coconut refresher accompaniment.  the donuts, however, are just okay. the service was more than excellent.  the decor is minimalist, but the lighting is perfectly subdued and relaxed.
