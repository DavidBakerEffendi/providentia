I came here with some friends on my last night in New York. My friends frequent various locations and suggested this place for dinner. I was interested because I'd never had Peruvian food before. While waiting for our third member of our party, we sat at the bar for drinks. The bartender was very friendly and gave us glasses of water along with their drinks. I got a glass of moscato and my friend got sangria, which tasted so good! I wished I'd gotten their sangria! When we were seated downstairs, we ordered the Matador combo to share. Everything tasted so good! My favorite part of the meal was the rotisserie chicken with its sauce. The whole thing was definitely more than enough for three people. I left the restaurant full and so satisfied!
