Am I missing something? I saw the reviews on this place and I was excited to try.  Chavela's frankly fell flat (see my alliteration though). The best parts... Definitely the drinks.  They have this sangria/margarita combo thing that's good, not amazing.  Their signature drink (I forgot the name and I assume it's signature because 70% of the patrons were sipping on one) is surprisingly good, notwithstanding the fact that it's cucumber-based (barf). I also had a hibiscus based mezcal cocktail that was very good and not overly sweet. The decor is incomparable.  Sort of a junky, Dia de los Muertos/gothic vibe.  It's basically filled with old authentic looking shit everywhere.  The bathroom is all types of awesome with this mosiac tile thing and saloon style doors.  Very original and adds to the ambiance. The worst... The food.  Oh my goodness. Maybe I ordered wrong? So we got the guacamole and asked if we could get it spicy and the waiter/bartendar (we sat at the bar) was like, I can bring you some habenero sauce on the side.  Que? Isn't it freshly made, can't they just throw some peppers in there?  Welps -- guess not. We got the crab and spinach empanadas as an appetitizer and these were good -- reminded me of saltfish a little bit. For entrees, the BF got the Camarones a la Mexica and I got the Chicken Enchiladas in salsa verde.  He made the better choice -- his was solid and tasty, but not amazing.  The salsa verde I had was... really tart/tangy.  It was hard to describe, but it was overpowering, distracting and took away from the dish.   The rice and beans that accompanied the entrees was virtually flavorless.   We skipped dessert. Okay -- so I would go back for drinks, definitely and maybe some appetizers.  I'd like to try to taco tray thing because it looks cool, but other than that, I'll keep the food to a minimum.
