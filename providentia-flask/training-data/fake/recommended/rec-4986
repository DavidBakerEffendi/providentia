If you're looking for authentic Texas BBQ this place is it! I'm from Austin, TX home of Rudy's BBQ and The Saltlick. I've been dying for some good BBQ in NYC. You'll meet other Texans in there too. It was great to hear and be a part of a normal Texas conversation again. The staff is friendly. Love the atmosphere inside and great to have the patio tables outside. Great variety of food. Gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it's super pricey. The moist brisket is $24 per lb! In Texas it's like $11. But I got it anyways and it was worth it.
