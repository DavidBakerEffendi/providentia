Really bad service. The waiter was cold and didn't even make eye contact with us the whole time. C'mon, man! Smile! Plus he got snotty when we asked about the vegetarian pizza. The host working the line was downright grumpy. I guess for a famous place with a line, they don't have to treat their customers well.
