This restaurant just opened over the weekend. It has the vibe of a seafood shack. The staff is friendly and helpful about the food options. I tired the soft shell sandwich, it was great! I had never tried a sandwich like this and I must say I was very pleasantly surprised the items are served inside of dough that taste like it was just baked. I also tried the sweet plantains, I will defiantly get a side of these the next time I come in. If you are looking for something unique and authentic, you should definitely try this place out!
