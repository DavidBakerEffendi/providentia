Made us wait 50 min after texting us that our tables were ready. Biscuits were incredibly disappointing even any random place would be better than what they gave us. Pancakes were ok. Pancake itself was a tad dry and I expected them to do more than just put blueberry and confectionary sugar on top floor $14. Also not good enough for 50 extra minutes on top of the original 1.5 hour wait and an incredibly crappy receptionist...
