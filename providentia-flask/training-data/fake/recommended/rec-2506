Osteria has so much insane hype (thanks to the Vetri machine) so it's hard to not get amped up for your trip here. This is what I experienced: it's good, some is borderline great, good wine list (but very overpriced), mostly good waitstaff, and a trendy vibe in a crummy area of the city. The pizzas and pastas are what Osteria is known for.  The pastas are almost all excellent.  Only Modo Mio has matched the expertise for me so far in Philly.  The pizzas are...well, they are wood-fired, super thin, and somewhat flimsy/soggy due to the sauce.  I personally liked the Lombarda pizza but I was expecting more out of it after waiting 2 years to try it. My big issue is that before I came I read about 15 reviews stating the same thing: too expensive and small portions. Note to Philadelphia suburbanites: JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE USED TO EATING AT APPLEBEE'S AND BERTUCCI'S AND CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AMERICAN AND MOZZARELLA CHEESE, STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT SIZE AND COST AT FINE RESTAURANTS. Ahem.  Seriously, when suburbanites do the one thing they are scared to do (venture into the BIG CITY) they expect a meal that costs upwards of $60 per person to do the following: 1) Repair their fractured marriage of 20 years 2) Turn their community college drop out children into Ivy League investment bankers 3) Allow them to experience Nirvana If it doesn't accomplish these things, the meal is suddenly overpriced and a waste of time. Osteria, I apologize for using my review of your restaurant to yell at people.
