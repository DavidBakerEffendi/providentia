Oh my god, the bahn mi I got was PHENOMENAL. I got the Hog Sandwich, which is filled with a ton of grilled, thinly sliced pork, pickled carrots, cucumber, cilantro, scallion oil, and fried shallots. The pork was amazing - seasoned just right and so tender. Veggies were the perfect balance between sweet and sour and had a great crunch. Whatever sauce they spread on the sandwich was also delicious and had a nice kick (I think there was sriracha...). Also, my sandwich was only $6.50!! That's so much cheaper than Num Pang (which also has delicious sandwiches but not at this price). I will definitely be going back to Xe May to try their other sandwiches!
