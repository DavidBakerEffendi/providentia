Came here with M for our six months.  I liked the classy ambiance a lot!  There was a single rose on our table with candles :) The food was okay.  Or maybe I wasn't being careful enough to really savor the food.  Either way, I got the spaghetti with octopus ink and M got some sort of a pork dish.  To be honest, a lot of the things on the menu was in Italian and we didn't know what most of it meant @-@ so maybe the food there is actually legit for people from Italia, but for us who are accustomed to Americanized Italian food, the food was so so.
