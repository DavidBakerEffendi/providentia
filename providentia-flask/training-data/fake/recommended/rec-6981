This is one of the best halal carts around. I never order the lamb, it's the same lamb that every cart gets. It comes in a solid block so there's nothing special about it. It's also processed lamb. I always get the chicken since their chicken is very simply prepared. It's not overly spiced or marinated like other carts. Their white sauce is mayo based since you see empty buckets of mayo next to the cart. Their salad is probably just cut up and never washed, but honestly I don't care. I eat here at least once a week, and never got sick for the past 8 years. Anyone rating this less than 4 stars, I can't really understand why.
