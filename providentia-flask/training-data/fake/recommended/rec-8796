Coming to visit from California, you can imagine my excitement when we found a great place to eat that stayed open until 4 am!!! This place is great. We arrived at 1am and snatched up the last table! Victory! We started off with the foie gras of course since it is illegal to enjoy in our hometown. I usually hate anything liver but this was amazing! It may be a bit of an acquired taste but I thought it was great and the portion was huge! Then we had the fried pierogies, they were ok. Probably would have been better if they weren't outshined by everything else. The BONE MARROW is a must have! This one one of the best things I enjoyed during my entire trip! So tender it melts in your mouth! Visiting blue Ribbon and not ordering the bone marrow should be considered a crime! For entr√©e I ordered the lamb chops! They served FOUR chops! That is unheard of. Talk about generous! They were cooked perfectly and even came with mashed potatoes, spinach, and a fried potato. The service was impeccable! Everyone there made such a great team and paid the perfect amount of attention to us. We never had our glasses less than half full, they continuously cleared dirty dishes, and crumbed the tables, and they all seemed happy to be there. If I lived in New York I would be a regular at this fantastic establishment! This is definitely a must try restaurant!
