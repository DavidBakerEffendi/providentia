Although the food is okay, it doesn't make up for the complete lack of service. There are enough good breakfast places within a 5 block radius that I would strongly recommend going somewhere else. The servers believe their only job is to move people in and out as fast as possible. During my last visit after receiving curt service throughout our meal we had a discrepancy with the bill. They charged us two dollars for tea when menu price was only one. When we brought this up to the waiter he told us the menu price was wrong and with a smug inflection commented "you must not be having a nice day today". Morning Glory has themes of "having a nice day" and "being mean is intolerable" but for some reason the wait staff doesn't follow their own rules. Morning Glory has really fallen out of my favor. I'm not sure why they feel it's there job to act this way, but hopefully next time you're looking for a quality breakfast you'll think somewhere else.
