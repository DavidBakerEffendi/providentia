By far my favorite burger in NY. A perfectly charred bistro burger with its flavorful Pat La Frieda patty, crisp bacon, slice of onion and a little pickle is my perfect late night meal. I even prefer it to Minetta's black label burger..because I could eat this several times a week if it wouldn't kill me. The place has character and you can grab Mc Sorely's ale in line..so whats not to love.
