The lunch special is an amazing deal at this place. You can get a huge (and I mean huge) French onion soup, a salad, two pounds of fries, and a steak sandwich for $15 bucks. It also comes with a soda or water (which they forgot to put in my bag when I picked up!) The food was excellent, including the homemade ketchup and mayonnaise (for dipping the fries, Belgian style!). I was left fat happy and in a huge food coma...now if they offered espresso to go...
