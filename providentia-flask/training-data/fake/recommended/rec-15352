I suggest ordering the hummus, spinach dip (Zeytinyagli Ispanak), yogurt/cucumber dip (Cacik) that go great with the unlimited amount of bread that is OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD!  I've been here twice, once for Sunday brunch and once for lunch during the week.  Both times the bread was so fresh, hot, and delicious.  The spinach dip was my favorite of the 3 dips I've tried.  I would pass on the entrees like the lamb meatballs and chicken as the quality is not the highest grade.  Those are the only entrees I've tried. As for ambience, the place is LOUD.  Every time I've been there, for some reason people are always shouting their conversations.  I suggest eating outside if the weather is pleasant.
