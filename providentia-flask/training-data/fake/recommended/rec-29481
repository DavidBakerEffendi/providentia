We went to Village Whiskey on Saturday night, which was its second night open.  Surprisingly we had little difficulty getting a table, although it was outside.  I'm not a whiskey drinker but several of my friends are.  They actually skipped the whiskey as the prices were about double what they usually would pay (a 1 oz. pour was priced the same as what a normal 2 oz. pour would cost).  Not sure if VW is going to be able to get away with that but I guess we'll see.  Had the Kentucky Fried Quail, which was very well seasoned.  Also had the short rib and duck fat-fried fries in a Sly Fox cheddar sauce.  Those were pretty awesome, definitely the best thing anyone at our table had that night.  I'd like to go back and try the burger (not the $24 one).  Considering it was their second night, I thought service was ok.  Certainly not the all-star service I've come to expect from other Garces joints like Amada, but hopefully in a few weeks time they will be a well-oiled machine.
