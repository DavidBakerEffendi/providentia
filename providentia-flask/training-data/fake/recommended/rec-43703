I am half Cuban and half Puerto Rican. I grew up in Miami and moved to NYC in my twenties (10 years ago).  So it's safe to say that I know my Cuban food very well.   I had the Masitas the Puerco (fried pork) sandwich with onions and maduros (sweet plantains, one of my fav foods)  for lunch the other day and it was delicious.  I cant speak about all their other food...yet. Now that I know this place is close to work I'll be going there a lot to try out all the rest.
