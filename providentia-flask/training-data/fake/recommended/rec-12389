There are already 749 reviews of this place here yet I feel compelled to add another. I just had lunch there and oh myyyyy goodness, it was so good. It seriously surpassed expectations... I had the Parma ham and melon, the octopus (so tender and flavorful) and the bombolotti. It was all beyond amazing. Ugh major need for nap now....
