I asked my buddy in NYC to take me to some authentic New Yorkan food.  He told me we were getting $7 food at a cart on a random corner near 30 Rock.  A tiny bit suspect...sure.  Especially with the dozens of food carts I'd seen walking around.  But hell, he's the one who lives here... Apparently it isn't a random corner cart.  The corner has it's own website.  There was a line at least 20 people deep when we arrived, which was a short one, from what I was told.  And the food was pretty sublime.  I'm a big lamb fan, and this joint did not disappoint.  I went with the lamb and chicken combo, and while I regret not getting just lamb, it was still great.  Almost like eating a tub of gyro, with some of the most blazingly hot hot sauce ever. The people working couple nights ago seemed really distracted, and while I wasn't expecting pleasantries from dudes working outside in a cart, apparently they were pretty rude that night.  At least we only dealt with them for as long as it took to get food handed to us.
