A friend of mine told me about this place a few years ago, and I'd forgotten all about it, until I did a neighborhood search for a good restaurant here on Yelp. If your not familiar with the midtown/theater district/times square area, it's a culinary nightmare. Most places are too expensive for mediocre food OR they are part of a chain... which means more reasonable prices for mediocre food that you can get anywhere in the country. I know that I'm being a NY snob when I say this, but I am not going to eat at an Olive Garden. Not simply because it's a chain, or because it is to Italian food what the Jonas Brothers are to music, but because I live in NEW YORK. I don't mean to pick on Olive Garden (Sometimes I love going to chain restaurants... Good ones... I wish we had a Chick-fil-A here) Â but I am using it to represent all crap chain restaurants in NYC. I personally consider it to be morally reprehensible for me to eat a lame meal when someone in Spokane can order that exact same crap at the same time (Nothing against Spokane, I'm certain it's wonderful! ... And I'm not even sure they have an Olive Garden there...) My point is Hagi is a really good example of why I love living here. even in the culinary wasteland that is times square, there happens to be a small, tucked away, odd, but pleasant surprise. There was a 20 minute wait, but when it comes to places that don't take reservations a wait is to be expected and should be planned for. The food was great! The staff, despite being ridiculously busy, were very helpful. I didn't know what to order, so I just picked things at random, asked the waiter what he liked and picked one of those. My girlfriend has spent a lot of time traveling through Asia and she was amazed at how authentic it was. In short, try Hagi. At the very least, It's fun. (my apologies to anyone I may have offended from Olive Garden, or Spokane)
