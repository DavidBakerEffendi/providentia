I've visited Walter Foods several times.  All of which have been great eatting experiences.  The service is also superb.  Somewhat limited menu but you can't go wrong with anything on it.  Also, note that this is a great spot for oysters.  There is usually a wide selection and the staff really knows their oysters.  I've brought friends several times who were not oyster fans and they leave wanting more.  Great fried chicken, great burger and any fresh fish special is alwasy a good bet. If stopping by during Spring / Summer, there is a really chill back patio dining area as well. Also, great drink menu and gin / bourbon selection Definitely in my top favorite BK restaurants!
