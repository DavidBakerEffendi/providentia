Asa! Finally a real Korean restaurant! Food is very authentic and delicious just like in Korea. The location is great just down the street from Westfarms mall. The service was great too. We went in on a Wednesday night. No wait. They do have a liquor license and the serve soju! We ordered daeji galbi (BBQ pork) a bottle of soju and dwaen jang jigae for $76. The decor is very nice too.
