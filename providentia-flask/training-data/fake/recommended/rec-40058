A favorite happy hour spot for my coworkers and me.  The veggie burger is the best I've ever had--it's made with actual vegetables and comes with a side of thick steak fries (for an extra $1 I get the side salad instead; the house balsamic is delicious!)  The hummus plate and plantain chip appetizers are also great.  I'm not a big avocado fan, but the guac that comes with the plantain chips I could eat all day--for me it has the perfect texture and seasonings. The decor is a little bizarre, but it does make for some great conversation starters (OMG why is there a lightbulb in that dog-thing's head?)  The only other downside is that when it's busy it tends to get noisy, but isn't that a sign of a great bar!?
