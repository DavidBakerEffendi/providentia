I love, love, love these french fries!  I am so not a go-out-all-night person (and my husband is) so the deal is that if I go out until after 3am I am allowed to get these. So far I have only made it twice (which is probably good for my waistline).  But holy smokes these are the real deal.  They are cheap, they give crazy big portions, and they are so worth the long line (you usually meet interesting people there that make the time pass quickly anyway).   I love the garlic mayo and my husband usually gets some sort of curry flavored dip.  Yum! Bonus: I wouldn't expect a place like this to accept credit cards but they do!
