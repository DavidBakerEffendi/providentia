First of all I am not a great fan of small dishes like Tapas and Meze simply because in Manhattan Â it's usually the biggest scam since the $40.00 hamburger. I am however happy to eat my words and just about every thing that comes out of the tiny kitchen at Tia Pol.40 minutes for a table? no problem, I'll have the fried garbanzo beans to start and a glass of Cava. Tight seating on backless stools?not an issue, the excellent lamb skewers,bacalau croquettes,patatas bravas,lengua,serrano ham platter,blistered peppers and the cockles and razor clams is actually worth the crick in my back . I like this place and it's laid back vibe,the wait staff are efficient ,friendly and knowledgeable about their wine list. Very well done.
