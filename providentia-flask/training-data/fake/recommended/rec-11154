I want to like this place more than I actually do.  So far, I've been here probably 10 or 12 times.  The food is okay, but nothing to write home about.  The service is efficient, but I wouldn't call it friendly.  I believe the efficiency is mostly the results of the guy who runs the register (and apparently the whole place) who is so very obviously OCD.  I do think this place could be a bit more customer-centered and friendly, however.   Here are my thoughts on the food: Hamburger (I've ordered this a few times) - overcooked, smashed together and not particularly tasty.  Not even quite an average burger in an area where there are lots of good burger choices.  IT is cheap and fast.  Close proximity to my office and the willingness to take speed and convenience over quality bring me back to it occasionally. BLT - it's hard to mess this up - and it was a basic BLT - just enough bacon, the bacon not incredible, but it wasn't the tasteless cardboard other places use, either. Fries - they're frozen krinkle fries . . . I ordered them once. I won't again. Cheesesteak - ordered it for the first time today.  Not bad - a little over cooked and somewhat of a burnt taste with the meat, but overall tasty.  The bread was a little stale at the ends.  Just average.  The truck on 16th just South of Walnut is better. Considering the incredible mix of customers this place gets, I think it could make itself into something really special, or it can keep on this track and just be an average place serving average food in a very orderly fashion.
