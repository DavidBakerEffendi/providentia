Oh boy! Every time I leave The Meatball Shop, I'm already looking forward to my next visit. Waits are usually pretty long, but I've seen that they're trying a new texting system, so I definitely recommend trying that out. Also, if you're popping in by yourself or with just one friend, bar seating can get you meatballs that much faster. The meatball of the day is usually worth trying out--especially the Greek meatball--but you can never go wrong with chicken balls and pesto sauce. I'm a big fan of the Smash: two balls, sauce, cheese on a toasted brioche bun (which in itself is amazing!). The daily veggies are also a great feature--lots of different textures and tastes. Once you've licked your plate clean, I definitely recommend splitting an ice cream sandwich with a buddy for dessert. The oatmeal ice cream is fantastic, especially on peanut butter cookies. But, really, it's impossible to go wrong on any of the combos.
