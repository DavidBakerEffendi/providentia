I came for the pho real sandwich (good but not great) but i keep coming back for the other creative gourmet sandwiches they have. i've had the obama, bloomberger in a wrap and the biden. all of them amazing - good portions and not expensive. note: was not drunk when eating these sandwiches. if it was closer to me, i would know the people by name.
