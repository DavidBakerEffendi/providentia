Yum-- steamed buns w/pork belly.  It's amazing to me how many places manage to dry out pork belly, but not momofuku-- their pork belly was perfectly juicy w/out being too greasy.  We had a late lunch at about 3:30, so we didn't have to wait at all.  Surprisingly nice decor for a walk up and order kind of place.
