The drinks are cheap and the bartenders are on top of things but there's almost always a cover at the door.  The crowd is VERY young so I guess it's a good place for a 21st birthday.  It's often crowded and very loud but I guess that's good if you like that sort of thing.  I wouldn't recommend this as a regular spot.
