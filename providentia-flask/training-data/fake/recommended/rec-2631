Last April, I traveled to Philly to sample Pat's and Geno's steaks in my quest for the most authentic, delicious, cheeze-whizzyish cheeseteak in the city of brotherly love and limited beer sales. Geno's was good, tidy, almost genteel. A nice mix of Â whiz, onions, and meat. Pat's, on the other hand, won points for sheer abundance. This thing was big. And messy (see photos). With about twice as much filling as Geno's, the flavor of the steak took center stage. I found Pat's to be a bit tastier, probably because the beef flavor came through more clearly. However, the bread was overwhelmed. I was overwhelmed too, with Cheese Whiz, mostly. Too much of the whiz is not necessarily a good thing. I gave a marginal win to Pat's on the basis of bounty, (and because they had a better selection of condiments and ruder staff), but I would really need to eat a few more steaks to decide on a definite favorite. Right now, Geno's sounds pretty good.
