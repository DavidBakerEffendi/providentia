One of the best brunch places in the city--warning: the service is not the best. However, the food is delicious and the location is convenient. These factors keep me coming back to this cute eatery. I highly recommend the Banana French toast for those of you with a sweet tooth. For ones who want something more savory, I recommend the monte Cristina sandwich.
