I've been here twice and have to say, it's a great place.  First time I visited I was rolling solo and had some time to kill before meeting up with a friend.  I was looking for a specific thing and it seemed impossible to find in this neighborhood (or city)  I wanted to drink quality beverages, snack on quality food and read a book in peace.  I went into quite a few places in Olde City before finding Race St. Cafe.  Most were too dark to read or too small/rowdy to be comfortable chilling by myself.   Race St was great.  First time there I found a small table near the back under a perfect light for reading.  Many of my fav beers/spirits and friendly staff.  Came back a few weeks later with friend on an absolutely freezing night.  Sat next to the REAL wood stove and received excellent customer service from the bar tender who also came out to serve  us.  He was attentive, friendly, helpful with choices and best of all when my friend and I were chatting away and the bar was closing, he didn't kick us out, didn't turn on the light, didn't drop the check... he just let us be.  As friend and I are both industry, we didn't overstay our welcome, but we appreciated the respectful treatment. I loved the mushroom soup - very rich and satisfying without being thick or heavy.
