I don't remember the bread being this dry & tough the other times that I've eaten here but I'm not complaining.  Not sure what happened to my previous review of this place but I shall write another one...besides, they got much better since my first review ;) The tough & dry bread counteracts the juicy pork (which they don't overly soak with au jus anymore - meaning, yes they used to over do it)  which is a perfect complement.  I enjoyed it this time much more than my previous visits.  The only thing that would make me like this sandwich more is if they offered more meat.  Meat to Bread ratio was imbalanced. Roast Pork w Sharp Provolone & Broccoli Rabe $10.25 Grab a seat at the counter if you can & eat it fresh right there with free condiments: horseradish & peppers. Location:  towards the center of RTM Parking: $4 parking for 2 hours at 12th & Filbert with Validation
