This is hands down the best burger place in the area and quite possibly has the most delicious burgers I have ever had.  I always go with the Billy Burger but if you are particularly hungry, go for the Pub Burger.  The fries are also really tasty and I even had the nachos once and was pleasantly surprised.  Once you pair the great food with a nice beer selection, that's five stars in my mind.  Also, if you want a little desert, they have $3 ice cream sandwiches.
