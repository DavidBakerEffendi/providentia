WOW. SMOKING HOT. Came here after a club bc more than one person recommended I get "chicken & rice" from this infamous corner. The line was long, almost like the line at a club. For 6 bucks you can get a combo of chicken and beef(?) and this orange yummy rice with pita and lettuce. The white sauce was insanely good. But I also put about the same amount of red sauce on my food with the white sauce. What a mistake! I can usually handle spice like a champion, but not this one. My mouth was on fire. It's a must do for NY visitors.
