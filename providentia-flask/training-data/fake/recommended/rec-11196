Awesome little corner spot! I love how from the outside it looks dark and unnoticeable but once you walk in it it's comfortable and relaxed! The decor is pretty cool! Our female bartender was wearing a mustache! Lol. The wedge salad was awesome! Very fresh. Wings were amazing. My favorite dish by far is the baked Mac and cheese! SOOOOO good! Some one the best Mac ad cheese I've ever had. I had a great experience at North Third! I would recommend it to anybody who's in the area looking for a fun, quaint atmosphere and yummy food!
