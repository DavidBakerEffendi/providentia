I arrived on a Sunday around 2pm. My friend got there first and put our names down to get seated but we ended up waiting almost 1.5 hours! By the time we got seated the restaurant was pretty empty and we were starving. The food was not worth the wait. The mac and cheese was pretty good and filling. I got the blueberry johnny cakes.. it was a lot of food but nothing special.
