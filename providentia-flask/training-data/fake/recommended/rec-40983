the pizza is delicious and crust is perfect, so are the cocktails and meatballs. i've had  just about everything on the menu except the cheese plate.  i feel the salads, though bright and fresh, are overpriced and not interesting, so i would pass on that unless you just have to have your greens.  the gelato, although wonderful a year ago, seems to have changed recipes or origins and not my favorite either.  the wine list, IMHO, could be rethought.  but this is a pizza place and you get what's promised.  all the pizzas please, but as always, margherita is my standby.  there's somewhat of a meandering seating arrangement, so you kind of have a choice of sub-ambiences: more secluded booths at the front, seats at the bar, cafe style seating, private large group table downstairs and outdoors in the back yard.  Family and kids alert if you're there for an early dinner.  Service has been good to very good on all of my many visits.  it's a casual place, but In the theater of service, i have overheard some rude exchanges from patron to server on occasion and I must say consummate professionalism has always been maintained.
