I LOVE Cornerstone Cafe! They serve great meals and I enjoy the atmosphere of the place. One of the best things about the place are the prices of the food. For the quality and taste of the food I was very surprised. I recommend the chicken cutlet parmesan sandwich version or entr√©e version. I've been to cornerstone quite a few times. They also have friendly staff here. They serve a great brunch here too. This place lately has increased in popularity so the place is usually full. I think it's a great spot for a date for new people or a date night with veteran couples. I guarantee you won't be disappointed if you stop by. One thing I don't like is that they don't take card. You'll need to have cash on you if you plan on coming here. I hope they can get a machine that takes card soon. No ATM inside either but there are a few close by.
