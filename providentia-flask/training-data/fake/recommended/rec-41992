This is one of my top three BYOBs in Philly. I love the cozy dining rooms and open kitchen. It's a wonderful place to pop into with a nice bottle of white. Put your name on the list and have them chill the wine, then head across the street for a cocktail while you wait to be seated - some ritual. I stick with my favorites whenever I come here grilled octopus (the best I have ever had in the US), hummus and greek style blue fish - all split among two or three people is a tastegism! Never been disappointed with this gem!
