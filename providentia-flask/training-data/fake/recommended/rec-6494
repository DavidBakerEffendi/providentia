After doing dinner at Little Owl a few months back, I'd be dying to try their sister restaurant. However, we left disappointed after a meh brunch experience ... nothing really was a standout and our server gave me a weak pour of prosecco. I've been told by a couple people that their brunch is lackluster, but they really shine during dinner...I'm willing to give it another chance.
