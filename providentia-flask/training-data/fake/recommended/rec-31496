Omg First 5 star review from me.  Get the fresh carved pulled pork with sharp provolone and sauteed broccoli rabe for the most exquisite combo of flavor and texture.  Forgive us for eating.this chametz on the way to a Passover sedar. Di nic get your (pork) butt down to dc/Baltimore.  You rock like Springsteen!
