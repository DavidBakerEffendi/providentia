Ok it surprises me how anyone could give this place a bad review. I loved this place! I've officially lost track of how many times I've eaten here but I've never had a bad experience yet.  The staff is always friendly and the wait once you're seated is reasonable but keep in mind if you go on a busy night the wait may be longer because this place is very popular.  This restaurant is extremely busy on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights so if you don't get there before 6 or 7pm be prepared to wait awhile to be seated especially if you have more than 2 or 3 in your group.  It is a BYOB but there is a wine and liquor store two doors down where you can buy what you want to bring with you.  The birthday celebration music that they play on the drums and maracas are fun to dance along with while they play.  I love Cuban Pete's food and my favorite dish is the garlic shrimp and for dessert the guava and cheese pastry.  Oh and the appetizers are delicious.  Chicken pops, bacon stuffed dates, goat cheese fritters, empanadas, the list goes on.  I love this restaurant and I will keep going back every time.
