Tinto on 20th St. The service was great. Very attentive to our needs. The waiter had genuine interest in making our experience memorable. We chose the crab bruchetta and the duck tapas. Both were good. However the duck was more flavorful complimented with a glazed cherry. The white sangria was delicious as well.  To top the meal off, we had desert which included a pear /cinnamon sauce and fig ice cream with a flan. We would would go again. Next time we'll choose the chef's selection of tapas.  Ambiance was wonderful and we could hear ourselves talk over the music. Pricing was aggressive, and of course portions were small.
