I'ma keep this one short and sweet like the Hawaiiana and the Maduro & Mozzarella empanadas. A Five Star eatery like this needs no extensive review.  Do yourself a favor and visit the place. I mean...  just walk in, grab a menu and order what your stomach tells you and then times it by two because I promise you're gona want another one after that first bite. You'll soon find yourself empanada wasted on a park bench somewhere in Flushing Meadow Park drifting off into an empanada induced coma only to be shocked back to life by one their great flavored Ice Pops. (Tambrin joint is mad good) It's a small walk-in spot. Mainly grab & go, but there's a stool and counter setup if you wana eat in. The staff is friendly and helpful despite the place always being flooded when I visit. The empanadas are made fresh to order so you might wana call ahead or just be prepared to wait depending on the size of your order. I've pretty much run through the menu; i prefer the white flour shell and organic shell ones over the corn flour, but I've yet to be disappointed.  My top two favorites are the Hawaiiana (pineapple, pork and cheese) and the Maduro & Mozzarella (sweet plantains and cheese). Honorable mentions to the Spinach & Ricotta,  Broccoli & Mozzarella and the Organic Tuna. stop playing yaself. check da place out. Empanada Cafe is straight Empanada Heaven. Mad Good, Shun!!
