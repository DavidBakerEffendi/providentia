We walked up on a Saturday night (two of us) and we were told to wait in the bar, which is the next door down.  We squeezed ourselves in, got a glass of chianti, and popped back out to the sidewalk because you could barely move in there.  By the time we were done with the wine, we were seated in one of the little outside tables, under heat lamps, a la McDonald's french fries.  It was a cool night, but the heat lamps were a tad oppressive.  The service was friendly at all points and the food was quite good.  The dessert, some kind of pudding things with drizzled chocolate, was unbelievably good, and i'm not even sure what the hell it was.
