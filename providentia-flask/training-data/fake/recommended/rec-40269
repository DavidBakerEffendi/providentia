What a great place to eat!  I started with the perogies.  They were great.  They came with a side of sour cream which is what I typically top mine with and the perfect amount of onion on the top.  The filling was very good and I was happy to see perogies on the menu.  Not something you can get everywhere.  My entree was the salmon with grilled asparagus.  Again the salmon was very well cooked and was topped with mushrooms that added just the right amount of flavor.  The dessert was the homemade seasonal sorbet which was very smooth and tasty.  A very nice pineapple flavor and the other was a type of rich chocolate.  We went here as a group after a scavenger hunt in the Philly area and they took care of our group very well.  The employees were very accomodating to us  and I appreciate it as our group was larger than we expected and they all moved tables all over the place for us.  Check this place out if you are in the area I enjoyed myself.
