This is one of my favorite restaurants ever. If you like soup then come here. I always order the beef stew noodle with chow fun. Beef is soooooooooo soft and tasty, broth is flavorful and I love wide rice noodles or chow fun. I love this restaurant, it can be a little packed sometimes depending when you go. But the soup is amazing here.
