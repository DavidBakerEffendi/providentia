This restaurant is not a place I take dates. Why? I just shovel everything put in front of me into my mouth, as though I have five minutes to live. Alright. If you need seating for more than two, you may have to wait. The restaurant is small and you may be nearly sitting on top of the table next to you. I'm obsessed with their pad thai. Vegetables are always of perfect consistency. Their vegetable coconut soup is awesome. I've tried eating other things but really... no sense in toying with perfection. I've had the distinct pleasure of eating here with the below yelper Marissa B and she's not joking about the mango sticky rice OR this place haunting you from the other side of the country. Their thai ice tea is worth drowning in.
