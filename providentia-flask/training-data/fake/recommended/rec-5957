SOOOOO Delish! this place is TREMAZING. the pizza is dynamite, the atmosphere wonderful, and the variety of menu options (beers, ciders, pizzas, etc) are almost overwhelming...no matter what you order you'll be happy, no doubt. The one thing that is tricky is the wait...its such a popular place that the crowd swarms, so you either have to arrive early (they don't take reservations) or expect to sidle up to the bar & try some brews while you wait. The menu had an extra special awesome touch with their "Stimulus Plan for the Soul"...(see picture). I can't wait to come back here next trip! FABULOUS!
