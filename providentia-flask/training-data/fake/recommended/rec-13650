Came by for dinner last night around 7:30. First thing I noticed was the decor. The main door is a cool wooden door that makes you feel like you are entering a home rather than a restaurant. After you walk in, you see  a giant chandelier in a glass case in the middle of the place. The decor makes me feel like i'm going for afternoon tea rather than thai dinner. So yea, the decor is excellent. Food- had the tom yum soup- extremely salty. Also, I had the pad kee mao (drunken noodles). it was described as a spicy dish but I didn't taste any spice?? It was tasty nonetheless. However, it was also very salty.  I got home and chugged two bottles of water. Prices are reasonable though. two people came out to $30 including tax.
