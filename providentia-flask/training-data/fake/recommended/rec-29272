Liked that they had a lot of healthy options on the menu that you can't get everywhere. For instance my friend got the mushroom bolognese that was served over spaghetti squash. I got the mussel corn chowder which was pretty disappointing because there were only 2 mussels in mine. The arugula and poached apple salad was great! The apple and pumpkin seeds went very well together. I also tried the fries which were extra crisp and delicious. Overall just ok.
