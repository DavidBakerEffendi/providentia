Wish I could give 4.5 (Cmon Yelp, work with me here...) but not quite a 5.  Still, an exceptional meal. Got there at 8 on a Fri nite without reservations, but a deuce at the bar opened up within 15 minutes.   What we ordered: a glass of Rioja homemade citrus soda (inCREDIBLE) A mixed drink (can't remember, but it was good albeit teeny) lobster pot pie- husband loved it soup special (winter vegetable) venison ragout w/buttermilk biscuits- excellent some kind of steak w/mashed potatoes (for hubby)- excellent The most expensive thing on the menu was $25, which is not breaking the bank by any means, but beware- the portions aren't huge.  Definitely enough food, esp. with the melt-in-your-mouth homemade bread w/pate that's generously passed around. ALL the food was great, except for the pedestrian soup, but still good.  Service wonderful, everyone was kind and professional and gracious.  The ambience, btw, is adorable and romantic. Will DEFINITELY return!
