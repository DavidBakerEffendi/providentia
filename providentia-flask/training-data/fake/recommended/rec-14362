Although the pizza here is great the employees don't really practice proper hand-washing. While Â waiting for my pizza I noticed a delivery man come in from deliveries take off the delivery bag from his shirt,(appeared to be drench in sweat as it was hot) place money into the register, and then proceed to touch and arrange pizza pies throughout the corner touching everything. While it it might seem simple hand-washing should be enforced in every food establishment.
