First of all, I need to venture to the UWS more.  The quaintness of the neighborhood still brightly lit made the bus ride to the restaurant that much more pleasant. Upon walking into the restaurant, I didn't realize how spacious the layout was and it appeared to fill up as the night progressed.  Two thumbs up for ambiance. I ordered the tubular pasta and my friend ordered the Sheep's Milk Dumplings (which he does not recommend).  I loved mine - thought it was full of flavor and combined vegetables, pasta, meat, and cheese just right.  A perfect dish for a pleasant dinner catching up with a friend.
