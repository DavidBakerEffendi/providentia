Max Brenner's is a Philadelphia establishment charging New York City prices. Â Everything is 30% more than it should be and while the food is certainly good the prices are by no means justified. The place is know for its chocolate, and while competently executed, it is nowhere near the mecca of chocolate that it is billed to be. Good place for lunch or dinner if price is no object but there are both places of better value and quality.
