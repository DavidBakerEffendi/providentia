This is a good burger. If you're looking for a straight up burger, you'll get one at Corner Bistro and it will be really good. Apparently this place has a crazy line/wait on most days. We went the day after Christmas when the neighborhood was relatively quiet so the wait wasn't long. I'm guessing that if I had to wait for an hour and a half I might not be such a fan... but then again I'd probably be starving at that point so who knows... I think the CB burger is comparable to the PJ Clarke's burger - both really enjoyable. And you can't beat the price at CB! *Wasn't a huge fan of the slight but distinct bathroom odor, which emanated out into the area where we were waiting... But its an old pub, what are ya gonna do...? This odor wasn't evident in the eating area.
