This place is great!   I actually came here based on Yelpers reviews and you did not lead me wrong, thanks fellow lovers o the Yelp.   We had margaritas, mojitos, and chimis.  We loved every single minute of this place.  The food portions are HUGE!  You will not be disappointed.  The drinks are wonderful.  But the best part IMO is the red sauce they give you for the chips, I think it has a lil chipotle in it.  Yum.   Check them out, you will adore this one.
