If anything, I'll give five stars just for the owner. I used to frequent his food cart when he was stationed at the corner of Bowery and Elizabeth. He didn't sell his bestseller in his food cart back then but he was still insanely popular. He would have lines down the block as well. He is incredibly hard working and extremely kind. His cart disappeared for a bit and then news spread that he now has a storefront. His old offerings (usual food cart fare) was in the back. And the rice boxes were in the front. It was so cheap a few years ago and it was still delicious. Now the price has increased a bit but it's still delicious. Don't expect it to be fine dining. This is good comfort food. The lines are insane but for the price and knowing how hard the owner works, it's definitely worth it.
