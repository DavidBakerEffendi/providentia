I came here Saturday for brunch and it was my second visit. I loved it so much I had to write a review this time. If you can, sit outside. Inside is great too, it can just be a little cozy. I ordered the eggs benedict and they were wonderful. I like to compare brunch staples from restaurant to restaurant and this dish was one of the best. Please get the fries, they were SO good. Our server was perfect. She was really friendly and attentive. I also really enjoyed the smaller details in the service. For example, the coffee is served in individual carafes and the creamer was warmed. Everything was just really pretty here: the food, the dishes, the restaurant, and the people. I have no complaints about Extra Virgin.
