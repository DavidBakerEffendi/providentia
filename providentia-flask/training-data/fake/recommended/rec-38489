Really like the food here, everything I've had (hummus, falafel, schwarma, baba ganoush, eggplant, etc) has been fresh and good quality, would definitely recommend for a weekday lunch. The prices are good, Â I paid $8 for a lot of food! Cool to see the pitas cooking in the oven too, way better than the ones you buy in the store. I've ordered catering before from the Chelsea location and I was very happy with the quality of the food then too, they have a nice selection of options depending on whether you're looking for just a snack or more of a meal. A few notes to that would make it better: -The music is a little too loud, it's hard to interact with the people behind the counters because of it -On some of the menu items, particularly the sides and sauces, a little more description would be really helpful. I'm not familiar with all of them, the containers that they're in when you're ordering aren't labeled, and it can slow things down a lot to ask questions Would definitely recommend this place for an affordable and healthy meal
