Hu has put a lot of effort into branding and the interior of the restaurant.  both are amazing... if only they put as much effort into the *food*.  we had breakfast for two - was rather on the expensive side and not very good.  (my dining companion called it "not bad" - which is not really a compliment when it comes to food.)  food was boring and bland.
