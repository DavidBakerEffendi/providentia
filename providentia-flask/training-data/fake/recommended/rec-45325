I visited Rucola last week for dinner. It's definitely the kind of place where you can expect a long wait, but we happened to walk in an hour early for our reservation and a table was opening up. Sweet! We ordered the chef's selection of antipasta, crudo, and the roasted chicken entree and drinks. Both the antipasta sampler and the crudo were amazing. The chicken was incredibly tender and meshed well with the sauteed spinach and celeriac potatoes. In short, dinner was exceptional. It's well worth the wait, even if there is a line when you drop on by.
