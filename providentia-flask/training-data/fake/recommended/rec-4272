Best Bah Mi I have tasted.  The combination of fresh warm South Philly bread and buttery goodness.  I ordered the BBQ beef Bah Mi.  Was everything and more.  The right amount of meat and veggies.   Mmmm ill definitely be going back for more. Also the outside is deceiving as it is in a Chinese warehouse that has a grocery store and other Chinese stores,  but don't be deceived,  this place is a gem amongst the competitive Vietnam joints around Washington Ave.
