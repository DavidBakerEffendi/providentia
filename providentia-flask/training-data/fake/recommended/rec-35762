Hearth is as homey as its name! You won't be disappointed after eating their delicious food with a unique approach to familiar dishes. The menu changes seasonally and the ingredients are fresh and mostly local. I must say that the desserts are even better than the main courses -- the apple cider doughnuts are to die for and the vanilla ice cream is spectacular. I would highly recommend going here for dessert if you've already eaten somewhere else or just want a tasty treat!
