This place is incredible!!! The bbq rib sandwich is amazing and I hate using the word amazing. I am from Texas and this eating this thing practically made me jizz in my pants it was that great. Some of the best food I've ever tasted. Also had the steamed pork buns which was also very very good but I am still thinking about that bbq, they should rename it BBQ Money Sammich. Don't forget to check out the milk bar at the back, the soft served ice cream is top notch.
