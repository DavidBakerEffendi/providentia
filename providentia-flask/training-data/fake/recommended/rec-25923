My new favorite soup spot in chinatown....Recently I had a friend show me this place, she's been going here with her kids for 20 years, and thought I'd like it.  And boy was she right...This place is great, there are tons of choices for soups, all kinds of meats, veggies, noodles, wontons, and everything is delicious.  The wontons are made from pork and shrimp and are scrumptious..so far my favorite soup is the roast pork and noodles soup, I get them to add some Chinese broccoli, so I feel a bit more healthy and it's so good.  I've tried quite a few noddle shops lately and New Wonton's noodles I can say are my favorite.  Another bonus is that the service here is friendly and super quick; you can be out of there in 20 minutes if need be, so it's perfect if you want a hot meal for lunch but you've got to be back at court asap.
