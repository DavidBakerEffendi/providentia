I had the regular-sized kirai which was the spicy ramen with fishcake, pork belly, black mushroom (I forget what they're called--the rubbery kind), bean sprouts, and bamboo. I'm from New Mexico and eat spicy food all the time so when people advertise their food as spicy, I humor them knowing better. But, this really was spicy--perfectly so. I don't really know how to judge this place. I thought the amount of food was rather skimpy, actually. So maybe the noodles were the right amount, but two slices of pork belly (the size of two half-pieces of uncooked bacon), a good amount of bamboo, but seriously, like 7 bean sprouts. Also, two thinly sliced pieces of fishcake, about the total size and thickness of a silver dollar. This was served in a spicy miso broth that was a little overpowered by the flavor of the canned bamboo. I love bamboo, but the broth tasted a little like the water from the canned bamboo. If you compare the quantity of food you get compared to pho (not because they taste the same at all, but because the idea of them is similar, along with the price, though the ramen was more expensive than a typical bowl of pho), this was far less than you'd get in a bowl of pho considering that typically comes with bean sprouts, lime, jalapenos, cilantro... The staff was fine, but Nom Nom wasn't busy as it was only 6 pm on a Sunday evening. I could see the potential with surliness, but I didn't get that. Perhaps when they're busier. All in all, I'm glad I tried this place, but I was a little disappointed.
