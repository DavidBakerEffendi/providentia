I'm a teeny person and normally teeny things suit me pretty well.  But this restaurant sadly did not.  I was seated upstairs with a friend and with the way the tables were set up, it was difficult not to get in and out without bumping into nearby tables.  I ordered the smaller crab cake plate and although I expected small I couldn't believe I was paying $20 for 3 potatoes, and a crab cake I could eat in one bite!  Yes, one bite.  I'm normally not someone who fusses over paying more for good food but I just felt silly paying that much for what I got.  Crab cake and potatoes were good, but sort of just okay. The decor was also...odd.  I will admit I'm an aesthetics person so I'm probably being harsh but the decor could be defined as christmas lights, mirrors, and draped fabric.  And if you want to use the bathroom - oh my word.  So small.   Based on my experience, it's not necessarily somewhere I'd recommend to another person immediately, but the people around me seemed to enjoy the food.
