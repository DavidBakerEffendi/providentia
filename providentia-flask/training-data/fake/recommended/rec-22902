I would give 3.5 starts...The environment is really cool. Spring rolls are worth trying, the noodles are ok but a bit mushy... And DO NOT order anything with roasted duck. Besides 70% are actually duck skins, not real meat, it's NOT ROASTED, the duck is so deeply fried and over cooked....I can actually chew the oil...which is really disgusting...
