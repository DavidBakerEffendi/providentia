I love this restaurant.  Their brunch is awesome (though I did have one experience where I got cold food) and the servers are great.  I've only had dinner there once (and ate outside).  It was really good!  I wish there were a few more vegetarian options on the menu, but it is still one of my go-to places in the neighborhood.
