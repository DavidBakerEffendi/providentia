Place was awesome. Crisp clean look right on the corner of a nice neighborhood. Being from Brooklyn I liked it. Drinks were solid! Staff was cool, not trying to be too formal but professional. Gotta love fine dining when you don't have to dress up and be greeted by some "snooty" clown Maitre D from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. regardless had some specials that were great. Never had Lamb tar tare , that was awesome! The Tuna Crudo I didn't like as much as the tar tare but still good. For mains my beloved had the Striped bass. It was great but the only complaint was that it came on what was a risotto chorizo??? anyway the chorizo steals from the bass. When you're done taking a bite you remember the chorizo more than the fish. My Chicken Breast was dope! and i love it when good food is deliciously filling! Desserts, meyer lemon cannolis, its good but If i was to go again I'd probably try something different but I would reorder the chocolate croissant pudding was dope! Should you go? you are guaranteed for a great night out, at a great restaurant with awesome food. You cant go wrong.If I give 4 stars its great and you should go!
