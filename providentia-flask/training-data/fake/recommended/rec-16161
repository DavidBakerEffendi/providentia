For the record, I have eaten here between 10-15 times now, so I have a pretty good idea of this place. 0. It is dirty cheap. 1. It is VERY tasty.  The white sauce makes this dish.   2. Like most tasty things, try not to eat a lot of it, because... 3. If you do eat a lot of it, you will want to stab yourself in the stomach 2 hours later.   Honestly, this place makes my stomach feel worse than after a Big Mac.  My advice, split it with a friend and you'll be ok.
