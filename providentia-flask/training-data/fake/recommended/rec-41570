The Ramen here is great. But the line is ALWAYS ridiculous. The service is arrogant. One time, we went there at 12 pm exactly when it opened, and there was a 2 hour line already! Whatever, so we waited. Then after 1 hour and a half, we had to add more money to our parking spot so we walked away for like 10 minutes and when we came back, they had just missed us by 1 spot - and wouldn't let us in!!! They told us to go back at end of the line again!! wtf?!?!? They didn't care at all that we waited for 2 hours for this!! But, we pleaded. Yes, screwed our dignity and pleaded. They finally let us in after letting a few other people in and purposely yelled at us for not waiting. So, while the food deserves 5 stars, the service is probably 2 stars! Since this is a review on food, I'll still fairly give 4 stars.
