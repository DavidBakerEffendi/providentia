I have to write about all of the Continentals... best ever!  Rad Na Thai Salad (which is really more of a pasta dish) makes me want to shoop.  Oh and the Miso glazed Chilean Sea Bass melts on your tongue!  It comes with sweet potato mashed potatoes.  I don't care for sweet potatoes, but these are amazing.  I thought about working there just so I could learn how to make it!   Prices are good, except for the drink prices.  The drinks cost more than the food and have a weak pour.   Cool atmosphere.  The top floor bar is really cool.  Lots of beautiful people looking smooth.  Well except one time, I ran into a girl from high school and got stuck talking to her and her breath was kickin.  But anyway, check it out!
