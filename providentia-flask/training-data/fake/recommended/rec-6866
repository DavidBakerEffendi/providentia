One of my top three favorite restaurants in all of New York. The atmosphere is perfection and the food is outstanding. I came for a celebratory dinner with my closet friends and family, and the family style tasting menu was unbelievably delicious. The drinks are great and the service is top notch. I've also been for brunch, which was equally as delightful. The chorizo breakfast sandwich was a standout- and I didn't even order it- I just got a taste of my friend's. The lamb bacon was also to die for. Sitting out back for a cold beer in the summer is also my jam!
