The great thing about working in media is that you get cool jobs, inside of cool buildings that have full fledged food trucks inside! When I found out that Mamak would be one of the vendors this week I thought I'd try it out since I've never had Indian/Malaysian food before, and I don't regret that choice for a hot second. The man working the stand was really nice. I was a little indecisive about what I wanted so, he offered to let me try a little bit of everything lol. So, I ended up with a Nasi Lamak Rice Bowl with half chicken rendang and half vegetables curry stew. I must say it was very good. The flavors were all on point, the potatoes were very soft (just the way i like them), and the Malaysian fruit salad added a pop of sweetness that I wasn't expecting, but was still so complimentary. The next time Mamak is in the area I'm definitely going back!
