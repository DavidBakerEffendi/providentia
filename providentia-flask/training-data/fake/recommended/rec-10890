food was delicious, the service was really strong and the chef came out to bring us free goodies and chat a few times throughout our meal.  i would definitely reccomend to just about anyone.  only caveat being that it is pretty pricey and, to be fair, it isnt the first place i would send someone in carroll gardens.  that being said, my wife and i really enjoyed the meal and experience, we will be back.
