I've lived across the street from Coco's for the past three years and only been in here a handful of times. I like the food although it's a bit pricey. I've never had anything special off the lunch menu (just bad to so-so sandwiches) but the dinner menu has always been pretty delicious. The crab quesadillas are super tasty, the nachos are baaaaaangin, and the burgers are great too. Also, the drafts are reasonable prices making up for the extra money you spend on food. Plus I think it's worth it when you feel like having above average pub food. The biggest problem I have with hanging out in this bar is that the crowd is so weird and not in a good/interesting way. It's kind of a mash up of creepy old dudes from Jeweler's Row, dorky grad school students, and maybe some other random people. Nothing about it is really... fun. The staff is (mostly) cool and I like the food but this isn't really a fun place to hang out and drink for me.
