We were trying to go to the bbq joint in this neighborhood but it was closed down forever! We found this place next door to it and decided what the hell let's just try it anyway. Boy am I glad we did. This place is incredibly charming, small but full of character and feels like you're stepping into a different place in a different time. Its a small place, dark and cozy. Very homey. The kitchen is exposed so Â you can smell and see all the delicious food. Food is typical French. I had the Salmon burger and it was really moist and tasty. It came with a fresh salad on the side and some fries. Also started with the crab and corn chowder. Really delicious! Creamy and sweet and it feels like you're taken away to a beach side oasis. It is a really cute spot, reasonably priced for French cuisine but average isn food. Nothing really to rave that much about.
