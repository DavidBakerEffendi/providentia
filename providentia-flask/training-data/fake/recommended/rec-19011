I love this place! Just moved into the neighborhood and have been here at least 8 times. I'm from the Bay Area, so I have pretty high standards for Vietnamese food. Everything I've tried here from the summer rolls to the pho have been delicious. The banh mi is huge, crisp, and tasty. I love the type of baguette-ish bread they use; not too stale or airy. The vegetarian pho is also great; tasty, hearty, and stuffed with lots of vegetables. Their Vietnamese coffee is also addictive. The best part about the place though, is the ambiance. The decor is earthy but modern and very relaxing. Not the florescent-lit, tile-floored, seats-with-plastic-cushions-that-stick-to-you type of joint that a lot of cheap pho places seem to be. The staff is incredibly friendly. It's great to see some familiar faces every time I come in. A really relaxing, friendly atmosphere overall. This is one of the few places I don't mind eating alone. Looking forward to the next million times I eat here.
