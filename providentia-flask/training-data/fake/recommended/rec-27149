I was craving a burger when I got into town and my host happily obliged to take me somewhere that would make me shut up about wanting a great burger.  We got here around 4 or 5 and it was a ghost town which I didn't mind at all since the convo we were having would make anyone blush. She's been here a few times and she was surprised how empty it was.  We ordered the mac and cheese since neither of us can ever turn it down when we see it on a menu.  Wish we had skipped it this time, it was tiny and had this weird gritty consistency and didn't taste very good but they made up for it with these wonderful beverages.  Tequila milkshake anyone?? Oh man was I in a happy place, plus she(my wonderful friend) had a bogo free coupon that she received last time she was there which they honored even on alcoholic beverages which is such a rarity so the horrible mac and cheese experience was forgiven.  The burgers were cooked perfectly and the fries were great.  Minus the mac and cheese I couldn't have asked for a better meal, wish this was in NY
