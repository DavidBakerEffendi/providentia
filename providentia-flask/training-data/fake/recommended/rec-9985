I'm a tough critic when it comes to thai food but after dining at Room Service for the 3rd time, my opinion hasn't changed.  Disappointed.  Most disappointed dish of last night was Penang Beef Curry.  It wasn't spicy and it just wasn't as flavorful compared to other places I've had it at.  The Spicy Basil Noodles was probably the best dish.  If your friend insists on coming here then I would say this is the go to dish.  Last but not least, we also ordered the Beef Green Apple Salad, which came in a very small portion and it didn't come with a lot of beef unfortunately.  The only reason why I've been here 3 times is because it's right around the corner from where I live.  But, I never suggest this spot if I get to pick.
