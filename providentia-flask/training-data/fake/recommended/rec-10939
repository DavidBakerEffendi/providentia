Finally made it to this much hyped burger institution.  Did I enjoy it?  Yes - immensely.  Best I ever had?  Negative. I tried the truffle burger, which seems to be the gateway drug here.  I wanted to dip my toe in, but not necessarily take the full plunge.  It was a very tasty burger.  It's kind of a truffle bomb, but I happen to love that, so I thought it was really good.  Very juicy, decent size, packed with flavor.  My buddy and I also split an order of the "Manly" fries, because well, we are just so damn manly!  Had to do it.  The fries come with cheese, bacon and fried onions.  Sounds intense, but they were actually pretty light and manageable. The space has a bit of a refined cafeteria feel, with a fast food/bar vibe thrown in for good measure.  It's definitely different, but everyone there comes for the same reason, so I think less attention to aesthetics and ambiance is perfectly appropriate.  The service was attentive and friendly.  Overall, I liked it and would definitely return.  There are better burgers out there to be had, but the novelty of umami burger is pretty cool and I look forward to sampling some of their other items.
