Consistently great food with courteous service. I've never had a bad experience here. I stick to the Chili chicken with the thousand layer bread with Vatana dip. Other good options are the chicken keema or almost any of their noodle dishes if you're into that sort of thing. The food is served relatively quickly so it might not be the best place if you want to hang out for a while and enjoy a long conversation.
