Sublime find. Goat cheese and caramelized onions were fantastic. Two days later I'm still thinking about that dish. Small plates - escargot, tomato/mushroom flatbread, bleu cheese stuffed dates - were all delicious. Decor is eclectic without being pretentious. Swift, professional service, and great wines. What more could you ask for?
