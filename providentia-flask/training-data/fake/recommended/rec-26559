I absolutely love this place. I have only been here for lunch on maybe 5 occasions but I have never had 1 complaint. Staff is friendly. Ambiance is great. Lots of huge flat screens even in the cabanas outside. Food: everything is good. Haven't had anything to complain about. Frozen Margaritas are cold a strong!
