We have taken out from Black Bamboo on numerous occasions, and have had great experiences every time.  The menu has a lot to offer, and accommodates to vegetarians and vegans.  Even the non-vegans in our family enjoy the vegan sesame chicken and vegan ribs, as they are so well-made.  Furthermore, their broccoli with garlic sauce, along with the tofu soup with vegetables are both phenomenal. The prices are very reasonable, too.  A family favorite!
