OH my gosh- I am obsessed with this place and think about it on the opposite coast all of the time! The corn is good but what is even better is the mozzerella, chorizo quesadilla thing (can't remember the actual name but it is an appetizer)- so amazing! And then the shredded pork with the black beans and yellow rice with squeezed lime is incredible! And the Cuban sandwich. sooooooooooo goooooood. I want it now. There is frequently a wait so try to not go during the rush. It is worth it, though.
