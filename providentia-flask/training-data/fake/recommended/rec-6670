Have been to this place several times for brunch and it's great!  The setting is warm and homey (it's literally in the ground floor of a brownstone) and the back of the restaurant faces a garden.  Reasonably priced menu and I really enjoyed the fish with grits, pupusa and the coconut plantain soup I tried.  I really enjoyed the pace, too - not rushed at all.  Can't wait to try it for dinner.
