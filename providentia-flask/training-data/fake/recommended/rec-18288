Three of us had brunch there this Father's Day. We should have been worried when there was only two other tables with customers when we arrived at 12:30. The food was basic. They were "out" of iced tea- but my friend finally said can't you just make some hot tea and pour it over ice. My husband ordered scrambled eggs and bacon. He got a fried egg and had to ask for his bacon twice. Bloody Mary was overly spicy and the waitress/bartender who was new should not have been left alone. Â Don't waste your money--there are too many other great places to eat in the city.
