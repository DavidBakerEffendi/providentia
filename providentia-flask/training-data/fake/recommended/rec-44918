What a wonderful downtown gem.  The food is delectable, simple, and has soul.  It's the kind of restaurant that creates a warm and vivid memory in your mind.  I think that that's the hallmark of a great restaurant... one where the food, atmosphere and, hopefully, company imprint in your mind a memory that triggers good feelings and thoughts.  This is that kind of restaurant.  A perfect blend of sophistication and comfort. You can tell that a lot of thought has gone into each dish.  What I like about the offering is that the ingredients are the "stars" and the seasonings "support" in a perfectly balanced way.  For example, the right amount of salt has been added to each dish and the taste does not overpower the meal.  It's a hard balance to achieve, but here it is done perfectly. The desserts fall flat.  Okay, they suck.  But that's okay.  I'd rather skip the dessert if that means that Harold and company can just focus on the main dishes.
