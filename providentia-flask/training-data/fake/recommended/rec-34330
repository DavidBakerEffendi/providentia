I am only giving this place a 4 star because of their Tom Yum soup. Probably one of the best I have had. Not greasy, nice and spicy. The atmosphere is okay. Kind of banquet-ish. Napkins folded in weird shapes. Nice China and cool figurines displayed all over the place. The lighting is just not quite there. It's a BYOB. There are a couple liquor stores around Bloomfield Ave. One is located just down the block. I had the Pad Gra-Pow for dinner, for around $14.00. Nice spice, fresh. I enjoyed it. Anything with that amount of garlic is bliss for me. The staff is pretty good. Keeps your water glass full. I wasn't absolutely blown away by the food...for that I would go to Topaz on Washington Ave. in Bloomfield. But, they have way better Tom Yum soup.
