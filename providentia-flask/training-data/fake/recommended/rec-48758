The BEST dining experience my girlfriend and I have had in NYC so far. Such a great meal. I'm not even a huge fan of thai but this was just so good. We got so much food too! Mussels, soup, dumplings, and two entrees for like 60 bucks. Â And the interior is immaculate. Our service was unbelievable too. Seriously, go here.
