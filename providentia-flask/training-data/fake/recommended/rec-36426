i heard good things about this place, but it did not turn out well... i ordered the duck shepherd's pie and french onion soup. the soup was good, but the duck dish was overcooked, dry and slightly burnt. i thought the worst part was the bathroom. it was not well maintained by the attendant and had slippery floors. Why even pay an attendant to be there when he doesn't do a thing? #fail
