There's aren't a lot of Filipino restaurants in the City and so its even rarer when one of these limited spots is actually amazing. If you've ever wondered what "Filipino Food" is then come to Grill 21 and they'll throw down some knowledge. The food here is delicious and hits the "tastes like my mom makes it" sweet spot. its in Gramercy and sort of out of the way if you live on the West Side but the cab ride is definitely worth it. The place is not big at all, think of it as a small mom and pop restaurant so its tight quarters. Things off the top of my head that you need to order would be the Tocino, the Lumpia Shanghai and for my homies that keep it real their Kare Kare with Bagoon is nothing to shake your head ... more like bob your head in agreement. Good stuff.
