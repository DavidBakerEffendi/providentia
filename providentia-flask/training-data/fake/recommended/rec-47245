If you love fresh pasta and great Italian food, dining at Supper is a must. This small restaurant in the East Village has that certain New York vibe we all seek when dining out in the city yet still retains the Mom & Pop charm of hole-in-the-wall finds as evidenced from the family photo on the menu. Everything we had amazed our senses and taste buds. We joked that even though we ordered way too much food, we couldn't imagine not having tried any of the following: Focaccia with white beans & garlic-infused olive oil (I've never had beans served as a bread accompaniment and now I can't imagine a better pairing) Bruschetta (The tomatoes used are some of the plumpest, firmest, most delicious I'v ever tasted. I also love that the bread is grilled.) Mozzarella di bufalo (Incredible fresh, creamy mozzarella and, again, those tomatoes!) Black kale panzanella (unlike any kale salad I've ever had - loved the bread in this dish, too) Spaghetti al limone (Refreshing, satisfying, and so unique) Spinach gnocchi (This is perfection) Tiramisu (Could rank among the best tiramisus I'v had) The prices are extremely reasonable, especially for New York. Though, be prepared with cash - no credit cards accepted. If you can, try to sit in front of the grill for a wonderful dining experience where you can watch the chefs work their magic. The wait staff is accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu. If you have questions, ask for recommendations. They won't lead you astray.
