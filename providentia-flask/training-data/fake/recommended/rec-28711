Good , fast & cheap.  If its fast and good, it wont be cheap and if its cheap and fast it wont be good..and if its good and cheap its generally not fast.  Not so with Joya.   Went in on a rainy Tuesday evening and we were sat right away.  Ordered the summer roll app, the see noodles, a green curry with shrimp and the tom ka soup.   The soup was watery and should of had more coconut milk in it but still was good for the price.  The summer roll presentation was beautiful.  Looked like a japanese roll.  However it tasted like it was wrapped in a wet paper towel.  Not really what i expected.  Inside was some fishcake and tofu, i dont even know what was in there really, but it was pretty. The curry was very plain served only with potato and no veggie at all in there.  Tasty though not the best ive had by a long shot.  The noodle dish was the winner of the night coming out piping hot and very good with the thicker noodles. 2 thai iced coffees , needed more half and half , milk was used like skim.  Healthy i guess but again not very tasty.   After that i had enough and asked for the check.  Was 32$ Very reasonable but next time i go in it will only be for noodles.  Service was quick quick quick.   Personally there are better Thai places on court street. Many.  Cafe Chili is awesome and even Ghang next door is better then here though not as bustling.   All and all it was good, fast and cheap.  But not great, sublime or extra ordinary in anyway.
