Went there on Friday night and it was very fun & the food was awesome (try the octopus app as well as tomato buratta salad). We all had pizza which was great. They had some very nice bottles of wine for under $30-we had the Primitivo for $25-not bad! The only negative was that it is very loud when the restaurant is full. But other than that I'd give it 4 stars! I'll definitely go back. Oh and the attentive service was a plus also!
