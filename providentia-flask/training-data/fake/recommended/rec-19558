I came to visit a native Californian college friend of mine, and she said I would LOVE this place. She was right (as she often is). This is your typical new American food. Comfort with an hippie, organic, fun loving, yummy twist. The portions were big, the flavors were fresh and for the most part spot on. I'm crazy to come from California and get the breakfast burrito, but hell...it had black beans and I'm a sucker. .. The tomato sauce on top I could have done without, but otherwise a successful go at a very Tex Mex/Californian inspired dish. Oh and the sweet potato fries with dusted powdered sugar...let's just say it's a crispy taste of Heaven! Perfect spot to catch up with friends or a nice casual date. Bon-a-petit!
