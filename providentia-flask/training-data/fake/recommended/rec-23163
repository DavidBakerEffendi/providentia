First time visit for dinner for 4 + 2 year old.  Had wonton soup (broth a little salty, but wontons good), scallion pancake & gyoza (both excellent) and then General Tso's tofu, excellent eggplant. Sesame chicken (outstanding), a moderately hot chicken and shrimp dish and a mild Thai curry.  This was followed by their ice-cream special and fried banana (could have used a bit more sweetness).  The beginning of a beautiful friendship
