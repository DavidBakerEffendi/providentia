This is a hole in the wall type of joint.  It's not that small but just don't expect anything in terms of decor.   I ordered their samosa chaat and dabeli and surprisingly they were both very good.  I will definitely be going back for more!! Give them a shot and definitely try their samosa chaat and dabeli.  Not sure about the other items on their menu.   I gave them four stars because I think they can make the inside of the restaurant much nicer so that people can have a better dining experience.
