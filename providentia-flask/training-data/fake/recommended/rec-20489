Tessara has been my 'go to' place for years now when I'm looking for a place in Hamilton that's a little classier to take business acquaintances to for lunch. I have a general practice and practice Real Estate Law as part of that. I've taken Realtors,  mortgage reps, title insurance executives and  others here and they have always been complimentary after.  It is not overly expensive when considering the service and the atmosphere. Stopped in with Debbi Faye, Melissa, Babs, Emily and Keith after he was sworn in as a new attorney and all enjoyed their meals. The bread is delicious and as we were all starving and had ravenously finished ours more was immediately brought without our having to ask! I had the Italian wedding Soup and a great Veal Parm entree that was excellently tasty! They have a full bar and great service. I've never drank at the small bar and as said elsewhere that does seem to draw an older crowd as I've noticed as you pass said bar on the way out.
