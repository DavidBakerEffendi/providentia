I love the 1/2 off times. Their spicy salmon is very cheap and very good. So are some of the special rolls. If you are careful with what you get, you could get perhaps 4-5 rolls for under $20, not too bad. Also, their hibachi is absolutely hilarious. The chef has a routine that involves squirting sake into people's mouth after they catch a piece of vegetable. It's a great party dinner place and fairly lively-fun without much effort. If you are getting the hibachi though, definitely get fried rice. I think it tastes better and they add stuff in it (eggs and little veggies). The soup/broth or salad that comes with the meal is frankly disappointing, but you'll probably be so full from the hibachi that it won't matter too much.
