Billy is a smart businessman and a lovely guy who has created one of the few really good restaurants in/around Red Hook. The price is right, the BBQ is authentic, and the atmosphere is top-notch. Go here if you don't feel like schlepping over to Fete Sau in Williamsburg. Just as good, less expensive, wonderful place.
