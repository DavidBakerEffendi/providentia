This diner always has good food 24/7. You can order breakfast anytime of the day or night & the portions are huge. The tableservice is somewhat friendly besides a few old-timers that have been there for years, who get the order right but are very sarcastic and cranky. The place is always clean and there's never a wait. It's a great place for a meal anytime of the day for yourself or a large group.
