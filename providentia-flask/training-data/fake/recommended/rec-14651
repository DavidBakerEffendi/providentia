This place held two surprises for me - both pleasant. I have this theory on Indian food on the East coast -  the farther you go from Manhattan, the worser it gets. This place happily disproved that hypothesis. And, the manager of the restaurant is from the town I belong to in India (and from the same neighborhood!). That does not happen all too often. The first thing that bodes very well for any restaurant is that the sever/waiter is willing to work with you to make the right choices from the menu, remember what 7 different people (including 3 little kids) order and then deliver them in the right order. And, the right order when you dine out with kids is not appetizer first; it is the kids' meal and then the adults' meal.  When done correctly, this aspect will make you forgive and eventually forget any misgivings that the restaurant may have and make you go back. So, kudos to Rajesh (the manager) for getting this right! The food itself reminded me of stuff from the original Myilai Masala, in Chennai, India. There are some differences but essentially they were able to retain a lot of the original flavor and taste. We ordered Masala dosa, Sambhar idli, Rava dosa, chappatis, south Indian coffee which is a fairly representative selection if you go to any south Indian establishment. The sambhar and chutney were fresh and the dosas were crisp but very well cooked. They also had the sour tinge that hallmarks all good dosas. Ghee Dosa was indeed flavored with clarified butter rather than the sesame oil which most establishments substitute it for. The coffee was not bad but I felt they could have done much better (given that it is easier to import coffee from India than import dosa batter!). I would certainly go again in a blink! Wish they had more branches like the ubiquitous Saravana Bhavan.
