My co-worker at the time told me he worked at this restaurant on the weekends and gave me a free $15 dollar gift card to use there. Knowing me, I can't say no to free stuff. Appearance-wise, it's a nice, quaint little Italian restaurant. A good spot to take someone out on a first date. Romantic low lighting, a very Italian vibe. But like I said, appearance-wise. Food-wise, it's actually just okay. For an appetizer, I got the calamari. It's the typical run-of-the-mill calamari. Simply fried squid with a lemon on the side, nothing out of the ordinary. For the entree, I ordered the Chicken Margherita over penne vodka. To be honest, it was brought out a little on the cold side. Granted, it took a while for my dish to come out but there was only one other couple eating at the restaurant. Which means it's shouldn't have taken that long for such an un-busy night. But the waiter was nice, so I'll let it slide. The chicken was okay. Nothing great. But good enough to satisfy my appetite. Penne vodka was subpar. Can't overlook once again that it was a little cold. Overall, nothing too crazy about this place. Probably won't go back only because it's not a restaurant I would give a second chance to.
