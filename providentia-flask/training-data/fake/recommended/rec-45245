This is hands down my favorite coffee shop and I've been a loyal customer for the past 9 years. I have never tried a drink or food item here that I didn't like (or love!). The ambiance is great--lots of comfy little couches around a faux fireplace, low tables, and higher bar-like tables with interesting artwork adorning the walls. It's perfect for brunch, doing work during the day with a laptop using their free Wi-Fi, hanging out with friends for a couple hours, or even a date. There are live bands that perform every Wednesday night and book signings or workshops during the day sometimes. All of their lattes are so delicious and if you're looking for creative coffee concoctions, this is the place. For example, the Elvis latte is a mix of peanut butter and banana, Knucklehead Mocha is mocha with raspberry and white chocolate, and my personal favorite is the Banana Nut Java (coffee with banana and macadamia nut syrups). Other stand-outs I would recommend: -Frozen hot chocolate (or the Fro-ho, as frequenters call them): so good and so many unique flavors such as brownie, mint, or birthday cake blended in -Individual pots of herbal tea (citrus burst and blueberry green tea are great) -Vanilla chai tea latte -Green tea blendesso (similiar to a Frappuccino) -Any of their desserts---spectacular -Grilled cheese on a bagel stick -Hazelnut hot chocolate (the Brown Eyed Girl) -Paninis Ask for a Fine Grind card if you go. After you buy so many drinks (maybe 10 or so), you get a drink free. Worth it if you go a lot. Most of their lattes are around $4 but sooo worth it. Definitely LOVE this place!
