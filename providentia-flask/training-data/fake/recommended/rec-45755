I have to be honest, I've been here a few times and every time I come it gets a little better and better. The atmosphere is light, fun but classy. The service this time was pleasant, cheerful and personable. The food was pretty good too. The chips are addictive, especially when warm! But the dip was watery and had chunks in them that we assumed were onion, but were afraid to try. I would have killed for some simple Lipton onion soup dip because the chips would have been perfect for that! The tortilla soup was good. Warm and balanced. I would have loved a kick, but it was still better than expected. The salads were tasty- the BBQ chicken salad had a good BBQ flavor though it had no color. Tasty but the chicken pieces were small so it felt insignificant. I guess I'm used to seeing a nicely sliced chicken breast on top of my salad. Again, some criticisms, but this place is ok and getting better.
