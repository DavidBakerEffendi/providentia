The food is great, the service staff is friendly.  The only thing that prevents it from being 5-stars is the long lines it always has and I feel it's hours are inconsistent (but that may be just me).  If you are in the nieghborhood, go here... strongly recommended.  And if you are on that long line, they'll give you cookies. I understand that long lines can be a sign of quality, but after a certain point, I simply do not like waiting to be seated.  Tom's would benefit greatly from expanding their place... although they would probably still be a line to get in even if they doubled their capacity.
