My wife and I dined here for a weekday lunch recently.  We were seated in the quieter upper level in a booth.  I ordered the vegetarian (tree hugger) Panini, which was excellent but just the right size for lunch, which came with superb skin-on fries.  My wife ordered the pesto spaghetti squash, which was a huge portion.  Carried out the raspberry cheesecake for dessert.  I especially appreciated the special designation of a vegetarian section on the menu, and being told (without having to ask) that the soups were not vegetarian. Service was friendly & attentive.  Very pleasant outing overall, and impressed with the quality of ingredients & preparation.  Will definitely return.
