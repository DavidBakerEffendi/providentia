The food at MMCo was delicious! Talk about having it down, even though they've only been open a few days. Â The Pork Mushroom was so flavorful and their tomato sauce is what I'd expect an Italian Grandmother's sauce to taste like, probably because they are the owner's mom's recipes. A great place for a quick meal or to take out.
