Simply put, my kind of bar.  I am just a long time devotee of Belgian beer and mussels, so I probably wouldn't have it any other way.   The beer selection is quite nice.  I was really pleased to see Grimbergen Abbey Dubbel available on draft!  More than that though, there are over a dozen such great choices available on draft, all under $10 a glass.  The bottle list is considerably more extensive and has a nice range. The mussels were really good too.  I opted for the moules frites with the vin blanc et creme sauce.  This was really delicious.  So flavorful, and the mussel meat was large and really took on the flavor of the broth.  It paired so well with my beer selections, I was very pleased.  The fries were served with mayonnaise, but I was able to request spicy Dijon mustard in place of it, and this worked out quite well. The ambience was wonderful.  This is what clearly distinguishes this location from the BXL at Times Square.  There I couldn't wait to leave, whereas here I indulged by staying longer than was necessary to finish my meal.  The paintings were visually interesting, and the radio played songs in French which definitely added atmosphere.  The clear conversation in French between the bartender, server, and a client sold me on authenticity though.  C'etait bien.  Definitely recommend.
