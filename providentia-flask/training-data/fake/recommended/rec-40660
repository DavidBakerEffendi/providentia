YUMMMMM, I am a fan of almost everything I have tried here... - Ginger Cosmo = 5 stars - Guac and chips = 5 stars - Hawaiian empanada = 5 stars (One of my faves) - Polish Empanada = 5 starts (one of my faves) - Italiano Mambo = 5 stars - Pernil = 5 stars - Chicken = 5 starts I want to go back but it's always so crowded!!! It's a small joint, don't bring any extra baggage because there really isn't anywhere to put it.
