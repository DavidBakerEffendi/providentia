Hotdog heaven. Every since I first heard about the mouthwatering and innovative 'dogs being served up at Hot Diggity, I knew I had to see if they lived up to the hype. The verdict:  Not only does Hot Diggity live up to the hype, it smashes right through the hype, obliterating the hype into a billion little bits of hype-dust. Located right in the heart of the South St strip, Hot Diggity draws you in with the aroma of fresh and spicy 'dogs.  Things are super-casual here: just order at the counter, and the hotdogs are out in no time.  For me, two hotdogs were a perfect (and inexpensive) way to satisfy the lunchtime hunger pangs: ** The Saigon Fusion -- essentially a banh mi hotdog.  This hotdog has cucumbers, carrots, cilantro, red onion, fresh jalapeños, and a generous dollop of Sriracha.  Absolutely delicious. ** The Philly Surf & Turf -- by far the best hotdog I've ever had.  In this one, the 'dog was wrapped in a crispy fish cake, and covered in lots of spicy brown mustard and sweet pepper hash.  The amount of flavor going on here was just extraordinary. There are so many more amazing hotdogs at Hot Diggity -- I just wish my stomach were big enough to try them all... ...and if that day ever comes, I'll officially dub myself The King of Philly Wieners".
