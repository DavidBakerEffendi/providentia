The food was excellent and the service charming and attentive. The ambiance and decor were pleasant with too distinctive areas: the bar and front part of the restaurant had a modern with a touch of industrial look. The back was darker and more 'French Country'. The menu was somewhat limited but overall an oasis in the Penn Station area.
