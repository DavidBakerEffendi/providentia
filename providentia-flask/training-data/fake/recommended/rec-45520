Only been here once, but we liked it, a lot.  Pancakes were large, good and fluffy, bacon was crisp, fresh squeezed OJ was vg. Fruit bowl had a delicious mix of tasty berries, bananas and mango.  Nice bagels served with enough cream cheese for 2 whole bagels.  Coffee was plentiful and good, nutty tasting. Large container of homemade berry jam on the table.  BUT, maple syrup is extra!  I think it is sad when you serve a great pancake and crappy syrup with them. We would all definitely go again.  Good for smaller groups, it is pretty small inside but they do have a little patio with a couple larger tables. They were very nice people.
