I'm fairly new to the 'hood and as hoping this place would be as good as it looked, since it's a bit of a mixed bag of an area. My boyfriend and I went for brunch at 1pm, and the place was empty except for the employees, but we decided to stick it out, and I'm glad we did. Despite no mimosas listed on the menu, they made me a peach mimosa, and the boy ordered a ridiculously cheap Blue Moon (apparently it's happy hour all day on weekends). I got the breakfast burrito, and was very pleasantly surprised. As a native Californian I can be snotty about these things, but it was huge and tasted great -- the black beans that come with it are awesome (whatever seasoning they use is delish). I ate as much as I could but it was too much food for me. Boyf got the banana pancakes with sausage (which I think they didn't charge him extra for) and they were quite satisfying and filling as well -- that strawberry sauce on the side is no joke. Staff was pleasant but not pushy or annoying, and very apologetic about their credit card reader not working that day (we just ran next door to an ATM). Overall, a great, affordable brunch (2 dishes + 4 drinks for around $40) -- very exciting to have this walking distance from my house. Will def be back!
