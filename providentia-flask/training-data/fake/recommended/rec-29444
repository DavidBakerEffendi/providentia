Big Fish Seafood is no big deal. Â A few friends and I stopped by here a few months back for happy hour. They had a great selection of happy hour apps and drinks. The service was excellent and if we stopped there it would have been amazing, but then the entrees came out and it all went downhill. The entrees were under seasoned and we ordered the two things that you would have though would have had the most flavor the jambalaya and the bouillabaisse. Not only was it under flavored, but they had over cooked the seafood as well. I am not one to ever send something back but I was highly considering it. So other than the entrees I give the place a 4.5 but after the entrees came out I now give it a 3.
