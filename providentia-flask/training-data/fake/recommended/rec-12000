blah...I went here alone--the true test of a restaurant's service is how they treat a lone diner. I walked in at 8 pm on a Thursday night and stood at the door for 5 minutes while the staff ran around me. I finally asked a server and got a seat at the bar, all the closely packed tables were full. Cool to watch the open kitchen (and dishwashing area), but the loose floorboards under the stools made for a bumpy ride. I ordered the risotto with roasted chix, mushroom and took pinenuts out and subbed arugula for a cool $18. It's a specialty restaurant in NYC, so I expect the price. The lack of starage is due to the mediocre service. As a former server, I have to laugh at 3 servers who can't handle a total of 11 deuces and 3 people sitting at the bar, in a little restaurant! I got my food fairly quickly, and it was pretty good. Tender chicken, risotto just a little al dente. I didn't get any breadsticks at all, which was annoying, but honestly who needs a lot of bread when you are gonna eat a big plate of rice? And, the portion was big and rich enough to wrap half to go. However it peeves me no end when a server doesn't check back in to see if you are enjoying everything. Ever. And my water was refilled once and then sat empty. Peeve-osity. I had to ask for my food to be wrapped (came in a styro cup laid on it's side--huh?), wasn't offered dessert, and got my cheque. I'd go back if I was with one of my special needs diner pals, but only then. There are enough good restaurants in this area not to deal with crowded dining and rookie service.
