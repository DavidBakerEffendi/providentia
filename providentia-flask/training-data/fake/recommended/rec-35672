Eulogy is, hands-down, my most favorite place on planet earth to enjoy beer. But not just any beer....BELGIAN BEER!!!! and my friends...they have lots of it! So buy yourself a Delirium on tap, order some Belgian fries, and polish off a bowl of mussels....b/c my friends....you have arrived in the promised land.
