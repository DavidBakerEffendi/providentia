I've only been here for lunch, but it is one of my favorite places to have lunch!  I have had the bread board (look for a unique new butter of the day), the tart (small but rich!), the beet salad, and a strata (during restaurant week).  These were all great!  Still need to try the mac and cheese and the grilled cheese.  Don't miss Caseus!
