I love the Art Nouveau inspired decor, the friendly waitstaff, and of course, the majority of items on the menu. I love the marinated scallops, and a few other specialties on the menu, however, other dishes, such as the ratatouille and white sauce entree, could have been better. I am always glad to see restaurants take risks with the cooking, but sometimes sticking with traditional flavors works for the best. c'est la vie.
