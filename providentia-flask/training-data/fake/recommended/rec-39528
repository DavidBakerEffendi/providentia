I came here for lunch with some friends after walking around randomly. It has a lively atmosphere: bright, warm colors; customers' conversations up in the air; music playing. I ordered their special that day, which was the crab cake benedictos. I really wasn't sure of anything about their menu so I ordered the most appealing yet affordable thing I could find. I saw the dish and thought "Oh man, I hope this is enough." However, it was able to fill me up. Not only that, the dish itself was amazing. 1. Rice with black beans:Rice was cooked well, not too dry or too moist. When combined with the black beans, it was good enough to stand on its own. 2. Crab cakes, topped with eggs benedict and a green hollandaise sauce: I honestly do not remember what they added in that sauce (avocado? some type of green chile?) but it was dynamite. The crab cakes weren't dry. It had good consistency, not breaking up once I forked it. The poached eggs and the green hollandaise complimented the crab cakes. I honestly wish I could have gone into the kitchen and seen how they made it, just so I could have it whenever I want.
