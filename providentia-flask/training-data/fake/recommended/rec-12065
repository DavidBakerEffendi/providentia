The service here was awful and they were very rude. I went to the register paid for my sandwich then waited ten minutes and still no good meanwhile everyone else behind me got there food. The girl then told me well you didn't order your food in the right place. There is no sign saying order here. I'm sorry a first time customer ( and last time customer) didn't know the proper protocol for getting food here. Only saving grace was the food was pretty good
