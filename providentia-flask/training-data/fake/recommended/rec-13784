I have never had ramen like this before! A friend of mine and I came by Ippudo on a Monday night around 8:30 and there was still about a 45 minute wait which speaks to the quality of this place. It's not bad because  there is cool stuff nearby so we grabbed a drink and then came back over. We each ordered the Akamaru Modern with a soft boiled egg so we were each out of there for $20. Wow this stuff was on point! I have no idea how they make the soup taste so good but they are doing something right. It is the perfect mix of color, taste, textures, and flavor which come together to make a delightful meal. The pork belly is ridiculously good and they are pretty generous with their serving of it. Make sure you are adept with chop sticks or otherwise make sure you ask for a fork to eat this dish properly. Decor is pretty modern and 'trendy.' Service was friendly and attentive.  If you like japanese or particularly ramen dishes, this place is a MUST in NYC.
