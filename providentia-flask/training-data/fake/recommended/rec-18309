I had a great time at Jose Pistolas. Their beer selection is top notch, as they have a wide variety of IPA's and Craft Brews on tap. Along with that they have a large selection of bottled beers. The menu seemed limited to nachos and burrito's, but as a Mexican food lover it was right up my alley. I got the Sunrise Burrito and I have to say this was one of the best burrito's I have ever had. The burrito offered a lot of different tastes and tasted like the person who made it took time and effort rather then slapping something together. The guacamole app was delicious as well. They offered two types of salsa as well as a mountain of chips. Overall a great little place if you are in the mood for mexican
