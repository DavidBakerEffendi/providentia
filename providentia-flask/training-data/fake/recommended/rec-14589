I was hungry--or I think I was hungry--last Thursday when it was 900 degrees outside.  The trees in Washington Square Park were breezeless, and the fountain was dry.  Through my tears of sweat and tears of tears, I spotted the Dosa Man on W 4th street. I thought, "no way, it can't be.  It's summer. How is he doing this? The city is on fire, and he's cooking outdoors?! Is he made of magic?"  But that was a stupid question for I already knew that the Dosa Man is made of magic.  So I ordered my lunch from him. He was kind and wonderful as usual, and I blissfully waited for his uttapam (I ordered it spicy) to raise my internal temperature to match the external one. The Dosa Man and the Dosa cart are glorious. Everything I have ordered (which I think is everything) is perfect, and I would eat here every day if I could.
