Unsuspecting delicious deli.  Sandwich menu is extensive, personal faves include the Pho, Biden, Mona Lisa and chicken Caesar on a crossaint.  Their soup is outrageously good, split pea especially.  The best part is their breakfast sandwich, only $3.50 and comes with two eggs, cheese, hashbrowns and bacon, ham or sausage.  I get mine on a bagel, super filling and so cheap. They are always open and they deliver anything anytime so long as it's $10 or more.  Great for drunken eats.
