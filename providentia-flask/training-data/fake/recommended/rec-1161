I've been to Frankford Hall four times now and everytime I go it's a great time.  They have giant liters of beer and I love Spaten's heffeweizen.  The fire pit's are fun and you can roast marshmallows for fifty cents.  I've always gone with a group of at least four or more.  It's a really good place to take large groups because of the long bench seating.
