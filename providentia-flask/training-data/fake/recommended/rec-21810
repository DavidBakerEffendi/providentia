My husband and I checked out Juventino last night for an impromptu dinner and were very impressed.  We had been here for brunch before and that was good too, but dinner took it to a whole new level.  Everything we had was delicious - perfectly seasoned, inspired plates using fresh ingredients.  They even started us off with a beautiful cheese plate in place of the typical bread basket, and gave us an amuse bouche as well.  The servings were generous and well worth the price.  I  highly recommend this place.
