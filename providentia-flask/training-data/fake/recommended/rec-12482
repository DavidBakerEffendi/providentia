Agreed with all the reviews about the wait being worth the pancakes. Came here on a Saturday morning around 11am and put our name down for a table for 2 for a 2 hour wait. They have a texting system so they will text you a 5 minute warning when your table is ready. That is plenty of time to even grab a quick snack somewhere else - Balthazar is a 20 min walk - but don't fill up! When we were finally seated, we ordered the blueberry pancakes and the farmers plate. Pancakes are as good as everyone says. They are very light and it feels like you could eat the whole stack of 3 without feeling full, but they are very satisfying and enough for 1 person. The farmers platter was good too. It's hard to go crazy over scrambled eggs, but it was nice alternating between the pancakes and eggs. It comes with 2 small patties of rosemary sausage- good flavor and a bit spicy. Raspberry jam is provided for the sourdough toast (which didn't seem toasted) and the toasted tomatoes are nothing special. Overall, the pancakes were definitely the best we've had anywhere else! Definitely worth the wait at least once!
