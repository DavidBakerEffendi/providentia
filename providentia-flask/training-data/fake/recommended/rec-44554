Best Filipino food in Manhattan.   All of the stock Filipino dishes are covered well, and you can expect great Tocino, adobo and kare kare.  The Sisig is also a stand out and it is really sizzling when it comes out.  The only dish that I would skip is the Lumpiang Shanghai which is just mediocre.  I kinda think of this as a throw away dish for people new to Filipino food.  Once you move on to the really good stuff, this can be skipped.  Not to say that Lumpiang Shanghai can't be really good, lord knows I've had some that was great.  Just not at Grill 21.   The stand-out dishes that I've had are the ginataang dishes, either hipon or manok.  The coconut curry they serve is like nothing I've ever really had.  It's more like coconut gravy, as it is thick, rich and mild.  I've had this dish at two other restaurants in the city and one in Manila and I still think this is the best one I've ever had.  My Filipino friends have said that it's not as 'traditional' as the other dishes at Grill 21, but I couldn't care less.
