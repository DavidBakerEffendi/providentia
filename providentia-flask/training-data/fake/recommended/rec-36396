I love wandering around neighborhoods in the city, and especially Soho, that's how I found this place, wanting a bite and to warm up. It looked so classically New York and wonderful ambience. I did have a sticker shock looking at the wine prices (but shouldn't have considering the neighborhood). I had a nice wine and ordered the crisped potatoes with aioli, (plentiful amount - I couldn't finish half, tasty and on the spicy side), and a wonderful spinach side dish - spinach sauteed in olive oil and shaved garlic, pine nuts, garbanzos and golden raisins, and finished with a cherry vinaigrette...I loved this dish and want to try to duplicate it at home - the server very nicely shared the ingredients with me! A very romantic lovely atmosphere -- a perfect place for a date with someone special, or by yourself in the bar.
