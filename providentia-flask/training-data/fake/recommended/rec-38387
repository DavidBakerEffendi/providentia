I've been here a few times, so it's about time to give them some props for being consistent and being the best ramen joint in NYC. Each time I come here, I keep being impressed by their ability to put out good ramen with so much demand. They don't err on their consistency and the noodles are always the perfect al dente while their broth is always done to perfection. That means they have the two most important aspects of ramen down. The pork they put in their ramen is also done very well, although I wish there was more. The only negative is that they always put too much scallions, and as much as I love scallions (and I really do), there comes a point where there's just too much. Haha. Remember, come here with CASH. And definitely not on a first date in the winter unless you want her to freeze. The wait here alone can have her be tired of you by the time you eat your ramen.
