friendly servers, cozy ambiance, and pleasant food! we ordered mussels on red (it's basically mussels with ketchup! or tomato sauce, which doesn't sound too cheap), Linguine (they can make vegetarian pastas), and Margherita. but Monk's Caf√© has the best mussel in the city, and probably the best on this side of the Atlantic.
