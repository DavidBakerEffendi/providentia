Cutie Patroller report Ssam Bar, located in the East Village, is one of Chef David Chang's five restaurants. I'm a fan of his original Momofuku noodle bar (one of my favorite pork based Ramen shops in the city- my #1 pick is Ipuddo). Ssam Bar showcases David's Korean and French influences, but for me it seems very similar to the Japanese Izakaya style (Japanese tapas pub). I like this place for combining a casual dining vibe created by the staff, open kitchen, and long community tables yet it still serves some very sophisticated food (like a Uni dish that amazed me). Start with a sake or magnum size Asahi beer (really cool). This pig lover's paradise, as a matter of fact the menu explicitly declares "we do not serve vegetarian...'', is known for its whole slow-cooked pork shoulder  (special order in advance). They also have a great raw bar but in this case skip it - you should order a second plate of pork buns. Before you leave, make sure to check out next door's Milk Bar for dessert!!  P.S. Chang's newest place is Ma Peche in midtown, known for their 'cool' foodie version of Vietnamese style 7 courses of Beef, but this Cutie Patroler doesn't often patrole midtown....so hopefully one day I will make it up there! by Cutie Patroller
