My coworkers and I stopped here on a whim while out for lunch. None of us had ever been and I have to admit it looked a little sketchy when we pulled up, but we went based on the good reviews on yelp and were pleasantly surprised with the food. I asked the waitress for a recommendation and she suggested the Grilled Loukaniko and it was very tasty! Â They allowed me to order it with grilled vegetables instead of fries and the vegetables were really good. The service was great, the waitstaff was super friendly. I will definitely recommend this place and go back if ever in the area again.
