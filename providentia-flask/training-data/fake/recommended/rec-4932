RICKY IS RUDE AND DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO RUN HIS BUSINESS The food here was great on our first visit. On our second visit we never got to try it because the rude and arrogant Ricky shooed us away - literally. When we walked in at 6.40pm we were told by Ricky that there would be no table till 8pm. So we decided to order takeout while others who walked in at the same time as us, chose to leave. While we were waiting we saw another couple just walk in and get seated immediately, without a reservation. When we inquired about that, we were told by Ricky that he cannot predict if people leave the restaurant early and since we had decided to order take out, we could not be served the food at a table, even if one became available. He was extremely rude. When we protested and said we'd like to cancel the order, he used his hands to shoo us away. I have no interest in giving my money to such a rude and unprofessional business owner and I can't even imagine how he must treat his staff, if his treats his customers this way.
