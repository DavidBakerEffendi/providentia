Having recently moved to the area and always the consummate "foodies," my wife and I decided to check out Mambo Tea House, a new Cuban restaurant in Rutherford.  First impression?  WOW!  The owner of the restaurant, who stopped by to check in on us during our meal, clearly put a lot of thought into creating an interior that whisks diners away to the islands, if only for an evening.  But the decor wasn't the only thing to capture our attention; the food at this comfortable, neighborhood restaurant is absolutely delicious!  My wife and I decided to split Camaraones al Ajillo (always a favorite of ours), I had the Ropa Vieja, and she had the Chilean Sea Bass.  All of the food was fantastic, including the Tres Leche cake that the owner sent over gratis!  We couldn't have felt more welcome especially considering that we were new to the area.  Mambo Tea House is truly a gem and we can't wait to go back!
