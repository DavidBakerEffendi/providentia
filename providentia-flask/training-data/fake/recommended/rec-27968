Great Sandwich; Racist Waitstaff. I came in for an awesome sandwich and left with an earful of bigoted garbage. While I was eating, one of the cooks/waiters began reprimanding the other cook/waiter. He said, "You shouldn't answer the phone. Because no one will eat here if they know Mexicans work here!" Right in front of me. Right in front of 3 other customers. Everyone was left speechless. I left immediately. I will never eat at this establishment, again. If you saw someone act like this, would YOU ever go there again? I encourage everyone to steer clear of this hateful atmosphere.
