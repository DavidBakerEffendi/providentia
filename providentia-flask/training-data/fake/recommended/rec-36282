Indifferent service. Diner food. People who call this authentic Italian food have clearly never been anywhere near Italy. I don't mind diner food, but that's definitely what this is. What I do mind is that every time I order take out they tell me it will be ready in 20 minutes, but they don't start putting it together until I show up & pay. I don't know about everyone else, but 20 minutes of my time is more valuable than the price of pasta & I don't appreciate it being wasted. If they need to be paid before fulfilling the order then they should tell customers that instead of making us wait 20 minutes to pick up an order that we still have to wait another 15 minutes for. The first few times I just thought they were running behind, but now that I realize this is their policy I'll find another diner to eat at.
