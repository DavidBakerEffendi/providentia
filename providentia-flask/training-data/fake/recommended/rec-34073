Just went to this place for the first time last night and loved it. Its pretty small and was packed on a tuesday night (no reservations so come in prepared for a wait.) But it was worth it! Had a good cocktail and wine list, and all the food was fresh and tasty. As a vegetarian (no fish either) I found plenty to eat. Loved the chopped vegetable quinoa salad, and the house made ricotta app was amazing too. Nice servers. Definitely a hipster spot, but for the decent prices and good sized, yummy portions, I definitely recommend it!
