It's OK.  I had the Bo Ssam (pork butt) last night, and it was sadly mediocre.  I've also had the pork buns and black beans.  I have to say, it's way overrated.  Pork is good-quality and perfectly tasty, but not a whole lot better than pernil at a good Dominican spot.   We also had kimchi and coleslaw, and again, nothing special.   Perfectly good, but no reason to pay these prices or EVER wait on any type of line.
