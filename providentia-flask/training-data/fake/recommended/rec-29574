One of my favorite byob's in Philadelphia. Great Italian food.  Everything is fresh and tastes great.  Versatile place to take a date or just friends.  Fairly priced for what you receive as well. I just have to note that wait time to get inside unfortunately can take a while at times so bring some extra wine :]
