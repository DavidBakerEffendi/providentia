This is an amazing thai restaurant. Good prices, and very tasty food. The service is also top notch. The small establishment treats every one of their customers extremely well. You always have the option of making any dish "spicy" .. so this is a HUGE plus. The tofu soup and spicy flat noodle are my favorite. HIGHLY suggest :] I live close by so it is never a problem to pickup , They do not deliver though.
