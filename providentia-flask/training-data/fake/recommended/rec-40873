I have loved this place since first visit. The food is amazing. I love the unique pairings, they amplify the flavor of each dish. I first Â tried the popular lobster roll, and I loved it! Since then I've been bouncing around the menu trying different things. There hasn't been anything I haven't liked- actually, I love it all. I definitely recommend coming here and trying something new. Great quality delicious food!!
