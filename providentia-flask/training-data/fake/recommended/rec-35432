Thank you yelpers for a great great great find. I spent the weekend in NYC with some girlfriends, eating our way across town. One stop on our wishlist was for some traditional japanese ramen. After reading so many great reviews I HAD to try this place. Alot of the complaints on here seem to be from people that were expecting clear pho style broth, because the real deal japanese ramen is thick, oily and hearty. This place delivers and had me stuffing myself so full of their wonderful brothy ambrosia. I had the toroniku ramen, which was a mass of tasty noodles, fatty pork and cabbage, with egg, bamboo, mushrooms, and more. The shrimp goyoza are so wonderful here also, not that you really have need for an appetizer with the amount of ramen you get in an order. So great. So so sooooo great.
