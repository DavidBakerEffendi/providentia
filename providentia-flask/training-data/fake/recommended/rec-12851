We get to the Meatball Shop today and as it's in my hood and amazing, I don't know how many good things I want to say about this place (and trust me there are plenty) because you will all converge on my 'hood and then getting in to eat a meatball will be a challenge.  However, I will not be selfish and tell you RUN, don't walk to this place.  The meatballs are AMAZING, the ice cream sandwiches are DEVINE, and the staff is more then willing to help.  Special kudos to Michael, the boss, who always has a smile on his face which radiates to all those enjoying their meal.  Enjoy but please save some for the rest of us :-).
