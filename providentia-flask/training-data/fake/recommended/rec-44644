Amazing, amazing, amazing. I sipped a crisp Lady Orchid, then indulged in a large, satisfying kale salad and lamb meatballs - two sides but plenty for dinner. The ambiance is dark, romantic and classy. Definitely bring a date here, one you like because it's pricey. I can't wait to go back and try other menu items but it'll be hard to resist the kale and meatballs again!
