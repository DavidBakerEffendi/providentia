If you want mediocre South Indian food, this is the place to visit. The menu has an extensive list of dosas - many of them you won't find in a traditional South Indian restaurant. The dosas are served with two chutneys and a sambar. The sambar was, and I am being generous here, somewhat stale - not sure when it was made. The brown/yellowish chutney was lacking any taste. The coconut chutney, thankfully, was a bit fresh and helped in washing down the dosa. We had a masala vada, which took ages to show up. At the end, it was kind of raw and uncooked. The Sambar vada, well it never came. I can only guess how it might have tasted. The service, besides the gentleman that brought water, was spotty at best. It was a Saturday night and some chaos is possible. This was unacceptable. Overall, go here if you run out of choices. Personally, I will look for more options.
