A friend and I took a chance on this place after reading their menu one night.  I'm so happy we did!  The mussels are to die for and I LOVE BELGIAN BEER!  There's no shortage of beer here, the list is endless.  Our waiter Ken was patient and very helpful. I can't wait to go back and eat/drink more.
