Ode to Saraghina, how I love thee...thank the goodness I can walk there and feast on fantastic thin rustic italian pizza, mellow out over the house red, gaze at the hipster italians who run the joint, and savor the papardelle...delicious. If you can make it to dessert (we usually are too greedy to get there), the tiramisu is pretty phenomenal too. Brunch is simple...to get the full experience go for dinner and stay a while.
