We found Cafe La Maude through one of those deal sites and I wish we had found it sooner. It is a small cafe nestled in Northern Liberties, next to Honey's. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the owner and were offered coffee and tea. The menu is small but definitely bursting with flavor. The halloumi press, the crevette, and the fatoush are our staples. We get them every time we go. and their coffee....well that is a different story. Their coffee is truly addicting. I wake up craving it and always take a cup to go. We have been to the cafe so many times that the owner's know us and we Â love chit chatting with them. They even offer to hold our son and keep him occupied so we can enjoy our meal. I love coming here and the girls know our order and treat us like friends. If you want a good meal with good ambience and away from the hustle and bustle of the city this is the place to go! We are moving to Canada in a few weeks and I am so sad to go, who will satisfy my coffee cravings if Cafe La Maude isn't around?!?!
