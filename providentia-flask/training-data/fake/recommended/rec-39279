Don't listen to the haters. OK if you're looking for fancy Italian food, or even food you would want to find in the North End of Boston or Little Italy, you're not going to find it here.  Even though it's in the Burlington area, it's still Vermont.  But, what Papa F does, he does well.  That's big portions of Italian comfort food.  Comparing Papa F to Trattoria or Three Tomatoes is apples and oranges -- they're fundamentally different.   I would recommend any of the usual suspects...pizza, pasta and meatballs, lasagna, manicotti, etc. etc.  Also garlic bread (with or without cheese) is a must.   If you want to push culinary boundaries, Vermont and Papa F is probably not your scene.  If you just want decent portions of good food, definitely give it a visit.
