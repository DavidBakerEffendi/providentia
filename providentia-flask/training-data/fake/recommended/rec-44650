This busy (but not crazy cramped) greek-inspired spot is incredibly popular on the weekends. The food in my opinion is good, not great. However it's reasonably priced for what you get and it'll do most people just fine. Based on all of the reviews / crowd I was expecting more. However, I'm certainly not complaining. We had a nice time and everyone enjoyed their meal. There are several vegetarian options as well.
