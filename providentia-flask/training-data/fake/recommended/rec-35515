I didn't want to give this place a review because I wanted to keep this place a hidden secret but the owner and the staff are so awesome that I want to see them succeed and stay in business!  The pizza is unbelievable!  The bartenders are so much to sit and chat with.  They are all super nice and make some fantastic tasting beverages.  My favorite pizza is Vinegar Hill... it really is everything my taste buds desire!  Tonight I added mushrooms to it and things got unreal.  Please don't ever change what your doing because this place is perfect in every way!  My fiance is vegan and she is able to eat whatever she likes here.  This place even has vegan Italian sausage and Daiya cheese (VEGAN)!   Thank you for being awesome!
