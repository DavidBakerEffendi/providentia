I have heard the legend of these fries many times over and was expecting big things. But to me (and I realize I am perhaps very alone in saying this)- they were fat greasy fries akin to those sold in an elementary school cafeteria. Hasn't anyone experience the glory of hand cut french fries with a bit of the skin still on them? These were just your average pre-processed, most likely formerly frozen fries. And the sauce- here I really don't understand the buzz. It's essentially salad dressing. All I'm saying is, I wish I was drunk, because maybe then I would have seen what the rest of the world is raving about.
