To be honest, I was quite disappointed. Maybe because of all the good reviews, I anticipated a lot, only to be disappointed. I made reservations for 2 on a Sunday night, and they were really nice calling me twice to confirm and everything and even emailed me their current menu. Actually that night was full, but it was not packed. So we had the strawberry glazed ribs, nothing to awe about, the meat inside had no taste at all and it was a bit dry. Then we had the pork belly, which was nothing spectacular either, it only taste good because it was pork belly but without the fat, it tasted like dry meat once again. The lobster risotto was the only thing I believed that was on point, but I believe the cheese did its job. Then the shrimp... honestly it taste a bit like sweet and sour shrimp from a Chinese restaurant to me. I brought my friend there thinking to show her my good taste, I only did the opposite, I really do not understand the hype over this restaurant. For the price I pay is ok, but to go all the way to Williamsburg just for this, never again.
