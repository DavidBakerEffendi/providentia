People walking in here should expect Mexican food, and that is what you get, plain and simple. On the inside, the restaurant is an amalgamation of whatever the owners could find in a mexican yard sale. Its aged, but quaint, and quite clean despite all the second and third hand furniture. Drinks are served in 16 oz. Solo cups and the food comes on plain round dinner plates. The meal starts out with home-fried tortilla chips and a pasty salsa, which is nothing to write home about, but was handily devoured by two people in 5 minutes. The tabasco sauce bottles on the tables had obviously seen years of refills. The food is exactly what you should expect. Entrees largely consist of combinations of a cooked dish accompanied by rice and a choice of beans. Plain old-fashioned mexican food, nothing special. And for what it is, its a good price, a lot of food, and it consistently comes well-cooked. Service was unattentive at best, but kind and competent when they did attend our table, and on a weekday night only two people were waiting and serving the restaurant which can seat maybe 40-50. Overall this place is good for a relaxed mexican meal when youre really hungry and not looking for fancy dishes or gimmicky atmosphere.
