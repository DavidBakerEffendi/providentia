The food here is pretty good. Got the nachos as an appetizer and it was awesome. The good thing is each chip has all the toppings. This means less chips but saves you from having to just eat a plain chip. I actually ordered the chicken pot pie which was okay. The ingredients seemed pretty fresh but nothing that was super amazing and not something I would probably order again. This was during one of the snowy days so I thought it would awesome, but it was just okay. My friend ordered a sandwich which came with fries. I can't speak for the sandwich, but for the fries are delicious and I love me some fries. We also ordered the apple pie for desert. The ice cream went very well with the apple pie, but the apple pie itself was nothing special. To me it taste and was about the size of an apple pie from McDonalds.
