Love El Vez, especially for apps and drinks at the bar after work. As other reviews have stated, walking in with no reservation will get you no where most days, as the place is always bumping. My favs are the grilled corn on the cob, the chicken fajitas and chipotle tacos, although sometimes the fajita with the chipotle can be soggy. The staff is friendly, the ambiance is great and the location is prime. The scene is mostly late 20's and 30's which is nice. Have yet to be disappointed.
