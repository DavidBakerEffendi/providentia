Apparently, when you go for lunch, in addition to whatever you order, you're allowed unlimited hard boiled eggs, pickled veggies and unlimited white rice. PLUS, their lunch menu ranges from $6-$18 (the lone sashimi dish) so you know you don't have to rely on ghetto $2.50 Mamoun's and $1.00 2 Bro's lunches. You can class it up a little. Also peeped their dinner which was a bit confusing. We were too late to hit the tasting menu ($50pp) and instead went alacarte and somehow managed to exceed $50pp. I blame the sake. Speaking about sake, lunch: $4 house sake special! woot woot. That's the sound of the police.
