My girlfriend and I were in Brooklyn for a date activity, and after we were STARVING! We came to Dinosaur Barbecue and were far from disappointed. My gf got a chicken sandwich and I ordered a burger. I ordered my burger well done, and  it came back undercooked. I was about to be very disappointed, until I was able to send it back and get it redone. On top of that, the manager came over and told me they were taking my burger off the bill! What good customer service! The burger was amazing; the fries very crispy; the Mac and cheese was full of flavor.  I would definitely come back to this place in the future and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for authentic and delicious BBQ.
