I came here twice with a few friends. FYI: this is the best restaurant on the island! Food: The wings and the ribs were incredible. I like it saucy and they were tender and saucy. The jambalaya was great but I've never had it before so I dont have anything to compare it too! The service: pretty standard, nothing extraordinary! Overall: The atmosphere is very lively and has this great up beat feeling in the air. Decor has some items that pay homage to mardigras and jazz. Overall: I would come back here whenever I'm on the Island for the food! *They have a back patio that can be used in the summer time.
