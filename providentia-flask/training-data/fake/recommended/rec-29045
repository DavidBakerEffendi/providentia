The name "Fat Salmon" alone made me like this place. I'm a fan of restaurants that put effort into ambiance and Fat Salmon goes above and beyond the calling. The blue lighting of the restaurant gives the semblance of a swanky cocktail lounge amidst historic Philadelphia. BUT the sensory delights don't stop at lighting. The sushi is the star. And the selection is fantastic! So many unique rolls to choose from, and a great collection of spicy ones. You are sure to find something you like or simply have the chance to expand your palette. Very reasonably priced, casual, great service, and soooo delicious!
