Yes Round 2 it is and I was just here 3 days ago...I came back for the Chicken Sandwich with chipotle aioli (flavored mayo) and OMG....the seasoning and how it's fried to perfection with the nice touch of the sauce was amazing!!  Not greasy at all.  I enjoyed every bite!  This is a must have!!  It's that awesome!   My husband and I split our sandwiches and he had the Mexicano Burger.  It was just as delicious but to be honest I was so happy to order the chicken sandwich!   And of course I had the fries....love love love those with the truffle sauce! And I forgot to add in my last review.  Spread the truffle sauce if you decide to order a Filipino Burger with sautéed onions.  Again a nice touch! I will definitely come back because Chef Jerome mentioned a possible Korean Style Burger is in the works....you know I will be there to try it!
