So went to Matt and Marie's for the first time today at a recommendation by a friend. Totally worth the time and parking cost. I was torn between the Nana's Tuna sandwich and the Peita Pastrami. Ended up going with the Peita Pastrami and didn't regret it. Potentially the best pastrami sandwich I've ever had. Sat down and ate it in house on the large table. Friendly staff. Also got the Capri sandwich for my wife. Â If you're in the area and need something quickly, this is the place to go.
