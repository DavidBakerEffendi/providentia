Great breakfast place! Very cute (french bistro-ish decor), grrrrrreat coffee, simple yet delicious breakfast, & good service.. If you get their early enough, they have newspapers (including NY Times) for free for you to take & read.. Their price is little bit too pricy for me but, I highly recommend if you want to have a nice serene breakfast or early morning date / meeting..
