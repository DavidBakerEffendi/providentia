We love the diner!  We are regulars here and even a place you frequent often has bad days except this place.  The food is constantly delicious, the drinks are creative and the entire staff are always professional and welcoming.  Chef Amanda is always smiling and Todd manages to pull off a fun vibrant atmosphere every time we go!  Keep up the good work Empire Diner, we are so happy to have you in the neighborhood.
