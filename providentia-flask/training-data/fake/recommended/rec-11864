Super friendly waitress. The bartender did not seem very professional though and that's probably due to her young age. Has outdoor seating. Burgers are decent. Served on a sesame bun that's thick enough to hold up the juices of the burger. No one wants a soggy bun! The patty itself is pretty juicy but not Â very beefy tasting. The cheddar cheese seemed to disappear into the burger and I barely tasted it. However, the fries are cooked to perfection. Not sure if I would go back.
