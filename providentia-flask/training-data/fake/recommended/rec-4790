Overall food was good. Ambiance good. Cute and cozy. Wait was very very long... Took about 30 min to place an order and get bread. Another 45min before we got our appetizer. Another 45min for the main course. I don't recommend it if you have another plan for the evening. If you are planning to just chill and spend 3.5 hours dining, it's a nice place to hang out. BYOB is also great for that. Their complementary French bread w garlic oil is amazing. Â  Cioppino is great. It's a must. Snapper (whole fish) also delicious. Mushroom salad. Very tasty. Tuna tar tar. Highly recommend this. Seafood chowder. It's ok. Nothing special. FYI: cash only.
