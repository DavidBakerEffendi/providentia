What a little gem of a café.  I will agree with the other reviewers regarding the rotisserie chicken sandwich as it was simply delicious.  It is one of the best sandwiches that I've ever eaten.  The fries that a friend had ordered, however, were over-salted.   The look and ambiance of the place reminded me of this coffeehouse that I used to frequent in Saratoga while in college.  If I lived closer, I'd probably spend a lot of time here reading and people watching.  Cheers for the nice experience!
