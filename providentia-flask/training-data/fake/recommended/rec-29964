Went to The Malt House for drinks and dinner a few Saturdays ago with friends and family and had a great time. Location is right in the heart of TriBeca and easy to get to. Â We started with a variety of American specialty beers (great choices) and hung out by the bar which was pleasant with plenty of room to either sit or stand around. The staff were attentive and very friendly and the decor was very 'tavern-like' and comfortable. We moved into the dining room and were waited on promptly. We ordered a bunch of starters for the table including artichoke with chips (I'm not usually a fan of artichoke) but this was good. Guacamole and chips were also very authentic (wasn't expecting that in a tavern!). For the main course I ordered the braised beef which was amazing (tender and tasty). My girlfriend ordered the ribs which came with corn bread and cold slaw, she really enjoyed them and my cousin ordered mussels which she said were great too. Will definitely go back and would recommend it to others.
