My wife and I went to sparsely populated Agno late on Saturday night around 9pm.  It has a nice atmosphere - I don't know why people were not eating there.   I ordered the suggested gluten free falafel wrap and my ordered the suggested meat plate option.  Everything had a tasty strong flavor.  I especially enjoyed the beets and cauliflower.  Agno's falafel is not as good as some food trucks (which I think 16th and JFK makes the best in the city), but I'm sure it was probably healthier.  I was grateful they had a cold herbal ice tea without caffeine.  I found the staff more than helpful.  Also, I tried the baklava and it has a twist.  It's made on shortbread with plenty of pistachio power!  You can taste the nuts - yum!  It's worth the $3 for it's interesting twist on traditional baklava.
