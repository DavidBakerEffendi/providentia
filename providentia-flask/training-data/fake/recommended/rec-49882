This place is like eating at your best friends house when you were in middle school. The woman who runs this place is incredibly nice and makes all of the food herself. She runs the place herself and serves everything on what looks like my moms dinner plates. We ordered chicken salad sandwiches, they were extremely fresh and very good. I had a strawberry smoothie which was okay, and he had turkish tea which he liked and we finished off with baklava and chocolate chip cheese cake. The baklava is my only complaint, traditional baklava is made with pistachios, not walnuts, however I do understand that its ridiculously expensive to make it with pistachios, so it makes sense. All in all this place was a good stop for lunch, and I would come back.
