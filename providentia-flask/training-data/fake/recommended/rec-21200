In short, my wife and me's favorite restaurant in NYC for the money. We've done all the Michelin Star places, and some are exceptional like 11 Madison, but we are amazed at how reasonable the check is every time with the amazing food, service, unique drinks and - lets face it - something cool about being "secret". If Bohemian were a boxer, it would Roy Jones Jr during his heyday of being the best pound-for-pound fighter out there. We've tried a bunch of the dishes, but have pretty much settled into a "routine" of the veggie fondue, Â beef tataki, mac & cheese, branzino fish, whatever is the fattiest/tastiest beef of the day, finished off by the panna cotta. We've probably been over 10 times, and it never gets old. Our only feedback - the chairs are pretty uncomfortable, so we recommend a seat the bar - very intimate and fun to watch them make interesting drinks.
