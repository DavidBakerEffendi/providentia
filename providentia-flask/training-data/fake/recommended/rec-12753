2am in the morning and hungry?? My boyfriend and I were searching on yelp and came across Coppelia, read the reviews and had to come try it. I was sold on the Lomo Saltado especially with all the reviews and my boyfriend ordered the Cubano. The Lomo Saltado here is definitely the most flavorful one I have ever had. The short ribs were super tender, melt in your mouth good. It was a bit salty for my liking though but still delicious. The Cubano was okay only because I am not a huge fan but my boyfriend found it pretty good. The meat was tender and definitely full of flavor, we also had the yucca fries with it which was my first time trying it. So what do I recommend? The Lomo Saltado thats for sure... oh and check in on yelp and you can get a free drink!
