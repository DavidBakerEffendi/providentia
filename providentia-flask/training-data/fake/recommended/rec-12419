First time coming here and I probably wont be back. Its a very outdated diner and pretty small. I ordered a turkey cheeseburger with cheese fries and gravy. When I eat a meal like that with all those calories, I want it to be good and it just wasn't. I felt like it was very bland. Service was a bit slow also. With so many great diners in the area, I wont be coming back to this one.
