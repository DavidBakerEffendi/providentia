I had a mixed experience at this place. When we got there it was happy hour so we sat at the bar and had a few apps. Everything was great. The drinks, the food, and the service. After we had a few drinks we went upstairs to have dinner. I ordered the New York strip and it was dry and did not have much flavor. I did not enjoy it all all, nor did I like the service. I will be back for happy hour at the bar, but never again for dinner.
