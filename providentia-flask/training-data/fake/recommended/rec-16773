Had dinner here on a Thursday evening. Yelp map had it south of where it really is. Order the Fat Boy and Scorpion roll started with an order of fried santons. Everything was really well made even the fried wontons. These were very good sized rolls with quality ingredients. They were cut a bit big due to being big rolls but I managed to get them in my mouth. The miso soup was very good as well. The two of us with fried wontons, two miso soups and three specialty rolls walked out for about $65 including the tip.
