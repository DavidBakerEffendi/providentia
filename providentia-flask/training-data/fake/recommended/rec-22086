Ok, so the reason I'm writing this review is the balance out the other reviews which I think are way over generous, technically this place should get about 2.5-3 stars mostly for the good service. But I just think more people should know this is not the fabulous spot it is made out to be on yelp. What's good about this place? 1. The service is really good. waiters were nice and friendly. 2. Oysters are a good deal, and seemed fresh enough. What's bad? 1. The food! We had ordered an assortment of 'tapas' which were all very sub par and very overpriced - the Porkbelly croquets had little shavings of meat in them, barely one tiny bit of meat a piece, and mostly consisted of potatoes. They were not good, just tasted like big deep fried lumps of starch with no meat. Owner stinginess? who knows. 2. More bad food- the Steak Tartar was a whopping $14 and basically wasn't real steak tarter. We were served a tiny pile of half cooked pieces of beef. With two sad pieces of toast. 3. More bad food - Endive Salad - Just tasted like a random array of greens with some type of tasteless crunchy substance. Also overprices for what it was and not tasty at all. 4. Butternut squash - was the only item that tasted ok, but was also extremely oily. Nothing to write home about. The check came out to be around 90$ for a really unsatisfying and sub par meal. Don't be mislead by all these gushing reviews, Maybe the owner is getting friends to do them, not sure, but I'm 100% not coming back to St. Austere.
