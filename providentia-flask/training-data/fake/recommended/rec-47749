Got the traditional cold cuts. It's got pate and a few different types of ham in it. I got it with just a tiny bit of spiciness. It's really good. Coming from Westminster's little Saigon in California, this sandwich is really awesome served hot. A little pricier than California but hey it's New York right? Just make sure you eat it while the bread is still hot so you get the right texture in your mouth. Also got the spring rolls to try. Pretty standardly delicious as well.
