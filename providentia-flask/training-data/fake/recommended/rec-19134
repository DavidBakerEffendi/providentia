After my first visit to the Original Pancake House (yesterday), I've been devising scenarios in my mind which would result in a trip back to this holy grail of breakfast foods. "Honey, why don't you invite your parents over this weekend... and we could go to the Pancake House in West Caldwell!" That's right, I'd even endure the in-laws for some of what the OPH has to offer. Unfortunately, I wasn't super-hungry on my first trip and only got to sample the "49er" pancakes (which are 3 deliciously plate-sized crepe-style pancakes) and a side of bacon. Crack-bacon. Get it and you'll understand. Oh how I'm still thinking of that bacon. And everything else I saw at other tables but didn't get to try: the mammoth baked apple pancake, whose owner did the sign of the cross before tackling; the Dutch Baby, whose name alone made me want to order it; and their homemade corned beef hash. Original Pancake House, I will be back. And I will be hungry. Disclaimer: The place is busy on weekends. Like "we're giving away free cheese" busy. But the wait goes surprisingly quick. Also, I do actually enjoy my in-laws but that doesn't sound as funny. And yes, this place is in NJ.
