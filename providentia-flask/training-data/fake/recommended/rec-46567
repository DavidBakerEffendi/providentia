I would say that it is the best authentic falafel place in Philly! For my New Yorkers, it's similar to infamous Naomi's pizza of NY :O yes I said it! For my people in Philly, Â if you love this place, check out Naomi's pizza ( falafel place too) in queens!!! This place is a little bit small but worth every penny. Great selections of sides as well as portion! I believe this place is cash only!
