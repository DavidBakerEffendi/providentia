Good, not exceptional seafood.  This is graded on a curve, since we're in Princeton which is strangely a culinary apocalypse.   Blue Point serves solid, fresh seafood.  They're not particularly adept at cooking, so go for the raw dishes, although there are a few standouts. Service is fine and quite polite and even cool.  Blue Point Grill focuses on oysters, and even have a cool "tasting menu" of 18 oysters.  You can watch them shuck the oysters at a little raw bar.  The oysters are served with cocktail sauce and an interesting sweet salsa type sauce. Most of the grilled fish dishes are slathered in olive oil or served in a cheap-Italian restaurant sauce.  Best bet on this front is to go for the whole branzino which they have shipped in fresh each day.  You can't go wrong with that.  I had King Salmon which was overcooked and dry as a bone! Best item is probably the grilled Portuguese octopus.  This is very tender and cooked expertly, surprisingly.  It's served in olive oil, but I guess that's the Mediterranean thing. This place gets packed with older locals.  It's BYOB, however, there's a liquor store a couple stores down.
