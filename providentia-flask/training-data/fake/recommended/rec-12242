I used to live in town, and walked past this place all the time. When it first opened I would take out from them occasionally. I found the quality and portions of their sashimi to be excellent. I really had no complaints. Don't expect any ambiance. It is what it is. You come get your food and go home. But places like this can really screw the pooch when they fail on the customer service side of things. I was raving about this place to my fellow Yelper and we decided to give it a whirl. It's been a few years since that last time. The woman at the counter was horrible. I mean downright nasty. I'm not sure if I reminded her of the guy who ran over her dog that morning, but I didn't even get two words out before I felt like she was going to call the cops on me for trespassing. I asked if they had a few specific items, which they did not, and she was none too pleased to even let me know so. Then the owner came out - who is also the sushi chef - and I asked him if he still had spicy tuna sashimi. In other words, just spicy tuna in a dish, no rice, etc. With a look of disdain, he asked, "How much money are you going to spend?" My response, "Not a fucking dollar here." And I never will. Not ever again. I don't care if they were giving away toro all day long, I wouldn't darken their doorstep. In a town where you can trip walking out the door of a sushi place and land in a chair at another one across the street, you'd think they'd be a little nicer. Oh well.
