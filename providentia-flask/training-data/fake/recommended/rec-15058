And I now have a new superhuman power after eating my first meal at Han Dynasty, being able to breath fire! I don't consider myself very good with spicy meals, but I went in warned. And I ended up loving everything. My date and I shared the wontons in chili oil, the cumin lamb and a special soft shell crab dish I'd read about in another review. The wontons were airy and delicious, the lamb was cut very thin and was especially tender. I didn't notice until eating my leftovers just how many pepper seeds were throughout the dish. No wonder it had so much heat. The softshell crab was like walking into an Asian market. An almost overpowering scent that was especially unique. I'd suggest bringing wine as that helped combat the heat. As far as the service we encountered a very nice host who got us seated quickly. And our server was able to accommodate our requests for making things a little less spicy. I don't think I would have been able to handle much more. I just finished the leftovers and can't stop thinking about more.
