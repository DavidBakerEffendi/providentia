It seems that the servers at this East Village spot are more interested in looking good than knowing how to serve food. The menu is fairly simple, and they do not allow substitutions for many of their dishes (even for a simple omelet, they would not use a different cheese). I understand that some dishes are carefully prepared, and ingredients are carefully chosen to create a specific taste and dish, but with a regular ol' omelet, I was pretty surprised. I also ordered a side of bacon with my breakfast, and it was not until the food came to the table that I realized the dish already came with bacon. It would seem only logical that a good server would bring this to my attention upon ordering, rather than making me pay additional money for something that was included. Still, hoards of people wait outside for their brunch on weekends, and the burgers are pretty decent. Not necessarily worth a wait.
