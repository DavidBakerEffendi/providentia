Came here on Friday night for dinner and drinks. After walking in and seeing the massive crowd at the bar I was overwhelmed thinking of even trying to eat in here.  The hostess, who was so friendly, helped me and my group of 4 through the crowds and brought us to a nice quiet table upstairs (perfect!!).  Our waitress came over the minute we sat down and took our drink orders right away (GREAT SERVICE!).  We placed our orders and let me tell you I am so glad we overlooked the crowd to come here.  The bangers and mash were AMAZING and my friend's shepard's pie looked mouth watering!  Even the boring old salad my other friend got looked and tasted amazing!  Great food, great service, strong tastey drinks! You can't ask for anything else out of a place! And the free post card was a nice extra to get with the bill! A great reminder for me to come back here another time!
