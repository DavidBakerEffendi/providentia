i love going to a restaurant and knowing that i'm going to love anything i order that night for dinner.  i've been to the pines a handful of times since they opened, and always walk out thinking that that  meal was my favorite...every single time! but, what makes it always my favorite meal is that the space is chill, crowd is relaxed and the service is friendly.  it's like being at a very fun and interesting friend's dinner party.  everyone's there to have a nice evening, so there's this great buzz in the air.   stand out plates:  foie, chanterelle, cavatelli, and pork shoulder stand out cocktails:  the pines and the uncle buck can't wait to go back!
