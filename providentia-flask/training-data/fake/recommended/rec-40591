This is definitely the sandwich that could topped die- hard fans of cheesesteaks. Its location in the Reading Terminal Market made it all more convenient along with other great eateries. The overstuffed Roasted Pork with broccoli rabe made this a ultimate combination in a fantastic roll (almost a foot long if I'm not mistaken). Juicy roasted pork in itself would be hog heaven, but on a roll with broccoli rabe it's even better. Long lines should not be a deterrent, but a chance to enjoy the very efficient staff who gets the orders done fast & correctly and lines moving quickly. So impressed with the roasted pork w/broccoli rabe, I return again the following day. This time the Beef Brisket was in order with provolone was even better. Being Sunday, the Reading Terminal Market was not as hectic as was Saturday, as most Amish takes Sunday off.
