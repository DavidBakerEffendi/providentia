Great speakeasy like atmosphere. Amazing drinks and very friendly staff. Usually a wait and have only been here after work a couple times but all the drinks I have had are delicious. The food is okay, a bit pricey but you really come here for the drinks. Cool upstairs decor also known as the "Parlor". Definitely cool to sit at the bar and watch the bartenders make all the drinks. I like this place but don't come often as it is expensive cocktails.
