Taking your chances.  The management seems inept and the staff appears to be  struggling to keep up. Great place if you like long lines and undercooked food.  Today, I had soggy half-frozen fries and an undercooked turkey burger, after waiting 25 minutes to order and checkout.   A few bites and it was in the garbage. Unfortunately, it is very convenient to me and I always find myself going there because it is easy.   80% of the time it works out.  But when it doesn't  work out it can be horrible. The salad station is the best thing in the whole place.   They have kale as a choice, a wide selection and the portions are good.   The employees are also nice, but the place is always understaffed during the lunch rush.  It's an easy fix for the management - just spend a few bucks and have more people there during lunch when you are busy!
