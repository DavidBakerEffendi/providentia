I've lived in Glastonbury my whole life and quite honestly the food is meh over greasy everything... but the service is the absolute worst. I've given them countless chances for them to get it together but it's the owners and the people that run it that completely ruin this place. First story: The waitress was complete unprofessional where she was complaining about how much of a "shithead" her husband is... the cook/owner. Keep that stuff to yourself I'm trying to enjoy my lunch. Second story: Placed a to go order, left on hold for no lie 25 minutes where the Aunt (lady answering the phone) was talking about life and the weather while I waited... she didn't realize she was completely clueless and just left me hanging... Alright fine, said sorry... kept this in the back of my mind. Third and FINAL story: I placed an order for 3 things. One being an EGGPLANT parmesan panini as my sister has been vegetarian for countless years. I would have never ordered chicken as she's vegetarian. I even wrote down what I was ordering confirming EGGPLANT parmesan. Well, we get back and it's CHICKEN parmesan. Well ok, mistakes happen. Let me give Pazzos a call.... Just to hear the Aunt (the women answering the phone) tell me well it was ordered as a CHICKEN parm... well no, I would have never ordered that. It gets better...Literally asked me if there was anything else in my order with no meat... then Â SHE TOLD ME TO TAKE THE CHICKEN OFF MY SALAD AND FEED IT TO MY SISTER. Well I mean that's my lunch though. This lady needs to go... Pazzos would be so much better without this family circus causing nonsense. Three strikes and you are out PAZZOS. Close up shop so a more decent restaurant can take your place. You all need a lesson in customer service... It's not like I purposely placed a hair in my food or am trying to get anything out of this but they are so rude and unprofessional and they just don't get it.
