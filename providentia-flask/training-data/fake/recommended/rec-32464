Came here around 8:30pm on a weeknight---only one other party was there and they were just finishing up their meal. I felt kinda bad that we were keeping the kitchen open, just for us...but the staff didn't seem to mind! thanks! We ordered a combination--the works type pizza--forget what it was called exactly, but it was really good! The cut the pie in a certain way, so that the inside pieces are crustless if you so prefer which i thought was great! I also got a small salad to munch on while we waited for the pizza to cook, and it was fresh and good! I really hope this place gets more business during lunch hours because it deserves it! Quality pizza, good service, and a comfortable atmosphere to eat! Its down the street from me so i'd definitely come back!
