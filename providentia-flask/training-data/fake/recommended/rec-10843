Nicolette! Nicolette! Nicolette! Walking up to your restaurant, with a group of 4 in front of us, we overheard the hostess tell them "1 hour". We had just left our shopping cart double parked in Fairway and were hoping to sneak in some crab and a few beers. Our hearts sank...but our stomachs persisted. We lingered for a moment, then an angel of mercy wafted by, and said, "The bar upstairs is open, go on up, I'll tell them you're coming!" We bolted up the stairs, the 2nd floor hostess greeted us, and in we went. Our waitress was very attentive (name forgotten, sorry, cool eyeliner chick!) The angel drifted by twice more, just to see how we were doing... On the way out, we asked the ground floor hostess her name... "Nicolette...." she said. Nicolette makes it happen! Oh yeah, the crab legs were awesome. We ordered potatoes and broccoli as sides, but after having delicious fried oysters, we could only taste the non-meat items and push them aside to make room for crab, butter, and lemon, in that order. Go here. You'll like it!
