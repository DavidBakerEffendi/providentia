My wife and I had lunch out on the patio to take advantage of a lovely warm autumn day. The newly renovated patio is beautiful, so that was definitely a highlight of our meal. Unfortunately we were disappointed with our food. The menu seems to revamped in an upscale direction -- we've been to Tap Room before for beers back when they used to give out free popcorn. All the salads seemed very impressive. I chose the cranberry chicken and my wife the beet salad. They were about 12$ each. We were offered some complimentary buns with a tasty garlic-pepper olive oil. We devoured them. When the salads came, we both found the quality of lettuces and greens to be wanting. I had to pick away some of the leaves that had wilted and were turning to green mush. The salads were large and filling, but mid to low quality ingredients and lack of attention to balance made them much less impressive than the menu suggests. We will not order salads from the Tap Room again. Though it was enjoyable to sit outside some extra time, it did take the server quite a while to give us our bill and we did have to ask twice. The service was fine, but a little more attentiveness would have been appreciated. I think the Tap Room has some ways to go to arrive at gastro-pub from pub.
