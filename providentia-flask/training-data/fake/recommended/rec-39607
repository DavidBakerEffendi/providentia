Decent, nothing to go out of your way for. If you happen to be in West Chelsea and crave for cheaper food than normal Chelsea offers, then this fits the bill. Otherwise, there are plenty of home made food for similar price. Came here after all the raving Yelp review but do not know what the hype is.
