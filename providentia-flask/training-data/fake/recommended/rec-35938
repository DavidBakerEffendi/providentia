New York City is an incredibly small town. I was on my way to my favorite restaurant one weekend when I stumbled upon B4. We perused the menu and, although we found it interesting, we continued on our way. Fast forward a few weeks, and a friend of ours was having a party there. Appetizers (B4's) - Sesame Seared Ahi Tuna Nachos w/ Napa Slaw & Wasabi Mayo - I was incredibly excited about this based on prior experiences at other restaurants. Sadly, it really let me down at B4. The ahi tuna was on a greasy wonton-like nacho...definitely not a nacho. Also, the slaw is more like garnish. Entrees (During-s) - Sage Roasted Chicken on Popcorn Polenta & Rhubarb Chutney - The chicken was insipid. I needed the chutney to flavor the chicken, but there was not enough chutney to do the job. Perhaps the chicken skin had the flavor, but I don't eat chicken skin, just the meat. The polenta was lacking in flavor as well, big let down. The star here was the chutney, and with protein driving up the price of the plate that's not good. (Drink-s) - Blackberry Mojito - I love mojitos, and I can truly appreciate a well done mojito. At B4, they give it a spin and put blackberry in it. I especially loved the mint leaves and 2 blackberries they put in it. The two ingredients gave the drink a lovely sweet aftertaste and added a nice hint of fruit. I loved the cocktail, and frankly that drink got me through the evenings menu. Heads up: My girlfriend ordered the Seared Salmon w/ Israeli Couscous & Feta Salad. Her salmon was cooked well, and the serving size was acceptable. The problem was that they gave her probably a table spoon of couscous and the salad never showed up....unless the garnish on her salmon was the salad. Bottom Line: Skip this place.
