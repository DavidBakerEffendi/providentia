Ardesia is a larger than average, brighter than average wine bar in an emptier than average part of town. All of the features I'm beginning to appreciate. Unlike most wine bars which compete on dim lighting, coziness, tapas (all the date enhancing features), Ardesia stands out with the basic essentials of a wine bar - interesting wine list, diverse food complements and stellar service. The chic, modern hall like setting definitely befits a friday night occasion. We first sat down on the cushioned benches inside. The initial order for the four of us consisted of a bottle German riesling, grilled flank steak, pastrami sandwich, olives, shrimp skewers and chicken liver mousse. The hospitable waiter warned that the riesling we picked was dry as "sucking on a shark's tooth" as he held the bottle. Hah! That comment made us switch to a local riesling (Finger Lakes, NY). He later let us sample the forgone and I must say, it was as delicious as a shark's tooth can be! As two more joined, we moved the party al fresco. The intuitive waiter suggested a bubbly torrontez. Food additions were caramelized green beans, duck banh mi, and the abbey and oma cheeses. Overall, the food was good but not outstanding - the reason I took a star off. Perhaps this is one area the owners of the bar can improve on. Of the ones we tried, I would recommend the shrimp skewers, olives, chicken liver mousse and the cheeses. Both wines were well received. The waiter, unpretentious, took good care of the table. We had a good time. I will keep this place in mind for future hang outs. If you are interested in sampling the dry riesling, I believe it is called Tesch. Have fun checking it out.
