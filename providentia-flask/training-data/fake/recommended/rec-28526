Instant love . I can't help it..just instant love. Like when u meet that blind date in a restaurant and all the sudden you're like 'where have u been all my life?' Such Japanese perfection. So charming, exquisite, refined (except for the too loud and obnoxious white Americans :) the tea was spectacular, the decor gorgeous and the waitperson kind. Â I can't wait to clme back this week and try the smoked salmon and the matcha next!
