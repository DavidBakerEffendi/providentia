Wonderful dining experience. Chanced upon this little gem after a disastrous experience at Cuban Pete's restaurant across the street. Great service, delicious food. There were 11 of us and we all were quite satisfied with our respective meals. Even my picky 5-year-old asked for seconds. Will definitely be back.
