I was impressed!  The service was great and the food was delish!  We started with the wings and mac and cheese for appetizers.  The mac and cheese was AMAZING.  Since I ate a lot of appetizers, I only got a caesar salad which was ehhhh but serves me right for ordering a salad there.  I got grits on the side with it and they were also really good.  I would def go back.
