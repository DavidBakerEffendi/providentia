More like a 4.5.  I've been here 3 times and this is the average of all my trips. First off, these are best pancakes I ever had!!  They are what all pancakes aspire to be: warm, fluffy, perfectly golden-brown and irresistible.  Also, the biscuits are AMAZING!!! They're buttery and have the perfect texture. I think I'm addicted to them. The chicken and waffles are pretty good. I really liked the waffle, it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. However, I thought that the fried chicken was only alright.  I will probably give this dish another shot though. I also once ordered the Clinton Street burger but I didn't like it.  The bun was over-toasted and hard, and the burger lacked flavor.  That was the only time I was disappointed by my food here. Finally, the restaurant is tiny so be prepared for a long wait if you decide to go for brunch.  However, the small size creates an intimate and charming atmosphere that I really love. Pro tip: Go to Clinton St. for dinner to avoid the wait.  You get mini-biscuits at your table and can still order the pancakes!
