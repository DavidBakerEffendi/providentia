Rats! Really wanted to like this place. Love where it's situated down on the south side of Kent where's there's still some undeveloped old buildings. Decor is sparse with lots of wood and few, if any, accents. Could use a spec of color here and there but overall it's fairly warm and inviting. Eight microbrews on tap. The Cisco pale ale was delicious! Bartender and waitress were very friendly and did a nice job. Now the bad part ...Portions were tiny! The $12 baked oyster appetizer included six oysters containing microscopic little dots of the sea critters that altogether added up to maybe one bite total. An appetizer portion of clams included only five and it was overwhelmed with a carrots and celery. Not good. I had a burger which was delicious. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. My only gripe was the 5" diameter bun sort of swallowed the 4" diameter burger. Was left with a big chunk of tasty but forlorn, burgerless bun which was disappointing. No bread came with the meal which is okay I suppose but it was irritating when coupled with the small portions . Bottom line: we left hungry (and we're not big eaters). Too many good places in the 'burg that that also give you generous portions so probably won't go back to Grand Ferry. Maybe for a beer. Still, they just opened so maybe they'll consider customer feedback and improve things. Hope so.
