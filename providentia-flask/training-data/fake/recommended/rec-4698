Came here with a Groupon and was not disappointed. Coupon included 2 drinks and 2 apps. I ordered a top shelf martini and partner ordered wine. We picked for apps PEI mussels and Calamari, both delicious. I ordered the Tavern burger which was so large I could not finish it, partner ordered chicken which she enjoyed. Overall fantastic service by Allen, nice atmosphere and good food and drink. Good beer selection. We will be back.
