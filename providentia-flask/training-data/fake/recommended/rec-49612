The combination of the food and ambiance makes Riverpark a winner. We came here for brunch, and I was happy to have finally find a place that wasn't a mob scene and seated us immediately. I love being close to the water so I could not ask for a better view, overlooking the East River. The ambiance and noise level was perfect for a catch-up Sunday brunch. Food: I had the Ham and Cheese sandwich with fresh arugula, and my friend ordered the Pulled Pork Chilaquiles, a specialty at Riverpark. The arugula salad was fresh, but my sandwich, while perfectly portioned, wasn't remarkable. I found my friend's Pulled Pork to be too tangy for my taste. The dessert was the highlight of our meal: a warm caramel cake that wasn't too sweet or moist (highly recommended). All in all, I will be back because of its proximity to where I live and the view that makes me forget the hustle-and-bustle of Manhattan.
