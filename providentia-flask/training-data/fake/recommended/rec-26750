I must preface this review by stating that I am an Italian American. Even so, if your main items are meatballs, then, you better well make a pretty terrific meatball. We stopped here for some takeout meatballs(5)(veal/pork/beef combo) in marinara. It costs almost $12. When I broke them open, they were all bright pink inside. Â Meatball insides (or any other meat products) should never be bright pink inside(except for sushi/maybe, salmon). So, my opinion is this: 12 bucks is alot of money to spend on ordinary sized meatballs that weren't even cooked properly and were heavy on the breadcrumbs. Note to Marabellas: If you want to prevent uncooked meat from reaching your curtomers plate-meatballs should always be fried first and then slow cooked in the sauce for the ultimate results. This is how I make them for my family-and, I haven't had one dissatisfied customer yet!! Ciao & Good luck!
