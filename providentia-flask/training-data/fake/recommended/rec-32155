Okay. Maybe I'm not as worldly and sophisticated as some of my fellow yelpers but I dig this place a lot. The Shrimp Mango Roll is one of the many specialty dishes that I have enjoyed time an time again. True, the service can be a bit inconsistent, but i've never been treated rudely or felt as I we're been ignored. It seems to me as they may have a big turn over of help for whatever reason. The hibachi guys are always spot on and put on a good show... foods great... nice atmosphere. They keep me coming back. Nuff said!
