I just left after 2 minutes in San Sai.  I arrived at 9pm to find the restaurant completely empty.  I was slightly concerned with keeping the staff, but my date reminded me that their Thursday hours went until 11:45pm.  When our hostess escorted us to our seats, we were vindictively placed at the worst table in the (empty) restaurant.  The other tables already had place settings, but they made up this table specially for us. We were stuck in a nook, forced to sit caddy-corner, since there was not room for us to sit across from one another.  Meanwhile, every other decent table in the restaurant stood vacant. After staring at each other in disbelief for a minute, we stood up and informed the hostess that we would be leaving.  "oh really?" She said feigning surprise...
