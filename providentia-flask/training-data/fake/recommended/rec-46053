My favorite all you can eat sushi place. I have tried other ones like Sushi Palace, and Sushi X, but this is by far the best one. It is a quaint place that is BYO and has fast, efficient service. They have a great selection of specialty rolls and regular sushi rolls to pick from, my favorite being the Edison Roll. I also love that the all you can eat includes sashimi, which can get expensive if ordering a la carte. There is also a big selection of appetizers and entrees that can be ordered, even if doing all you can eat. The appetizers are, however, pretty small. I ordered the calamari, which came with three rings of calamari. But I'm not complaining because the small appetizers leaves room for more sushi! Love this place and would definitely recommend if you have a BIG appetite and a craving for sushi!
