I love this place.....they do it right. Upon entering, I already got a sense that I was going to enjoy my dinner here.  I noticed a great decor/ambience and workers busy doing their job.   Lots of chatter from other guests (that's a good sign for me), awesome greenhouse room where we were seated.  Service was awesome and you'll agree when you also see plenty of floor managers keeping their eyes on things.  Food was on point and worth ever penny.  I wish I could go into detail for each dish, but everything I ordered was very delicious; coupled by a nice/strong cocktail that hit the spot. P.S.  Attention to my special request for the birthday girl was executed smoothy.  Thank you for making my wife's birthday dinner very enjoyable.
