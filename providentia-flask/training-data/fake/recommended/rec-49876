Went there last night and we dined a la carte as there was nothing in 1st or 3rd bite that I was attracted to.    We shared the chilled spanish octopus  ($14), gnocchi ($13), Diver Scallop "noodles" stir fry ($15),  the porcini pasta ($14) and the shrimp & rice dumplings ($14).   While the Chilled octopus was deli-sh, the shrimp & rice dumplings were awful.  I've had better dumplings at South Street Chinese Takeout joints.  The standouts were the Diver Scallop noodles (was curious as I was a top chef fan), the porcini pasta and the gnocchi.  We could have had 2-3 order of gnochi.   Wine was good but a little pricey.  Dessert -  butterscotch panna cotta - was smokey and had an odd texture and taste.  We left unfinished.   Would come again as the menu just changed I believe a week or so ago and the old menu (winter/spring) had more appealing options for the tasting menu.
