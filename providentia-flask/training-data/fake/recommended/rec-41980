Bottom line: The food is delightful, plates are adventurous. Palates and bellies were happy both times. Fresh seafood; great dessert. SECOND VISIT We sat in the back dining room - intimate room, great lighting, great service and fun place to satiate a party of 8. We had to get the lola rosa again - reliably amazing.  After reading the reviews, we couldn't skip the lobster cappucino this time (beautiful color, light and frothy with delicate but full flavor).  We ordered almost the entire menu, and loved every bite.  Future repeats: lola rosa (yes, again), those darn amazing short ribs, heavenly maple souffle dessert. Glorious. FIRST VISIT We sat under an escalator.  That's really the worse thing I have to say about JG Domestic.  I was pretty much thrilled about everything. The menu was interesting because it has a second page which tells you where everything on the menu is from, in line with the restaurant's commitment to local ingredients.   For three, we shared: -Salt & vinegar kettle chips (greasy!) -Lola rosa - rare tuna and artichokes in a mustard vinaigrette, perfectly complemented by a smoky, caramelly stravecchio cheese. Easily could be my last meal on earth. -Looks like we missed out on the lobster cappuccino but  the blue crab gratin was much enjoyed, even if not mindblowing. -Black trumpet mushrooms - we absolutely relished this. Tiny portion but beautiful presentation and such complex flavor! Loved it! -We skipped the whole rabbit, but took the server's recommendation for the striped bass, which was dense, flaky, and delicious. And, yes, the dinner rolls are awesome.  It's also true that the portions vary in size, even within the course menus.  My standard advice applies: ask for recommendations from your server! :) Enjoy!
