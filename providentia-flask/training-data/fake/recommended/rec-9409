Lombardi's has pictures of famous patrons hanging on the walls; they come for good reason. Their pizza has withstood the test of time - The Pizzeria has a long history, with their success coming by the tongues of countless new yorkers who have tasted their pizza. You can't go wrong with Lombardi's if you want tasty pizza. Their prices are rather high, however, and there are no refills. Service is fast, and we were seated promptly.
