When you're feeling hungry and lazy, all at once, you can seamless this place. I've ordered from here at least half a dozen times, and it's consistently solid, low to mid-range Italian fare. There's no seating in the restaurant (hence, "To Go"). They have daily specials which they advertise on their website. They're also incredibly quick - usually it takes about 10-15 mins for them to make your food. The Spaghetti Bolognaise is always good; I would stay away from anything with salmon, though. In sum, I'm never super excited to eat here, but when you're out of mental energy to decide where to order from, choose this place.
