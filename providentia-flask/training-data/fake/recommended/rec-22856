I must admit my expectations were very high for Locanda Verde as some friends raved about it and the yelpers generally bestow high praise, but, I was disappointed even after spotting Sting  and Trudie Stylers last night ! Don't get me wrong, overall I liked it. The strong points are the scene and ambiance quintessential NYC hip, cool, mix, of Celebs, wall streeters, and well healed locals seated in a lovely and bubbly,clubby space.  To sum it up the food was very good , some things great and some just ok. The great  examples where the blue crab crostini,the garlic bread set on the table, the Bronzino Filet with a nice accompaniment of fava beans and veggies. Just ok the fire roasted chicken,and the rhubarb upside down cake. The squid ink pasta with seafood was a misfire, coming out mostly cold and lacking flavor.  For the food 3.5 stars, but the scene takes it to 4. It's fun for your NYC to do list and not terribly expensive for such a cool show. If you can get a table, which is not easy ..... I say go.
