I ate lunch here 2 days ago and ordered the much lauded Bun Bo Hue. Several hours later, in the middle of my shift, I got a terrible case of food poisoning. I was sweating uncontrollably and had to run from my station to vomit. Afterwards I had a glass of water and about 15 minutes later had to vomit again. The food was tasty going down but not so much on the way back up. The service was good, not neglectful but not overly bothersome either. I know this place has a great reputation, which is why I went there in the first place but the food-poisoning wasn't worth it. If you feel like rolling the dice, I've had worse meals...
