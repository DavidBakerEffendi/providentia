A long wait...yes. Worth it...yes. But, you can have a beer while you wait. Once you sit down the service is super fast. Only 6ish things on the menu, so decision making is easy. I got the Bistro Burger. If there's one thing I've learned, the signature namesake dish is good bet. And it was a good bet. Yummy crispy bacon, good ol' american cheese and tasty beef cooked to order. Fries have to be ordered on the side. They are crispy goodness. If in the mood for a good, cheap burger, this is the spot.
