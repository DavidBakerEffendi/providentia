Had brunch here a few weeks ago during a light snowfall and my only complaint was the pricing which was a little steep but being a prime location on 5th, somewhat understandable.  We both had the chicken sandwich and a few cups of the french press which was delicious.  Chicken sandwich was a little messy but really tasty and  you could tell the ingredients were fresh.  Feels like you are eating in someones dining room in the country even though its smack in the middle of Brooklyn, which I couldnt get over.
