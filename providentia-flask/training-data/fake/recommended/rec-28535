Great for our wedding ceremony and reception. Ceremony: in the Pavilion. Reception: up stairs on the Landing and Boncompain. We opted for the morning wedding, early afternoon reception. Chris Carrel organized it with us. He had a great attention to detail and helped us throughout the entire process. And of course the food was delicious and relatively fast (considering we placed close to 60 orders within 1.5 hours). Other Notes: Great opportunities for photos. Guests can enjoy the Grounds for Sculpture (which is a trip in itself). Helpful, enthusiastic staff (for our wedding at least, the actual restaurant staff were not as knowledgeable of the events and accidentally lead some of our guest astray right before the wedding. It happens...) Lots of ducks and peacocks. No decoration required. Beautiful just the way it is. Health Notes: Probably friendly to paleo and ketogenic dieters. I had a salmon dish with veggies. The staff and chefs at Rat's are happy to modify dishes for allergens or vegetarians.
