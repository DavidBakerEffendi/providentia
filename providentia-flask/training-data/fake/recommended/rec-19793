Please don't pay any attention to the negative reviews---just be thankful that you won't have to dine next to those morons. Finally went to Xixa last Friday and I'm still wondering why I waited so long. Truth be told, I was trying to get a reservation for Traif and they didn't have a table available for the time I wanted so I figured it was the perfect opportunity to give Xixa a shot. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful. Nothing lacking in that department so don't listen to the reviewer who complained that his girlfriend had a fork dropped in her lap. Seriously, she was probably thinking that the fork was the most exciting thing she's had between her legs since she met him. Ordered a couple of their fancy cocktails where the ice cubes provide the flavor as the tequila is poured over them. Fun and flavorful. My gf had some sort of bourbon tequila that tasted delicious while I opted for the watermelon margarita. Both were winners. The only problem with the menu was trying to choose what to order. This what I think we went with-- Mexico city edamame---a nice grill and and just a tad bit spicy. Steak tacos---this was with some sort of pibil, I believe, and not tartare. Whatever, it was delicious and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again Thai guacamole---couldn't believe how well apple slices pair with guacamole. Basic and genius. scallop dish---the least exciting of all the dishes but still good. lamb meatballs---perfectly delicious---more please. (the guys who run the Meatball Shop need to take notes) artichoke and spinach something or other than came with chips, disappeared quickly and will definitely be ordered again. passion fruit churros---we were full but it was Â my birthday and desert was in order. We were happy that we managed to force the dish into our already swollen bellies. The only thing I'm sorry about is that I didn't order the carrot dish but we had already ordered enough food so please keep this on the menu until I return.
