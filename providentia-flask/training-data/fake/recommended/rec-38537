I miss this place so much and it sucks that they don't have anything in comparison in Houston. LE SIGH. The cooks are usually fly as hell to ogle down while they put their back into making a conscious concoction of delicious... I've raped their menu many times over, but my favorite is their take of a cheesesteak as well as their vegan chocolate cake. I WISH GOVINDA'S EXISTED IN HOUSTON. *thug tears*
