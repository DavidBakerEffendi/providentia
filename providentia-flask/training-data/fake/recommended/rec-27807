Went in for a Sunday buffet, arriving right at the opening time. Overall, I was rather underwhelmed... for the following reasons: - Selection of dishes was average - Quality / taste was average - One of the dishes (Chicken 65) was very dry and looked as if it was made the day before. Another dish (some type of Paneer) ran out and no one brought out more for a while. - No one asked if I was interested in ordering anything else after I was seated, e.g. a drink - After I finished my first glass of water, a refill did not come for another 15 minutes Add all this up with an interior that is dull and unexciting and the overall atmosphere of a canteen... I am not coming back. There are better options in the area in the same price range.
