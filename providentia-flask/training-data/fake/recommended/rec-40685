I visited Jones with a [tame] bachelor party for the first time two weeks ago, and it was certainly some delicious food.  Some guys and I shared the black bean chicken nachos, which really hit the spot.  I thought the ingredients were something I could have easily arranged and whipped up, but I appreciated the hearty app nonetheless.  I got the BBQ Pork Sandwich with skinny fries, and everyone instantly declared me the winner of the night's ordering as soon as they saw it placed in front of me.  The sandwich was absolutely packed with pork on top an artisan snowflake roll.  The customary steel cup of coleslaw was served with the meal... and it was probably the most fantastic side of coleslaw I've ever had.  I'd be tempted to order the same exact thing when I go again! As for decor/service/scene, it was definitely a classy looking place.  High ceilings, stone interior, modern wall clock, plants galore, and energetic crowd definitely made for a good night out.  All of the servers were wearing bright colored Lacoste polos and jeans which kind of confused me as to what they were going for with that look.  Overall, my Coke/meal/app share bill was $30, kind of pricey put well worth it for this college kid.
