Was in the mood for something fresh & tasty so decided on Hibachi & Sushi. Â Been here a handful of times and happy to report we've always had excellent service & great food! The place is huge with tons of seating & parking - (living in JC, parking is much appreciated!) Great place for big groups & families. I usually do the hibachi (cs my daughter loves it), but the couple times I've ordered sushi it's been great! I'll Definitely be back to try more of the specialty rolls!
