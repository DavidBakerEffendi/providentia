I lived in this neighborhood years ago, but have since relocated to Washington, D.C. I was back in town recently and was intrigued when a friend suggested we try a new restaurant near Classon and Fulton, Alice's Arbor. Fortunately, for the both of us, it turned out to be a great place. The decor is very wooden and cozy, and the atmosphere is both warm and comfortable. Also, the restaurant is not very loud despite the total space actually being larger than you might think from the storefront. This is probably because the front and back rooms are, in a way, separate (we sat in the front). My friend and I both got the price fixe meal (for me, the asparagus, swiss chard and mushroom pasta, and bread pudding, for my friend the baby back ribs, organic chicken, and bread pudding). We also shared four oysters and each ordered a beer. Everything was absolutely delicious, and there was more than enough food (we actually brought home half my entree and one of the two bread puddings). The service was good, though our waiter probably could have been a bit friendlier and quicker with the check. And while we both enjoyed the beers on tap, I would like to see the restaurant add a couple more brews. The menu is dying for a Belgian ale of some sort. But, all in all, this is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood.
