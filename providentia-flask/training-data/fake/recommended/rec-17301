Great portuguese reastaurant in Elizabeth, NJ.  We celebrated our fellow yelper's birthday.  There was about 18 of us there.  We had a great time. They give you bread and butter in the beginning. The bread can be a little softer.  After awhile it gets hard like a rock.  They supply you with a bottle of olive oil and peppers to dip your bread in. A fellow yelper recommended steak on a stone.  For $25 dollars, they give two filet mignon and you cook these bad boys in a burning HOT stones. They give you crispy potato skins and portuguese rice on the side as well as butter to put on your steak as the wholesome goodness of the steak sears on the hot stone and the aroma just makes you wanna grab the steak in your bare hands and start taking large chunks of it. Steak was delicious and juicy.  It took me awhile to cook it since i love my steaks well done.  Even with a well done steak the juice still dripped down my chin.  I was full by the time dessert came.  I skipped this one.  But a fellow yelper recommends TRES LECHES...get on it!!
