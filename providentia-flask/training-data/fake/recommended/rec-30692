Good brunch. Good burger. The bartender poured me a beer that had a lot of stuff floating in it (I'm hoping he just poured too fast and got some sediment from the bottom of the bottle, because i haven't had chunky beer before) and when I asked him what was floating in my beer he tersely stated that it was supposed to be that way. Not quite an answer to my question, but at least he responded. I kinda wanna go back.
