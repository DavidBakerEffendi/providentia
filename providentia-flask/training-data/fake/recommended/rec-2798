This is a hipster haven, so let's just get that out of the way right now. The food was surprisingly good, though, both times that I was here before a concert that my friend dragged me to. I think I had a burger the first time, which was good but not really memorable. More recently, I ordered the grilled Caesar salad with chicken. Let me repeat that in case it didn't sink in--the salad is GRILLED. It was actually pretty cool and very tasty, though there was a ton of salad so I didn't finish it all. I also ordered a cheesy biscuit which I was very excited about trying, but it really didn't taste all that cheesy. It was good, but not great. They have a very interesting drink list, so that's something. The dining area is usually packed, especially before a show, so be ready for a wait. It's not someplace that I'd purposely seek out to eat a meal, but it does the trick if your friend is dragging you to a concert upstairs afterwards. By the way, the venue is pretty cool, in that you can look down on the performer...it just happened that I was really not into these particular performers.
