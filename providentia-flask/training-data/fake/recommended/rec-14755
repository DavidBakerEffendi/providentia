Still in love with this place and my bartender tonight is a awesome guy very funny and nice to patrons. He created a new drink called 25 to life.... 25 different brown liqours Mixed together for a smooth creeper drink... its definitely a must try drink and a bartenders creations are definitely a must try usually a hit or miss but this one is amazing... today i tried jambalya and i loved it not too salty full of flavor but hands down the snapper fish is my fav. dish .. still enjoy the music and come here you wont regret.
