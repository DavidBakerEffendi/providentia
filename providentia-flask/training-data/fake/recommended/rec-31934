Yummmm my favorite hangover food! The long lines are the only part I don't like about artichoke. Other than that the spinach artichoke pizza is put of control. Perfect combination of crust and creaminess. Â I think about getting artichoke everyday- thankfully so far I have been able to resist. Can't wait to try the sicilian.
