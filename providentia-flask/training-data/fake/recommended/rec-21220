Been here for lunch a few times due to business, but just can't seem to like it compared to other places nearby. The decor is interesting with the large chandelier, that I wished would be decorated in my home, and mirrors all over the roof. Palates are presented in very large plates, which makes the food look a tad bit small portioned, but in the end, your stomach is full. Prices are very reasonable. A selection of one free appetizer is definitely a plus. Service was a little slow, but nothing to be worried about. The staffs are very attentive and constantly on the watch for empty cups and plates. A good sign. I know that happy hour and night time, this place gets packed. Maybe one of these days, I would like to experience the night hours.
