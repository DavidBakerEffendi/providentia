I met a friend there after hearing SO much about this place. We left after a course of appetizers, sure we weren't going to get anything better for mains or desserts. I won't be back. Sangria - strangely unsweet. Cucumber rhubarb soup - the only hit of the meal. The organ meat skewers - undercooked. That is just criminal. Zucchini corn app - why are they serving *corn* in *June*? Edit: to the chef that posted he got corn at the greenmarket at the *end* of June - that is believable. but that's not when i ate there. i ate it before corn season. Â and it's unseemly of you to argue dishonestly on yelp.
