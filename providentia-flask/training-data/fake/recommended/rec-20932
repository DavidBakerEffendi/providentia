Beer = great. Food = ehh. Atmosphere = good. I like going here. It feels alive. I seem to always be disappointed in the food. It is a fun place to go, but I no longer go hungry - I'll just have a 'snack' here if I want something to go with the great beer. If I were only rating the beer, it'd get 5. Â If only the food, it'd get a 2.
