I think there's a lot to be said for a restaurant where the owner greets you warmly, takes your order, cooks the meal, delivers it to your table, and checks back to make sure everything is OK. Even better if his mother (who, with her late husband) owned the business for the previous generation) joins in to help. Not only did we have a good meal, but a great visit with some totally Vermonty folks!
