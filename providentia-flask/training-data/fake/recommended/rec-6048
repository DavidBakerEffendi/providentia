Another five-star review for Pylos but hey, they deserve it! Beautiful decor, wonderful staff, and AMAZING FOOD. I took my boyfriend here Â for his birthday and it was perfect. Romantic but not stuffy romantic! We ordered the saganaki which is the best saganaki I ever had. It's not greasy or "too much". It's baked perfectly and it's exactly the right amount for an appetizer. I dream about this saganaki. We had the piperia gemisti me kafteri feta which was another gem. Just delicious. Then I had the moussaka which was one of the most original, perfectly portioned, absolutely mouth watering pieces of moussaka I've ever had. My boyfriend had the lavraki me tsigarellia. He loved it and the fish was cooked to perfection. Unfortunately, we didn't have dessert cause we were seeing a movie right after (Guardians of the Galaxy - another recommendation) but I am super pumped to go back and try everything on the menu and the dessert and just eat at Pylos forever. One thing that is good to note, some of the tables are close together. It didn't bother me - especially because we were sitting next to very lovely people - but it's a good thing to know in case that's something you'd want to know, ya know. It really doesn't make a difference, especially which such a good meal! It's just so pretty in there. Okay, I'm done with the Pylos love fest. Just kidding, go Pylos.
