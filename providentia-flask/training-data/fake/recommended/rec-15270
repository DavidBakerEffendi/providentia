Another great food truck that frequents Montclair! We had the jambalaya which was delicious, piping hot with the perfect amount of heat and spice.  The rice was moist and it was chock full of meat. The shrimp po-boy was just out of this world.  Every one of those crispy fried shrimp tasted like it was just caught from the Gulf of Mexico and I'm still thinking about that remoulade sauce that was just heavenly/addictive. The beignets are not exactly like the ones you may have tasted at Cafe du Monde (because these are almondy flavored)  but are pretty amazin anyway.......served crispy, piping hot and showered with tons of powdered sugar.   As a huge fan of the City of Nawlins and Cajun cuisine (one of my favorite vacation spots),   I highly recommend The French Quarter Food Truck.  Just close your eyes while you eat and you will be magically transported to NOLA.
