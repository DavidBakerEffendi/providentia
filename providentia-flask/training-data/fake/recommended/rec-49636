Ridiculously slow service.  We sat down at 7:15 on a Thursday night.  The place was 1/2 full.  The bottle of wine we ordered almost immediately after sitting down wasn't brought to us until about 8.  The whole affair took over 2 hours.  My entree was missing a crucial element.  Yes, they gave us a couple of free drinks in the process, but I would have much rather had a meal served in a timely fashion.  I won't ever be back.
