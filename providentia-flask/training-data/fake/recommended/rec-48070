The guys at PT are the most amazing in any Italian restaurant i have ever been to. The waiters (Nick in particular is one of my favorite people ever) know everything about the menu and the wines (something that restaurants in the city are forgetting to teach their staff) and the owner, a REAL Italian from Sardinia-- has created such simple yet unique dishes. The baked oysters are to die for and you are always greeted with the most friendly of smiles... become a regular and you'll get plenty of free cheese and grappa. It's fairly reasonable (although of course like anything, add some appetizers and go to that second bottle of wine and suddenly your wallet hurts). I'm here once a week... and only because I don't want them to see how obsessed I am...
