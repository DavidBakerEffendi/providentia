It was okay.  I went in, like others here, expecting more just because I've heard so much about this place!!   It wasn't too crowded when we arrived, and the three of us were seated right away at the bar.  The server was super nice.  We started with the brussel sprouts, then the pork buns next - both very good.  Then we had the cod and apple bacon kimchi - also both very good.  The only thing was that the portions were really small and the prices pretty steep for what we got. I mean, the food was good, but it wasn't amazing - nothing too new.  I've had better ssam at Korean restaurants elsewhere.  On top of that, I was disappointed that the ssam menu selections were really limited - there were one or two that were affordable, and the other "full on" ssam selections cost $140 or $200.   A little too pricey for my taste - so if you're going for ssam, be prepared for this. The damage came out to about $25-30 each - not too bad. But I still left oddly disappointed.  Maybe it's just me.
