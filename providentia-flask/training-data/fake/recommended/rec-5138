Juniper is a Williamsburg staple. This is the kind of place that makes a neighborhood. The chef (maybe owner too?) Tom hangs out in the front of house all the time and he will share all his techniques with you if you ask. He is so friendly and inviting and makes you feel like you came to see him so he can cook just for you. Prices are totally reasonable for the quality of food. The wings are insanely good time and time again and the Mac and cheese is hearty as you could hope for. It is BYOB, though, so keep that in mind. They're super cool with getting you glasses and they don't charge to open your bottle of wine. It's not hard to grab a box of wine on N8/Driggs and go to town, though. I love this place and I'll be coming back for as long as they're around.
