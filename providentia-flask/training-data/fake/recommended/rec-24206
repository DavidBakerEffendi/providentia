I've been here a few times now and enjoyed it every time. The creme brulee french toast is incredible - in my opinion better than what sabrina's offers. The egg and biscuit thing that comes in a griddle is also so delicious and full of cholesterol that you won't want to eat the rest of the day. Today we tried their burger - perhaps the best in the neighborhood, rivaled only by south philly tap room. The roll was so good - a soft seedy pretzel roll. And it has tabasco onions and a generous amount of cheddar with some thick bacon. Served with an impressive portion of crispy golden french fries. The fifth star is missing because it is cash only which annoys me and they need to work on crowd management. We sat outside and the people waiting were literally on top of us towards the end of our dining experience. Â  Go early! The first time we went at 8AM on a Sunday and it was truly delightful and unhurried.
