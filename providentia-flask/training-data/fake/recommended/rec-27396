I am so happy this place exists. One of the best happy hours in the area with $5 cocktails (strong), great tapas, tasty lamb burger, and delicious vegetable pizza. Good tunes. Real fireplace. Nice mix of people. My only complaint is the service. Really nice waitress but just simply overworked trying to cover the entire bar herself. We had go to the kitchen and ask the chef for ketchup, poured our own water from the pitcher at the waitress stand, and asked the manager at the front for our check. Throw an extra server into the mix, and Bijan looks more like a 5 star establishment.
