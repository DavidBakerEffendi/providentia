I went out to Okemo area to grab dinner and along the way stopped at a wine & cheese store.  The owner highly recommended I make a drive and go to the Inn at Weathersfield.  So I ended up going back the way I came and bailed on the Okemo area.   The inn was great, very small and cozy. They said the majority of their ingredients come from with a 20 mile range.  The food was very tasty and I was seated near the fireplace which was nice.  The owner came over and said hello, which I always find respectful.   I would recommend it as a place to relax and have a nice quiet dinner.
