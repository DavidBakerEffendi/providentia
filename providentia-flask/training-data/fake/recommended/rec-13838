High quality, detailed oriented with a heavy Southern influence.  My main problem here is always the struggle to leave room for the desserts.  Particularly the luscious chocolate or fresh raspberry cakes baked on the premises.  Forget Magnolia, these cakes are far superior.   The brunch is legendary but dinner is excellent too.  The specials are always fresh, creative and excellent.  I had cornmeal crusted oysters with creamed spinach and a crispy artichoke salad three years ago that I still remember.  The cocktails are also inventive and excellent. I must have eaten here 20 or more times in the last few years and I really have never been disappointed.
