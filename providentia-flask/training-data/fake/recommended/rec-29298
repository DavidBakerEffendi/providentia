All we had to eat was the cheesecake. With that being said, there was practically no line at the Times Square location at around 10pm. The cheesecake was delicious! We got the strawberry version and the crust, fruit and cheesy part were amazing. Only criticism would be the syrupy strawberry sauce they use with the fresh strawberries. Not the best.
