Hole in the wall eatery off Chinatown where we tried to satiate our Asian food craving. // LOCATION // Chinatown // SERVICE // Curt and inattentive, typical of small tiny Chinese establishments // FOOD //     + Beef and beef tendon noodle soup with hand-pulled noodles: The beef was tough/chewy and not fall off the bone soft which is what I am accustomed to with my beef noodle soup. The soup was also bland and lacked flavor. However, the hand-pulled noodles had a good consistency and were tasty.
