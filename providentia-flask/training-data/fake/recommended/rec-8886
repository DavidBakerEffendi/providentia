This feels about as far from New York as you can get. Like, across the ocean, through the Bay of Biscay and up into some tiny town with wild flowers lining the roads. There you'll find PÃ¥tes et Traditions, complete with white picket fence, wallpapered edges and a warm shabby chic interior that sings, "Stay awhile." The menu is laden with pastas and heavy country French cuisine with a long list of crepes ranging from savory sausage and melted gruyere to sweet goat cheese, honey and fig; all rolled up in tender buckwheat pancakes. The service is friendly and lingering, the wines simple and available by glass or bottle. The French sparkling lemonade is also a real treat for old and young alike. While I've only been for dinner, the brunch menu looks delectable and hopefully I'll be back on Havemeyer in the mid-morning soon. After all, it's only a train ride away.
