Have I really not reviewed this place yet? For shame! So I had a major Korean food craving and love this place because it has everything for cheap.  When I went in it was still pretty busy at about 7PM but had little problem navigating the place.  My only issue was a personal one I was a bit overwhelmed by all the food options and it took me a bit to figure out what I wanted.  Better too many options than too little I think though! Finally I settled on beef bibimbap and a banchan of kimchi.  Although I have had better kimchi, for 1 dollar I will definitely come back for more!  What I did not realize was the beef bibimbap came with rice and miso soup. What a pleasant surprise! So my dinner ended up being beef bibimbap (think veggies, yummy beef, rice, and sriacha sauce :)), kimchi, miso soup, and green tea for 9 dollars.  All of it was delicious except for the kimchi and frankly the miso soup left a bit to be desired.  Those two minor notes aside, I had a 3 course meal and a drink for 9 dollars! Last time I checked that was a steal! I am officially obsessed!
