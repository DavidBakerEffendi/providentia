This place is the best cocktail bar in the world. Clearly. Service impeccable, food extraordinary and fairly priced. Drinks are off the chain. Would totally recommend this place to someone visiting NYC. Yes, it's crowded but they take amazing care of their customers. If I could give these guys 6 stars I would. Fantastic.
