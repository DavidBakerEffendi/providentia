The chicken Parma sub was delicious, used great fresh ingredients all at a fair price. From reading other reviews, next time I go I will try a burger but was on the move and needed something I can eat on the go. The restaurant itself was very clean and new looking. It's a little hard to find and kind of non-descript, but a good sandwich shop if you can make your way there.
