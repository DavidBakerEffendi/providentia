Yummy!  I went here with my friend who lives in Brooklyn.  She had never been (and she's lived there for 3 years) and I'm always down for pizza, especially NY pizza.  We took a cab, and I was relived that there was NO line!!  We were seated right in front of the door when we realized that we would freeze our asses off, so we joined a couple and sat down at a table for four.  It worked out great.   Now, onto business....the pizza was soooo good.  It was different from the pizza I've had in the Bronx (Crosby Pizza), but the cheese was nice and gooey, and the crust was nice and thin, the way I like it.  I ate one too many slices, but it was well worth it.  I would go back even if I were not staying with my friend in Brooklyn.
