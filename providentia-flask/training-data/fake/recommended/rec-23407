Love this place, have already eaten here a few times, it is very clean and the guys that work there are super friendly. I had an order of chicken tacos, which came with 3, was able to choose my own toppings and it was delicious. It also comes with white or yellow rice and beans, unfortunately no refried beans were offered. They made the order in front of me and I was out pretty quickly. For a few bucks more you can get a soda and salsa/chips with your order, overall pretty inexpensive. I don't know what the first reviewers issue was with cleaning supplies near the bathroom, Â if you ask me, it's a pretty dumb complaint.
