I've pretty much eaten the entire lunch menu via Seamless delivery, it's all very very good. I especially recommend the Moroccan hero, which is grilled chicken with eggplant and some other stuff in there, it's a mess to eat but crazy delicious (it also comes with the homefries which are great). All their sandwiches are good, was surprised how much I liked the Sabih Croissant which is cured boiled eggs, potato salad, eggplant and more. The falafel comes more like a appetizer/salad but, as others have noted, is AMAZING and rather unlike others you may have had before. Definitely one of the best new additions to WIlliamsburg in some time. Really need to go for dinner.
