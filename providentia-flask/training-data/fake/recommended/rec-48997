I had this place bookmarked awhile ago but never got the chance to try it. I happened to be in the area and saw a line outside and I immediately knew it was the place I bookmarked! Soup Spot is a take out place. You order, pay, and go. There's a list of soups they are serving for that day, several sandwiches, and specialty salads. I had a difficult time choosing from the list because they all sounded amazing. I ended up getting the lobster, shrimp, and salmon bisque. I had no idea there would be chunks of salmon in the soup!! The bisque was pretty good, but a bit salty. I finished the whole thing, but now I'm so thirsty. A soup costs $5 (incld tax) and comes with a piece of bread and an apple. A spoon and a napkin is already packed for you in a paper bag with your soup! I definitely want to return and try other soups! :)
