Boy Do I LOVE LOVE LOVE This Place.... I always manage to grab great parking and a great seat no wait. Happy hour is awesome! My favorites: Margarita (even though I wish they were bigger I drink em down way to quickly! lol) Guacamole with tortilla chips- fresh and yummy! BTW-I dont even like Guac! Queso Fundido with Chorizo and Poblanos- Cheesey Melty Flavorful Heaven! Chicken Enchiladas- Superb softly shredded meat, cheesy, sauce is to die for!!! Â  I really do enjoy going to El Rey the atmosphere is cozy comfy and there is always a nice buzz going on. The servers are attentive and have great suggestions from the menu. Its not too far from home and it always open! (When I need them lol). Go try it for yourself. I doubt you will be disappointed, not sure what to order? Try some of my favs I want to try something else but I just love them so much.... But I keep hearing about those nachos so.... next time I'm going to try them and update this review. :) ENJOY!
