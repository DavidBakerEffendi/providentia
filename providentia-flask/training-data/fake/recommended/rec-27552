Went here for Valentines Day dinner and was quite impressed. The service was great, the wine even better. Was pleasantly surprised at how moderately priced the menu was. The ambience was great and the views of the Park and Columbus Circle were amazing. Overall, a great experience and I will definitely be going back soon. One more thing, cotton candy for dessert!
