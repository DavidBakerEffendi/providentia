Pros: They had a delicious stout I have never tried before and the manager was super helpful and nice. Cons:  In order of offensiveness- 1. I went in for the oyster happy hour and there were shell fragments in my oysters.  I swallowed one by accident and it totally scratched my throat.   2. It took a long time to get the oysters after ordering.  I think the kitchen was backed up.  My friend ordered a sandwich which did not arrive for at least 40 minutes at which point we cancelled, got the check and left for a restaurant with better service.  The people next to us told us their fries were undercooked. 3. Our waitress was terrible.  I'm talking not making helpful suggestions when you ask for three different drinks and none are in stock, not checking in, avoiding eye contact, and a general attitude of pushyness let me just get this over with why are you here i dont want to help you. It's a beautiful bar and I was looking forward to trying it out but I'm never going back here.
