Been here multiple times. Food, just OK at best. Nothing special including the onion rings that every one raves about. Burgers small and very ordinary. Ice cream is OK but again nothing special. About on a par for a homemade ice cream store. They have a "policy" that dictates that a Sunday "must" be served in a Sunday glass or you have to pay extra for a "custom order". Sounds silly and ridiculous because in a Sunday glass the ice cream drips over the glass and all of the syrup is on the bottom of the glass. Therefore when you put the spoon in to get to the syrup the ice cream goes over the top and you lose about 20% on the table or plate below. What possible difference it can make to the store is beyond me. I wouldn't go here for the best ice cream and certainly not for the food but if you want to visit a 50's ice cream parlor and a Sopranos' site, then it's worth a visit.
