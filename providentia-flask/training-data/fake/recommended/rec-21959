I have never eaten poboys and am glad that Beck's was the place I had them. I had the shrimp poboy and cajun fries and the shrimp was crisp . It was great. Husband had the Jambalaya and could not stop raving about it. Â Next time, I am back in Philadelphia, will definitely make sure to stop at Beck's. Please open a location in NJ please :) Definite try : Jambalaya, Poboys
