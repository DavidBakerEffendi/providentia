Located in between perhaps two of the most popular sandwich vendors in Reading Terminal Market (Dinic's and Original Turkey), Hershel's East Side Deli doesn't get full recognition as the go-to place for sandwiches. Well, at least for me, it took me a long time to realize that! Famous for its corned beef and pastrami, Hershel's is operated by a bunch of young-looking, hat-wearing fellows. Although it may not sound so delicious, Hershel's serve one of the best greasy sandwiches! The pastrami is tender, juicy, and with a slight hint of pink in the middle wrapped around with great seasoning outside. Recommendations: 1. Pastrami Special (Not grilled, with russian dressing & cole slaw) 2. Pastrami on Reuben (Hot sandwiches, grilled with russian dressing & sauerkraut in it) Pros: 1. Perfect coordination between the russian dressing and the meat 2. Takes LevelUp and I believe there's $2 credit for Hershel's! Hooray! Cons: 1. A bit too pricey for a medium-size sandwich despite its hard work on making them (Usually goes over $10 for a sandwich with small fountain drink. But with the LevelUp credit, you can simply ignore this point) 2. A bit too greasy if you're looking for a light, health meal. Stuck in between all the "must-go-to" places in Reading Terminal, Hershel's East Side Deli blew me away with some serious stuff. Before I can find better pastrami in town, Hershel's is still considered as one of the best place to grab a quick sandwich!
