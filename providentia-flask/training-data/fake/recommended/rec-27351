Solid Thai food. Went with a group of friends to have a quick dinner before one of those happy hour cruises. Food was fresh and came out quickly since we were some of the first to arrive before the dinner rush. Drinks were surprisingly balanced - this is no easy feat. The lychee martini had just the right amount of sweetness and alcohol, we did not feel like anything was missing. It was absolutely perfect. The papaya salad was a little on the mild side but you could request it spicier, calamari was just okay but the chili sauce it came with was great. We had the drunken noodles, red curry with chicken, pad Thai and tamarind snapper and each of them did not disappoint. For dessert we ordered coconut ice cream and mango with sticky rice. Altogether, it was a good dining experience.
