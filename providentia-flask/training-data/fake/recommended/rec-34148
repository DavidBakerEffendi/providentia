I seriously love this place... Super low key, authentic, great buffet selection, AMAZING meats and totally affordable. I'm a big fan of Brazilian food and go to churrascarias a lot, but this is even better if you're not in the mood for a big production and sit down table service. It's one of those random places you would literally walk by on a daily basis and never think of going in unless you heard someone raving about it and decided to try it. Copacabana is not really close to where I live but I come here about 3 to 4 times a month whenever the meat cravings strike. And as an added bonus, the desserts are also delicious, especially the Brazilian flan and passion fruit mousse and tiny coconut balls that taste like they've been soaked in condensed milk. Yum!
