I was looking forward an authentic Chinese place. I have a bunch of friends from China (some from Szechuan Province) and all agree that this is the best and most authentic Chinese Restaurant in University or Center City. Definitely order one of the Szechuan style dishes, but beware that this place is extremely spicy even for people who eat are used to it. Also, the portions are big so a small plate is enough for almost anyone.
