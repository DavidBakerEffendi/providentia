Decent food at a slightly steep price. Try any of the Italian entrees and pass on their steak. The steak has a trend of being too tough despite how it is prepared. The wait staff was friendly, funny, and helpful. The resteraunt simply lacks flair and/or uniqueness. Nothing separates it from the crowd. The layout of the restaurant gives you the impression they remodeled an old Denny's.
