Ive been visiting Philly for years now and never stopped into the Reading Terminal Market before, what time I have wasted! the aroma of all the different foods and candies and coffee here is worth the trip. A crowded little market filled with everything from unique restaurants to a raw oyster bar to bees wax candles. Wish I had more time to stop in and really explore everything that was inside!
