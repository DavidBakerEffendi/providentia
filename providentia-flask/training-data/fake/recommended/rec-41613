Best pizza in Philadelphia. They make their dough fresh daily. The broccoli rabe and roast pork pizza is unreal. The guy roasts a pig habitually and puts the shavings on this pizza. Yowza. And the cheesesteak pizza is surprisingly good. No better place to get real pizza in Philly. Love it love it love it.
