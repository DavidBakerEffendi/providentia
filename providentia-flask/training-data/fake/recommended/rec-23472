I'll make this short: food was good. I had the pulled pork sandwich but for some reason they throw a dainty amount on a thick hard roll. I'm not being picky, this roll is about 4-5 inches thick making it more of a roll with a slight pork flavor vs a pulled pork sandwich. I ended up eating it off the roll and eating the roll as a side. Also, as others reviews state, service ain't too good. And, their ordering system straight sucks. Hey owners! Do something about it! Having one line with annoyed workers isn't good. By the time you get your food you already have a bad taste in your mouth. Are two lines and a little speed in service too much to ask for? I also had the Mac and cheese which was good. Basically this comes down to them losing business due to service and Â ordering system. I honestly may not go back. The food is good but not worth the experience. ( and please use better bread on with your sandwiches. The meat should be the focus, not the stiff, chewy bread.)
