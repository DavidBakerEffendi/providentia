It's nice to be just off South Street. We went to Southwark for drinks and dinner. It was very quiet at 6 pm when we arrived. The bar is beautiful, a perfect place to hang out, a long bar with stools and a number of small high top tables. The drinks are professionally made with a focus on American whiskeys and rye but fully stocked with all manner of libations. The bartenders are smart and attentive. Dinner was good, we had fluke and pork belly. Everything was delicious. Â My only complaint, the toasted bread with the cheese plate and meal tasted like gas, common when the bread is done over a gas grill. The waiter didn't seem to agree with me on this point, but he did bring me some plain bread. Although we sat inside, there is a nice outdoor seating area as well. Very good food and drinks. Highly recommended.
