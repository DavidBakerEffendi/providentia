this place is DISGUSTING if you cant tell by its hidden rating- it got a C i should have known better then to eat here. the food was room temp, lacking in everything, we got a steak asked for med well and it was brought out raw- not even rare, but RAW like right from the fridge. the only thing that was good was the drinks. and i did get sick after eating here the minute i left i was throwing up on the street a few blocks down.
