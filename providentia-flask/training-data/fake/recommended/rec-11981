Fantastic brunch! Filled with ricotta, topped with berries and some kind of delicious butter, I crave the ricotta pancakes all week, . The cheddar cheese egg sandwich and the stewed tomatoes are also very good and the Bloody Mary's range from good to excellent depending on the day. Â What more can you ask for? Oh and the host was very nice and accommodating to our group of five, despite the fact that it was truly a mob scene outside and he was running around like crazy.
