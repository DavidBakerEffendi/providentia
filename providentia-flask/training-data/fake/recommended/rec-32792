Husband and I went there with 2 other couples. Â Bartender couldn't have been friendlier, our server had a sweet perpetual genuine smile on her face and the manager, after checking in on us and finding out our tortillas were not as warm as they should be, kept coming back after sending our food back several times to get it right. Never met a manager that cares as much as he did. We loved the atmosphere, the way we were treated and the food also. We will definitely be back!
