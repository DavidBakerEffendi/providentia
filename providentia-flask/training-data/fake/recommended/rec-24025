I walked by Little Italy Pizza this afternoon and decided to go in and get a menu since they are new in the neighborhood.  We decided to jump right in and try it right away.   We ordered a Sicilian Pizza and an order of wings. The Pizza was absolutely wonderful.  Delicious and well cooked.  The wings were the breaded kind and we got the sauce on the side.  They were very good as well. I am happy to have a good pizza place in the neighborhood.  They have several tables in the shop as well. I definately recommend Little Italy Pizza and hope they remain in the area for a long time!
