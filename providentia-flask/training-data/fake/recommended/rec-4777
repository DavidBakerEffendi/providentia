We had a chance to stop by for dinner, and the food is just as good. The food is def not for the faint of heart - our scotch eggs were ginormous, the mac was rich and the crawfish pot pie was to die for. The pork chop was also amazing. Huge portions, very rich flavors - don't plan on going out after dinner!
