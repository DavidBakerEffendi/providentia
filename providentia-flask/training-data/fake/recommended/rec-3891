yes it's popular and there's always a wait but the crowd is significantly exacerbated by the layout.  narrowness in the front creates a huge bottleneck that makes the bar unpleasant to sit at and intimidates anyone on the street from even attempting to come in.   once, however, you get into the back room, it's a delightful experience with excellent food.   this is probably a 3.5 but it feels ungenerous to ding them too hard for the layout when the food is so good.
