I'm fairly new to the CT area and finally decided to go out in the West Hartford area..Bartaco is a fun spot. Only been there for drinks and they definitely make everything fresh there. I've had some of their tacos and although small, they were definitely tasty!  It's always been crowded the 2 times I've been so far. Definitely going back. The bar staff is attentive as well -  in particular, Joel, I believe is his name.
