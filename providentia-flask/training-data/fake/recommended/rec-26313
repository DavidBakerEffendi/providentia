Swarmed with people, sights, and sounds, the place itself was very warm and inviting. We were seated pretty quickly for a group of six on a weekend night. From what I can remember, our waitress was on top of our orders. This night was a bit of a blur to me. After the sparkling wine, vodka/tonic, vino, and patron, our table really rang in the bustle of the E Village. But I do remember how amazing the gorgonzola cheese potato chips tasted and how I slurped each drop of chardonnay broth from the mussels. I have to say that I was more than irked, however, to have TWO snooty parties seated next to and behind us, ask us to keep it down. Why? So we can clearly have as much fun as your stale conversation over sparkling water over there? Well, we didn't pipe down because this place IS NOT THE FREAKIN LIBRARY. Later that night, we told our waitress, Alisa, about it, and she apologized and was totally on our side. She didn't have to, but the fact that she did earned her a hug and a "you're my favorite waitress" by the end of dinner. Don't come here expecting to keep your 10 month old infant in REM.
