My wife and I recently moved to Cedar Grove and spent a year trying to find our "go to" place on Friday nights. We always talked about trying Delmonico's as we  drove by it on our way to another restaurant, but we never pulled the trigger until about a month ago.  We're sorry we waited so long! This place is great. There menu offers a lot of options and has something for everyone. We've been four times so far and have been satisifed with every trip. As a waiter for nine years I can be picky about service and it drives my wife nuts! But here service is not an issue. Although you have your main server, the rest of the wait staff pitches in and helps their fellow servers out and do so WILLINGLY!   They have a nice little bar area in back of the restaurant with a good selection of beers and a place to sit outside in the summer. Definately recommend this place if you're looking for a casual restaurant that serves good food.
