If you like Mediteranean, YOU MUST GO HERE! plus they deliver! If you are vegan/vegetarian all you need is the veggie platter which comes with hummus, grape leaves, falafals, beans, chickpeas, eggplant spread and more. It's only $10 and it feeds TWO people. Sometimes my girlfriend and I don't even finish it.
