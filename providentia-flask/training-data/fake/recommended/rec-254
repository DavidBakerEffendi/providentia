Probably one of the best bahn mi places I have had. They had a variety of different bahn mi to choose from along with other dishes like salads and rolls. I got the super cub classic with spicy and it was really good. The bread roll was delicious, heated and crispy. The don't skimp on the stuffing and had just enough kick in it with the jalape√±o. Ingredients were very fresh and the sandwich was put together right in front of you. Prices were great too! Place was very small though, which is why I gave it four stars... five people in there already made it difficult to breathe. Customer service was ehhh here... the guy who took out order wasn't friendly at all and emotionless. Overall, I enjoyed the food here, definitely will be coming back here again.
