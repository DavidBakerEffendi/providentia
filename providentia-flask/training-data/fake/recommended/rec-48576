When I saw a picture of this little cute place on online few month ago while searching for what brooklyn has to offer,I really wanted to come see and feel little France. I didn't think it would be happening the night until I arrived because I came here after work for dinner with my coworker (I shall say owner/boss). It was exactly like the picture I saw, but little more romantic because of night lighting. Normande Crepe with chicken, mushrooms, white wine, cream,&  swiss La shrimp curry cress crepe and Glasses of Sauvignon Blanc. We ordered 2 menu from savory crepes, shared and enjoyed them both. I found whenever I have savory crepe, I love seafoods in there. The white wine they offered me was great, that absolutely reminded me of the very first wine I had in my life in Paris France. (After I ordered I quickly looked through the price for wine list, that  i guess was one of the expensive one there. it was too late) I felt little guilty after ordered as I had little suspicion that my company might offer for the payment. but Still, it was great wine that is pleasantly light and easy to drink, like water of heavenly grapes. The surprising thing is that they take only cash. (but they have ATM in their restaurant) Overall I had great time with their dishes and joyful conversations.
