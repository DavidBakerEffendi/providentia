The fries are good. The television is massive, and the employees and patrons alike are friendly and always ready for a conversation. They have a good selection of bottles (try La Fin Du Monde if you have a healthy wallet) and the atmosphere manages to be lively without being obnoxious. Oh, and did I mentioned the fries? They are GOOD. Also, the pita and hummus is a great cheap way to fill your vegetarian stomach or tease your vegetarian friend (due to personality issues, I am usually able to do both, even when alone). The juke box is the usual fare, the pool table gets the job done, and the plentiful bar and table seating makes the place good for a loner, a couple, or a rowdy reunion of felonious frolickers. Sorry, lost myself there for a moment. Only complaint: Get a lock on the Men's Room door. For balls sake, there's nothing like getting walked in on 5 or 6 times during a single pee session. Not to mention that courtesy flimsy-wooden-thing that blocks the interloper from actually spying your junk looks like it's about to fall out of the wall any minute. Guard my urination, New Wave, and I will be yours for life.
