I ate here last night with three friends and we all cleaned our plates! Two of us had the Red Curry, one had Vegetarian Delight and one had Crazy Noodles, all were excellent, and much cheaper than Circles. YES, the service was a bit amateur. The waitress was very young, didn't know what a wine key was, and didn't seem to know the ingredients of all the dishes (which we had to ask about because only some items on the menu had descriptions. And some are mislabeled- for example, the salmon dish is called "Black Bean Sauce"). Also, there didn't seem to be a bathroom for customers. Since I live half a block away that's not a problem for me. I will definitely be going back. As soon as I finished my Red Curry I wished I had another one, it was amazing! It had just the right amount of spice that I like without me even having to ask. Also, they were playing Top 40 radio in the dining room. Kind of weird. I had to call to find this out, but they are BYOB.
