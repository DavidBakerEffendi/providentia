Seriously? Wow. Came here with an Israeli friend, she said this is one of her favorite places for a taste of home. I had the most amazing pancakes of my life. I have no idea what was in them, maybe cormeal? Maybe potato? Wasn't anything normal, the taste was completely unexpected, right out of left field. I had the pancakes with sausage and goat cheese. WOW! AND, they made fresh lemonade, you can pick bitter or sweet (I am a bitter fan). We also got a hummus platter-thingy (which I ate most of) went reeeally well with my pancakes...GREAT place for brunch. My food baby was very satisfied with this amazing Israeli feat.
