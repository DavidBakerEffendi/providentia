Food was delicious ambiance was great.  I will definitely go back my only complaint is the wait staff was way to eager to clear out plates when there was still food on them.  My biggest pet peeve is when a server clears one diners plate while other guests are still eating.  During our second course we had 3 different people try to clear our plates.  That was very irritating.  And don't pick up the check until after the guests have left the table another no no.
