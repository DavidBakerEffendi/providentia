Holy Balls!!  The burgers are so juicy and tender, you barely have to chew them! Definielty one of Phillys top burger destinations, I can only give it four stars because of what I view as a fairly limited menu.  Additionally - not to be a duck fat fry grinch....but I wasn't that impressed.  Although I was blown away by the concept of duck fat fries the reality was fries that were super limp and soggy - not nearly as "knock your socks off" as I had expected.  The smores milkshake *was* divine - I use the word *was* because it was replaced by a red velvet flavor.  Boo!  Definitely give it a try - it's a great experience to add to your Philly burger repertoire.
