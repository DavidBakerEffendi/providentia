Overrated burgers. They're not bad, they're just nothing special for the price and the hype. 67 burger in Brooklyn is much better. The service was also terrible. They were nice but I ended up paying cash since it took more then 10 minutes to come get my credit card. Kind of touristy too, I would skip.
