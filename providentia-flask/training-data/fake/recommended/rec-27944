When I got to town, I had one thing that I wanted to eat more than anything else: good cuban food.  After about 2 hours of shopping around on Yelp, my friend says, "Look up Cafecito.  I think I remember that name in relation to good Cuban food."  We pulled up the reviews, got directions and headed out. When we got there we decided to sit at the street-side bar and eat there.  We had some spectacular mojitos (not too sweet, just right) and struck up a conversation with a woman next to us who was eating something that looked unbelievable.  We asked her what it was, and she told us it was the Vaca Frita, but that we should order it "extra crispy".  As we continued talking with her, she told us that she was living in LA now, but when she's in town she eats at Cafecito as many times as she can.  Definitely a good sign. Between the three of us, we ordered the Vaca Frita "extra crispy", the Churrasco, and the Masitas de Puerco.  When our food arrived, we stared at good size portions wondering what we would do with all the leftovers.  But as soon as we tasted our dishes, we knew that there wouldn't be any.  The food was perfect!  Everyone sampled all of the dishes, but everyone loved their own dish the most (a rare moment for sure). Overall, this was definitely one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time, and I will probably come back here whenever I'm in town.  Great job Cafecito!
