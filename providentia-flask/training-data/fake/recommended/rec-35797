Very cool looking place in one of my favorite corners in Philly, Headhouse Sq. First thing to notice, is they obviously have a killer tequila list. I chose to sizipp on some Don Julio up, and they delivered it with some tomato/Tabasco palette cleanser thing that was essentially a spicy virgin bloody Mary. Wonderful tequila and a nice touch. A drink is one thing, but the real deal is obviously the food. We started with the Vuelva a la Vida ceviche (scallop, squid, oyster, shrimp). It was pretty darn good, presented nicely with cilantro, onion, tomato, chile, and a tomato type sauce. Next up, I had the mixed grill, which was good, but nothing earth-shattering -- as my wife put it, "glorified fajitas". Again, not to say that it wasn't good, but really nothing great special for the price (most expensive on the menu). My wife had the enfrijoladas, which were disappointing tortilla wrapped veggies, with barely any veggies inside. Finished everything with the churros which as others mentioned, are radical. We were both kind of underwhelmed, but I'd go back to visit Don Julio again.
