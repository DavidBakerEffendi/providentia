For starters, I am going to say that you are NOT coming here for the quality of the food. You are going to come here for the convenience and the price of the food. The food here isn't great--probably only a step up from the pre-made food at H Mart. But I've been here countless times and I will continue to come here. Where else in midtown will I find kimbap, pay for it, AND still manage to run and catch the train all under 10 minutes? This place is so convenient for me, and the price isn't that bad (although it has increased in price over the years I've come here). So once again, this place gets high ratings because of how convenient it is and how low the price is... NOT because of the quality of the food.
