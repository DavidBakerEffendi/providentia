definitely a love-hate relationship. one of those places you always end up hitting up, but never really are blown away. although the margaritas usually result in nights that spiral out of control (in a good way!!!), the food is always a notch or two away from being "exceptional". located in a nice area to stumble around pre and post visit. definitely have to give the respect to this place for being consistent in all aspects, good or bad.
