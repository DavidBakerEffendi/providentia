This is the first time I am giving 5 stars. My husband and I ate here on busy Saturday night and sat outside right on Church St.  If you like to people watch and have great food, service and a delicious mix drinks all at the same time, this is the place to be. Great selection of food and beer.  We started with cucumber melon martini's which were very refreshing. We had calamari and scallops wrap with bacon for appetizers it was yummy. The calamaris had green leaves on top with a splash of balsamic vinegar.  It was very different but the calamari was cooked perfect (crispy). I know its summer but the clam chowder is also a must try.  Its one of the best chowders I've ever tried. For dinner, we order fish and chips and salmon with couscous.  Everything was excellent.
