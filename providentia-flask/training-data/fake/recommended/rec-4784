We refer to Khyber as our Cheers.  There's always a friendly familiar face to greet us, and they know our names!  The food is consistently great, the servers/bartenders are always knowledgeable of the menu (which there are different daily specials) and how to pair the best libation with your meal.   I am a beer drinker and I'm confident that there are few other establishments in Philly that can rival the Khyber's beer selection. Which changes weekly btw. My only challenge is that I always ask my server to surprise me with a beer of their choice so I never remember what I had the time before. The only parameters I request is the abv i.e. 7% or below.  Which often times 80% of the beer selection is well over 7%.  Generally when we go back, the options have changed but are always good. I wouldn't recommend going in looking for a Miller Light Draft.  They're proud beer connoisseurs and they may laugh but suggest a great local, light beer.   As for food, love the Bayona's duck sandwich.  I've had the actual duck sandwich at Bayona's in New Orleans and Khyber's is a pretty solid rendition.  The fried green tomatoes, crawfish etouffee, honey habanero chicken wings, bbq pulled pork sandwich the boudin and eggs for brunch are a few other favorites.  And for any of you veggie/vegan folks, I was told the chef was vegan for a few years so there are usually non-animal options on the menu.   As for cons...the only negative feedback I can give is when we walk into the bar or restaurant and it's so damn busy there's no room for us.  I'd like to think we have seats with our names on them and are bummed when reminded that we aren't the only Philly patrons who frequent the Khyber.
