I have been to Giorgio for a party of 2 just on a normal night and it is great. I went there for a birthday dinner with 16 others last night and they went above and beyond. Their food is always delicious and homemade. That is a given. The service though was some of the best I ever had. They dealt with all of us and were just amazing. Nothing was messed up. Things came out faster than I would expect for a big party, AND then as a surprise they gave us 6 free pieces of cake to share for the table. Awesome food, amazing people, and great experience. Highly recommend! So impressed.
