Clearly, the best water ice EVER, in the UNIVERSE, hands down, no questions asked, and if anyone disagrees, then they don't know good water ice.  I grew up in South Philly, on 9th and McClellan, and sure, there were other places to get water ice closer to the house, but we'd trek over to Italiano's because no one else's was quite as good (Pop's, however, is a very close second... I'll give them that).  Now, years later, I live in South Jersey, and am not above driving all the way into the city to stop at Italiano's on a nice summer night.   It always hurts my heart a little bit when people get all excited over Rita's Water Ice, thinking it's the best in the world and that Rita's alone is the one place you can find a great gelati.  WRONG.  Go to the place that INVENTED the freakin gelati - Italiano's.
