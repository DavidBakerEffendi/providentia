The service was impeccable and the drinks were delicious. Like this place better than Dos Caminos. We had some of the spicy guac which was delicious. Then we had the short rib quesadilla along with the tilapia and brisket tacos and overall it was very good. The portions were a bit small and were a bit expensive, hence a 4 star rating.
