Not that Mood needs another good review - but we are visiting from out of town and after finding Mood on Yelp we made it part of our vacation plans. Unfortunately we were still full from lunch and after telling that to the owner he steered us in a direction allowing us to have an experience without filling up. My husband,son and I shared a mango lassi and a lemonade lassi. We also shared a samosa chaat and a chicken chaat. He was very kind and chatted with us about the history of the food and his other restaurants. Luckily the busy dinner rush had passed and we were able to sit and enjoy our visit. Having this experience was a great ending to our day in Philly.
