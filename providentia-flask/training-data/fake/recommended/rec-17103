Place is amazing, just had some red snapper from there that fell off the bone. Literally, grabbed it by the head and was able to lift the whole spine with no effort off of the meat. Place gets crowded because it's such a hot spot but the food is top notch, atmosphere is amazing, and the waiters/waitresses are all really helpful. If I had to recommend one dish, I'd recommend them all....
