Sheep's Milk Ricotta, enough said. The Blue Crab w jalapeno is definitely worth getting as well. It was prepared differently than the last time my fiancee was there but impressive. I would highly recommend the Gigantone as well. Then we were able to get the Rib eye which was a special that night. It was stated to be for 2, but 5 of us shared it. It was perfectly prepared. Sheep's Milk Ricotta, period.
