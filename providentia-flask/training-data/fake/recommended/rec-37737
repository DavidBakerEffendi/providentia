Been to Philadelphia twice in the final quarter of this year. Stumbled upon this place while walking around near our hotel. Enjoyed the meat and cheese plate and wine. Decided we'd come back for a meal. Pizza was on point. So many pizza places don't seem to understand that if the dough isn't top-notch, the pizza it's made with can't be any better. These guys get the dough right.
