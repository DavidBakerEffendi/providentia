As a native Texan, I'm picky about my BBQ, and was skeptical when I heard a Texas BBQ joint was opening in the neighborhood. Needless to say, I had to go the week it opened. Since then, I have eaten at Morgan's almost once a week. Willie Nelson ought to write a song about it, it's that good. The meats are cooked to perfection, the sauce is just right - not too sweet or too vinegary like in some other (inferior) states, and the service is quick and friendly. I would be willing to wager it's the only place north of the Mason Dixon that serves both Frito Pie and Shiner Bock on draft, two Texas favorites. The sides are all good, from green bean casserole to the stuffed baked potato, and the desserts are simple, but done right (don't miss the bourbon pecan pie). My only request is that they serve more pickles, especially with the pulled pork (they're available if you ask). Overall, this is a terrific addition to the Brooklyn restaurant scene - a legit slice of the Lone Star State.
