Evan and his gnome were great hosts at this charming bar in a really cool, really old building that looks a bank (probably because it WAS a bank). I love me some exposed brick & friendly staff, so we were quite pleased when we ended up here as the last stop on the "OMG I live on the other side of the country and will be in PA so we must get together, catch up and drink WAY too much" evening. They have many a great brew on tap and in bottles. We opted for vodka. We drank and talked about gnomes,  iTunes technology and "Burning Man East" and looked around to see who that other person who had checked in on Foursquare was. A good time was had by all. Go for the cool building & décor. Stay for the atmosphere and great staff.
