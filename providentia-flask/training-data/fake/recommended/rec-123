Place was empty so I didn't have high hopes for a good sub. Boy was I wrong!! Â My son got 1/2 club sub and I got 1/2 meatball parm. The bread was fresh and the meatballs were like home cooking with delicious marinara sauce. The 1/2 subs were too big for either of us to finish. This place is highly recommended.
