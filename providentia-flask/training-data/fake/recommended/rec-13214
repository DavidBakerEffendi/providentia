This was hands-down the best pizza I've ever eaten.  I will always go back when I'm in NY.  I had a square pizza with mushrooms, sausage, and onion.  Since I live in California, I'm going to have to wait at least another 9 months to go back.   While he cuts it, he says, "Is this your pizza?"  Music to my ears...
