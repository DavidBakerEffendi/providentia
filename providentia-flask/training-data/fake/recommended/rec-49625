I went to Edi & the Wolf with a group of 7 people and it was really fun! Definitely make a reservation if you're coming with a group though! We were seated in the back "garden" area which looked like a creepy/cool greenhouse. It was much quieter back there though and a great spot for a larger group. The front of the restaurant was a little small, and I'm not always a fan of communal tables but the energy and atmosphere were good. As it got later in the evening, the front section of the restaurant seemed to be a really fun place to hang out and enjoy some drinks.     The food that I was able to try was wonderful! I wish I could have tried more of the smaller plates, but I  certainly didn't leave feeling hungry. My favorite dish there was the spatzle. It had such a great flavor and the portion size was generous. One serving is plenty for about four people to share. For my entree I got the Schlutzkrapfen (goat cheese ravioli) which was excellent. I thought the presentation was a little plain, but the flavors made up for it. I sampled my boyfriend's linguini with the mussels and clams, which was pretty good, but I'm definitely glad I got the ravioli instead. My friends at the table had great things to say about the pork belly and schnitzel, but I didn't get to taste them for myself.     Overall, the food was very rich, flavorful, and unique. I left feeling very satisfied and I would definitely go back again if the opportunity arose!
