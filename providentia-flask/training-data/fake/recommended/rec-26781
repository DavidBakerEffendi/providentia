My boyfriend knows that I absolutely love Asian food.  He took me here on a dinner date.   We both ordered bubble tea, he ordered passion fruit and I ordered the mango. It was the first time I have bubble tea and it was yummy.  we ordered the steamed pork dumplings and steamed juice buns.  Both were very fresh and flavorful, not to heavy like you expect from a take out Chinese place.  My boyfriend ordered the shredded beef specialty.  For him the spice was tolerable, but one bite had my mouth burning.  I ordered the chicken blossom which was not too spicy and came cut into blossom pieces which was cool.  The only thing I didn't like was that your only option was to have either white or brown rice with the dinner entrée.  I wanted noodles but they didn't offer a side of noodles.  We had to order an order of Chicken lo mein in order to get noodles.  Wait staff was nice and efficient.
