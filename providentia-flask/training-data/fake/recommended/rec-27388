food is def. a 5 star i went here with a few friends.. they really were giving us great service. only thing that bothered me was the amount of space, we had a party of 5 so why would you seat us on a table that only fits 4? so it was tough moving around and what not. however the appetizers to drinks and to the entree, everything was exactly like stated on the menu. will def. come back here again!
