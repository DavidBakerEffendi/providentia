First off, I will say that I've never gone to Green Eggs during "brunch" hours-- I've always eaten a light breakfast early in the morning and waited til around 2 to go for a later lunch. I have dreams about their Pork Belly Benedict. The cream sauce mixed with the saltiness of the pork is heaven. I've tried their buffalo chicken mac and cheese and duck reuben, which are also really good. Here's what's keeping me from giving 5 stars: the music is always way too loud and it can get pretty brutally cold while waiting for a table--- although that's usually absentminded patrons who don't realize that they've left the door wide open. I think the place could benefit from adding a little vestibule to the front, so those waiting a long time don't have to be subject to cold air every 5 seconds.
