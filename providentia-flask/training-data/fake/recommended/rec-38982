Apparently, this restaurant is popular for brunch. I went with a group of friends on a wknd night. Food is good, drinks are delicious (although very expensive). But the service is abysmally bad!! We waited a good 30-40min to have initial contact with our waiter after being seated. Another 30min to get our first drinks. No one would check up on us - even after we politely asked someone who looked like he was in charge to get us better service. There were 3 people by the door - but no one would even bother moving every time the door to the outside would be accidentally propped upon by an exiting-customer (with cold air rushing in). Again, food is good - but with all the restaurant choices in NY - it's just not worth the money to spend it on mediocre service when the staff simply doesn't care.
