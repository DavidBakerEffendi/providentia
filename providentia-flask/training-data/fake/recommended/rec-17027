A stylish space with 2 floors, providing attentive service and tasty food at a price higher than the many BYO establishments in Montclair, but not on the level of NYC. While the focus of this restaurant is on seafood, they do have a few options to provide for both carnivores and vegetarians.  The food is fresh, well seasoned and cooked to order, tastefully plated in a pretty presentation. One of my personal favorites is the crab cake.  It's a large enough portion size to share as an appetizer, but not large enough to satiate most as a main course.  Full of crab meat, with a light breading for consistency, and chunks of fresh corn, it is an exceptional rendition. I found the frito misto to be a touch over-fried and a tad oily.  I'd have preferred a lighter presentation.  Also, they could have been more generous with the portion size of the accompanying salsa verde, though I'd have ideally preferred a side of both the salsa and a traditional marinara.   Given the price points, I felt that you got more bang for your buck from the entrees as opposed to the Aps, with the brasserie plates providing the most value.  I also enjoyed sharing a few brasserie plates rather than just having a main to myself. The service is usually on point.  Attentive, but not intrusive, and on one experience we had a server brand new to the restaurant who could not have been better trained or prepared for her first weekend of work--impressive!   The cocktails are a little stiff.  Great for me, but perhaps a touch overwhelming for patrons who'd rather have a "lighter" drink. The decor is modern, and the space is nicely laid out.  The tables are not right on top of each other, and the ambiance is bustling, but not excessively loud.  I have yet to experience the upstairs lounge area, though if other reviews are on point, I'm sure it would be a great place to take in post-meal.
