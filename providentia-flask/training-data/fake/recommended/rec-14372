My go to place for a quick cheap filling noodle soup I love that they have options for choose from, whether it be the type of noodles, or if you even want noodle or soup, what kind of protein. I had my first taste with a take out.  It was the beef noodle soup with knife cut noodles and broccoli.  I remember that hearty comfy beef broth, so delicious and a bit fatty.   Since then, I have moved and now live 2 blocks away.  I have tried Fishball with pork meat Pork Dumplings Fujinese Wonton There is still more to try! I prefer the knife cut noodles over the hand pulled because you get the more doughy texture and its a little bit more slippery where as the hand pulled noodle...doesn't seem to be that out of the ordinary. My favorite thus far is the fishball with pork meat.  It is sooo good.  The fishball has a boing and you get a different seasoning and taste with the pork..its like 2 in 1!  The pork has a gravy like sauce and is a bit sweet. If you do a pickup, order through seamless to use your credit card but it is a cash only place. as of april 2014, the prices vary from 5.50-7.95 (for seafood noodles of course)
