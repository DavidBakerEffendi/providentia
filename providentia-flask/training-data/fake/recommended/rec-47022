The margaritas are tasty but a bit pricey for what you're getting. If I could plan out your meal, get either the De La Hoya or Bazooka guacamole to start with your El Vez margarita then get the Taco Sampler with your Corona. Don't bother with dessert and you'll leave happy. Both of the fish tacos (Mahi and Sea Bass) are great, the others are nice but can be bought else where for cheaper. Make a reservation and enjoy this Starr restaurant.
