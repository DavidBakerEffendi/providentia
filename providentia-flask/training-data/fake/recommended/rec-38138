Stopped here for lunch while on a road trip and loved it! You walk in and the U counter was full with people. We got a seat not too long after arriving and ordered. It was a tough decision as everything looked good. We sat on the far end so we got to watch him cook everything. The staff is friendly and willing to answer any questions as the menu does not have descriptions for certain things that you have no idea what it is. We ordered a gyro with sweet potato tots and a Texas Hot Dog with chili and side of fries. Everything was delish! I wish it was closer so we could go back for breakfast!
