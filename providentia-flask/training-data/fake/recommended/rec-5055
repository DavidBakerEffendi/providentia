This place gets really crowded. I went here to catch the later part of happy hour and dinner on a Friday evening a few minutes before 7 pm. There was a wait, but I was able to order a $5 margarita at the bar while waiting (happy hour price). once seated, i really realized that this restaurant is using every inch of space. In fact if you are a bit heavy I'd imagine that it would be difficult to get into some of these seats since little space is left in between tables. Our waitress was really nice as well. My friend insisted that we order a pitcher of margarita. After consulting with the waitres and learning (inaccurately) that each pitcher had 5 drinks in it, we decided to live Friday up a bit and go for it. However, that pitcher was huge and ended up pouring 8 full glasses. We needed a third person, but that wasn't available. I ordered the Plato Don, which provides a medley of different foods that you can make your own soft shell tacos with. The food was tasty and the serving was pretty large and screams, "share me". We struggled to finish that pitcher which felt like I was guzzling sugar water by the end. I'll definitely go back. It seems to be the new neighborhood hotspot.
