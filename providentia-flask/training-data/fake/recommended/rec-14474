I can't review the food yet because I just quickly dropped in (twice) today for coffee, but I can tell you that my cup-of-joe was the best I've had since moving here from CA.  This new place has about 20 tables, an outdoor counter, a bar (currently with one beer on tap), and a COFFEE DRIP RACK where all the magic happens.  For $2, enough beans for just one cup of coffee are freshly ground, added to a drip filter, and filled with hot water that  transforms this earthen product into a heavenly potion.  I noticed they had Bahn Mi (Vietnamese Sandwich)  on the menu (for $9) and several other sandwiches.  This place might become my regular pit stop on the drive to Fairway.
