All hail Cesar!  Chef Cesar Ramirez that is!  But don't call him a chef.  He prefers the title of"craftsman", the same way that Japanese cooks refer to themselves.  And boy, has this man mastered his craft.  It's like seeing an artisan practice his art at THE highest level. It's amazing the things that Cesar and his crew of 5 (2 sous chefs, 1 hostess/server, 1 sommelier, and 1 busboy) can do!  But then again, with only 18 seats at the Chef's Table, only 10 of which are served at any one time, the level of service remains at an impeccable and personal level.  The kitchen is completely open as the diners sit around a U-shaped stainless steel table and watch as Chef Cesar and his team make magic before our very eyes.  There's no white table cloths.  No pretentiousness.  Just some of the best food I've ever experienced.  And my new #1 in New York (move over Eleven Madison Park and make way Le Bernardin!).
