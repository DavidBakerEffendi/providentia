Very cute inside. They offer a pretty wide variety of sandwiches, including a handful of specials, and the typical "build-your-own"  on a pretty wide variety of breads/rolls/wraps. They also have a large selections of baked dessert-type treats. In particular, their black and white cookies are spot on.  A previous reviewer complained that they could never tell when the place was open, but they now have a sign saying they're open until 7pm  Wednesday through Friday. I walked in at 6:50 and they were happy to serve me. Having worked at a deli, I know how annoying it is to handle people who walk in just before closing, but they were very friendly and fully open for business.  I ordered a combo sandwich, which had about 0.4 lb of meat and came out to a little under $6.50. In this town these days, that seems like a pretty fair price to me. The vegetables were fresh, and the sandwich tasted great. I would definitely recommend this place to others, and happily eat there again.
