With a staff that looks and sounds like they where taken straight from the scenes of Criminal Records, Lovers & Madmen is a place that has enough appeal to be the next Starbucks but is cool enough to stay local. With a helpful staff, couches, and great food this is the place you and your friends should hang out at to discuss the lyrical styling of Radiohead. However, you probably should just order and sit back and relax. By the way the coffee isn't bad either.
