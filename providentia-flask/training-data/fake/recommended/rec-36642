I'm a fan of Ssam Bar and have tried it several times.  Without fail, the cured hamachi and brussels sprouts and the pork buns are the best dishes every time.  My dinner companions will always ask me why I insist on ordering these three small dishes to share at the table until they try them and understand the love.  Cured hamachi is has a buttery texture and yet is delicious with some crunchy stuff thrown on.  Taste the hamachi with the crunchy with the wasabi sauce all in one bite to make the dish reach the level of awesomeness that you would not believe.  The brussels sprouts must have a dozen random ingredients cooked with what was once a vegetable and has been turned into just some crazy tasty combination.  Other tables WILL look at your order of brussels sprouts and wonder what in the world it could be and then ask their waiter for their own portion.  The pork buns are absolutely required as an appetizer at any David Chang restaurant.  I don't care if you're there for a snack or lunch or dinner, these are just amazing pork belly with a perfectly fluffy bun.  If you don't order enough so that each person at the table gets their own pork bun there WILL be a fight.   My negative comments are reserved for the large plates.  I've never been that impressed with them and I've tried the rice cakes w/ sausage, the scallops and the duck.   Its always just good restaurant food and doesn't reach the insanely impressive level you get from some of those small dishes.   Finally, make sure you skip dessert and walk next door to stand with the masses at the Milk Bar for a piece of cake.  Not pie or cookies, just cake.  You can convince yourself that you're "walking off" dinner by standing while you eat your dessert.  At least that is my approach.
