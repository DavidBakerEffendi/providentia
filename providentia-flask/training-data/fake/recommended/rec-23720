Really good falafel for the area, and a variety of other tasty dishes. My favorite is the mixed grill, they are not afraid to get some saffron in the mix, which is clutch in those crucial lunchtime situations. Bonus points for a light pita/wrap that doesn't detract from the flavor of sandwich or fall apart while you are eating it. Only downside is gloomy staff and some things being a bit pricey on the menu.
