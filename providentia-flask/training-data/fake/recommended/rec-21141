Ippudo is the reigning king of ramen in NY. The buns are out of control and you cannot go wrong with any of the ramen bowls. Come hungry. The lines downtown are usually never less than a two hour wait, but the other location in the theatre district is much faster to get into. It's a great location for inexpensive, top notch food with fast, attentive service and cold Jpanaese beer.
