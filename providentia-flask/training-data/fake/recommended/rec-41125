I have all sorts of love for this place! Great food! Great service! Great ambiance! If we are in the area and hungry, I always try to grab a bite here. :) Never a bad choice for either a sit in lunch on the adorable patio or a quick bite to grab and go. Love hanging out in the garden during the summers, the trees offer cooling shade from the heat and the umbrellas offer protection from the falling leaves. The seating is plastic lawn chairs so it's decent enough for an hour lunch. My parents loved this place and that's coming from restaurant folks! The Meguez Plate is by far my favorite! They have freshly baked warm pitas brought to the table with your meal and it's lovely. This place really knows how to cook fresh and delicious! They also have this very refreshing mint tea to enjoy after your meal. Perfect touch!
