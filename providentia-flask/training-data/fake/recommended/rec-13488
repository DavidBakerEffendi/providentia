Go on a weekday if you can to avoid the weekend brunch crowds and 'round the block lines.   The Brioche French Toast is incredible - absolutely the best I have ever eaten.   The texture is so light and fluffy, without any trace of 'eggy' aftertaste.  I would struggle to make French Toast as good at home.  I would love to know their secret! The Maple Butter served alongside is delicious.  You literally have to hold yourself back from licking the plate clean. The Eggs Benedict were also very good, they are served on Buttermilk Biscuits which are also delicious thanks to their buttery, flaky texture.   This place is busy and it is noisy, so don't come here for an intimate date, unless you are prepared to shout across the table or have those in your vicinity in on your conversation. Staff are courteous and attentive.  Depending on your location, this place can be a little out of the way, but is well worth the effort to get to.
