I've had a lot of pizza around NYC and I must admit that I was sceptical that such atouristy place as lombardi's could have great pizza.  but I was oh so wrong.  While not the best pizza i've ever had, it's very close. Crust is perfect, sauce is great, and cheese is awesome.  Despite the tourist impression of this place, its a very high quality pie.
