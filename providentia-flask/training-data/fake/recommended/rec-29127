The food here is okay, the service here isn't. Out of the three times I've been there, two of the times the service was horrible. The first time I went there I was seated in an empty section with my friend. The server came promptly, but we weren't ready yet, so we asked her for a few minutes to look over the menus, well, she never came back. We saw her go over and check her only other table a few times, and then stand behind the bar doing absolutely nothing. After 15-20 minutes of sitting there, waiting to be helped, we just left. The other time, the server didn't come for at least 15 minutes. It wasn't even busy. Even though I like the deserts here, I only would come here if I had extra time to sit and wait on waiters who don't seem to really care to be there.
