I just got home from an amazing dinner at Frankie's 457 and I have to say: I lurve this place.  I guess coming at a non-peak hour is key: my boyfriend & I happened to be feelin' hugries just before 5:30pm & were seated immediately.  (However as the night went on, we heard the host telling people it would be over an hour and a half wait!)  I found the staff to be very professional & attentive.  The *best* part of the night was the pork braciola marinara - O M G it was unreal.  So perfect with a glass of the house red.  My boyfriend had the lentil soup with smoked bacon and that was delish too - very smoky and bacon-y.  Can't wait to come back!
