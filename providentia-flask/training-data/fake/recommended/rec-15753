I loved their Pizza's we had three and it's thin crust and it just melts in your mouth, we ordered the Margarita , the house special and the Bee Sting pizza all were awesome..this little tiny hole in the wall joint in the middle of Brooklyn, NY is Roberta's they have tables's inside and outdoor seating too..Great drinks and great atmosphere i really enjoyed the coffee also..
