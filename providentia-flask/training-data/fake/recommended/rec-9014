Uhhhh you guys? I think this place is called Lam Zhou, not Lan Zhou. At least that's what it says on the triangular plastic mini billboard thingie they put on the street, right outside the door. As for the food, I echo everyone else: it's delicious! It's amazing! Awesome. Ghetto. Good. Dump. Hole in the wall. Thin dumpling skin. Cheap. Blah blah blah. I mean this place is bomb and all, but they weren't the best noodles I've ever had. Actually they were a tad dough-y. The dumplings, sides (pickles) and condiments are where it's at!
