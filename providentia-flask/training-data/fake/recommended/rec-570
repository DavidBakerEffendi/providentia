This place is very delicious, if you're in the area(and even if you're not) you should try it! I went with my friend and we split a pitcher of sangria, beef empanadas, pork skewers, calamari, mussels, and an almond tart. Everything was great. The waiters were friendly and attentive, and we ended up staying long after our meal was done to finish our sangria (and nobody was hovering over us to see if we were finished). The only reason I gave it a 4 as opposed to a 5 is because all of this together was $30 a person, and I don't think it was filling enough to be that much. But hey, everything else was great, and the sangria was especially delicious, so I'd say it was worth it in the end.
