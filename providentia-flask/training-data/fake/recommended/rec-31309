This was fantastico. Got 2 pitchers of sangria, seafood paella for 2, a fish dish with shrimp and clams all to split. Portions were huge and everything tasted so good. So much seafood, the paella had an entire lobster in it...rare to see. Service was great. Was a little loud but what do you expect at an authentic Portuguese restaurant. If this was in the city, I'd throw all my dinner parties here. Only complaint and it's barely one, is that the sangria may have been too sweet, it's been a few hours and my stomach feels a little like the morning after a frat party and too much jungle juice back in College (not that I drink jungle juice...I'm a guy).
