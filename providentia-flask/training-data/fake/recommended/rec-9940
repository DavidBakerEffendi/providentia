This is my go-to/ (small) crowd pleaser pick in the Midtown West/Hell's Kitchen area. It's an exciting hole in the wall place painted in bright green, red, and yellow. It fits no more than 20 people, with a sliver of bar top seating to keep the space lively or extremely cramped-- take your pick. During the warmer months, they'll have a table or two out on the sidewalk and fit another 2-4 people outside. It gets crowded on weekend evenings around dinnertime-- its a popular place (700+ reviews and counting kind of gives it away, no?). I suggest you get there early or be prepared to wait a bit. The food is great-- well priced and delicious. I usually go for the Cuban, Brasil, and Spicy Chicken empanadas. All are extremely flavorful and go amazingly with the chimichurri sauce... or maybe its the other way around. I might be biased. The plantain chips with guacamole are delicious, I don't know how else to describe it. They're crispy/crunchy and go perfectly with the smooth and tangy flavor of the guac. I'm drooling just thinking about it-- excuse me! Also, if the empanadas aren't enough, they have a yummy arroz con pollo (chicken & rice) dish served with a side of fried sweet plaintains that will fill you right up. The chimichurri sauce (the green one) goes with everything. Maybe except for the dessert empanadas-- which, are definitely worth a try if you're not full by then! But then again... there's ALWAYS room for dessert. By the way, did I mention its 24/7?
