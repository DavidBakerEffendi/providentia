BY FAR the best pizza in this area. The sandwiches have room for growth...but for a pie, this is the place to go. It doesn't hurt that the prices are amazing and the staff are very friendly, efficient and generous. My husband and I stopped here for a late dinner once, ordered a few slices, and they gave us a whole pie for the price of 4 slices since it was near closing time!
