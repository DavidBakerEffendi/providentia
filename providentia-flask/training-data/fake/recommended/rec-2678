Love this place! We eat here at least 1 x a week and are never disappointed. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but the calamari are a really good way to start. Lunch specials are $10 and are the same size as ordering off the normal menu, just make sure you bring cash for the lunch specials. Also, place is BYOB and discounted menu after 10PM. Eat here.
