"Typical Bar Pie"....that is a Vanishing thing of BEAUTY~! No one makes them any more and Since Patsy DiAngelo passed away, Bayonne hasn't had a bar pie as great as this! If they took everything else off the (really nice) Menu, I wouldn't mind as long as you can get a good Bayonne Bar Pie. I am a fan of Lees Tavern in Staten Island, but this is another genre. Lees makes amazing "other" pies, but for an authentic thin simple Bar Pie, Starting Point is the place to be~
