Just came home from a wonderful meal at this great new find. We had the flag ship dish, pho dac biet #26 and rice with grilled pork, shredded pork, and egg quiche #45 in the expansive menu. We also had the spring rolls for appetizer. Â Everything was authentic tasting and awesome tasting!! We are definite going to be regulars here for sure. I'm bringing friends here for lunch this Friday. Place is nice and clean with plenty of parking. Good portions and pricing is on par with other vietnamese restaurants.
