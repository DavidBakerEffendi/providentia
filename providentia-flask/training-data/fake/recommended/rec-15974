Very good restaurant. As everyone has already mentioned, the Spicy Duck Meatballs were awesome. I had the duck for my entree, also great. Although I'm very curious about the hangar steak. My girl had the lamb shank. She enjoyed it. We had the Brussels sprouts as a side. They were good. Â  We had the doughnuts with some ice cream for dessert. Very tasty. They have an outstanding wine list, and some great cocktails. As far as ambiance, it's harmless. It's a very "safe" restaurant. Nothing gimmicky. I mean that in a good way. Sometimes you just want a nice quite restaurant. I would consider it for corporate dinners or with clients. Cheers.
