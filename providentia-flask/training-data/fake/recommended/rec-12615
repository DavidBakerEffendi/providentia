Chef  Massoud is genius! Loved all the mezzas-appetizers!! The duck shawarma, which we ordered as mini were absolutely delicious!! Tabouli was super good, not too watery or sour like the rest but just right. The kibbeh was on point! Best was the labneh, pita, and garlic whip; they just start the meal off so well. Next go with the almost any main dish, you can't go wrong! We go the lamb chops, steak and lentil beef stew! Extra yummy! As for dessert, we got a couple, the yogurt cheesecake with mango sorbet was amazing! The candy bar was rich and satisfying, just like the hazelnut soufflé. Then there was a cheese and filo cake thing with the most delicious syrup that you would fill into a pita! The ultimate savory combination. You can't go wrong here!
