I'm pretty enthusiastic about Toloache.  Most of the items I've tried in my two visits have been solidly flavorful.  The item that has stood out the most so far is the guacamole frutas.  The guacamole itself is immensely savory, while the sprinkling of mango and pomegranate acts as tiny jewels of sweetness interspersed.  The resulting contrasts in flavor and texture result in a truly novel twist on your typical guac experience.
