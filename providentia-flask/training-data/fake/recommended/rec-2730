The husband and I had an amazing dinner there on Friday night. Nice dining room with great ambiance. We started with a special tuna appetizer and the beet and mushrooms. Both were delicious and very well-balanced. For dinner, we had the stuffed skate wing (delicious and the star of the evening for me) as well as the pork. The pork was inventive, prepared three ways and accompanied by a bean cassoulet. My only critique would be to add a green to the dish, possibly some kale, to help brighten and lighten it up. Ample portions- both of us were stuffed. They had two beers on tap, one of which was a steal for $5! It was over 10% and a nice pour, the hubby had that. Â I chose the Cab Franc which was nice. For dessert it was banana pudding, which as other reviewers described was delic! I think what really made the night stand-out for us was our server. She was amazing- attentive, helpful, and incredibly personable. Small place so reservations are a must, but they do reserve 4 or so bar seats for walk-ins which is good to know.
