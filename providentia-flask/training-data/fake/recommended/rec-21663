I've lived in near Italian Touch for about seven years now and because of its proximity and because some other nearby pizza places were awful, I ordered the pizza, usually for delivery. It was always fine, but never great, and I know there were some people who never really liked it. Recently, however, Italian Touch changed ownership to its original owners, who first owned this restaurant before I moved to the neighborhood. Since that occurred, I have to say that the food has improved greatly. I really enjoy the taste and the variety of the pizza. My family has also eaten several times in the restaurant itself and enjoyed good portions and tasty food. Make no mistake. This is a typical neighborhood Italian Restaurant with a menu to match. You won't find anything fancy, but what you do find is great to eat. In addition, the owners are very friendly and always welcoming and thankful for your business. If you have not been to Italian Touch in the few months prior to this review, you likely went under the old ownership and should return. I heartily recommend it.
