Wow - a great place, with really good prices.  Sliders are $2, or $2.75 with bacon, a huge portion of shoestring fries (twice as much as a probably needed) is $3, and a good beer $4 (I had a Spaten lager).  Next time I'll try one of their milkshakes.   The atmosphere is hip but friendly - I ate the the bar and had a good time.  They also have tables in the back. The burgers themselves are very good for burger lovers - not overcooked thank god (pink in the middle) and you can really taste the meat and the grill.  The onions probably could have been a little more cooked or a little less stringly, but that's a small point.  They're served on potato rolls, my favorite.
