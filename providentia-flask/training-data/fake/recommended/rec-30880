Amazing tapas! The best I've had in NYC. You would think a Spanish tapas joint would have a better selection of Cava... they only had two, one of the a rose, but that was forgivable. The lamb skewers were friggin' fantastic, as were the patatas bravas. It was just good food, a good vibe, an all around great experience.
