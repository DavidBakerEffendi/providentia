Came back last night to celebrate our Anniversary. Best octopus I have EVER eaten. It was divine! The oysters again were amazing as always, fresh as fresh can be. I felt like I was back living near the ocean again as I was eating them. The blackened mahi-mahi was seasoned perfectly. We love Blue Point!
