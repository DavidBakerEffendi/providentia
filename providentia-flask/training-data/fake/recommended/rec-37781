One of my favorite restaurants in the city! Great service and food. Been here a few times, but tonight my friends and I all shared the small plate-eggplant parm, two salads- warm shrimp avocado and the beet salad and two pizzas- the Joey and the stache. Everything was fresh and delicious. Even the cocktails. We tried the savannah, the sangria and the tequila daisy. Definitely have to check this place out if you haven't yet. You won't be disappointed!
