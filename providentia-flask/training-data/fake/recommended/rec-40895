I just moved around the corner from this amazing little eatery. We have been two days in a row and I'm going back this morning. They are friendly and the short menu is very well crafted (although there is no vegetarian dinner entree). They have 3 great salads to choose from (kale, spinach, and mesclun). The duck torta was amazing and the spinach omelet was not dry which is rare in my experience. I think the price point is perfect for the quality and amount of food you get. 5 stars!
