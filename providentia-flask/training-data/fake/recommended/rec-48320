This place is amazing! The ingredients are fresh and high quality which is really important to me. I don't think I have had one thing I didn't like. The service is awesome also, I never even have to tell the male waiter my order, he remembers my usual every time I come in and even what I drink. My only complaint is that I have had some pretty bad experiences with one of the female waitresses. There are two female servers, they are pretty easy to tell apart. One is college age, tall and petite looking, she is really friendly and does an amazing job every time I come in. The other one is a bit shorter, probably late 20's early 30's and not quite as petite, every experience with her has been horrible. I'm not sure if it's bad luck or what, but every time I get her as a server I feel like leaving less then 20%. The last time I had her was pretty much the last straw for me. I came in with my father who was visiting from out of state. When we sat down we were the only table, then a table of 4 and a table of two sat down shortly after us. She did see that we sat first, but it didn't stop her from taking the table of four's order first. That table had their order taken and drinks served before we even had water on our table. It took that table about 30-40 mins to eat and leave. It took my father and I, 1 hour and 45 mins to eat and leave, 20 mins of that was me waiting for the check after I asked her twice for it. Like that all wasn't bad enough, to top it off she wasn't even very friendly. I'm sorry but almost 2 hours to eat at a sandwich place is unacceptable! I would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for that server but I have to take one star away because of it.......I wish that wasn't the case because the food is amazing!!! I will keep coming back, but if I see her working I will go elsewhere.
