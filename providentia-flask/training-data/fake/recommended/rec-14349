How did I live in NYC and only discover this place AFTER moving to LA? FML! The owner is authentic, from Sicily & you can taste it on the pizza! If you order anything but the deep dish pepperoni , you are CRAY! Pizza was beyond epic! Small, crowded but don't let the line scare you... It's worth the wait!
