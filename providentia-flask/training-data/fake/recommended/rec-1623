Easter Sunday, and my boyfriend and I along with our friend were able to be seated as soon as we walked in around lunchtime. As they were observing Passover, they were both very excited to see Matzo ball soup on the menu. Both said it was good but wished there were celery and carrots in the soup. I ordered my usual breakfast: sausage, eggs, toast, and potatoes. Solid. I tried my boyfriend's grilled cheese. Good. I was impressed they were able to seat people almost as soon as they came because the place was crowded. I didn't think it took long for food to arrive, and I thought service was pretty good considering the lunch crowd.
