I've been to Northern Spy Co. for their "Sunday Supper" special several times and have rarely been disappointed. If your feeling adventurous just head in around dinner time on any given Sunday and prepare to leave feeling satisfied. It's always different, and pretty decent for the $24 price tag. Â Starter salad, entree, and dessert. It can get busy, so if you have more than 2 in your party, call ahead to make a reserv.
