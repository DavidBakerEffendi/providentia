Went here for a GNO last night and had a great time.  Love the decor, nice laid back vibe, attentive service and reasonable prices.  The pecan crusted brie was fantastic and my lobster tacos were ok, nothing particularly memorable or exciting. The final bill for the four of us, which included 3 bottles of wine (and a couple extra rogue glasses for some of my more, ahem, guzzle-lier friends, only came to about $120.  While I won't return just for the food, I'd definitely go back with friends if asked.
