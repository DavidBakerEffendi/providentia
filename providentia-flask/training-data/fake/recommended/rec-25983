I've eaten here about 10 times over the last couple of years. I love the casual vibe and the service has always been great. Food is reliable, although the menu is somewhat limited and is very heavy. Wish they had some lighter fair. Also very inflexible in terms of the menu (can I have a sale on the side - I will pay extra: no). Shines brightest on Sundays with its Sunday fried chicken dinner which is sensational ($20 a person) I prefer the bar area to the restaurant bit in the back. I think this is slightly pricey compared to other places, but not too bad.
