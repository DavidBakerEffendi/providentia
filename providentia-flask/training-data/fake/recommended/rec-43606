Finally went to Salt & Fat after a recommendation from an old co-worker a couple of years ago and boy am I happy that I did!! The place itself is small, cozy and unassuming. Both the waitress and hostess were very friendly letting us know popular items on the menu etc. So where to start???.... Well bacon fat popcorn is as good a place as any...yes you heard that right!! Instead of a boring bread basket they start you off with a cute brown paper bag filled with this deliciously baconee popcorn, yummm. I was disappointed to learn that they took the crack and cheese off the menu, but y fiance and I shared the Yellowtail tartare, Scallops, Korean BBQ Wraps and the Fried Chicken. Everything was delicious I loved the tartare it was fresh and had a great heat to it. Â The carrot puree with the perfectly seared scallops were excellent and the hanger steak in the BBQ wrap was cooked and seasoned perfectly. My fiance loved the fried chicken, I think for me after the first 3 dishes being so light that once I got to the fried chicken it was a little to heavy but flavor was great. Finished off with the rice krispies and marshmallow ice cream that was aaaaaaamazzzzing!! Probability of return: Highly likely
