NEVER EVER EAT HERE! Dark, depressing interior, terrible food and unfriendly service, We were the only people dining, the remaining 11 people were "comedians" about to perform unfunny comedy. Waitress was rude, and the food was disgusting. We ordered 2 veal dishes that tasted like rubber, and the food wasn't hot. What a waste of a $29 groupon - I wanted to leave immediately. An overall horrible and depressing evening. Please, do not eat here!
