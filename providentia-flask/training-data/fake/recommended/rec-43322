I've seen Rutt's Hut on TV a bunch of times so I figured to try them out since I was right down the road. Honestly you gotta really love hot dogs to come here, REALLY LOVE HOT DOGS. The hot dogs by themselves aren't that good.  I was so disappointed, it felt like the California Taco place in Omaha, were it had a ton of reviews, rated high, and I didn't like at all.  The only difference I see with these dogs and everyone else's is that these are rippers, deep fried until they literally rip. Other than that it's just another plain hot dog experience.  The hot dog was plain. The relish was pretty good but not enough to improve the hot dog for me. Once again another cash only place for a decent food place. Maybe try something else on the menu and not their hot dogs or just avoid the place. Their hot dogs are about $2.  Would I be back, maybe not but they were friendly.
