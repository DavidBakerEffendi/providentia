This place is super super yummy. My favorite is the mashed potatoes. The steaks are delicious, but you might not have any room for them after eating as many of those delicious rolls with sweet cinnamon butter! The service is always good here-friendly and fast. The staff seems to enjoy their job. Definitely worth checking out while in CT!
