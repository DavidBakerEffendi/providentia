I had such high hopes for this place. I've passed by Saxon + Parole on many occasions and there always seemed to be a lot of people and it looked very nice. I came one evening with my family to give it a shot and was disappointed. The food is not bad, but not stellar. Many of their dishes are quite heavily flavored, sometimes too much. My mother had the Green Goddess salad that was dressed very saltily, we also ordered a side of brussels sprouts that was drenched in honey, way too sweet. On the other hand my brother ordered a New York Strip Steak that was tender and cooked very well. My father and I ordered scallops that were good but not spectacular, I've had very good tender scallops for a very similar price and they were only mediocre in my opinion. I was hoping that their food was as impressive as their atmosphere, which is actually very well done. Their interior is beautiful and a lot of attention was paid to it. Their bar looked like a great place to have drinks, and I noticed on their menu that they seemed to specialize in liquor drinks (Whiskey, cognac, and others) and cocktails more than their food. Their layout and decor make it a really great place to mingle, which is why I had such high hopes. Their staff was also very friendly and service was quite good, their food was the thing that left me disappointed. They did mention that their menu is seasonal and so are their drinks. It seems to me that this is more of a place to grab a drink with friends and stay for a while if your wallet can take the beating (since their prices are on the higher end). I might come again to do just that when I can spare the money, but I'm afraid I won't be returning for a meal anytime soon.
