My friends and I had a great time at ECR on a Thursday night. We got exactly what we were looking for-- a place to down some drinks and eat some tasty low-key food. The menu's variety was appreciated by vegetarians and carnivores alike. Our waitress was super friendly and fully attentive--kept the drinks coming at the perfect pace. I thoroughly enjoyed my shrimp taco salad--wasn't amazing, but hey, it's a taco salad. If I lived near ECR, I would definitely be a regular.
