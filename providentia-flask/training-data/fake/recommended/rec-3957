I cannot say enough good things about Tom's pancakes, waffles, and omelets.  On very rare occasions, you may get an undercooked pancake or egg.  But where Tom's really shines is the service.  You get treated better here than at many "starred" Manhattan restaurants.  Also, they make the best egg creams I've had anywhere.
