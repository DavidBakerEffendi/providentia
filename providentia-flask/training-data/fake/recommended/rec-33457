Hands down my favorite restaurant - it never disappoints! Great food, great atmosphere. Some nights I binge on tapas. My favorites are the bacon wrapped dates, octopus, and falafel wrapped artichokes. Other times I go with the evening special - fish dishes are always stellar. I bring ALL my out of towners here to help them fall in love with Brooklyn. Fantastic brunch spot too.
