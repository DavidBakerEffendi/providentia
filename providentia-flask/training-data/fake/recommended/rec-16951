Best burgers in Hillside!!! Surprisingly, there are many good places to eat in this township. IMO burger is one of them. My friend and me had no big expectations when we walked in for lunch, but were delighted with the quality of the food. Delicious, healthy and very unique. Excited to try something new next time!
