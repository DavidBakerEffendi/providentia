Hipster vibe: bearded waiters in plaid shirts and skinny/straight jeans in an industrial chic interior accented by Edison light bulbs.   Seems like a cute date place though it gets way too noisy to really hear the other person.   Lots of different beers on tap.  Tried the: Evil genius turtle power grapefruit pale ale - bright hops and citrus.  Very yummy. Food is good. Tried the: 1) beet salad - good single portion with plenty of beets.   2) St Louis rib appetizer - sweet and just shy of fall-off-the-bone.  Still had some nice teeth to the meat.   3) 3 cheese platter - had thus as my dessert.  Good selection of cheese but after dinner, it was a bit heavy (of course I went for the heavier cheeses too, so...yeah).   Great service. Amiable staff.
