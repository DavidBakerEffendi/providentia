The name is pretty good. I only went to the bar downstairs and didn't eat, so this is only based on that.  The area is pretty small and not a great place to have a conversation, but it's ok overall.  Nothing special.  Kind of an older crowd (like - over 30...40...50 even). The two downstairs girl bartenders are pretty rude - definitely 1.5 star worth of rude.
