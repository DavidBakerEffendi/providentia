Fantastic location, friendly service, and great food. The outdoor deck has a beautiful view under the bridge over the river, and it feels like you're in the city yet not in the city. They have a spacious parking lot, although it happened to be full when we came. We ordered a meat and cheese plate to start, and three pizzas, all of which were delicious. They had a decent selection of drinks, and I just love the way the deck was set up. I would definitely return. We brought two small children, and they were very accommodating and our server was very friendly but not overbearing or annoying.
