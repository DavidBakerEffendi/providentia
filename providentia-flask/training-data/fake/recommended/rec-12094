The service out shined the food by far. Everyone we encountered was so attentive, knowledgeable, and personable. It seemed like they sincerely enjoyed working there. The food was incredibly over salted to the point where I was going through water like a fish. I could only eat 1/3rd of my suckling pig. Definitely not impressed.
