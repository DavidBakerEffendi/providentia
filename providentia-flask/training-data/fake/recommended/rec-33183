First of all! How awesome are the people in this restaurant? I must not get out often because, to me, their service was exceptional! The best I've had so far. My friends and I went here for a birthday dinner. This is what we ordered: Appetizers: Guacamole: Holy Mole! Amazing! The waiter was nice enough to share the secret of this buttery, tasty, cheesy (yes it has cheese) delicious guac, but I won't tell you, you have to go and try it yourself! We were scraping the bowl with the chips for more. Tacos de Pescado: Perfectly cooked pieces of tilapia in a tiny tortilla. Very tasty. Yucca: Very good, but would have loved if they were the pieces of yuca itself. Dinner: Lechon: Served with yucca puree, chicharron and a delicious sauce that left me wanting to eat birthday girl's plate. Arroz con Pollo: My friend ordered this and she found it okay. I had a taste and it was very flavorful, but not out of this world. Moqueca "Brazilian Paella": This was my plate. it came out super hot so it took me a long time to finish. I'm glad I did. It was so tasty that I did not want it to finish. My friend who ordered the arroz con pollo used some of my broth for her rice. It was so good! And finally... Yes, we had the Poquito Picante. We looked at it. We smelled it. We questioned it. And we loved it! Now, go! Enjoy some Yerba Buena!
