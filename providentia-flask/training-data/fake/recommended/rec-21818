a friend and i went for RW. between the two of us we had the baba gannouj, falafel, chankleech, and grape leaves for starters.... the beef and lamb kebobs for entrees.... and the achta and ilili candy bar for dessert.... for drinks we had the phoenician lemonade and the from beruit with passion... wow! everything... and i mean... everything was delicious. for non rw menu, i'd say it's a bit pricy for what it is... also, the cocktails during happy hour were $6 and when we ordered our second round at the table they were $18! (either that or they mischarged us) the space and the service were both excellent. all and all, i will definately be back. probably for happy Â hour. but still... a great joint.
