I really do hate when my husband has to pay for crappy and pathetic food. This place sucks on the biggest level of sucky food. We sent back the seafood salad because it had no seasoning or flavor. Also, for $19 their should not be seafood sticks in it. The scallops and calamari tubes were this sponge like material. YUCK!! The service was also lacking and the place looked like it needed a make over. Oh, as soon as we were seated the pizza guy with the screwed up teeth, kept giving me dirty looks as he chewed his gum like a damn cow. In my almost 20 years in the food service industry, this has to be one of the worst meals ever!! Absolute crap!!
