I wanted to take my lover on a nice date. Thai is one of her favorite foods so I did my research and found Bodhi Tree. We walked passed it without noticing at first. When we finally found it, we realized we've passed this little gem several times when in the area. Can't believe we never saw it before!     We walked in and the host was amazing from that moment on. He let us choose a seat by the open doors towards the front and was very patient as we decided what we wanted to eat. He never bothered us throughout our time there, always checked on us with his eyes. Whenever he met mine he knew to come over and help us with whatever was needed. I appreciated this. Nothing irks me more than a host who constantly checks on me, not giving me my privacy with whom I'm with or the time to see if anything is wrong to begin with.     The food was by far the best Thai food I've had in a long time. It didn't take long to come out and the presentation was delightful as well as the taste. My date and I left very satisfied with our meals and our time at this lovely place. I will definitely be coming back to try more of what's on the menu.
