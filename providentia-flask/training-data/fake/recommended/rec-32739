4.5/5 A Korean Japanese restaurant in West Hartford. Decor is nice. Customer service has improved greatly over time. Usually there are plenty of tables for you to choose from and you don't need to wait for other customers to finish. Personally, I would recommend the Korean food over the Japanese food, but you can order either/both.
