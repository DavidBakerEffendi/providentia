So far, they are my favorite spot in NYC for fried chicken. Like many places, their chicken is fried perfectly. The meat is juicy and tender; the thickness and the crunch of the crust is just right, not too thick as if you were just eating the batter. What makes their chicken mind blowing is their seasoning on the Hot or Extra Hot. It is spicy but I can't stop eating it. Must. Have. Another. Bite. Arrgghh, hot-hot-hot! Put that on repeat. Their Shrimp and Grits are also great. The grits are cheesy and creamy, they are so good I can eat just a full plate of that. Their sides are fantastic: The collard greens are probably the best ones I have ever had, not too salty nor bland. You can taste the slight smokiness in the broth it was cooked in. Mashed potatoes, perfect if you are a garlic lover. Bacon-Potato Salad, well it is bacon, potato, salad. No imagination needed. The staff of Peaches Hothouse are unpretentious and they are always nice with a smile even when the place is packed. The restaurant is small and serving the food like they do (delicious and well priced), it is guaranteed to attract a crowd. So fyi, there might be some wait if you come during the rush hour. p.s. Thanks to Wing L. for putting this place on my radar.
