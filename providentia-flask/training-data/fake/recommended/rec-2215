My husband decided to stop by Geno's on our drive back to Maryland from New Jersey. He heard all these great reviews about it. So we were excited about trying it out. Well the food was not what we expected. I've tasted better philly subs where I live in Maryland. This restaurant has all the hype because it has been here forever, but they lack to deliver quality food. The steak was bland and the fries had an awful after taste. So I was truly disappointed!!!! Maybe since they have been here for so long they don't put as much effort into the taste. There are only 2 types of sandwiches: one with provolone cheese and the other has American cheese (which is basically Cheese Wiz) and both have onions. I have never once eaten a philly sub that required me to add ketchup because of it being so dry. The provolone cheese sub was so dry!!!! Who would ever think about putting cheese wiz on a philly sub??? The only reason why this tasted better to me was because it wasn't dry. I could care less for neither one of them. Does anyone ever come out to clean those tables? They all were filthy. On top of the wind blowing all of our napkins on the ground, we had to sit at a dirty table. Bring some Clorox or Lysol wipes with you if you plan to eat here.
