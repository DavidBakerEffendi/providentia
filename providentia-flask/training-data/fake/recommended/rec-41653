Delicious, fresh and carefully prepared food, served by friendly French people. The menu changes daily based on seasonal market availability.  The chef is meticulous and treats each plate with care and attention to detail. I had the market salad, fresh seared fish with corn and tomatoes. The hanger steak with frites might be common but in the hands of this chef, it is memorable. Those frites are fried in duck fat, crispy on the outside and soft within. Yum. The menu contains some  adventurous selections and the desert selections are also tasty. The young french owners are making a go of this place in the iconic former home of the beloved Zucco, who ran his Le French Diner successfully for years. If you loved Zucco, you owe it to yourself to give this new version a try before the lines form out the door.
