Maybe I need to get out more, but aside from one veggie burger (my first and last) I have never had a bad meal there.  The crowd that's in Claire's is usually a large one so I'm surprised by the negative reviews.  Either the reviewers are off, or no one is paying attention.  I agree it's a bit pricey, but they're not a soup kitchen.
