Fantastic little restaurant! If you want to try a great breakfast while walking around Philly that's a 15 minute walk to the historical sites, choose this one!  My friends and I wanted to get a quick breakfast while in the city and yelp had this at 4.5 Stars-- was not disappointed. I had the pick your own brunch , chose the eggs over easy with cheddar and goat cheese on top of bacon and ham. My gf had the eggs Benedict over homemade cornbread.. Amazing!   Things to definitely get -- chocolate chip scones!! Best scones I've ever had!! Things to watch out for-- small space, so get a reserved table! Will definitely  try this place again.
