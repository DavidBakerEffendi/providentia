Overpriced poor quality food. The decor is cool though. The ingredients tasted like they came out of a can with very little spice. There were barely 4 small glasses of margarita in a pitcher. And at the end of the meal the waiter tried to entice us to wait on a list to go see some private back bar..just seems like it's about charging as much as possible and offering very little.
