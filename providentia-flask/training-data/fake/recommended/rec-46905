The concierge at my hotel didnt lie when he said this was the hottest breakfast spot in Philly. The lines on a weekend are gigantic and the cafe itself is pretty small....so you do end up waiting awhile but its sooo worth it. I had the frittata and the boyfriend had the huevos rancheros. Amazing and delicious on both accounts. I would wait in line in the dead of winter wearing nothing but a bathrobe for this joint.
