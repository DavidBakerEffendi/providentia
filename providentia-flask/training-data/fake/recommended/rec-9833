A little haiku for the Halal Guys. Gyro or chicken, all good. Late night grub for cheap. Red sauce. Good in, painful out. When it doubt as to which is the right cart, go with the one in front of the Hilton hotel. It's the one with the longer lines. Love the yogurt sauce but that damn hot sauce is what makes it so damn good. Or maybe my tongue and taste buds are just damn inflamed and numb that I can't tell whether or not it's that good or that I'm just too damn delirious to notice.
