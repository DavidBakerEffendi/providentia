I found this place after a long flight from Cali. We had a huge layover in Philly so I used my Yelp application to pick the highest rated cafe near the airport. I want to warn you to expect an "East Coast" attitude from the employees here. I used my iPhone maps to find this place and we ran inside as soon as we saw it (pouring rain outside). Would you believe, the employees (who were just sitting around waiting for opening time) said we had to wait outside until the cafe opened in 5 min??? How fucking rude is that? Remember folks, LASHING RAIN OUTSIDE!! The service was no better, our waitress was an ice queen and did the bare minimum to take care of us. And by bare minimum I mean she took our order and dropped off the food. IDK..... maybe I'm spoiled by the service providers on the "Good Coast". MAYBE it is outside of a waitress' job description to ask you if you need napkins or a drink refill....IDK.... The food was OK, tho. Nice sized portions, I guess.
