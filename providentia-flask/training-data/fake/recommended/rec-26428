Since my last review, the Halal Guys have expanded to include a cart on 53rd Street and Broadway/7th Avenue and have also now opened up a sit-down restaurant in Union Square. The food is still yummy and the lines are still as long as ever. Why the -1 star then, you may ask? Because they now limit the amount of sauce you can take!!! Not too long ago, I could easily grab three or more containers of white sauce or ask them to load it up on my plate. Just yesterday, I saw they only gave two and I tried grabbing some more, and they yelled at me saying I have to pay extra! Blasphemy!!! (Yes, I know I am spoiled, but you can't just downgrade the sauce on customers after years of offering them unlimited amounts. That's just wrong! *pout*) Anyway, I split a combo over rice order and the two white sauce containers with my BFF and still loved the food, so I guess it's not the worst thing that could happen. I do feel like the hot sauce doesn't have as much kick anymore. Maybe that's just my dying taste buds from years of eating spicy food? Overall, it's still awesome, and I'll definitely come back, even if I'm still crying over my limited white sauce.
