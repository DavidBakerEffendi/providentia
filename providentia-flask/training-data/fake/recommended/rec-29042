GARCES HAS DONE IT AGAIN..... My friend and I went here last wed. nite after going to a open house in the city. I have been wanting to try this place for quite a while and boy was it worth the wait. Since the burger was highly recommended by other reviewers, my friend and I got the village burger, all I can say WOW! The best burger I've ever eaten in my life! It was juicy and cooked perfectly on a perfectly toasted bun. Thank God it was only the 2 of us, we were fortunate to get seating @ the bar otherwise it wouldve been an 1.5 hr wait for a table. The bartender was really nice chatted w/us while we waited for our food. We also got pickled tomatoes for apps that was really good. Its whole Cherry tomatoes in a jar and u jus pick em out and eat em. We also shared fries...really crispy although some were kinda burnt. But it was the burger that made this meal. $11 was so WORTH the price for the burger. I would definitely go back to this place again and again!
