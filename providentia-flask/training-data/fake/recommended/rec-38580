OH. MY. GOODNESS. Mamoun's, how you've saved my life, more than once, more than twice. Whether I am taking you to go in Washington Square Park, or enjoying you while completely wasted, I am always happy to have you in my belly. And here I was, thinking I'd go completely broke on an eating adventure in NYC. sigh. I'm thinking about your baklava, your falafel, your hot sauce Till we meet again.
