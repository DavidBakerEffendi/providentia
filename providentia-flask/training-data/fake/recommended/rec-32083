The best Italian restaurant I've ever been to. GREAT food. I've been here for a corporate dinner, as well as for casual dining and have yet to be disappointed. The crab ravioli and veal saltimbocca are my favorite entrees here, and the speidini for the appetizer. I did not expect a private room separate from the rest of the dining room for the larger event I went to. The head waiter presented his recommendations off the main menu, as well as the night's specials, to the entire group. Everyone was taken care of and checked up on like they were the most important person in the place. The food was brought out fairly quickly after the appetizers were cleared. Everyone was impressed with their dishes. I would recommend this place to anyone!
