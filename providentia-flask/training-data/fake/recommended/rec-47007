Came here on a Sunday morning with my girlfriend. We arrived at around 9:30 and just beat the church crowd. There is a separate area before you go into the restaurant with seats as a waiting room. When we get seated, just 5 minutes later, we went outside and into the second room. We were seated by the door, and it was a little cold, but nothing that some nice breakfast cant help. We each ordered some fresh squeezed oj, which was 3.99 each, but still delish. I ordered the Challah French Toast stuffed with cream cheese and bananas with vanilla maple syrup, was soo yummy. She ordered a special Challah French Toast with Guava sauce and berries, which was also tasty. The bill ended up being 32 with tip, which is a little expensive for breakfast, but as a treat every once in a while it was absolutely worth it!
