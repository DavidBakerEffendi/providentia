This is some good s#%! I came to try their fried chicken and it is goooood. Crispy skin, tasty, spicy, and juicy. All without being greasy and oily. Their hot chicken dish comes with 3 pieces of chicken, toast, a side and pickles for $13. A good deal! Sides we tried were corn on the cob with lemon salt (yum!), collard greens (delicious) and sweet potato fries (the best I've ever had!) Came for brunch around 2ish and had to wait ten minutes. A lot of people were leaving at the same time. Sat at the bar. Happy hour deals on cocktails. Got my bloody mary for $5 only!
