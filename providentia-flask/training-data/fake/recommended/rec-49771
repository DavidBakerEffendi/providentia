I found myself here on a cold winter night and was looking forward to trying some Thai food that was not just noodles and coconut milk. We ordered the larb with duck and also the Pad Ped Moo Krob. The Pad Ped Moo Krob came first and was AMAZING - crispy pork (how to they get it so crispy??) and a delicious sauce. They seemed to have forgotten to add the eggplant but that wasn't really a problem. The problem was with the larb that arrived next. I took a bite and the dish was definitely very, very tasty. And then, after a few more bites, it hit me. The heat, that is. Now, I'm normally fine with spicy food - sure, my eyes might water a bit or I may need to drink an extra glass of water, but I can typically handle spicy food. This dish was out-of-this world spicy. What's odd is that the Pad Ped Moo Krob was a regular spice level. Why would the waiter+chef decide to pump up the spice to such an extraordinary degree on the second dish, and without asking us? We sadly were unable to finish the larb. It was essentially a salad and what's needed to cure a spice-burned tongue is carbs, which the dish did not have at all. To top it off the waitress came around very rarely to fill up the water glasses. Every time I tried another bite, I regretted it a minute later. On a lighter note, the place is BYOB so you can just grab some beer from the store a few doors down and Larb Ubol will bring you glasses for it, free of charge.
