Had brunch here on Sunday, Mother's Day!, on a whim and had a lovely time.  The conejo en mole verde (rabbit in a green mole sauce) was delicious, as was the huevos banadas...  No complaints from me.  Nice little place, nice server (who so closely resembles a friend that lives on the west coast it was scary), good vibe.  Will be back!
