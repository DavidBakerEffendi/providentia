The food, the ambiance and the staff, everything worked well together to elevate the experience at BCD Tofu House. BCD was recommended by friends on a recent trip to New York's Korea town and it did not disappoint! We had a large group of 8 so the wait was a little long (it was obvious people love this place!). Within minutes of getting seated, both sides of our table were flooded with delicious appetizers. Fried fish, kimchi, broccoli, seaweed, seafood pancakes, the list goes on. Everything was absolutely delicious! I ordered the pork Soondubu (it comes with an egg that you can crack and mix yourself, so fun!) and split that and BBQ with a friend. It was my first time having Soondubu and it was absolutely delicious! Â I tend to like my food on the spicy side so I ordered it with a little heat and it did not disappoint. I would definitely recommend BCD to anyone and I'm looking forward to going back the next time I'm in NYC.
