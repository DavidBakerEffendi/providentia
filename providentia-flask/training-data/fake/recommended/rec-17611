Dear Ralph, since I've moved to AZ 5 months ago I have not been able to enjoy a truly delicious thin crust pizza!! if you live in the Nutley area you must try their pizza ! even plain cheese pie is heavenly and the owners are very friendly good old Italian family from Nutley so their you'll enjoy Â time there if you dine in or take out.
