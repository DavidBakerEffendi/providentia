I absolutely love this place. Whenever we visit Philly, its one of the first places we have to go. The menu is whacky and absurd which is probably the reason we keep going back. Be prepared to gain at least 5lbs before you even walk in the door. Once you get in (or sit outside if the weather is nice!), the decor is great and the service has never been less than adequate. I try to always get something different on the menu so our group can always share these delicious creations. One thing we always get is the booze milkshakes. The birthday cake one comes with a cupcake on top. Yes, heaven is a place on earth. Take a look at the kids menu, too. My niece always gets a pb&j which has banana, French fries and lucky charms in it. Ok, now go to the gym.
