I've had a really hard time finding decent ramen in Brooklyn. Ganso, despite being the hipsterest ramen joint you will ever see, takes the cake so far. Chuko, on the other hand, was not worth the wait. The pork bun was fine, and the veggies on it added a very refreshing brightness to the bun, but the pork itself was very small and just kind of there. Didn't really add to the flavor. I ordered the pork bone broth with roasted pork. (Kind of a fan of pork.) The broth was bland and much thinner than I'd ever expect of pork bone broth to be. Adding some of their really pretty good garlic oil helped a bit, but I'm a firm believer that a ramen dish should come out perfect from the kitchen. If the customer has to add something to give flavor, you're doing it wrong. The noodles, also bland, lacked the toughness I love in my ramen. And the eggs! I didn't even know it was possible for soft boiled eggs to taste like absolutely nothing! Quite surprising. The staff was incredibly friendly and they were a delight to interact with, but that's no substitute for the still-mythical perfect bowl of Brooklyn ramen. Also!
