service was very friendly and food was pretty good. they had two salsas with chips which were both fresh and good. guacamole app was terrific. I had chick chimichanga and it was good.  my girl had the shrimp burrito and she said it was "Eh, ok".  prob won't come back here but I'm a pretty tough critic.
