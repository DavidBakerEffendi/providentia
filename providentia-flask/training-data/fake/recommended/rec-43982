Legit. Any place that has funky drink combo specials like the Sportsman (Black Label + Evan Williams shot) or the Texas Two-Step (Lone Star + tequila shot) is cool with me. There's also some quality microbrews on hand. The Levee has board games like Sorry! and Jenga with big tables to play in groups...oh and a solid jukebox. My buddy and I decided to throw on 7 tunes including some Van Halen, Thin Lizzy, and Hall and Oates' "You Make My Dreams Come True". You better believe that had some people dancing and a chorus of others singing "Oooo ooo wooo hoo!" It's a fun loving crowd.
