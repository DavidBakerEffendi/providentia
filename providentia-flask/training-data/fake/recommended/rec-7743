a nice and mellow place to grab a coffee and do a little catch up on my reading. the coffee is just average though and the waiter is a bit nonchalant---and was the only one working on a saturday afternoon? (poor planning on the management part, i'd say). as others have mentioned, croissants are not the thing to order. you are better off buying them from wholefoods.
