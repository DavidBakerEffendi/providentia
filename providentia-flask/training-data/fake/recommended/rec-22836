I've been here multiple times and can't believe I haven't written a review. That said, parking is a pain in the ass. It's incredibly difficult finding parking off-street, so you're forced to park in one of the many lots situated behind businesses. I usually conduct business in the Blue Back Square area, so I find myself parking in the Isham Garage and walking 1/4 mile over to the cafe for brunch/lunch. My usual order is a croque monsieur or a croque madame with a side order of pain au chocolat or a macaron. The sandwiches are best eaten while dining in because they can get soggy otherwise (what grilled cheese wouldn't?). Also, the salad that accompanies the sandwich is a plain romaine lettuce... but the dressing is quite tasty. My H really enjoys the marseille sandwich/wrap/crepe- basically any mozz, prosciutto, arugula combination is perfect by his standards. Â We've had the crepes on Sundays and... we've had better. The batter is very thick and not at all what I remember while visiting my relatives in Marseille, Paris or Champagne-Ardennes. Maybe the owner's recipe is different?, but it doesn't suit my taste. Otherwise, her crepes (the insides, whether sweet or savory) are extremely delicious. My brother really enjoyed his montagnard crepe, my favorite has to be the st michel and my H prefers sweet crepes like the pear and chocolate. Nom. Also, the confectionaries are decent. The macarons here are very tasty and they have FEET (If you know macarons, you know what I mean. As someone who tries to make these little buggers at home, it's a feat- pun intended)! The croissants and pain au chocolat are best eaten fresh- so if you're here after noon, don't bother. They taste soggy. Also, I'd like to note that sometimes, it's very difficult finding a table... space is so extremely limited.
