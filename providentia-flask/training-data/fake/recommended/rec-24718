Not usually a fan of all you can eat buff√©ts, but Sake Bomb was really quite good. Sure there are some nit picky short comings but given the price, the selection, quality, freshness and overall tastiness of the food as well as the fine service, I think this is a very fine establishment. It is certainly worth a trip...and a return trip.
