Extremely generous portions that can be for two people- but are priced for one. Friendly and quick service and delicious food. Don't be fooled by the outside! The Tony Salad is a great appetizer (honestly just ate the salad and vege part)- amazing dressing! Again, huge portion. Got the Shrimp Fra Diavolo as my entree with yet another delicious side salad. Perfect spice to the dish and delicious sauce even containing tomato chunks. The two guests I was with ordered pasta dishes. They too claimed they were delicious and of course took half home to go. Would love to try a whole wheat pasta dish next time! Mondays are even "make your own". Other perks- gluten free pasta and pizza. The cannoli was very creamy and original. The shell was cinnamon covered and amazing. Tartufo very authentic, along with the cappuccino.
