First off, I was a huge fan of Harold's on Top Chef.  It was clear from the beginning of that show that he was the best and it didn't surprise me that he won.  Thus, the next time I went to New York, I promised myself that I would go to Perilla.  I went on a Saturday night but had reservations. I took my aunt, who was visiting from China and had never experienced NYC before, so I wanted to give her the best experience ever.   It started off great.  Our server was attentive and friendly and he knew his stuff.  We ordered the scallop and calamari salad to start.  My aunt LOVED the the scallops and the calamari was wonderful I thought.  She ordered seafood dishes because that was what she preferred.  So, she got the Bass and I tried a bite.  It was over cooked and the fish must have been frozen because it didn't taste fresh.  I ordered the Duckling and it was so-so.  It was cooked well but the skin was not crisp because the fat had not been rendered.  We ordered the carrot cake for dessert, which was really moist. We also tried the Apricot Donuts, which also was good.   I have tried many fine dining restaurants in Boston, New York, and Los Angeles.  Overall, it wasn't great, but it wasn't bad.  I was just a little disappointed because I had been so looking forward to the meal.  Maybe Harold wasn't cooking that night?
