All I have to say is, meh. I was excited to try this place out as they sell their establishment as tapas style tacos in many many different varieties. However, the ordering style is mildly confusing. We wanted the platter, but had to wait for our waitress to come back to ask the difference between the small and large platter as absolutely no information was on the menu. When my group of three finally ordered, it came out family style. We weren't told which taco was what, so it was trial and error, which was a bit of a challenge since some in my group were vegetarian/non-beef eaters. Family-style is Â fine normally, but the corn is served in ears, which I'm confused about since it's family style and only two ears were given. We also got tamales, which again, is a slightly awkward thing to have family-style since there were only two tamales served. Also, the chicken tamale was beyond mushy and soggy, I couldn't even eat it, and I'm not at all a picky eater. The tacos were good, but again, nothing to write home about which is a shame, since they had a lot of unique kinds on their menu. My fav. was the fried oyster and the portabello, but all the others weren't note-worthy at all. The ambiance is great, until about 10 at night when suddenly, the lights dim even more and the music is cranked up. I don't think this place turns into a club as there is nowhere for the tables to be moved to, so I'm not sure why the music needs to be turned up at a restaurant, no matter the hour of the night. Overall, I'm glad I can say I tried it, but I don't think I'll be returning. There are too many other great establishments in WH to test out.
