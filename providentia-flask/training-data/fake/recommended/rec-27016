The customer is always welcome and right - unless you get Shelly as your waitress. After getting your order incorrect twice (and blaming you for it), you will ask that your order be cancelled because it has taken an inordinate amount of time.... She will then badmouth you to customers sitting at the counter, so you can overhear her, and then she will tell you that customers like you are disliked by all of the staff and that people like you should not come back to the diner. Hey Bill - you are the owner --- is this how you want your regular customers to be treated????
