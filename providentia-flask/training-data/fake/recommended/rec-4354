I had the Cincinnati Skyline and fries with honey mustard for lunch today at Hot Diggity. The beef chili was really good, although a little greasy, and the hot dog itself had a lot of flavor. I could still taste it under all of the toppings. It was pretty messy, but you expect a hot dog covered in chili and cheese to be messy :) The thick handcut fries were nice and crispy on the outside. They were super hot when I got them, so they must have just come out of the fryer. The honey mustard was good too, and I used every drop of it with a small order of fries. Next time I think I will be a little more adventurous with the dipping sauces. They had a lot of really interesting choices. The guys that worked here were really nice, and they brought the food to my table very quickly. Â I love the Hawk Krall art everywhere too, it's fun! This is a great summer lunch spot.
