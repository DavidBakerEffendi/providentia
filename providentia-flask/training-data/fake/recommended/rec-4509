Royal Masala has a reasonably priced buffet that includes dosa and even chai! (a lot of buffets don't seem to have dosa or chai which saddens me because those two things really make a meal feel more complete).. we got there early on a saturday with some fellow yelpers and we all agreed the food was good A-OK. Appetizers were good. There was a fair selection of vegetarian options (maybe 4 choices) even if it wasn't my favorite dishes everything i tried was good and spicy (more spicy than the average buffet) - i didn't really look at the meat department (it looked like maybe 3 meat options on the buffet). if you order from the menu on a buffet day you may be waiting quite a while. Â  (3.5 stars maybe?)
