Just fantastic. The period-dressed servers know the menu inside and out. They can provide details on everything from drinks to entrees! They easily worked with our food restrictions (vegan and some allergies), and not one thing was screwed up. The food itself is rich and delicious- everything is quite filling. The drinks are strong (VERY STRONG) and also delicious! Also happened to go there on Thomas Jefferson's birthday- the servers know a ton about the history around as well. highly, HIGHLY recommended.
