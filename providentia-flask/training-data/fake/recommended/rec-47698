College night lives here. Thursdays at the Russian Lady always has a good crowd. I normally arrive early to grab a quick bite. The food is your run of the mill pub food and is delicious. And with about 20 taps of draft beer, the options are great. Then the crowd rolls in between 9:30 and 10:30. Always great DJ's and fun environment. The whole bar is set up nice! If the whiskey room is open while you're there definitely check that out, very legit and original
