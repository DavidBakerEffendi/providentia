While walking around in Burlington, my boyfriend and I decided to stop in the red onion to grab a coffee and a sandwich. We ordered the red onion sandwich but decided to split it, as we were going out to dinner when we got back into Waterbury. So we ordered, paid and found a table. Let me preface this soon to be annoying situation with this: the place was dead at this point. Maybe 5 other customers, 4 of which were already eating. So, one of the guys brought us two sandwiches and walked away. We were confused, but thought maybe it was a double decker. We both only ate half of the sandwich. I heard one of the guys say to the other guy, he made a mistake. At this point I felt bad, realizing he did in fact give us two sandwiches and was going to go and pay for the second sandwich we didn't order. Â I used to work in a place similar to the red onion, and have been in similar situations. Just as I was about to get up, one of the guys came over to our table and said did you pay for two sandwiches? Because those are supposed to be for that table over there. Then, the kicker, he said "however you want to deal with that." And walked away. Not only did he embarrass us, he made us feel guilty for a mistake we didn't make. I got up to go online to pay for the second sandwich, but I also wanted to know what he meant by "however you want to deal with that." As soon as I got online, he brought over tin foil and said to my boyfriend, "you are all set." We left. Not taking any leftovers. They could keep their overpriced, mediocre turkey sandwich. Sorry for the ramble. I would NOT recommend this place.
