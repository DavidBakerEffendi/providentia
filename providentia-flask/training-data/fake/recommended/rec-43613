You won't stop eating when you're full. Cafe Orlin is that rare find in New York City where you spend a fairly modest amount of money and still get a wholesome, filling meal. It feels a lot more like a euro-diner than a restaurant, but the food is markedly better. My friend had the homemade chicken pistachio sausage, and everyone was wishing they'd ordered it too. We shared the pumpkin pancakes with cinnamon yogurt, and a dill omelette; both were delicious. If you go early in the morning, you may be able to walk right in and be seated immediately. If you go late, prepare to wait in line outside, but since the restaurant seats about seventy-five people, the line goes fast.
