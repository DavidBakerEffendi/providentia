What i really wanted to try from this place is the BLT. But they only serve that during lunch. After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to give dinner a try. The skate definitely lived up to it's reputation, delicious! We also ordered the rack of lamb, which I think it's totally under-rated here. It was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was just amazing! The tempura green beans were again, delicious! The sauce is good, but it sort of overpowers the beans. The beans are perfectly cooked and crunchy! Finally, the bread was addicting. It's just surprising how good sour dough and olive oil can taste when it's properly made. Now I need to come back for lunch to try that famous BLT.
