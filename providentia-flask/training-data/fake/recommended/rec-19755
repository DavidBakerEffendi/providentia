What can you say that hasn't already been said.  One of the best Halal carts in the city with one huge downside - the line is always WAY too long at the main cart.  Is it worth the wait?  No.  BUT... Just head across the street to the SE corner and you'll find the SAME deliciousness with 1/4 the line.  Awesomesauce!
