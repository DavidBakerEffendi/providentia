I must admit that I am fairly cheap when it comes to going out to eat, and if it wasn't for my wife and her friend, we would have never even have tried this place. Â We are frequenters of the Royal Tavern and still stand by the claim that it has one of the best burgers in the city. After going to village whiskey, we have to add a stipulation. Royal has the best burger for $10. If you don't mind spending a little more, than Village Whiskey is your place. This place is known for the completely gluttonous "Whiskey King", their burger that features fois grois. I'll be the first to tell you that I would ask myself, " Self, is this burger really going to be that much better because it has fois grois, and more importantly to justify the $26 price tag?". My brain said no, but my mouth said yes. This thing was unreal. I just have to note that I added to the Whiskey King a fried egg and truffle mushrooms, so this was a different level of absurd, it only enhanced the awesomeness. The burger was moist, seasoned perfectly, and actually cooked to the temp that I requested. Everything was perfectly portioned, as to complement the taste of the burger, rather than piled on, just because. Must try, even if it is at least once.
