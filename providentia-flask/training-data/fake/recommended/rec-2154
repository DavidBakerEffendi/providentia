Recently, on a road trip with a friend who had never been to the North East we decided to have cheese steaks in Philly. We headed to the cultural and culinary landmark Pat's King of Steaks. Now being from New England I've had my fair share of cheese steaks, but was expecting great things from Pat's. Instead I was let down by the mediocrity of the cheese steak from this iconic meal spot. Yeah, they held true to "how to order," and what-not, but that's about it. The sandwich was less than fresh, the cheese not melted and the bread was rather dry. If you are in the area I recommend trying another spot. However, if your feeling touristy or gimmicky then have at it.
