I come here to see bands pretty often. I hear they have a patio and food and the photo booth and such, but for me it's always the same: walk upstairs, pick a beer off the mercifully easy-to-read chalkboard, elbow my way through that weird bottleneck at the end of the bar (why does everyone stand right there?) and wait/yearn to be transported by whoever's playing that night. Bands sound good here; there's a balcony if you want to try the bird's eye view; the ladies room is eons away from disgusting; they have cask beer and a bunch of bars so you won't have to wait a million years to get one; you can always find some space to mill around, even when the show's sold out. I've been thinking about it, but I don't think I can ask for much more from a place to see music... except for maybe a pony. How about a pony, Johnny Brenda's??
