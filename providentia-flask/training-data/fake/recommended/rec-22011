City Steam is a must for the 420 Friendly Traveller, particularly if you have the munchies. Great food including a massive chocolate cake. Great beer (I recommend the Black Silk Stout) and comedy! Hubs and I have been here at least half a dozen times or every time we visit Hartford. CT is not generally 420 friendly, but it's dark enough in City Steam that no one will notice your blood shot eyes.
