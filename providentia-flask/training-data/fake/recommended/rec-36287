I am a fan for many reasons. A-Cty has become a melting pot for unique cultural fare. Walking up and down the avenue my wife and I had an opportunity to select a restaurant of our choice and from many choices. Serbian food, hmmm. We all know that every country has their own culturally / ethnic food selection. I have to add, I haven't ever thought of eating Serbian food, well that was until last night. The menu was interesting, very nice fare to choose from. We ordered 2 appetizers to start with one beer to share. the portions were larger then expected and very, very delicious. We ordered a 2nd beer and desert.  Really nice to eat outside and enjoy the locals. Servers were very helpful, and led us to make the correct decisions on our meal. I will say, we were so full after the starters that we must have missed out on the mains.  Prices are reasonable.
