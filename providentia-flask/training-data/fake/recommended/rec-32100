I love this place. It's our favorite restaurant in the neighborhood. They have great classic comfort foods like lasagna, gnocchi, and spaghetti and meatballs (my fave) as well as interesting things like the wing special we had the other night that was phenomenal, mussels, etc. The prices are also very reasonable - you can get a half portion of their pastas for about $11. They always have great beers on tap. I love the cozy atmosphere - one of those places you don't want to leave when you're done with your meal. Great place!!
