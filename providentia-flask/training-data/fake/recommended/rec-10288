We ate here before Tom Petty show.  Service was very good and the water glass never sat waiting for a refill.  We each had a Gem Salad to start.  The salads were delicious with a perfect balance of lettuce, fresh radish, crisp bacon, and hard boiled eggs and the Russian dressing had the right zip.  A warm roll with butter after the salads while we enjoyed lemon-tinis.  Our meals arrived hot from the kitchen.  He had the strip steak with mushrooms and it was accurately cooked to a medium and tender.  I had the rigatoni bolognese and it was luscious with the tender shreds of meat in a rich tomato sauce with heavy dollop of ricotta.  Heavenly!  To finish he went with the carrot cake with pineapple sorbet and walnut strudel.  This is no exaggeration:  I had to chide him to keep him from licking the plate after he had scraped it clean with the spoon.  I had the chocolate cream pie and it was so large a serving I only made a dent in 1/4 of it.  The chocolate was velvety, and the graham cracker crust was crumbled over the top of the chocolate like sprinkles and the whipped cream was delicate and fresh.  The service remained consistent and prompt, we relaxed and enjoyed our meal fully.  We have been to DISH multiple times and have had the same consistent experience each time we've gone which is also lovely.
