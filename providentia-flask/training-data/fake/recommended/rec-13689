The noodles themselves were perfect. You can get them thin or wide or super wide, but I just chose the standard thin size. The chewiness was specular and you could really taste the love put into them. Overall, the soup was lacking a bit in flavor for me. It wasn't the perfect bowl of soup I imagined it would be, but I think its delicate flavor would be perfect in the winter when stuck at home with a cold. Still, a meal thoroughly enjoyed.
