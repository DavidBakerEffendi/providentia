This place is great! WINNER: Churrasco steak and truffle fries... if this were in my neighborhood, I'd be in real trouble, haha. Cocktails, yes! Caramelized Banana and chocolate crepes, ughh, delish! Environment also great for intimate evening get togethers, especially a romantic date (pretty dark, which I personally enjoy). Service was also great. Try it out!!
