At first their $18 lunch "special" didn't seem like such an awesome deal, but then I remembered I was in NY. Â And yes, $18 for lunch is a deal in The Big Apple. It did turn out to be quite a bit of food... A falafel sandwich Side of hummus served with a basket of soft pita bread And some pretty uh-mazing french fries I gobbled it all up since, afterall, I'm eating for 2 these days. The service was attentive and speedy- there was even time for a dessert stop at Pinkberry before heading back to work. Perhaps this wouldn't be a deal back in Chicago, but it was a pretty special NY lunch!
