To some, joy may be found in dining at a fancy restaurant with ordinary service and food for a steep price. To me, bliss is discovering a jewel in the rough where the service and food is indeed extraordinary for less than $10! I've always wondered but now I understand why Mood Café is rated the best restaurant in the city of Philadelphia. 1. First of all, the food here reflects the owner's philosophies. Made with love and care, the intricate blend of ingredients is truly magical. Each flavor is bright, distinct, and amazing. I cannot recommend a specific lassi or chaat because if you choose from any of the literally hundreds of possible combinations, you will not be disappointed. Although Hassan always says kindly that you can have your money back anytime if you do not approve, no one has ever done so. 2. From the wildly popular rose lassi to the many fruits in the chaats, every single food item on the menu is made fresh from scratch. It makes you wonder if he is actually hiding a huge secret elaborate garden somewhere?! 3. Vegan, lactose-intolerant, and can't eat spicy? No worries fellow patrons. At Mood Café, it's all about you, the valuable customer. And amazingly, it doesn't matter what you prefer, because you'll find out it all will taste oh so delicious! 4. Hassan personifies what all business owners should strive to become: friendly, accommodating, down to earth, and funny. When you leave Mood Café, you'll have both your stomach and heart content with incredible food and genuine love. I honestly wish Mood Cafe was more common in the world. People like Hassan working hard to make the best food with the best service possible, not the cash that comes with it. Simplicity and perfection at every level. Bravo!
