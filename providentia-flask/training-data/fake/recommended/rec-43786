I have to say we had a great experience at Cafe Orlin today! We were looking for good whole wheat pancakes after 2pm and this place came up. Thanks Yelpers. We've been here before and had a good experience, but today was a little more special. I'm not sure which was better the service or the food, but I think I'll go with the good service of Michal (hope I spelled that right!). Usually servers are not so happy to see a group come in a few at a time, but she was patient and friendly from start to finish. She had no problem checking for possibly allergic items  for David (1.5 yr old) and coming back 3+ times to finally take our order. Are you new to NYC Michal or just a good actress, because I would have heard other servers' eye's roll by this time? ;0) We had brunch (weekends and today Monday 5th of July) at 3:30p ish for about 9 people.  I had the banana pancakes (excellent, just slightly dry, but Anne said I may be asking for too much), Anne had the salmon salad (very good - not over dressed and cooked just right), the millet pancakes and mozzarella sandwich was a hit as well.  The brunch was $12.5 including a coffee that included a few items, but my pancakes were a little less. Thanks for the very good experience. I'm sorry the managers were not around so I could tell them what a good experience we had too. Michal, you'll tell them right? See you soon. post script: Happy Birthday Safiyya Jackson! post post script: Thanks to everyone for coming out on short notice! Sincerely, ~r & the familia
