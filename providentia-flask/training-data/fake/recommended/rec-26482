I'm not a big fan of Mediterranean cuisine, but I liked this a lot. We made reservation but had to wait a little at the bar because the restaurant was packed on Fri night. First of all, the ambience was great, warm lighting, high ceiling and intimate. By intimate, I mean that there is virtually no space between us and the next table (something you must get used to dinning in Manhattan). The menu is consisted of small plates and grilled kabobs. We ordered both. Everything was very tasty and everything was very small. For dessert, the ilili candy bar was very good but the baked baklava looked and tasted strange. Four of us ate for $240 with absolutely no wasted food or left-overs.
