My wife and I were in NYC visiting family and delighting in Book of Mormon. Six of us ate at Pylos with four of us having never been there even though they live in NYC. Our dinner from apps to entrees to dessert was simply beyond! Every tasty bite was heaven oozing with flavor and freshness! Can't wait to return to NYC to dine again at Pylos!
