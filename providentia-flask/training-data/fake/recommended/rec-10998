We went to Han Dynasty to celebrate Chinese New Years. The service was just plain awful,unprofessional and inexperienced. They brought us a martini that we requested to be made with Grey Goose vodka but was made with Gin. The waiter said he thought that Grey Goose was gin. We got an order of dumpling that was very good and the cold sesame noodles were extraordinary but the service was just painful. We could not get the waiters attention to refresh our drinks, bring us hot tea, and get us some additional sharing plates. We ordered a whole Sea Bass dredged in a sweet garlic black bean sauce. The fish was good but the sauce was predictable and the waiter spilled our cocktail all over the table when he moved our drink to make room for fish dish. The restaurant is ok, I would go back on a slow Tuesday evening during a snow storm when we could actually get attention and understand the menu a little better.
