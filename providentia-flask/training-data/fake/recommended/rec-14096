had these several times and just had one today. tastes best when eaten fresh, although reheating your takeout in the mic-wave will taste almost as good. pita tasted like any others. definitely add some chilli sauce if you can really take really spicy(they're really good), because their sauces are devillishly spicy. love the chicken yummmm. don't ever worry about the line, because they move extremely fast. good things come to those who wait.
