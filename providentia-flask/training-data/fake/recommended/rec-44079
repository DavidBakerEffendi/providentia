This is a review of Penelope's brunch! BIGGEST THING TO STRESS: come early, Come Early, COME EARLY!!!!! Come around 10am, anything later, and you'll be waiting 45 mins-1 hour just to get a table. It's a reasonably sized place, but it still takes time to get seated. The smaller party size you have, the faster you get in. Go for the $14.50 Prix-fixe. You get a drink (Apple Cider Mimosa, Pomegranate Bellini OR coffee/tea and juice), in addition to an brunch entree. I got the apple cider mimosa - which was delicious! Also got the Farmer's Market Omelette with onions, peppers, sausage and goat cheese. Mmmm mmm mmm DELICIOSO! Even the home fries hit the spot! It was perfect! I will definitely be back again soon!
