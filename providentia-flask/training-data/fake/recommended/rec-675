I was in Philly briefly and was looking up good steakhouses. I saw Fogo, and I've always wanted to try a Brazilian Steak house so off we went. It was great. Perfect service, the salad bar was great, the meat was great. Especially the filet. I wish I could have eaten more, which is one reason I don't do buffets and such, so I'm sure I didn't eat my moneys worth, but it was great! Guys were constantly coming around with meat, I was concerned at first because I eat all my steak rare to medium rare, and I was wondering how it would come out, but there were no problems with that, let me tell you! They slice off a piece and its perfectly med rare. I would definitely come back here again.
