A friend who works in the Film Center Building up the street recommended Turco.  I went over for dinner.  It was just fantastic.  Very nice staff and you can see all the food displayed in the front.   The falafel sandwich was out of this world.  I tried the chicken kabob and was blown away. In the past I would frequent Maoz, but this place takes middle eastern food to a whole new level.
