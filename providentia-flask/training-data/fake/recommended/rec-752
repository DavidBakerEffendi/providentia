My girlfriend and I are HUGE Los Angeles Umami Burger fans, so when we were going to NYC and found out that they have a couple of restaurants on the East Coast now, we were excited! We went to this location on 6th Avenue with 7 people. We arrived just in time to beat the lunch crowd so we were seated immediately. The server came around quickly to get our drinks and starters going and we stated that we were ready to place the full order but they could bring the apps out first when they were ready. The restaurant filled up super fast about 5 minutes after we were seated and people that came in about 15 minutes after we did were already eating their lunches as we were still waiting for our apps. I don't make it a habit of complaining to restaurant workers for many different reasons, but after 25 minutes of not getting ANY food brought out, I asked the hostess who was walking by if she could check with the kitchen to see what the delay was since our server was MIA. The servers emerged from the kitchen and told us that they dont like to send out food until it was ready for everyone at the table and since some of us ordered our burgers well done, we had to wait. I asked about the apps and finally after about another 5 minutes, our onion rings, house pickles and shoestring french fries came out. The fries were not good at all and kind of cold. The onion rings had absolutely no flavor UNLESS you dipped them in any of the side sauces they give you and only then are the half decent. The house pickles were actually really good. The plate had pickles, and pickled cauliflower, green beans, and okra on it and they were all very tasty. When the burgers finally came out, I was happy that the taste was almost as good as the locations we've eaten at in LA. The burgers are fantastic but the wait time and unapoligetic staff made it really hard for me to want to return to this particular location however.
