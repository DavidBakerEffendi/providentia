A solid French restaurant in a quieter area of Williamsburg that serves up flavorful crepes. I say this as someone who, if witnessing a gladiatorial fight between crepes and chicken & waffles, would root for chicken & waffles any day: I would actually root for the crepes at Pates Et Traditions. Their savory crepes are all priced between $10-15 and come with salads, so it won't set you back too much. FYI, the brunch menu is more limited than the dinner menu. To be honest, I don't even like French food much but everything I sampled was amazing. I went with the Normande, a delicious combination of chicken, white wine sauce, and mushrooms, and I loved every bite. It wasn't too heavy or too creamy or too bland, all qualities I've come to fear at French restaurants. My table also shared a sweet crepe, something insanely good with apples, cinnamon, ice cream, and whipped cream and I couldn't get over how perfectly chewy the crepe tasted. Won't make any French jokes but the service was fine too!
