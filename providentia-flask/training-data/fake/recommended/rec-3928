I've had consistently amazingly good service here ... Until tonight. We went from great service, and wonderful servers and bartenders - to whatever this is. We have been consistently good clients for years as we live in the area. Even back when they had their hepatitis scare, we went and established great report with the crew there... I've met wonderful people - some of whom went on to greener pastures, others who have stayed. Most of which are awesome and take to their client's needs. Until tonight, when I showed up with a damn take out container and got chewed out by the bartenderess, a sour faced girl that I had never seen before. I had no intention of eating the food because I was full, but had no bag. Apparently I made the mistake of going and getting dinner with leftovers prior to getting drinks and errantly put it on the bar. The manager showed up and when we explained the situation he said : "what would you like me to do: get her fired or killed?" I've never felt so humiliated, especially by a place which I once held so dear. I've worked retail before and know the difference between good and bad clients, but I don't think that asking for a bag was too out there. We've brought many friends there, but rest assured that we won't be back. We didn't want much, but once he said this, that was that. Good bye Alta, it was fun while you had good service. Ps - high fives to Rebecca and all of the good servers, sorry to cut our visits short!!!
