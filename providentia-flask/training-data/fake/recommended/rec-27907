i am a monster dumpling fan and felt for a long time only grandma's homemade dumplings could complete my satisfaction. however, prosperity dumpling truly rivals my family's version of the "best dumpling I've ever ate." the steamed/fried dumplings are meaty, and not too doughy. although you would expect otherwise right? $1 for 5 pieces. truly a steal. i feel their chives and meat dumplings are the better of the two fillings they have. outside of the dumplings, their beef sesame sandwiches were awesome. i wish there was more meat in there but the mixture of the vegetables in the sandiwch really made up for it. the jiang jiang noodles were ehh not too great. too greasy for my own taste but then again - its so cheap so def worth a try if you fancy it decor and attitude of the place? well it's a hole in the wall
