Only ever stopped by for lunch, but this place is solid. Good quality, good portions, friendly service and good prices. Really hard to go wrong here. The only reason I didn't give up five stars is the lack of drink variety. Just bottled sodas/water. If they kept something fresh made like some fresh brewed tea or lemonade, this place would be the perfect.
