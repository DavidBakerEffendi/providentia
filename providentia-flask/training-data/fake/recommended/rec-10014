Ambience is really nice and cozy. You walk into a dark curtain entranced room, gorgeous leather benches, enormous chandeliers, dim lighting & subtle music. A good date environment, or a place to catch up with old friends. I ordered the Sautéed red chili. The waiters didn't ask how you like your spice level before prepping the food & it came out pretty spicy.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining! Everything also comes out very fast here, there's a certain pace to the place which can get annoying. For instance we were having a deep conversation, but were asked by waiters at least 3 times if our check was done. Very cheap $10-15/ entree. Cocktails $10 During the week, no line. Tried to go Friday night, 30 minute wait.
