My boyfriend and I went here last weekend and had a wonderful time! We arrived around 1/2 before our reservation and ended up getting some drinks at the bar.  I got the flight tasting of 3 types of Lambrusco which was very fun way to start the evening.  Then we ended up sitting at the bar and not moving to the table we reserved.  We had perfect seats to people watch and the bartender was so friendly and awesome!  We shared an amazing cheese and meat plate.  Then we split the Calamari stuffed with cheese and kale appetizer which was delicious.  Then we split the Creste pasta with shrimp and Brussels sprout leaves.  That was heavenly!  Then finally we split the Porchetta.  Such a huge amount of tasty meat!  I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants some tasty and hearty Italian food.  It is perfect for cold weather as the food is pretty heavy.  The wines can be pricey as well.
