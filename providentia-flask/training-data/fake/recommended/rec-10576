Absolutely terrible service.  The owner (Natalie) thinks she's running this very upscale business..when in fact it's a diner. This place had so much potential but the service ruined my experience. Don't go here! Oh and if you were walking around prior and grabbed a Starbucks, you're not allowed to bring it in.  It's their policy but it doesn't list it anywhere on the front door..etc.  If you do manage to bring your coffee in they'll charge you a $1.00 service fee. Bottom line..food was good but service and owner ruined it!  Find somewhere else to go.
