This place was my first experience with thai food, now I can honestly say it's one of my favorite places to eat. Excellent service even better food. I had the pad thai which was off the charts kemosahbee! Extremely spicy so when you go their level of hot is about 2 times the norm. Also the pan fried dumplings are incredible, you can get pork or chicken.
