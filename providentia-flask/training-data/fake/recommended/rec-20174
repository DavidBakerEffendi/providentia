i love udon west so much. the service is always so nice. my favorite is the host who is always wearing a red sweater... sup dude! you ROCK. i normally prefer soba to udon but udon west makes it right, but if you're not sure how you feel about udon, their various donburis and curry are awesome. my one little prayer is that they make a vegetarian curry some day, the way their curry smells tests my commitment to vegetarianism every time.
