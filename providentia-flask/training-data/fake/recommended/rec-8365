Tried this place, as it looked beautiful on the inside and out. While waiting for a table, i saw mouthwatering dish after dish pass by. Had no idea what to order, short of stopping at each table asking people what deliciousness they were indulging in. Ordered 2 great appetizers; baby oyster omelet and squid with Chinese watercress. I could have licked the plate clean, but decided to keep some decorum. Ordered a noodle soup that sounded delicious, but unfortunately, was not my favorite. Prawn Mee sounded great.. who doesn't love prawns, egg noodles, shredded pork and vegetables in a spicy broth. I think it wasn't the cooking, but this is not my kind of soup. The broth was more of a rich sauce, instead of a light broth that i usually find in soups. It was very rich, and i picked out the meat and shrimp. Thankfully, i already got my fill on the appetizers, and I walked out full. In spite of my poor choice of entrees, I definitely plan on going again when I am in Philly again !
