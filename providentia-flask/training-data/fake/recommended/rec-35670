If you are from Philly and you haven't been to DiNic's...shame on you. This place IS the reason you go to Reading Terminal Market. I have been here at least 10 times and have only gotten one thing. The roast pork sandwich is what they are known for and what they do so well. Get the pork sandwich with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe and you will not regret it. My favorite pork sandwich in the city...although I have never been to John's Roast Pork (it's on the list).
