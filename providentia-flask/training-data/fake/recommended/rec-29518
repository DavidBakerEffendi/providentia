Everything you need to eat and drink just down the street. Sandwich service is spot-on. Great selection, good quality meats and cheeses, good weekly specials ($4!), and a careful, attentive sandwich artist (this dude puts Subway's to shame). Soups are pretty decent too and you get a bag of chips with each non-breakfast sandwich. Not bad at all. The beer selection is excellent (not the best, but overall quite good) and prices are the most reasonable in Center City, which isn't saying much but it's better than getting ripped-off at the Corner Foodery. Also of note: all the beers have their prices clearly labeled! The fact that this is unusual in Center City speaks to the shadiness of the other beer sellers, but is again a big plus in Monde Market's favor. A bit more friendliness in the service might be ideal, but everything else is so good I'm not going to complain if I don't have a faux-friendly conversation with the cashier every time. Note: They stop making sandwiches around 10:30 PM, so get your order in by then.
