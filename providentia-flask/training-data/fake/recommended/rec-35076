I saw this place on yelp and thought to give it a try since they have pretty good reviews. My friend and I was in the restaurant waited for 10mins to get seated when there was couple of tables open. Didn't take long to place my order considering the limited selection for brunch. However, took forever to get our food and they didn't even have salt/pepper or condiment ready set on the table. We had to ask for them as well as a silverware set. Really?!? Our drinks was sitting at the bar for awhile. Not all of my food came out together. The food was okay. Presentation was not all that! AND I HAD EGG SHELLS IN MY FRITATA.... Would not recommend anyone to go there, unless you have a lot of time to do nothing..you can waste you time there. It's pricy for not that much food!!
