I was really looking forward to the patatas bravas, and they turned out delicious with the aioli sauce; it reminded me of those Japanese french fries with tobiko mayo. However, the other tapas are more eye-opening. The squid in ink with rice, the veal tongue with pickled red onion on toasted baguette, and the shrimp in olive oil with garlic and chili were my favorites. We had some sangria to round out the meal; service was attentive,we were full, and it was great.
