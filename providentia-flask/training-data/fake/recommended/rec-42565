Having spent most of my childhood in Chennai, I have very high expectations from any place that claims to "capture the taste of Chennai." While the food here doesn't quite match up to "kovil" food, it's still a good place for authentic tamil food. We went here for a weekend lunch buffet, which at 12(ish) bucks, is a great deal. This is the only place that I know of in the tri-state area that actually serves idiyappam and that itself is worth 4 stars in my  book. The chutneys were excellent, and the urandai kuzhambu was perfect. The idli and vadai were delicious.  The sambar, rasam and dosas were good, but I've had/make better. I'm so glad that there's finally a south Indian restaurant that offers more than the standard idli/vada/dosa. Will definitely return.
