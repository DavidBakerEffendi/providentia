In all honesty i've never had a taco salad to compare... the burritos are doled out in large, Â juicy, delicious portions that hold up well from lunch for a late night snack. i live in VA now and I swear I think about their cart food all the time. there's nothing down here like it... it's better than moe's and better than qdoba!
