Arrived on a Saturday night around 8, and this place was packed! We had a 5-minute wait before being seated down (+1 for quick turnover!) We were a bit hungry, so we had to call over a waitress (it seems that every hand on deck was busy). I ordered the sliced intestine noodles to call forth memories of Taiwan, and it was pretty good at living up to its expectations. I think that says a lot about Nan Zhou. Unfortunately I didn't know their 'house noodles' weren't their shaved noodles, so I was a bit bummed when it came out. That being said, the flavor did not disappoint. The duck noodles seemed to have sizable chunks of meat! Overall, this place is great if you're looking for a filling, cheap meal. Nom away, Yelpers!
