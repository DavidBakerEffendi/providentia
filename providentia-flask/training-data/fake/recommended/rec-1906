Why just 3 star? Because I am not a fan of spicy food. We ordered all spicy food except Taiwanese sausage and three cup chicken. Sausage was ok but three cup chicken was so great. The chicken was boneless and tender (It is different from the common three cup chicken) and went well with steamed rice. My friends like spicy food so that's why we went there. However, they could not stand their food because they were so HOT!!! We even used tea to wash the chili oil and pepper, and still can feel the HOT! But the smell and flavor was great, just your tongue and lip got numbed and swelled :) I believe it is 5 star restaurant for spicy food lovers!
