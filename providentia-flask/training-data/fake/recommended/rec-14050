Everytime I think of New York, I think of the amazing blueberry pancakes here that come with the maple butter. Â It is seriously one of the best breakfast places I've ever been to, and I've been to many. I love the small cafe like venue, the friendly staff, the cozy booths, the giant mug of hot cocoa that comes overflowing and topped with whipped cream, but most of all, the satisfied feeling and happiness I feel after scarfing down my entire plate. It is no wonder that everytime anyone travels to NY and asks for recommendations on what to eat, everyone says Clinton St Baking!
