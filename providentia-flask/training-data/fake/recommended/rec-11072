Best steaks I've had anywhere and I dare you to challenge me! I've tried this restaurant in Washington D.C. and in Philadelphia - Philly beats the other by far. The food here is delectable and mouth watering - but there is so much that you should be prepared to have this be your only meal of your day. There is a massive salad bar so if you aren't into steak and poultry - you'll still have a wonderful time. The salad bar is fully stocked with all sorts of greens, vegetables, cheeses, fish, dressings... you name it! The meat choices are to die for. Every cut of steak, some wrapped in bacon, chicken, lamb, pork... it's never ending. At about $50 a person (or about $35 if you go for lunch which I recommend) you really get what you pay for. Not only is there a never ending salad bar and meat selection - but they also provide you with fresh sides like mashed potatoes and fried bananas. UNLIMITED! The staff are incredibly quick at getting food to you and are very polite - they clean debris off of the table, pull out your chair for you and even ask if there's any type of meat you'd like, then send it right out to you. All you have to do is sit back and relax... ahh.
