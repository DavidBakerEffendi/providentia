Okay, so this place did take forever to open up, but hurray! It is such a welcome addition to the neighborhood. My husband and I just went last night. I will say that from the sidewalk, it can feel a little intimidating to walk in. You can't get a sense of the interior atmosphere from the sidewalk. Luckily for us it was just busy enough in a chill, soothing sort of way. (9:30 p.m. on a Friday.) We shared the Bib lettuce salad with Gorgonzola and toasted walnuts - absolutely delish! And the pizzas were great as well. The best way to think of this is as a traditional trattoria - casual, simple fare that sticks to the basics and gets 'em right. The staff was exceptionally nice and welcoming. Our server (David) did let us know that the place just got its liquor license. He told us that they'll begin selling booze next Friday 11/25/11.
