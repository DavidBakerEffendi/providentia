This place has one good thing.  Marinated pork chimichangas.  everything else i have had there is sub-par compared to anywhere else.  the service is extremely hit or miss, and the crowd is about the same. old review : good burritos, decent jukebox, good quesadillas and great guacamole.  The prices are a bit hit but the quality and the service is good.  the service is much better than the south philly originator, maybe they learned from their mistakes or maybe things just go smoother on the other side of market.....ooh burn. take out is great and their bartenders are fairly nice while waiting for some good take away
