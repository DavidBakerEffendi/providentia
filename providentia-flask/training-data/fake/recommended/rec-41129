I rarely get around to writing reviews due to my own forgetfulness, but had to make extra effort to express my opinion of this place. We ordered the Brussels, shrimp bun and miso soup with pork. All I can really say is that the richness of flavor blew my mind. Never had anything like it. Absolutely delicious and will make you seriously consider ordering seconds. Whether you're into this genre of food or not, you owe it to yourself to check this place out. The space itself was intimate, friendly and attentive staff. We were seated right away and were in and out in about 45 min. This was lunchtime on a Monday.
