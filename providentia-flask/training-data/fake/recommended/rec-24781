Lovely ambience: cozy but not cramped.  Came with a friend of mine for a night on the town - surprisingly, the last minute reservation wasn't a problem.   I'm always critical of all things French in America lest they be only masquerading as French (French Fries don't make you French!), however, the atmosphere was distinctly Parisienne.  I was very pleased.   I ordered the mussels (good, but not the best I've ever had) and the chocolate chip bread pudding (fantastic, but much too rich and dense for one person - consider sharing for sure).  I'll be back!
