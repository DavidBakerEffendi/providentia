Awesome experience here on a rainy Friday night.  Seriously, I think this was one of my favorite "hole in the wall" type dining experiences in the entire city.  We got a strawberry/truffle dessert that I think I thought about for about 2 weeks after.  Come with a date or a small group - don't bring your out of town parents or people not accustomed to dining in NYC.
