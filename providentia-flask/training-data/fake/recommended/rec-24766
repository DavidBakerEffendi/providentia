I was staying with my brother in Chinatown and was craving some "bun bo hue". I did a search on yelp and this was the closes place and seeing the four stars, I was stoked! I didn't want to eat there so I called and ordered it to go. I should have hung up realizing this place was not legit when they didn't know what "bun bo hue" was from me speaking it. Despite my better judgment I went to pick it up and it was gross. There was no lemongrass smell to it (the foundation to this soup) at all. It seems like they used the pho broth and just poured it over a different kind of vermicelli and called it "bun bo hue".
