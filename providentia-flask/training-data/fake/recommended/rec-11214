Great food, great atmosphere, great service. I came here with my boyfriend and a friend on a Monday evening.  Our server was very attentive throughout. He gave good menu suggestions and checked on us frequently.  The dining area was full of interesting things to look at while we waited, although the food came pretty quickly. We ordered the thai chili wings, oysters, free range chicken, and the trout. Everything was delicious with healthy portions. I will certainly be back.
