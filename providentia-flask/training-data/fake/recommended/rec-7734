So yesterday I made a visit to Kafana. I have never had the pleasure of eating Serbian cuisine so I was more excited than usual. I have had a lot of experience with Eastern European cuisines that are similar, however, so I was not going in completely in the dark. Having said that, when I walked in, I felt like I was in Serbia. There was ethnic music playing, the decor reminded me of a typical Eastern European bar, and the atmosphere was just perfect. The waitress greeted us and we were ready to scour through the menu. We decided to share some appetizers for the table, which turned out to be an excellent idea. The appetizers consisted of celery root and beets, fried spearings, smoked trout, the famous kajmak sandwiches, and the roasted peppers. We also ordered a larger than usual helping of the ajvar pepper spread, which was to die for, to put it bluntly. For the main course, I enjoyed the Pljeskavica (traditional Serbian burger), and it was scrumptious! Just add some kajmak and it is perfect! The cabbage that came with the meat was also quite tasty and really added to the flavor of the burger. The blood sausage special with scallion mashed potatoes and the pork shoulder with scallion mashed potatoes were also hits at our table. Finally, for dessert, we all shared some palacinke with jam, as we enjoyed the end of a glorious meal. The service reminded me of the service traditionally received at Eastern European restaurants, which, although I kind of love for the authenticity factor, I still felt could have been better (the staff was very friendly, but sometimes a bit slow). Cheers to trying more and more new cuisines!
