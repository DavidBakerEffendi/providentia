Fabulous little joint right next to the Bowery Ballroom. Excellent craft beer selections, about 20- 25 options on tap & they also have a full bar. The food was surprisingly good. We all had burgers & they were excellent. Service was very friendly. I spent some time earlier at the bar & they're nice people working there. So glad there's no longer a struggle to find a convenient place to hang out before shows at one of my favorite venues in the City.
