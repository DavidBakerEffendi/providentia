I was told by my aunt that I had to visit this place while I was in the Theater District.......so I walked in around 5 p.m. with a party 3 and was seated right next to the door.  Super Fantastic for a cooler NYC day (insert SARCASM)!  There were only two tables sat when we walked in and nine when we left.  You couldn't have sat me elsewhere......whatever! The food was GREAT.....really was!  I had a cold crab sandwich and my husband had a pork loin/brat dish.......delish!  I'd give it FOUR stars for the food if I could but my beef was with the service. I was a server in Las Vegas for six years and did very well for myself; I like to think that I always gave my tables GREAT service.  So call me picky, but I demand that every time I eat out as the customer! I saw my server twice......to take our order and to drop off the check.  I think her name was Cassandra???  She seemed to have a stick up her a**!  She wasn't polite in the slightest and never once made eye contact!  Our drinks were refilled once by the server or runner that dropped our food, and we were never checked on to see if we were enjoying anything.  I watched her stand around chatting with her co-workers throughout my entire meal.  My husband is an exceptional tipper that always gives the benefit of the doubt to people, and even he was irritated! DISAPPOINTED......I really was, and I still haven't decided if I'll go back again!  I wish that I could review this place with wonderful comments like the other Yelpers, but I couldn't wait to leave......I never felt welcomed!
