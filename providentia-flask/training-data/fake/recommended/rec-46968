I have not reviewed this place - shame on me. As the 4891th reviewer, let me officially assure you - this place is LEGIT! Â I know there are carts on all corners of this intersection, and I have been assured by MANY New Yorkers that ALL 4 carts belong to the same people hence the food tastes the same. But true to my uber FOBBY self that reveals itself in NYC particularly, I will duly wait in line at the cart right outside Starbucks. I have always only eaten here and I will always only eat here.. yea, I am weird that ways! I always get the chicken over rice withe extra yogurt sauce - the chicken is moist, it's flavorful - it's like a spoonful of chicken heaven in each spoonful, I would change NOTHING about this place - except maybe have someone police the place for all the super ghetto people who refuse to clean up after themselves X-( Regardless, no trip to NYC is complete in it's fobby goodness without a bowl full of chicken over rice from this place - also, lo behold dear reader, this place gets 2 - not one thumbs up from my sister too..!!
