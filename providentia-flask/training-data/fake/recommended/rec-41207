Chuko is a veggie ramen paradise. It is incredibly delicious. Be prepared to wait a long time for a table, but while you wait you can go get ice cream at ample hills creamery down the street because dessert first! :) After about an hour we were seated. First we had the kale salad which was the BEST KALE I'VE EVER HAD. no exaggeration. just order it. my non veggie friends ordered the steamed buns and by the looks on their faces they were in food heaven. the veggie ramen was absolutely delicious. perfectly flavorful and the noodles cooked to perfection. you must go here!
