First off...I'm a fan of any place that has beer on the hand pump. They have a top notch selection of local beers and this was easily one of my favorite places to go to during beer week this past year. Staff is always friendly, especially Pierre. Love being able to sit outside too. Girard avenue isn't the most beautiful street to sit along, but the tons of critters driving by and stopping at the light can actually be quite entertaining if you ask me. The music venue upstairs is what really makes this place. I've seen a bunch of shows here. Sound is good, but the overall feeling/ambience is what really makes it shine. Only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is sometimes the food can be hit or miss. Standard Tap (The owners other restaurant) is always on point anytime I go there for a bite. But last couple of times I've had JB's it's either taken forever to get a simple fish sandwich out, or the quality just wasn't the greatest. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could though
