I went on a date here over the weekend and it was just perfect. The ambiance is lovely. Tall ceilings. Mood lighting. Reclaimed wood. Elegantly decorated bar area. Plenty of booths, small and large tables depending on your seating preferences. There's a cute downstairs area that's covered with wine bottles and plenty of bathrooms downstairs, too. The service was great, as well. Our server was knowledgeable and attentive. They also had plenty of staff to fill water and clear away plates in a timely fashion. I don't think my water glass was ever actually empty, and I drink a ton of water. Mostly importantly, all of the food was delicious and beautifully plated. Even the complimentary bread had me drooling. Everything on the menu sounded good to me. We shared the beet salad as an appetizer. I had the Diver Scallops entrée and he had the Pork Chop. Both plates were devoured in their entirety. For dessert we shared the Peanut Butter Crème Brule (See photo - it's freaking beautiful!) which I'm still thinking about days later.
