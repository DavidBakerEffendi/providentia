Small, cozy, great dishes, very good red sangria. the wait wasn't bad, but that's prob b/c the birthday girl had connections with the hostess. regardless, the service overall seemed good and the food was great. lamb, chorizo, spanish olives, ham-wrapped artichoke&manchego, even the almond cake was mmmm.
