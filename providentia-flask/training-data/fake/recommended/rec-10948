My favorite restaurant in the city. I cant believe I haven't reviewed this before!  I've been multiple times and always walked out thinking about when I'll go back.  The Brussell Sprouts (with grapes, yogurt, fig jam) are so fantastic, the recipe was posted in the New York Times about a year ago... I've made these several times at home ;).    The Duck is outstanding, the kibe naye  (Lamb tartar) is the BEST I've ever had (and I'm Lebanese).  The bar has the best kibbeh balls with lebane (meatballs and yogurt).  Honestly, I've never had anything i didn't like there.. Oh, I'm almost forgetting the fresh warm bread- again, best I've ever had in a restaurant.   Best advice is to go with a group and get the mezza sampler.  Even if youve never had Lebanese food, you'll be sure to like something. All this talk, now i want to go there for lunch today... i wonder if they'll deliver to my office.
