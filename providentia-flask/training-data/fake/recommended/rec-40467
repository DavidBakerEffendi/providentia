The first time I when to Smorgasburg I saw the line and was like, like most people, this must be something good but am I going to wait on this line or am I going to look around for something else.  This Saturday, I realized why people wait on this line.  Buttery bread, soaked in the juices of the smoked brisket.  You add pickles, red onions and red peppers and you now have a fusion of in your mouth food fucking that you will not forget!! Just do it for yourself and bring your friends so they can 'gasm to!
