I ate lunch here. I like Greek food, but disliked my meal. I ordered a Chicken Souvlaka (Chicken Gyro). The chicken was chewy. The Greek Salad (Kefi Salad) was decent, but heavy on the dressing. Homemade chips were good when dipped is Tzatziki sauce. Odd that they don't offer a Lamb Gyro. Prices must have been raised recently as well, because menu prices Â were higher than earlier quotes on Yelp! Service was bad as well.
