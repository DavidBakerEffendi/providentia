came here on our girls date out, we had wonderful time because food was delicious, except from time to time, we all get too carried away, laughed a bit too loud, and everyone turned and looked at us=p i know we should be more lady like, but it is hard when we get together. anywayz...back to reviewing this restaurant, this place has wonderful service. the first time we went, chef gave us a few more surprised dishes than what on the menu. we ended up spending more than 3 hrs in the restaurant for the $55/5 course meal. totally enjoyed our time there. will definitely go back again!!!
