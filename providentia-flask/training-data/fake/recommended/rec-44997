Little Owl was fantastic.  My husband and I celebrated our first year wedding anniversary here and could not have picked a better locale.   The waitress was well versed in the menu/wine list and was the perfect amount of attentive. The food was delicious, the decor is simply wonderful and the overall experience was a pure delight.
