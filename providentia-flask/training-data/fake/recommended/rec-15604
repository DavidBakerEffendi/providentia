Went here for Saturday brunch. The food was ok, nothing to get excited about. The service was terrible. Our waitress was rude, inattentive, and unpleasant. When my guest asked for an update on the food we had waited over half an hour for, she obnoxiously responded that the restaurant was at full capacity, as if we could not see that for ourselves. Her general appearance and presentation was also lacking. I have been here before, however I will not be going back again based on the poor service.
