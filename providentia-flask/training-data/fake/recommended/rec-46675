A bowl of Pho (#101) would probably make our Vice President jump out from his seat and yelp "This is a big f--king deal". Yes! Â That was my reaction, and many yelpers too, who tried it in Pho Xe Lua Viet Thai (choo choo restaurant). It tastes so good and makes me want to yell (but obviously I didn't), instead, I yelp to you now. so let's begin: Pho #101 (Large or Extra-Large): Even you order a large bowl; you will be amazed by its size when the bowl is actually sitting in front of you. Yes, it's HUGE in my opinion. Inside the bowl, a pile of various types of beef and beef inner parts (such as thin cuts of beef, brisket, fatty flank, tendon, tripe...etc) that covers up top. Right under them, you will find a ton (a little bit exaggeration) of white rice noodles in clear beef broth. Let me rephrase myself one more time on the last part of my sentence : CLEAR BEEF broth (many other restaurants are serving NO-CLEAR, NO-Beef, or nasty broth). If you dare to look at it again, you will probably think that you are getting an extra-large order (don't be shy about it, ladies!). A plate of fresh greens, herbs, vegetables and various others are right next to your soup and waiting for actions. Once you properly "mix" them into your soup, Da..da..da!! delicious! Yet, the price is under 7 dollar. Can't be that. Pad Thai: Spaghetti like rice noodle mixed with red hot/sweet sauce covered up by big shrimps, dry tofu and others on top looks very nice. And of course it tastes good too. It's one of the best pad thais I have in Philly so far. Yes, it's under $10. Great deal, great taste! Many other "Exotic" drinks such as martinis with various flavor, bubble teas, and Avocado smooth drinks are very tasty, and yet, probably the cheapest in town! Try them yourself in this Choo choo restaurant !!
