I've never been to India but this is what I imagine India (and heaven) to be like.  The food is amazing and can be cooked exactly to your liking (I have a really hard time with spicy food and every time I go here they make whatever I want exactly how I like it)  If you become friendly with the staff they also recommend amazing dishes and treat you like kings.  I would eat here every single night if I could.  I recommend the Butter Chicken and Basmati Rice - To Die For.  This place is definitely a strong contender for my "Top 5 last meals on earth"  Try it out - you wont be disappointed.
