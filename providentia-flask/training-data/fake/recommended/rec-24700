Not the typical hipster West Chelsea restaurant.  Almost had the charm of an old Cape Cod seafood joint.  Surpassed expectations from the start.  Fresh, spicy radishes at the bar.  Stiff, habenero margaritas.  Nice bartender and hostess, great waitress. Had the quail to start, then the tile fish, along with polenta and the green beans on the side.  The tile fish was well prepared but not my style.  Everything else was a 10. With a few drinks each, bill was close to $200 with tip, and well worth it.
