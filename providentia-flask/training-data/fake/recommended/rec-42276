Please Read: I love Blue Ribbon! the food is great. However as of last night my favorite Bartender and frankly the reason why most people go on the weekend to Blue Ribbon got let go. Sad to hear because now I have really no reason to sit at the bar Â hang out and order tons of drinks and food. I will probably sometimes get take out. But that will be it. Adam will be very missed and frankly this is the worst thing they could have done... Blah....
