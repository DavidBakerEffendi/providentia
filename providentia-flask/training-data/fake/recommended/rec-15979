I wanted to LOVE this place, but because their service was a little spotty (slow/under staffed) they only get 4 stars for now.   My friend hosted her birthday dinner here this Thursday and we had a fabulous time.  There were 15 of us and I believe we ordered about 6 appetizers and each an entree.  I can't recall everything we ordered, but I do remember the ribs and thought they were amazing.  I had curry chicken which was yummy, but not even close to spicy as promised.  The service for drinks was very very slow, so we didn't drink much there (which I guess was kind of good because it kept the bill down). I really liked the vibe and decor - it was like being in the Meat Packing District minus the pretentious d-bags that frequent and for only a fraction of the price.
