I'm stingy with my starts but this place is a gem in the hood and has always been that. It's just perfect. If you want a nice corn beef sandwich, here it is for 10 bucks. To much meat for you? get a smaller one for 7 bucks. You can choose from different types of bread and you have GOT TO GET THE GRAVY!!!! I forgot it the last time I was there but never again. The meat just desolves in your mouth and you don't feel like an over stuff piglette when you're finished. It's truly one of the hidden gems of Crown Hights. Now that the neighborhood is changing, I hope they continue to grow but I also hope thier prices don't become over the top....
