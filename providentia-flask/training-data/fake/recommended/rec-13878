It may be an issue that I just moved literally a block away from this wonderful, wonderful restaurant. An issue in the sense that I will patronize WAY too often. Bubby's is great for brunch, lunch and dinner...and every meal in between I guess, because it's open 24 hours. I love the fact that they start serving brunch at midnight...such a great idea considering I always crave french toast and other decadent breakfast foods after a night out. I recommend all breakfast/brunch foods and for dinner, the pulled pork is great! Aside from all the delicious main courses, I love the desserts. The Red Velvet cupcakes and pies are my favorite...but I suppose that is expected, hence Bubby's Pie Company as the name. Anyway, it will be interesting how much time I spend at Bubby's in the upcoming year.
