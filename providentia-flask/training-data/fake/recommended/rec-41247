This is a place where your wait time is at least 25-45 min at least. So we called them first before we went there, however we were 20min late for our reservation. They seated us in 5 Mins!!! That was awesome! We had the salt and pepper chicken wings, it was Mucho tender and not too greasy at all- love it! The ramen was alright just because I prefer the thinner noodles but I got the thicker one. The nice waiter told us about the sake from the can (forgot the name) it was really good! And also the we tried the peak fresh cut organic beer , that was unbelievableÔºÅ
