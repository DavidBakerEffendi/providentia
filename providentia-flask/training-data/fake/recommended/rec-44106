This place is great if you are in the Chinatown area. The 1,000 layer bread is the stuff dreams are made of. In addition, the curry's are to die for. I recommend going during the week because it is less busy. You will have no problems with service; just finding a seat. The good prices makes this one of the best bargains in town. They have BYOB, but there is a corking fee. I suggest just getting your drinks there.
