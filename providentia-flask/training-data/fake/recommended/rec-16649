Wonderful. We headed over here on a Friday night for a quick bite (3 of us), it was full so we sat at the bar. The bartender was great with service, the environment was great, we didn't really notice an inconvenience with sitting at the bar (which is not easy). I ordered the beef carpaccio (includes fries), which was literally happiness in my mouth. I then ordered, the skate (I think) with the sweet corn. I can't even explained how delighted I was. I'm very picky with seafood. This is just a sure 10. Each of us had ordered a appetizer, entree and a desert and we ended up paying a little under 40 dollars each. It really was spectacular. Romantic or cozy for date or small intimate group. Go!
