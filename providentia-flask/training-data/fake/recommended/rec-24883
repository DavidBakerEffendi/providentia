This was our last meal and Philly before catching our flight and was the perfect way to end our trip.  The restaurant is very intimate and has a great buzz.  Right out of the gate, they pushed a "brunch cocktail" on us, which always serves to win me over.  Fork has a great selection of house cocktails.....so enticing, in fact, that we decided to give a couple of them a try.  We both agreed that neither of the drinks was too sweet or sugary.......both were perfectly blended and not too overpowering....they were so good, in fact, that a second round quickly followed. There were a lot of good food choices.  The breakfast burrito ended up being the choice for both of us and I'm glad, because if we wouldn't have both ordered it, I would have had to share.  Needless to say, there were a lot of enticing choices on the menu.  The next time I am in Philadelphia, Fork will be on my list for another meal.
