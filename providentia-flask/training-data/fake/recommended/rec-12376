Love this place! I live in the neighborhood and go to Pause all the time for their strong coffee and fresh smoothies. Great food and drinks, great staff, chill atmosphere. Just don't expect the fastest service. It's a small place and if several customers come in at once, there can be a bit of a wait. Â But the wait is well worth it!
