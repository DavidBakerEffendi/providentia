For me, the most important part of a pizza is the crust.  The flavor and texture/consistency are absolutely essential.  A close second is the tomato sauce.  Together, these make or break your pie.   My favorite way to enjoy a pizza is pretty minimalist - tomato (sauce and slices if fresh and in season), mozzarella, fresh basil, garlic.  Quality ingredients should be allowed to shine, and not be obscured by too many toppings or distracting flavors.   Frank Pepe's is a great New Haven style thin crust, with the edges crispy and the center soft and chewy, but sturdy enough to support the toppings.  The flavor of the crust was OK.  The sauce was pretty good, but not the best I've had.  They forgot the basil and garlic on my half of the pizza, so I was left with a very basic pizza with ingredients that were decent but not great.   Modern has more flavorful tomato sauce and crust but they can't ever seem to get the texture/consistency of the crust right.  It is always soggy in the middle, but the flavor is great.  But having tried both, I can say that going forward I will choose Modern over Pepe's.   Haven't been to Sally's yet but that will be our next stop.
