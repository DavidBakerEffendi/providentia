Went to Green Eggs Cafe this past Saturday with my partner, and we both enjoyed ourselves. We went around 11, and the wait for sitting inside was about 25-35 minutes, so we opted to sit outside (which we were seated right away). He ordered the philly style eggs benedict (served on a pretzel roll) and I ordered the creme brulee french toast. Needless to say, the food was superb (literally the french toast is the best I have had in the city) and the prices weren't too bad (although coffee was two bucks, which I thought was high.) We will definitely be going back!
