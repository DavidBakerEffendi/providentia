I loved Misery Loves Co. It was the perfect location for lunch. We had a short wait for a table as it was packed in the restaurant. It smelled SO good inside. Small and cozy space. The sever was very helpful in explain the menu items. They had great alcohol specials, however we felt it was too early to be drinking. I ordered The Vonnegut which was pork belly and a fried egg in a brioche bun. It was amazing and I also love the flavor of the pork belly. It was the perfect lunch. I cannot wait to come back and try more menu items!
