An absolute delight.  Went there on a freezing night at around 8:30 and got seated immediately.  The waiter was very helpful and funny.  The food was absolutely delicious. If you are looking to try something new, go with the grilled portuguese sardine filets for appetizer.  It's very very tasty.  The lamb is a must-try.  It is definitely one of the best tasting lamb I've had in a long time.  The other entree we ordered was the pancetta wrapped pork tenderloin but felt that it was mediocre. Great atmosphere but a bit noisy at times.  Feels very down to earth although packed with a hip crowd. Pricey? Yes.  If everything was as tasty as the lamb it would definitely deserve a 5-star.  Just thought the pork need an extra kick of surprise to its flavor.  But definitely worth the visit.
