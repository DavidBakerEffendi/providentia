Great atmosphere. The wait during lunch is not bad at all. But I know that the wait for dinner can get pretty ridiculous. Umami has great combo deals. You can get a burger, fries, and a drink for 18.50 or substitute the drink for a beer for 21.50. BEER: I intend to test out a bunch of these and edit this review. Tempura Onion rings: Super yum. Very interesting. I would recommend it to everyone. I'm a big fan of onion rings and these were tasty for sure. Truffle Burger: Delicious. The chef recommends medium rare. I trusted him and got it. The patty was definitely really juicy. Parts of the meat were a little too medium rare for me. I like my burgers served medium. I like seeing that sliver of red between the charred deliciousness. I could definitely smell the truffle in the truffle cheese and truffle glaze. I didn't notice the garlic aioli but I'll check again.
