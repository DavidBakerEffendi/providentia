I ordered the Peel 'n Eat Shrimp smothered in Old Bay.  Oh god.  They were beautiful!  They arrived in a little net.  It felt like someone had just caught them especially for me.  *drool*  Salad was mediocre, but I didn't come for the salad. The decor was cute--rustic chains hanging from the ceiling, old signs and ship parts hanging on the walls.  In fact, the lamp shade at my table appeared to be modeled after a vintage mariner's map.  Pretty cool.  If only the waitstaff wore little pirate costumes.. The ambiance was, well.. it's a seafood restaurant.  I had the pleasure of listening to a table of teenagers misquote Borat and gossip about their friend who bought a $28,000 car.  Great entertainment value.
