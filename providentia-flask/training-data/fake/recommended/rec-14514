HOW DO YOU DO IT HALAL GUYS!!!! It's chopped-grilled chicken served over a bed of rice with a side of lettuce. Some white sauce and some hot sauce, and you have one of my most favorite food money can buy! Forget all the fancy pretentious food with a hefty price tag. Cheap, quick, fast, and dirty is where it is at! And the Halal guys will do you just for that! (oops that sounds weird). The chicken is tender and moist, the rice is soft and warm, the hot sauce will kick you like a Bruce Lee round house, and the white sauce holds it all together like a happy family. 'Nuff-said.
