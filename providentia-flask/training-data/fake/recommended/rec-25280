As a SoCal transplant to NYC for nearly 20 years, I miss a good burrito or taco now and again.  My co-workers and I had heard about Taqueria Diana from some friends but we work all the way downtown near Wall Street so haven't had the change to give it a try -- man, have we been missing out! With the awesome weather, one of the office mates volunteered to handle the pickup and the whole office wanted in.  We were not disappointed! This food is fantastic -- the burritos are packed with flavor but not so overwhelming that you get a food coma afterwards.  And the guac is out of this world - tangy, flavorful and perfect for dipping those fresh made chips.  Our Mexican colleague is taking all her friends there because she swears she hasn't tasted Mexican food this good since she was back home.
