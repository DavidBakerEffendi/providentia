Came here on a Friday afternoon for lunch.  It is a bar/restaurant with the bar right in the center of the place.  I sat at the bar and I ordered a beer they had on tap (Delerium Tremens).  I know this beer to be a particularly exquisite beer, although it wasn't as good as I remembered.  Anyway, I then began looking at the menu.  They have a wide variety of selections and are not limited to burgers.  As I was in the mood for a burger and a beer, I went directly to the burger section.  They have a page of burgers on their menu, as well as a piece of paper where you can build your own.  You have the choice of the size of the burger (1/3lb, 1/2lb, or 1lb), type of meat, bun, cheese, toppings, sauce, etc.  I chose to order a 1/2 beef burger with Tilamook cheddar, lettuce, jalapeños, onion confit, roasted green chiles, and chipotle aioli. The burger itself was fantastic.  The ratio of meat to bun was on point and the quality of the meat was top notch.  It wasn't too crumbly or chewy, but instead had a prime amount of cohesiveness.  The chipotle aioli surprisingly had a pleasant sweetness, which did a great job of offsetting the spice of the jalapeños.  The jalapeños tasted very fresh with a "pop" of spice, and the bun did not get too soggy.  This burger was hands down better than Zinburger, and I am looking forward to going back soon.   Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at The Counter.  The burger was solid, beer was varietal, and I even made friends with the bartender.  If you are looking for a place to grab a burger and a beer, look no further than The Counter.
