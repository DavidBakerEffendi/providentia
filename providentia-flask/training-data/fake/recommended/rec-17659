Want EXCELLENT brick oven pizza in NJ ? - This is it !!! The dough is FRESH !! All ingredients are excellent ! Zach was our waiter - very good and  very friendly. Jackie at the door was VERY nice too.   The food was definately worth waiting for.  BYOB . We had to wait about 15 miuntes for a table - no problem ! We took a walk around the block. The pizzas were all wonderful. Can't wait to visit -Again and again !!!
