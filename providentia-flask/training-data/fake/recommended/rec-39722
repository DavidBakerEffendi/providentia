Joya oh Boya!!!  sorry guys, I just couldn't resist! hahahaha I really like joya!  The vibe in that place is lively all day every day... You can go on a Tuesday and it is packed with action! There portion sizes are huge for the prices and the specials are dddddelightful... !  It is okay for kids even though it is loud... and the kitchen is in the main room... Some of my fav include: ~Som Tom Gai Yang (green papaya salad with a grilled chicken quarter and skicky rice) ~Fried Tiger Shrimp Rolls with a plam sauce ~veggie pad Thai ~Thai House Salad with a peanut sour ~Spicy noddles ~Mango salad ~ and more of my glass noddles!!! OH yessss pleaseee Everything is good and they make a mean Martini too!!! Big parties are welcomed and yet another cash only place.... umMm Good Eats!   P.S. I am always so stuffed I never get to dessert... Can anyone tell me what's good????
