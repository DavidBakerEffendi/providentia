LUnch time was really slow. Nobody said Hi when we arrived so we just set anywhere. Someone brought a menu that they just quietly drop on the table. still no Hello. I order a Tom kha soup but the broccoli was black and the onions was slammy and brown and spoiled. The server noticed me digging them out, looked at me for a bit.... and quickly walk away. Nobody said thank you. Nobody said bye. I will not come back. Rude and just not welcoming at all. No effort what so ever. Why tip? Cause we had to but not cause we wanted to.
