Yum. I've been here several times for breakfast and lunch. Breakfast is amazing - both times I've gotten the two eggs any style, with 2 sides and a piece of their grain-free bread. Delicious - the 2 sides I've gotten both times have been the veggies and the sweet potato hash, but have been tempted by the bacon and sausage as well. I'm sure they're delicious. The lunch/dinner food is good, as well, although I don't love it as much as I love the egg and side combo. The only reason this place won't get 5 stars is the price. But I'm telling you, those eggs and clean sides hit the spot every time.
