I ate so much that I got sick, because everything was delicious and I couldn't stop eating. I think that pretty much sums up my review but... Complimentary popcorn with bacon- ADDICTING. I actually nearly demolished the whole thing while waiting for my friend to show up. scallops with roasted carrot puree, truffled corn salsa, capers- soft grilled to perfection. good with and without the puree. the bed of corn it was on, was surprisingly flavorful as well and not just there for decor. yellowtail tartare with yuzu gel, scallions, cassava chips- listen to the chef's recommendation of mixing it all up. delicious. crispy pork trotter with spicy mayo, slow cooked egg, and scallion- pulled pork is hard to make since it can become a bunch of stringy, dry pieces of ...string. not in this case! fried chicken with pickled daikon and herb ranch sauce- what is this witchcraft? WHITE MEAT CHICKEN THAT ISN'T DRY AT ALL? marshmallow ice cream with rice krispies treats- okay, where else have you even heard of marshmallow flavored ice cream? it will transport you back to childhood smores... unless you missed out on childhood and never had smores.
