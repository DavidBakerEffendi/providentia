I was skeptical. I like eating healthy but I am a picky eater when it comes to my sushi. Being a regular sushi lover I had my doubts that veggie sushi could satisfy my taste budds.....OH WOW! I was wrong. Beyong sushi was fabulous. We ordered way too much food, partially because we didnt know the portion sizes and partially because everything sounded so tastey. Between 2 people we ordered 3 rolls, 1 rice paper wrap and a rice bed salad, with a watermelon mint drink. The total came to just under $40. The rolls were fresh and tastey. We got spicy mang, which was on point...perfecty spiced and matched with flavors! Mightly Mushroom which tasted like truffels and had a wonderful and deep mushroom flavor and La fiesta which was my least favorite but still great. The Spicy Schroom rice paper wrap was good. It had glass noodles, enoki, teriyaki braised shitake, grilled portabella, pickled ginger, spicy cashews, lettuce and sriracha. It was an interesting mix of flavors and everything was very fresh. It reminded me of the pho vietnamese wraps Ive had before...with a modern twist. The Rice bed salad was great. It could have been a whole meal on its own (which I think is meant to be) but we didnt realize that. There was a bead of six grain rice with salad containing lettuce, avacado, cashews, seaweed salad, carrots and nori. There was more stuff on it but I dont remember what else. Everything was delicious though. Â  Even though we had a ton of leftovers we were full and happy. It was a healthy meal that tasted great and the place had a cute vibe. The workers were super friendly and helpful. I would surly go back and enjoy this place again. A+
