Our second time here and still the best service of any restaurant I have ever been to. The food is also amazing but the staff are the most friendly, professional, and knowledgable I have ever met and it deserves to be mentioned more than anything else. Whatever you get is going to be amazing (heads up, get the Brussels sprouts) and it's going to be served to you by the best servers in the city.
