Thanksgiving dinner was to die for! I heard many great things about this place back home, I just happen to be in NYC for Thanksgiving. So took the opportunity to check it out! I was highly impressed by the food and the wait staff working 12+ hrs on thanksgiving! Â Absolutely amazing flavors, best french food had in a long time! "Wee Wee"
