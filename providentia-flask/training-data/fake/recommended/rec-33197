A friend, whose advice I trust, recommended this place to me-- and it did not disappoint!! The decor is absolutely fabulous. Juxtaposition of faux baroque (check out the massive chandelier centerpiece-- stunning) and the Thai menu is very unique. It was a Friday night, so I did make a reservation-- we were sat right away and they were very accommodating with my slightly picky requests on seating. Also, my date's chair was slight broken and they were very quick to replace it--and apologetic. (P.S. the hostess' cute little black fascinator--so chic! Loved it!) The food is such a great deal. You might wonder if the quality lacks (the miniature corn spring roll appetizer is only $3 and change), but no! The dishes were well presented, thoughtfully created, and generously portioned. I don't think either of our entrees were over $12, and my date and I, being Pescatarian and Vegan respectively, had many delicious options. I was impressed. Â My Spicy Thai Basil with Tofu was lovely and my boyfriend's Pad Thai with "dried shrimp" was good, he said, but the "dried shrimp" a little salty perhaps. (But that's the nature of the beast, no pun intended) The Thai Pumpkin Flan was different than I expected. It was not bad, just not what I expected. I think I was expecting something more like Spanish flan-- this was a bit more cheesecake-y than flan. But good, nonetheless. My ginger-basil mojito was tall and well poured. Cheers! Service was pretty attentive for a busy Friday night-- nothing to rave about, but also nothing to complain about. All in all-- we loved our food (and the prices!) and will definitely be back. It was a good ambiance for a date and would also bring a group of friends here. Very chic and sexy. Thanks, Room Service! Keep up the good work.
