This place is the shark infested waters of the New York dining scene. Definitely exciting but not necessarily good.  Some of the things on the menu are unequivecolly superb.  Take for instance the pork buns or the bahn mi, or the namesake of the restaurant.  Other dishes are more like food sketches than finished masterpieces. Clearly innovative and demonstrative of the creators prowess in the culinary sphere but not so much a tight, completed work as an idea placed out there in raw form. Porn  for foodies? Absolutely. A guaranteed food experience? Yes. Consistently good, no matter what you get? ...not so much. Still, cool ambience and lots of exciting flavor combinations in a fairly approachable, low key environment.  Personally, I'm completely thilled but I may be in the niche on this one.
