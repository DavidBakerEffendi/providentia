L'Artusi is a cute Italian spot in the West Village. Upon entering, there are tables to the right and a side bar to your left. At first I thought this was a teeny location but there is actually an upstairs area, which we were seated at. The ambiance is very dark and romantic. Good thing I brought one of my closest friends. We were surrounded by couples in celebration of birthdays and anniversaries. Ironically, it was also my birthday. The drinks were well concocted and strong. I loved the Pacific Xooler * sauza blanco tequila, lime, lemongrass-ginger syrup, basil, kaffir. Very refreshing! To begin, the bread was a bit tough to bite into. It was almost crouton status. However, the tagliatelle bolognese was great. I liked that it deviated from the norm which usually incorporate a heavier tomato base. This one used white wine and cream. For dessert, I had the Brown Sugar Bread Pudding * caramelized banana, bourbon butter sauce, maple walnuts, creme fraiche gelato. This was the perfect spot for a cozy dinner celebration!
