Every northeast city is obligated to have some inexplicably large, packed Mexican place. While Tequilas is not as well done as Rosa Mexicanos, it is certainly better than Lauriol Plaza. All of these places, though, share one broad quality besides the type of cuisine: while they do not serve Taco Bell, the owners are better at running excellent businesses than making sure the food is top quality. Tequilas fits this definition exactly. Some of the dishes are nice, but items such as the ceviche and most of the fish plates (although they handle scallops well) do not justify their price point or their lengthy, colorful, and likely fictional descriptions of where they fit in Mexican cuisine and history. One pork dish's literature makes it sound like grilled pig was the secret to Mexican Independence. Stephen Starr's El Rey does better at about half the price, which is saying something as Mr. Starr himself is known for style over substance. Despite this disappointment, I cannot help but feel guilty for not rating Tequilas higher. The service is almost always excellent, and Tequilas has such a range of options that they can please almost anyone. Beyond that, the waiters are also more than robotic drones repeating specials. Several times when I have been, the waiter has noticed my obvious homosexuality and disdain for carbs, and recommended the skinny margarita, a drink I have not actually found on the lengthy menu to this day. It's a nice touch and good business; I always seem to have enough drinks to have desserts that I cannot remember. So Tequilas is a great choice when you want a large, fun Mexican celebration with attentive, yet expensive, service. Most diners care the most about strong margaritas and waiters that make them feel more important than they are, which explains why Tequilas has done so well despite a lackluster kitchen.
