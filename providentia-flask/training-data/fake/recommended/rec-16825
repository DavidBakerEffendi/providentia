Another great Philadelphia find! Atmosphere was super cool - farmy and kitschy, but not overwhelmingly so. I loved the outdoor seating area, if the weather is nice that is the place to be. The food was INCREDIBLE. Orgasmic. Delightful. Creative. Continue adjectives here. I went with a group of people so we shared the "Master Collection" cheese plate. Great way to start a meal. My husband and I each got an appetizer - I got the Tortelloni of Slow Roasted Whole Goat and he got the Braised Rabbit. Both were delicious and the types of dishes that you use a spoon to claim any last drops of sauce. For dinner we shared the Spiced Lamb Shoulder, Fresh Milled Polenta, Mace-Scented Thumbalina Carrots, and Yogurt. So good! The lamb was amazingly crispy and tender and the polenta was a great match. We also got a side of the new potatoes. Sounds boring, but oh my were they tasty. For dessert, the Millefeuille of Banana and Toffee. Amazing end to an amazing meal. Go. Now. Well, maybe not right now, but definitely for a date night or special occasion. Oh, and one last thing, other people had complained about the service being slow. It was fine for us. This is the type of place that you want to eat slowly and enjoy your meal and company. Don't try to rush.
