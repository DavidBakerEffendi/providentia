This place reminds me of all those family vacations of mine to places like Disney World where we'd pack and sneak in Kati rolls instead of eating at the overpriced food courts. Ahh, nostalgia. First off, the portions aren't that big, so don't share your roll unless you really only want a snack. The lamb & chicken kati rolls are what my friends and I got, but the lamb is far superior. It wasn't spicy at all, so I was a little disappointed by that. The ambience is great & you can really feel like you're on the streets of India without having to see any cattle sh*tting in front of you. Definitely hit this place up if you're a fan of affordable Desi food.
