Took my son there for his birthday.  The food was delicious, and service was attentive.  We had the duck confit, striped bass, and paella.  Everything was very tasty and beautifully presented.  Beware of the spicy chicken sausages in the paella though; I would have preferred the traditional chorizo.  We shared the chocolate chip bread pudding and that was really good because it was not too sweet.  We'll be back!
