When the weather cools down, where will you find me? Frankford Hall....eating a giant pretzel and roasting smores with strangers around a bonfire. This place is the bomb diggity. There are ping pong tables, jenga everywhere, beer steins, and bonfires. It feels like one big party and everyone gets to know one another. The food is great too...just stick to the classic German dishes (and the big pretzel!). Splurge on the hand cut fries but skip the burgers. They actually reminded me of the burgers I had when spending time in Germany....tasteless, with an odd texture. You're guaranteed to have a good time here. I also do and I always look forward to when I can go back.
