Found Box 63 on LivingSocial and decided to give them a try. Menu looked interesting with lots of options for pretty much everyone. The decor is very nice; cozy and relaxing in the middle of New Haven. Small outdoor patio with 4 or 5 tables and an outdoor bar. We ordered eggplant sticks and poutine for starters. The eggplant was cooked well while the coating was nice and crunchy. Unique menu item that actually worked well. The poutine was pretty good as well. Fresh cut fries with pulled pork and cheese. Could have used a smidge more cheese but was overall a good choice. For dinner we got the so-be mac and the red and blue burger. Both were delicious! The burger was extremely flavorful and cooked perfectly. The pasta was, once again, cooked spot on and had a generous amount of artichoke hearts. There was no skimping. Our waiter was very attentive throughout. The owner came out and chatted for a little while about the restaurant. Nice guy, great place. I was very impressed with Box 63. Our last couple of New Haven food adventures have been "adventures" to say the least. Box 63 is a refreshing change. I'd definitely come back to try more of the menu.
