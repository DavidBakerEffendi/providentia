This is my favorite restaurant up to date. The choices are endless with all gluten free options that taste like real food. I come here often when visiting my sister and out with the family. The desserts are just amazing aswell. It is so nice to be able to choose cake for a change and not have to worry about being gluten free. My other family members say they can't even tell the pasta is gluten free that's how good it is. This place serves real Italian and real dessert that's great!
