Had a wonderful evening; from owner Christian, servers Dave and Corey there was non stop hospitality and graciousness. Food was outstanding, boudin noir, pumpkin salad, turkey sausages (comp'ed), deep fried cod balls (comp'ed) went great with the opening round of draft belgian and other craft beers. The feature entrees was the ribeye 40 ounce steak for 2 done med rare and the incomparable pig's head. The 6 of us could not finish the food as outstanding as it was. Quantity was sufficient to feed 10. What's more Chrisitian and the cook staff are road bikers. They'll be leading rides out to Nyack and environs starting from the restaurant.  In addition to taking home the leftovers I got a Conti 4000S to replace the tire I blew out.  Very, very neat!!!
