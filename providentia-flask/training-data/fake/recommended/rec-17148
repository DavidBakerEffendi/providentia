The ambiance at Cuban Pete's was amazing. I think I was dancing in my chair the entire time. Our group brought our own bottle of wine & our server made it into Sangria - very tasty and a unique BYO option. I got the Gloria sandwich - it came grilled with cheese, pickle, onion and shredded meat (pork, I think). I would definitely get it again. My friends got the tapas - highlights: chorizo & fried cheese. The pear salad looked great as well. We arrived at 3pm on a Saturday and the place was hopping; there's a definite possibility that we would have had a hard time getting in if we had come at a more traditional lunch or dinner time. Long story short: I would definitely go again - especially if the weather was right for sitting on the patio!
