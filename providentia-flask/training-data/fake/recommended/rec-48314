Good beer. Good food.  Good service. The decor is warm, and there is German artwork peppering the walls. I ordered a Franziskaner beer (light, sweet wheat beer) and it was delicious.  To eat, I got the fried cod dish.  Nicely fried, with potatoes and spinach and lemons on the side.  Comfort food is really the best way to describe it.  I cleaned my plate.   For dessert I got the bread pudding - very firm, not too sweet or drizzly.  I'll definitely go back, as this is a neighborhood gem.
