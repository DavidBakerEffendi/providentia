I really like this place. It's got a really warm neighborhood vibe, with a mix of older folks and whatever you call the younger people who've moved into the area (I wouldn't really call them hipsters) and a smattering of the Chowhound fanatics in search of the next great pizza place. It's great for a date or a small group of friends sharing some wine (especially since it was still BYOB both times I went). I've never been to Grimaldi's, or Totonno's, or Patsy's, or Lombardi's, so I'm really not the right person to tell you how good the pizza is, but I can tell you that you can do far, far worse than the pies here. And it's better than John's on Bleecker, which is just riding on its rep. The crust is thin, the edges crisp, it's got a nice char, the toppings don't weigh it down, the ingredients are quality, there's no grease. It's good enough that I'm willing to trek out here from Manhattan. The only problem is the consistency, which perhaps they've remedied by now. Given that the owner was making all the pies himself, there was much more variation between them than there should be. On one ocassion, we killed three of them, and while it was great that each one was better than the last, it shouldn't have been that way. Another time, the pizza was strangely soggy on the bottom. But if there aren't any blips in the execution, I have a feeling the pies could stand in the same room with all those legends without embarassment.
