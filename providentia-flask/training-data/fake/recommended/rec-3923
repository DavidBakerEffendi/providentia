Yippee! So glad this place is in my hood. Not only is Cheryl lovely and present in her space, but the food is great! Went from brunch and enjoyed my complimentary mimosa and poached eggs and salmon hash. The decor is not bad either. Expect a long line of big dog owners, bicycle enthusiast's and trendwhores out front during brunch hours. Sidebar It's crazy how much this area has changed in the past 10 years. Back in the day were we lucky to have a bodega that sold sandwiches on moldy bread (not a lie). Now we've got poached eggs and chipotle dipping sauce for our fries. I wonder why??????????
