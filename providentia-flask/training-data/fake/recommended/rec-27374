Love this place! Our first date night with friends since the arrival of our little bean. The drinks are delicious and the mixologist( they are not just regular bartenders) are very generous with the alcohol no watered down drinks here:) oh the pumpkin ale with cinnamon around the glass rim is pure genius ( pumpkin pie kinda genius) The food.....the wings are freaking delicious I'm usually not a fan of chicken wings but the pickled pepper wing is worth reapplying your lipstick. Pork belly is the best I tried so far. My only meh moment was the truffle fries, it's just plain ole fries no truffle. But I will definitely be back here to eat my way through the menu.
