I went here for the second time last night and it was even better than the first time... Hard to believe. Service is impeccable as well as the food. Oysters and fish are unbelievably fresh and cooked to perfection. Sides are tasty... My friend and I left nothing on our plates. Bring your own bottle is nice, too. Five stars without a doubt!
