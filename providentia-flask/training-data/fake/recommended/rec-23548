I wanted so badly to like this place. A bar dedicated to whiskey? A bar with over 100 whiskies to choose from? What's not to like? Turns out: quite a bit. What I expected in "The Whiskey Room": a dark and quiet Irish (or Scottish?) style pub; lots of whiskey; maybe some darts. What I got: sure there was lots of whiskey; but entirely too loud, and... well, I didn't see any darts. RE: "entirely too loud" -- WHAT WAS WITH THE TOP 40-STYLE TECHNO, YOU GUYS? Seriously. I enjoy some house music, but this was about the last thing I would expect to hear in this place. And at that volume? Months later and my ears are still ringing. (And why play pop house at all if you don't have enough of a floor for dancing? The Half Lounge already has the monopoly on this niche market.) I did enjoy my whiskies, and it *had* been a while since I'd seen any place carry Powers, but give me a break, you guys.
