Beautifully designed. Romantic, Intimate. A great, much needed addition to that neighborhood. Unpretentious. A very solid and tasteful menu both for drinks and food, that rotates based on fresh/seasonal ingredients. GREAT wine list. All their pasta is homemade. Both their brunch and dinner are awesome. It's still a bit of a secret neighborhood joint so it doesn't seem to get too overcrowded. I would go check it out before more people find out about it.
