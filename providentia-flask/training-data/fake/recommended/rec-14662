Great! Great! Great!  but remember to make reservations!!  I hadn't been since shortly after they opened over the summer and we almost didn't get in since we hadn't made reservations but then we ended up getting a seat at the bar after the hostess/manager ran after us down the street!  What a biscuit!  We owe you Irma!  ;) Everything on the menu is fantastic and reasonably priced!  Win-win.  Memorable moments: Pumpkin soup w/ banana, rice puffs and pork belly! and the duck and sweet potato entree!  YUM!  Do yourself a favor and go get Traifed!
