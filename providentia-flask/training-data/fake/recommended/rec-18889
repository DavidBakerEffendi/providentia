We went with a large group that encompassed three 1/2 generations (yes my daughter is with child!) After waiting about 20 minutes to be seated, we were greeted promptly by our waitress who offered drinks, and went over the "Taste of Hartford" menu, which offered a soup, salad, entree with a side, and cheesecake for dessert...all for $20.13. Most of us went for this, including myself. I ordered New England Clam Chowdahh, and Prime rib with baked potato. I consider myself a true conneussieur (sp) of clam chowder. There are so many variables to this dish to consider, including consistency, creaminess, onion flavor, bacon flavor, size and cosistency of potatoes and clams...very few places hit the mark. I'm happy to say that Chowder Pot has one of the best clam chowders I've had in my life. It was a joy to share and finish. The rib eye was not the best, which I should have expected from a place that primarily serves fish...not terribly tender, but the portion was good, the doneness was spot on, and the flavor was fine. The baked potato came wrapped in foil, one of my minor peeves, but to my surprise, it was hot, and cooked perfectly. Guess I got there just in time. The cheesecake came with a choice of toppings, but after everything else, I opted for plain. It was a good commercially made cheesecake. Nothing terrible, but nothing to write home about. One of the deciding factors that allowed me to grant 4 stars is the attention and immediacy the crew had for making things right. One of our group received a lobster that had a spoiled claw. It happens. A waitress who was not even assigned to us took it away immediately, and put in an order for a new one. When it came out, it was sweet, tender and perfect...so kudos for that. Next time I will try seafood, but one thing is for sure. I will DEFINITELY have the clam chowder!
