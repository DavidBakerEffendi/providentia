maybe because it was an oasis for a rainy day, birthday brunch or maybe it was dear friend john hyping it up beforehand but saraghina is definitely a place i will be returning to in the near future. not a far walk from my home but oddly placed in the stuyvesant heights part of bed-stuy, which apparently is becoming an up-and-coming part of the neighborhood. the restaurant seems like a place you can really spend an entire night at due to the massive wine room in the back (i think you can only view through windows in the back dining room--this is apparently a new addition as it used to be BYOB) and the outside garden patio. gentlemen, this is a place to woo a lady. ladies, the waiters are hot. and as a designer, i appreciate the detail put forth in the menus, business cards and interior decorations. thank you, saraghina. tharaghina.
