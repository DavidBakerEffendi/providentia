Just turned vegetarian and this is my first time here. I love this place already. The older guy was nice when I placed my order he catered to my every need. I got the vegetarian roti wrap. It has potatoes collar-greens and pumpkin rolled on this wrap. I don't like the cakie things between the roti but the rest of the food is great! I'm really satisfied with the whole experience! And it was super fast!!!
