Good god. Jesus. Hail Mary. I used to live 3 BLOCKS from this divine culinary piece of heaven. And now I live thousands of miles away. My first stop when I land back in NY in LaGuardia, is straight here (its only 15 minutes away). I mean what can I say? The fantastic and hearty greek salad with warm, crusty bread. The delectable lemon potatoes. The grilled shrimp or calamari that will delight your mouth in ways I cant even describe. And best yet...the free dessert at the end, - galaktoboureko; a honey-custard like pie. You may have to wait in line, especially on a nice summer/spring day. But heck, wait. Because a) the area doesn't have anything like it and b) you'll leave stuffed, happy and forgot you every had to wait. If you live in Astoria, or NYC for that matter, please go and pay respect to the genius in the kitchen.
