A great stop on a Monday night after work. What a great way to start off the work week! Burgers and beer with friends. Not to mention that we got two bacon cheeseburgers with fires and 5 bears for just $33. (Before the Â well deserved tip) Who ever knew that a place with good food would only charge $2.50 for a beer?!?! I didn't think that was even legal in NYC.
