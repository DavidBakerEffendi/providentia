I like to believe I've tried most of the pizzas along the east coast from Florida to Maine. Â I've had plenty of great pizzas, some not so great and a lot of I had better. Hearing the hype of Pepe's white clam pizza, I was very very anxious to try. It's all hype. I've had much better pizzas in Portland, Maine at a joint called Otto. There's also numerous take outs in NYC that I would prefer over this. To me, it's hype. You can do better without the waiting.
