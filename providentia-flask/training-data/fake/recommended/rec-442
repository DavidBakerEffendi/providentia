I went for brunch and was pleased with the food.  It reminded me very much of it's sister restaurant , Jane.  Prices were a little high, still, I thought.  But it is nice that a drink is included if you order from the brunch menu.  I think it is better value for brunch than dinner.  Also they had a high chair and let me also keep a bassinet near our table which I really appreciated.
