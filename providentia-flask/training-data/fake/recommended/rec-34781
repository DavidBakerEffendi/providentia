I'd give three and a half stars if I could. The first time I came to Grimaldi's about a year ago, it was the best pizza I ever had.  It was definitely 5 star pizza.  The crust was thin and crispy, baked perfectly!  The mozzarella was fresh and please do order garlic on your pizza if you're a fan of garlic!  Fresh garlic was the perfect topping, along with pepperoni.   DO NOT GET MUSHROOMS!  Or anything that will soggy up the pizza!  I love mushrooms, but the mushrooms soggies up the pizza when its baked fresh. I've been back a bunch of times since, but unfortunately I feel like they don't wring out their mozzarella well enough so you're left with a soggy crust.  It's still good pizza, but not the best I've ever tasted anymore.   :(
