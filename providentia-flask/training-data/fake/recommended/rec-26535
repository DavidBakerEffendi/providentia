The only reason I give it 3 stars is that for what it serves, it is pricey. But I think all Thai and Japanese restaurants seem to think it's okay to charge high prices and serve smallish quantities of food. How can you serve three pieces for an appetizer? The soups were delish and the duck in tamarind sauce was superb. The fish cakes appetiser was excellent. The curries however were alright, nothing special. The shock of finding pineapple in all t he curries we tried was a bit off putting. Service was very good, and we had a chat with the owner a couple of times and have offered to re-do her menu as it has some interesting typos... like 'crap' for 'crab'. :-) we do go there occasionally but not as often because the prices are a bit high.
