I've ben going to the DW consistently (2-3x a week) since it opened. The food is what keeps me coming back... specials are usual very special indeed. The regular menu seems to have something for everyone. The RIBS are amazing esp over baked beans Â but lately have been showing up with some decent collards. The shirmp BLT is slammin and the fries that accompany each dish are worth the calories. The catfish sandwich finally has a tartar sauce (of the chipotle variety) and recently, desserts have been showing up on the specials board. Good quality ingredients and thoughtfully prepared food make the DW a no brainer for meeting up locally. Note: New waitstaff / kitchen mgmt are a bit of a challenge esp on busy nights. Head over early if youre especially hungry to keep the wait reasonable.
