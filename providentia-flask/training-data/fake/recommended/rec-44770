I want to give more stars to this place but i can't... Decor: This is a hole in the wall place and has its own charm to it. Crowd: 20s-30s Food: Im really trying to understand where the amazing reviews come in. I do find myself to know where there is good food but I couldn't find it here. I ordered the eggs benedict which is my standard go to and it was simply bland. Worst part...there were TWO hairs in my plate and was completely mentally spoiled from that as I had eaten most of it. When I mentioned to the waitress, she kindly apologized but it was never taken off the bill which is what i would expect after a meal like that. My mother ordered the salmon potato pancake dish and even tho i see people raving about the dish, again, i found it extremely bland and the salmon wasn't as fresh as i would expect it to be. Maybe it was an off day and we ordered the wrong dishes from this place...but I haven't had such a poor brunch like this in a long time.
