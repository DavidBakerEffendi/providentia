Best Rodizio I've been to ny far! Meat after meat they bring out it gets better and better. You will not go home with an empty stomach. Appetizers are also verry good.  Chorizo and grilled octopus is some of the best Ive ever had at any restaurant in the area. Sangria is good not the best but it does the job and goes well with the rodizio or menu items. But be prepared you are garunteed to wait to be seated a minimum of 25-30 minutes even if you do have a reservation. It is always packed and there is absolutely no waiting area so people are just crammed anywhere they can possibly fit. I guess that  speaks volumes about their food shows that people are willing to wait for it though.  Great food here!
