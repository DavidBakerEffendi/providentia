This place is alright. This cheese steak place was listed as a must try at my hotel. I walked over there with a group of my friends to taste them and Geno's. This place got second place in my comparison taste wise. I would give a higher star rating for the food however the customer service is lacking. It only takes a second to cut a sandwich in half no need to bark no at me and be rude. I will not return to this place. Save yourself the time in their line and go across the street to Geno's.
