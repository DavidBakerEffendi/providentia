This joint elevates the Egg Sammy to the level of high art. Simply slammin'. My bro and I each got the "Penny" and the "Abuelo" and went 1/2s on each. Wow. Both are awesome. The fresh-squeezed OJ was delish and nicely pulp-free. The restaurant as a whole is also, clearly, a tightly run ship. Good service that's quick without making you feel rushed, good tunes playing and happy vibe. If you don't mind paying a little more than you would at a diner then go b/c, like they say, you get what you pay for.
