AWESOME dinner and service.  Dan, our waiter, was superb!!!!  The food was excellent.  My husband had the mushroom soup (a hallmark of the place) plus the lamb shank.  The lamb easily fell off the bone as he cut into it.  I had a salad and the duck.  There was nothing left on either plate.  The only area for improvement would have been the wine.  We had an excellent Malbec at the upstairs bar, but it was not on the menu downstairs.  The wine--one of the owner's favorites--was OK, but we would have preferred the wine we had at the bar.  The atmosphere was a bit dark for my husband, but I was fine with it.
