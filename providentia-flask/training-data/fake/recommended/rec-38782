This is the only place I'll go to for a Viet Hoagie. I tried a couple places in Chinatown and I use to love O Sandwiches before their quality went down after a year. Ba Le is my go to spot now for Viet Hoagies. If you don't know how to speak Viet, no worries, there's a sandwich menu with pictures and you can order by the number. Several of my veggie friends enjoy their Vegetarian Hoagie which is made very differently from the tofu hoagies at Fu Wah in West Philly. Btw, I like Fu Wah's tofu hoagies too. if you're feeling adventures, check out their summer rolls and other small goodies on the counter and on the hot rack. You'll find a larger variety of food in the cases on the weekend because that's when all the shoppers come out. Tip #1: If you're ordering a sandwich for later consumption, ask to put the veggies on the side. Tip #2: Buy 5 hoagies and get the 6 free!
