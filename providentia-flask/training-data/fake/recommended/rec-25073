When me and my girlfriend where attending Connecticon. We decide to head down to West Hartford to get some sushi at Sakura Garden only to find out it was closed (which is a crying shame), so out of desperation we looked up the nearest sushi place using Yelp and this being the first to pop up. We did not waste any time and just drive down the street and park at the bank of the parking lot near the restaurant. We where greeted with a friendly soft spoken waitress. My girlfriend ordered the Bento box and I ordered the cheif's dinner with a side of Sake. The chicken that was served on my girlfriends bento box is the most delicious chicken I have eaten. The sushi really fulfilled my lust for sushi that day. It was like almost perfect. It is on the pricy side but I do think its worth it though.
