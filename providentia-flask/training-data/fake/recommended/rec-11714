the brunch that I compare all other brunches to... and no other brunch comes close and i'm always disappointed that i didn't make the trek up to the east village... their corned beef hash and their creative breakfast beverages are AMAZING. buttermilk biscuits with seasonal preserves (when i went it was peach... ) sooo good i could eat those all day every day! YUmmmm
