One of my friends yelp'ed this place when we were planning out our study adventure in Brooklyn. This place is pretty much a hole in the wall in a far off corner of Williamsburg, with no sign marking the store front. My friend and I walked back and forth using google maps to tri-angulate where it was. Inside, the restaurant is very spartan with two tables for food and a register where you order the food. Yet, don't let all of these things preventing you from stopping by. The banh mi here is delicious, though the pho is so-so. Pork bahn mi ($5): Crispy toasted baguette filled with lots of moist, flavorful barbequed pork. 4/5 Traditional bahn mi ($5): A great banh mi filled lots of cold cuts. Very well-balanced with the addition of the picked radish/carrots, cilantro, pate and sauce. One of the best that I've had. 4.5/5 Pho ($6): A good bowl of pho. Â The broth was good and had very little MSG taste. I wish it came with more veggies and meat. 3.5/5 A good hole in the wall place for Viet food. I'd come back here for the banh mi for sure!
