Ramen is your best friend when the weather is cold! I won't ramble much because the reviews and pictures explain it all. With over 5k reviews AND it's a Michelin-starred restaurant, you know this place HAS to be great! We waited for almost an hour before it opened its door for dinner at 5pm on a Saturday night. It was worth the wait in the cold. As soon as you walk in, the whole entire staff erupts with a loud greeting in Japanese and they're probably saying "welcome, eat our food, it's delicious!" haha. We were seated and treated like VIP! We were handed moist towelettes and they brought out our drink orders right away. We started our meal with the Hirata Buns with chicken. It was amazing!!! You have to get it! I had a taste of the Hirata Buns with pork and that was even more amazing!!! I preferred the pork over the chicken. The Shiromaru Hakata Classic Ramen is what I had and I loved it. I added a soft boiled egg to it and went well with the ramen. I also had a taste of the Akamaru Modern and was also delicious. Â Broth for both ramen dishes were rich and flavorful. All the ingredients went well together. Afterwards, they serve you green tea. It was a nice end to a great meal. Worth the wait and the price! You have to try this place out!!!
