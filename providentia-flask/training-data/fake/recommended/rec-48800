I had been here several times and enjoyed the food, especially the torta. Unfortunately, when I went today, I found that Rubamba had raised all its prices (there were stickers covering the old ones all over the menu). I went with one of the cheaper options: a chicken burrito for $8.95. But once I received my food, I found that my burrito was almost all rice, with very little chicken. Disappointing.
