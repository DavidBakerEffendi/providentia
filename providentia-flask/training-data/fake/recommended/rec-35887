Mediocre food but convenient and friendly. Â Polpetone and spinach gnocchi drowning in too much sauce. Too much bread filler in the meatballs. Special avocado and tuna salad very good. Reasonable service. Busy and lively. Seems kinda silly for a restaurant this popular not to take credit cards for 3.5% fee.
