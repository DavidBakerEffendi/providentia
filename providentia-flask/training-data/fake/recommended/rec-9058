Yum!  Chicken and waffles!  I do love chicken and waffles, and this place is in Harlem and extremely close to a subway stop.  How could I not go? Pretty tasty chicken and waffles, I must say.  I've been to a number of places, and this is one of the better ones.  Their waffles are large, belgian-style, and have a very good flavor.  The chicken was also really juicy.  I also got a kool-aid, which was a nice touch. Not the best chicken and waffles I've ever had (that goes to Gladys Knight's) but they are definitely doing a lot right.  Recommended.
