Hey.  ANY place where Yelpettes are screaming "GIMME MORE BALLS!" has got to be a great place.  The Meatball Shop is no exception.  Ended up here on a wonderful recommendation from the bartender at the Mondrian, a true unsung Maven of NYC. I think we must've tried every meatball in the joint, ordered a pitcher of beer of which not even a full glass was consumed, probably because of copious wine and JD's prior, but more than likely because not enough space could be allocated for one more bite of delicious meatballs. There was honestly not one meatball that wasn't fantastic.  Go with a party of 3 or maybe 4 (if lighter eaters) and try everything on the menu. Be prepared to wait an hour.
