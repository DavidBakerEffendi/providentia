Just left this place. There was a hair in my fish. I sent it back, however I cut my fish in a certain spot to make sure they would give me a new dish instead of just taking the hair out and playing it off as if it was a new dish. Minutes later they bring me a new dish..surprise, surprise! They gave me a fish with a cut in the exact same place. Coincidence? Nope! This place is disgusting.
