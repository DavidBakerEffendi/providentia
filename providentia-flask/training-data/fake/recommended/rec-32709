I've had the pleasure of dining at TK for team cocktail hours, birthday dinners, and lunches during Restaurant Week and i'll definitely be back. Out of the higher end restaurants Downtown I have to say that this is the one that delivers the most for your Â buck. The menu is diverse and the food is flavorful. I'm a big fan of the rock shrimp and I don't even typically eat seafood! The staff and service is fast and friendly and the atmosphere is warm and sophisticated. If you've got the money to drop, I'd recommend this over many places including Max's Downtown
