Grabbed the smothered pork torta and the onion rings. First, the torta itself is smothered in its entirety with more sauce on the plate itself. The sandwich wasn't drenched in it and was a unique twist to your typical torta to add flavor to what likely was a so-so bread. The pork was a bit on the dry side but not too bad. Try it while this torta is on the menu. Onion rings were as good as ever. Eat them while they are hot for that satisfying beer battered crunch.
