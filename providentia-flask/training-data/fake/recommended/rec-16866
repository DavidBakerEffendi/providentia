GREAT FOOD! The specials are always AMAZING! I am sometimes unsure about the specials, but I order them almost every time I go and I am blown out of the water by how good they are every time. I have tried almost all of the flatbreads and have loved all of them. The beer selection is really good and reasonably priced too. No complaints other than there is often a long wait on weekends but you can stop by and put your name on a list to get bumped up the line when you arrive.
