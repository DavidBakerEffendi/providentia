The place is as glam as it gets with a big chandelier in the middle of the room. Modern style and rather darkly lit but tastefully done. Room Service is always extremely crowded. The service does a good job though and the menu is lovely. Downside: The food is above average but not as good as it could be (there lacks spice or sth.) in light of the venue, the descriptions on the menue and the stiff competition of Thai places in Hell's kitchen. A good restaurant which does not disappoint but simply not the best.
