OMG my dinner was so good! Every time I'm hungry now and trying to figure out what I'm in the mood for, my tongue's memory instantly remembers the flavor bonanza that was Tequilas, and makes me crave mexican. (Please note -- after eating here, Chipotle doesn't satisfy quite as well...) The place was packed so it was good people watching, and the drink menu was so vast it was almost overwhelming! Of course, despite it's breadth, I wanted the one thing not listed, but the kindly bartender whipped me up a fresh bloody mary anyway. (Please note -- yum!) The freshly made chips (still glistening with hot oil), appetizers, drinks, entrees AND dessert were all delicious, and the ONLY reason I'm docking them a star is because we asked for our plentiful left-overs to be boxed up, and when we got home and went to open up the boxes for a Tequila's snack, we saw that our waitress had only boxed up one of the meals. (Note -- #$%*&!?) Still, I'm hungry now, and dying to go back. For the future, I'll have to remember to either eat everything on my place so there are no left-overs -- or -- be extra vigilant about the boxing-up process.
