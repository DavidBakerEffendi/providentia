Yummy in my tummy. But not so yummy for my moneyyy. I got the chili con carne burrito. I don't know what I was expecting but apparently using Spanish to say "A burrito filled with Chili" tricked me into thinking I was going to get some kind of Mexican explosion in my mouth. It was good, don't get me wrong, but in the end it was just a burrito filled with the kind of chili you get out of a can *Disclaimer: I'm a Wendy's chili type of girl (Large w/ a ton of hot sauce and an order of fries... Mmmm). I'm also confused as to why people keep going on and on about how big the burritos are. They're about 1/4 smaller than the burritos you get at chipotle and equivalently priced. Also, I was tricked by these other reviewers into thinking I'd get a huge ass bag o' chips to go w/ my, allegedly, equally big ass burrito.... Alas, another misconception. The bag is about the size of my palm and my palm is the size of a small child's; or a primordial dwarf's. Not really, but hyperbole seems to be the soup du jour in Michelle-land today. I do, however, appreciate its proximity to my apartment and must admit that I'm pretty effing lazy. For that, Burrito Box deserves an extra star or two but sadly I'm too lazy to move my cursor the 2 inches to do so.
