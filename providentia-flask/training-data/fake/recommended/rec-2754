I had their jerk chicken wrap and CAN'T WAIT to go back again and try something else. They had a newspaper critique on their wall and was very impressed with their review. I had their fried plantains and I thought I had died and gone to the Caribbean. I cannot wait until I go back again. Though the place is slightly small and plain, It's ideal for takeout.
