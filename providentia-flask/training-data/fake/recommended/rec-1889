We made our way (from Boston) to Pat's after seeing the fued between Pat's and Gino's on Man vs. Food. I gotta say I side with Pat's. It was the juiciest Steak n Cheese Ive ever had. We walked up to te window and asked for an authentic Philly Pat's Style and it was sooooo goood!!! A must stop from now on whenever we go to or through Philly. Amazing!
