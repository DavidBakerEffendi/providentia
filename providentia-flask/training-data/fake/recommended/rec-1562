I was so excited to visit Philly and experience an amazing Philly Cheese steak. But Geno's didn't do it for me. It was just OK, but I'm sure their are other cheese steak places that are way better. I added a bunch of hot sauce and hot peppers on top of my cheese steak to give it flavor. Either way I was excited to visit Philly for the first time and watch my first eagles game; so I had a good time at Genos. There wasn't any lines and enough seats to sit and enjoy my cheese steak. Next visit I might go across the street to Pats and see that all the fuss is about other there. Until next time Philly!
