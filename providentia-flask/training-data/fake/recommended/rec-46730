My husband and I went there for dinner Saturday night , the place was packed! However, the service was quick and we got our food pretty quick. We ordered muscles and app sampler to start off with, not to impressed with the muscles, but the samplers were delicious! Main entree: Drunken noodle was outstanding, you have to try it! Â Curry was tasty with right amount of spice..... Overall , we had a good time . Will go back again and it's my new favor Thai spot now!
