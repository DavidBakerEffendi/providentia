Worth the trip DEEP into Staten Island from the ferry.  It helps to have a ride, because otherwise you have to take the bus.  But I've made the trip with my father in law several times before catching a SI Yankees game and its some of the best pizza I've ever had.  A nice adjacent dive bar and a cute family institution.
