After living for several years on the west coast, it was nice to be able to appreciate sushi/sashimi again.  The sushi/sashimi platter was very delectable. It was fresh and soft like buttah!  Very tasty selections.  My favorites are the tuna and the salmon.  The real California rolls were also great.  I was happy that the option of real crab was available. The atmosphere is very matter of fact, but the service was good.  The restaurant is very tiny, but I've gone twice and have not had any issues in getting a table. Good sushi place that I will continue to visit.
