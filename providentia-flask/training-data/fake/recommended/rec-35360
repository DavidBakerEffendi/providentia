This place is legit. Lots of food. I will complain however on the lack of vegetables -- more greens please! The pita bread if you get the plate is also paltry. Gimme some more of dat! But the chicken and lamb are great. Moist. The white sauce is admittedly necessary as several have noted. I dumped on the red sauce the first time I went (I'm a baller) and had to retreat to a nearby restaurant to wash my mouth out. It's srsly hot. But good. There's a fountain across the street right? Eat over there! At night!
