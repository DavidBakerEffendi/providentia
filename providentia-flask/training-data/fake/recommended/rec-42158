We went to Meritage last Thursday for the Korean Fried chicken and came in with high expectations.   For appetizers, we ordered the pommes frites and flatbread with curry.  The fries were disappointingly un-crispy, which was a shame.  The flatbread was just OK, with a small serving of curry that was likewise mediocre.   Now for the centerpiece... the Korean Fried chicken.  It came with 6 pieces and a 20-oz Sapporo.  The pairing was great, and the chicken was EXTREMELY moist... props for that.   The sauce was spicy enough, and was described well by Mindy K. as a mix of korean pepper paste and sriracha.  I thought it could've been a bit lighter on the sauce though.   Compared to the Korean Fried chicken at Bon Chon (Northeast Philly), this one was less crispy and had more sauce.   The restaurant itself had a very home-y feel, like eating at a friend's house.  There was a bar section and a separate dining area which was secluded and quiet.   It's great that the chef took inspiration from asian influences for her dishes, but overall we thought that the originals (indian pancakes at Penang or BonChon chicken at Cafe Soho) were better than her interpretations.
