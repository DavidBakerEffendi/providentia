WHY DON'T WE HAVE THIS IN SF?!! :(! I would be the happiest person in the world if we had a cart out here. I ordered the Halal chicken and rice and it was perfect! It is a big size but you should definitely order your own and drown it in white sauce ;) I finished my left overs the next day and it was still amazing.
