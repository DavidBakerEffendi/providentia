While the service was great and the price was pretty standard, I found a chicken bone in the sandwich. It looked like they had pre-cooked and pulled chicken set aside (if I had known the chicken wasn't cooked to order I would never have ordered in the first place). Of course, this happened on a train ride home so I couldn't go back right away to the restaurant. Not just a risk of choking, but a wasted 10 bucks too, WOMP.
