Ippudo.  In the East Village.  Yum.   They make their own noodles (the proper thin egg kind) and they make their own broth.  Mmmm garlic!  Mmmm negi!  Mmmm mysterious red stuff that you stir into the broth!  It tastes the same as the other Ippudo location I'm familiar with in Ebisu, Tokyo.  The NY location is larger and more trendy than any of the branches I've visited before. It is "pricey", but have you been to Momofuku?  They're a home grown outfit (not from Japan) and a meal there costs about the same.  So maybe it's NOT that pricey.  For New York anyway.   I wish they'd open a branch in San Francisco.  You can't get good ramen or noodles in aforementioned ramen to save your life.   Worth the flight and definitely belongs on the East Village ramen flight that my New York visits have become.
