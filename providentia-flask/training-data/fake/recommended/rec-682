This is the kind of place you go to once a year for a big occasion.  Food is fabulous, ambiance is spectacular, service is spectacular and the prices are very pricey.  Of course you get what you pay for.  You will not be disappointed and your guest will be very impressed.  Nothing bad to say about this place, I love it.  Wish I could afford to go more often!  I have no idea how this place survives in the Trenton area?
