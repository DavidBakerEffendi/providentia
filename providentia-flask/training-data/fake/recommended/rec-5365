I took my boo here.  Saturday night 9:30ish. Loud as a motha. Girls trying to dance in a circle in the corner. Food pretty pretty pretty pretty good. I remember it being better. The service was fast, the workers friendly. The food was fast and it suffered for it.  It had sort of the Chipolte (semi-fast food) quality, although better than Chipolte. Unfortunately, unlike Chipolt,e it was pricey. We got Hummus and Pita, Crispy Calamari Salad, French Onion Soup Dumplings, Mushroom Flatbread, and the Cheesesteak Eggroll. Cheesesteak Eggroll, you got it (Kevin McCallister voice). But the Mushroom Flatbread, was eh. Pretty greasy. Crispy Calamari Salad was a lot for a little. French Onion Soup Dumplings, which I enjoyed a year or so ago, were like cheese and blah in a nice tiny package, "that's what she said;" I mean literally that's what my boo said. The Hummus and Pita was probably the second best dish we got.  It's $9 and is probably worth $5.  I remember it being cheaper. And in many ways the dining experience was. Although my wallet may disagree.
