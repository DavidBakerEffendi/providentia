I grew up on home-cooked Korean food, so maybe I'm spoiled here...but Ichiban is NOT good Korean food.  The side dishes are okay, but the food itself, although Korean in name and looks, does not taste anything like real Korean food.  It's oily, relatively flavorless (or emphasizes the wrong flavors altogether), and the kalbi was tough and rock-hard in some places...just not good Korean food.  It's really sad because are no other Korean restaurants anywhere near Hartford.  I've never had their sushi, but their main dishes that are billed as being "korean" are nothing of the sort.  I've asked around for opinions from some Koreans I know in the area, and the most positive response I've gotten is, "meh."  If most Koreans don't even like it, that tells you a lot.
