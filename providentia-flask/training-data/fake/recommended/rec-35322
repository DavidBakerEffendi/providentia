Went to totto ramen on Tuesday night at 6:40 pm.  Waited about 40 mins for two seats.  I ordered the chicken totto ramen with pork and the broiled pork with mayo don. The soup had good thick chicken flavor even though they only use chicken for stock.  It's not too salty or oily.  The noodles cooked al dente.  Liked the noodles a lot, it's not too thin or thick.  The broiled pork mayo don was good.  They use torch to sizzle out the extra pork belly fat so it's not as greasy.  However, I wish the rice is not as mushy.  Maybe I had the bad batch of cooked rice.  The Avocado tuna had nice seared on the outside and rare in the center but that's all.  I think the flavor was average, nothing too exciting.  They used a lot of fried garlic for the sauce to add on top of tuna.  In my opinion, it is a bit too strong of garlic and overpowering for the tuna.   The meat lover ramen is the same ad chicken totto ramen except there is piles of varies type of pork meat.  If you have average stomach like me, I suggest don't order anything else because it comes wirh a lot of meat.  No kidding.  Overall the foods were good and the staffs were nice.  The priced for the ramen and side dishes were reasonable.   Just be expected average wait was at least 40 mins.
