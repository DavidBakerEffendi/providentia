best cupcakes i've ever had. i don't know where they come from and they're a little pricey, but totally worth it. so much so that i've gone multiple times a week and been worried that the guy at the counter will remember my face. even so, totally worth the potential moment of uncomfortableness based on GIANT ASS frosting filled candy topped cupcake consumption several times a week. paninis= pretty decent too, but honestly, who can focus when you're thinking about a cupcake?
