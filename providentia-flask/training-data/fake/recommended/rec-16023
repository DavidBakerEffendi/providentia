Came here on a Saturday night at 12am and there was no wait! Lucky us! Meatballs 100% live up to the hype. For my first visit here, I had the spicy pork meatballs with spicy red sauce. I go risotto on the side; which honestly I could have done without. My boyfriend got the chicken meatballs with red sauce and rigatoni on the bottom. The meatballs have a hard outside which gives them an awesome texture. Best part of this meal is you can trade balls :). Both were delish. The pork having a serious zing but just the perfect amount. Portion sizes were perfect. Cant wait to come back to try the smash sandwiches which looked really yummy.
