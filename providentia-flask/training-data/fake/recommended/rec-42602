Dined here the other night. Food was very good, but the overall prices and portion sizes of both food and drinks were comical. $90 after tax and tip, and we left hungry. I feel for what we got, a $55-$65 total with tax and tip made more sense to us. We'll wait awhile to see what they do moving forward. For now, we can wait. We can get a full dinner at many Park Slope neighborhood places  (this is in Windsor Terrace) all with farm to table style food at $90.  But to literally feel like we just had a few snacks and still be hungry, it was a bit unacceptable.
