This West Village staple has a solid burger (one of the best, if not *the* best in NYC), a lively crowd, friendly (if very busy) staff, and a well-worn, comfortable, and unique environment.   Be prepared to wait for a table on weekends, and even some weeknights, but don't be a douche - be kind to your fellow drinkers/patrons.  You're all in it together.  :-)
