I went there for my birthday and it was simply just a great experience. Starting with the owner, who was so gracious and friendly and generous, he made sure that we were always pleased. To the food, it was delicious and authentically Cuban. Yes, it was a little loud and crowded, but after all, that's what Latins love. I would definitely reccomend it and pass the word on to my friends. I will be there again. Sincerely, Cristina from Argentina
