after all the rave reviews here on yelp, soba-ya did not live up to my very high expectations.  hmmm.   perhaps my expectations were too high.  you see, i have a list of places i want to eat at/go to in NYC in the next year based on recommendation and soba-ya was one of them.  my friend and i ordered the tuna tartar for our appetizer.  yum!  my hopes soared and my anticipation heightened.  for my main dish, i ordered the hot duck soba noodle soup like others suggested.  waaahh it was so disappointing!  like someone else mentioned, the soup was a little sour, the duck was a little tough, and i was really not impressed with the dish as a whole.  i left the restaurant dejected and don't think i'll be coming back.  booo.
