Went here on a desolate weeknight and experienced: 1. poorly executed and overpriced food; 2. bad service and long wait for food; 3. freezing temperatures! Literally, there was no one else there and we waited 30 minutes for appetizers.  No update from waitress on why our food was taking so long; no inquiries as to how we were doing (hungry!).  We didn't even get any bread while we were waiting! The food was conceptually interesting but poorly executed.  I mean seriously - $7 for a rubbery Scotch egg?  The mussels were mediocre at best and served with 2 measly slivers of toasted bread; the menu says it is served with sweet potato fries but they were more like over-fried tiny slivers of garnish.  The beignet was too doughy and reminded me too much of Hot Pockets ... actually that's an insult to Hot Pockets, because I think they are crisper than Rex's beignets if you use the aluminum sleeve when you microwave them.  The crawfish pot pie had decent flavors but the pastry should have been flakier.  The fig bruschetta has balanced flavors, but I one of my poached figs was dry and chewy. Lastly, THERE WAS NO HEAT ON A CHILLY NOVEMBER NIGHT BECAUSE IT FELT LIKE IT WAS 50 DEGREES IN THERE!  I guess the servers didn't notice because they weren't really in the dining area at all.  Really, al fresco dining is not my thing at this time of the year and all I could think about was getting the bill so I could leave and get warm again.
