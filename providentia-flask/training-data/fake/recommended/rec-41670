I read all the great reviews and got excited. I hadn't had greek in a while and was looking forward to seafood. I got the seafood platter and it was the worst seafood I've every experienced. I thought maybe it sat too long in the delivery car and got soggy, but I don't see how it's possible. Everything had a film/paste coating that was horrendous. It was basically identical to that poo/inedible brain section of snow crabs. Spot on texture and taste. There was a thin layer inside the calamari, on the outside of the octopus, and the shrimp. The shrimp was actually mushy and had no shrimp texture. How do you grill shrimp and yield those results!? It was like 75% paste, and 25% faint shrimp protein texture. The shrimp looked jumbo size and awesome, but had less edible meat than a mini shrimp. I'm getting sick thinking of it. The only thing saving the texture was burnt spots, but they still had no flavor. I ended up wiping everything down and rinsing it clean before eating, just to get my $30 worth (portion size was still weak for that price). I just don't understand how seafood could be so bad. I was really afraid of getting sick. My guess is that the food was well over a month old. Then it was either boiled or microwaved. Then maybe a half second on the grill to make it look like it was grilled? Seriously, how can you possibly cook shrimp to the creamy texture of hummus? It defies physics. Other than that, the hummus and pita were fine. Average 3 star worthy. We also ordered some fried stuff, but that was maybe 2 star. It was just a soggy mess because they didn't vent the delivery packages and it steamed itself. I really want to try this place in person to see if this was a fluke. But I'm deathly afraid. It wasn't cheap, and to reward them with a second chance would be moronic.
