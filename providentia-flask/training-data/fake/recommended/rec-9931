This place is really good! Went here with friends for a bday dinner and loved most of the food...and yes, as other Yelpers have noted, the sheep's milk dumplings are CRACK, as is the spicy lamb sausage. Like wow. My friend got this entree, and after trying it, I found myself subconsciously forking the lamb from his plate every few minutes. Yum. My food (hangar steak and sausage) came out pretty good as well. Loved the steak (cooked medium), although the sausage was just ok. Appetizers: meatballs in my opinion were too olive-y, but my friends loved them. Pretty nice atmosphere, although it is a bit loud at times. Gave 4 stars since we did have to wait about an hour for a table, and they pretty much burned half of my friend's steak.
