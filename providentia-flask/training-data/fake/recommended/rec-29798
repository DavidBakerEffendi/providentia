It was a friends birthday and he invited a few friends to this place. I know some folks are big on Thai food, but i'm very take it or leave it. Upon doing research for this place I didn't know what to expect. The place looks really cozy from outside and has a nice ambience too it. The Good: I'll start off with the obvious; THE FOOD! The food was really good. For the price it was just as good as any hole in the wall Thai food place, or even a chain like Spice. I'm a big fan of dumplings and had the Chicken and Shrimp dumplings. Dipped in the most awesome mushroom sauce the food was excellent. Secondly, the wait staff was very friendly and prompt. The prices were good comprable to less swanky looking Thai food places, and the food tasted a bit better than well priced chains, such as Spice. The bad: The downpart was that the place fell a little flat to me when it came to the seating. The tables were very small and as a party of 8 it was really hard to fit. Everyone was sitting too close, it almost felt like we were cuddling. The establishment needs to be a bit bigger, or maybe less tables. Otherwise, it's really good Thai place with reasonable prices..
