I have been going to the Blue Ribbon Brasserie for years. It was a favorite late night spot for musicians, waiters, bartenders, artists anyone who had a late night schedule. The bad thing is sometimes there is a long wait for a table but being a New Yorker sometimes you call ahead and get a feel of how long of a wait if you play your cards right and are charming with the person on the other end. Its all a matter of luck with the seating, although it is a bit cramped as the restaurant is small. However once seated and you are with some good friends you can have some good fun here. Like all small places sound carries and it can be loud, if that is a problem this is not the restaurant for you. Patience is a virtue and if you are too finicky you may not enjoy the scene. Some of my favorite eats here are: Grilled Shrimp Remoulade   Grilled Sardines   Fried Oysters   Beef Marrow & Oxtail Marmalade  (Fabulous) Sweetbreads arugula, wild mushrooms and carrot Fried Chicken mashed potatoes and collard greens Chocolate Bruno   Cocktails are yummy too. Great place if you have patience and enjoy the Late Night Manhattan Who's Who Scene. Maximilian F. House Manager Southampton, NY
