Cabana Restaurant on 3rd avenue provided me and my friends with a very enjoyable Friday evening! The place is a little bit on the small side, but it was very comfortable and the decor is warm yet clean, crisp and classic. We were waiting for our friend to arrive and they resisted seating us until she arrived, but we insisted and then they accommodated. Other than that, the service was impeccable. The wait staff was very polished, friendly and professional, checking in at the appropriate intervals to see if everything was alright, refilling our water, etc... We spent almost 4 hours drinking and eating, never feeling pressed or rushed. It was a pleasure to be able to just enjoy ourselves in a leisurely pace. We began with drinks and the Bocadillos appetizer, an assortment of finger foods designed for 4 people. So far so good. My Sangria was delicious and not watered down like so many other places. My friend's Mojito was served in a large glass and was delicious. We then feasted on an avocado salad, which really was more of a mixed salad with avocado but it was delicious and the large portion was shared by all three of us. The entrees were very good too. I recommend the Steak and Shrimp. It came with a side of rice and gandules and tostones. One of my friends had the Churrasco and she thought it was a little salty but I tasted it and thought it was fine, and it was a large serving. We topped it all off with dessert and cafe con leche, which I also recommend. Everything was very tasty. We enjoyed the fact that they actually provided us with clean flatware with each course, as opposed to the tacky custom of many restaurants to leave the dirty, used fork and knife on the table. All in all a hit. I would have given it 5 stars except that I found it to be slightly on the pricier side for the drinks and some of the entrees. Still, really great service and great food at a great, convenient location are definitely worth it.
