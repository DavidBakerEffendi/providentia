Great vibe, love that they feature local produce. However, they should let that local produce speak for itself - not drench it in oil and salt! I had a side of Brussels sprouts, which were ridiculously salty and had that strange chemical taste that appears when sprouts are overcooked. I LOVE Brussels sprouts, but these were so salty I had to send them back (and I rarely send food back in restaurants).   In place of the sprouts I ordered the "roasted" vegetable side. I put the quotes around roasted because it turns out the veggies were grilled - and they, too, were just swimming in salt (and oil). Any flavor the produce had on its own was completely drowned out. I was deeply disappointed in the quality of the dishes I ordered (also had a perfectly passable, but not particularly delicious, soup).  And at such a steep price, really not worth it. My husband enjoyed his food, though - so that's what gets the stars.
