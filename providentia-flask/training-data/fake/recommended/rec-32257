I saw this place on one of those celebrity foodie shows so, as I live nearby, I had to give it a try.  Because it's in Fishtown, I wasn't surprised to find that the place was crawling with hipsters when I walked in; it was matched by the non-conformity radiating from the decor. Hipsters aside, my friend and I were promptly greeted by a friendly waitress who directed us to their drink fridge and subsequently received our orders in an equally timely fashion.   I had high expectations for the food and it did not disappoint.  I got the Cyclops burger which has an egg on it.  It was perfect.  I also crushed a tasty side of fries that I ordered, which was a large serving considering I ordered the smaller of the two offered. One big drawback for me was that they didn't have any soft drinks (so hipster) and we weren't offered water as an option.  That's a big thing for me when I'm eating salty food.   Overall, my objective was to eat a delicious burger, so despite some minor complaints  I was very pleased with the experience.
