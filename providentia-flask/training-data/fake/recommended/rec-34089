For starters, the quality of fare is really decent. Don't think I knocked off stars for that. And the interior is charming. But I really don't understand this business. The owners took it over from previous shop and didn't change a thing (besides the name, which probably lost them a loyal base). The only thing that really changed that I can see is customer service. After 3 visits, it takes 15-20 minutes to get almost anything. One person isn't enough to fully man this location, it's a catch 22 I assume: being prepared for customers costs money. Not being prepared costs customers. If you want to be apologized to- more than once per visit -- cedarhurst is the cafe for you.
