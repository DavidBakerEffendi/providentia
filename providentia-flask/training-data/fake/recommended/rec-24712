Salinas serves up rather non-traditional Spanish fare in a formal dining environment whose main saving grace is the beautiful open-air backyard.  Was my dinner experience an enjoyable one?  Yes.  Would I go back?  Hmmm, probably not.  Here's why: Food: I enjoyed the tapas a lot more than the mains. For tapas, we ordered the jamon serrano, which was nicely drizzled in olive oil and yummy.  The gambas/head on shrimp was also delish and definitely one of my faves; it came with a tasty sauce with enoki mushrooms - kind of a fusion take on a traditional tapas dish - but it worked.  The pimientos/shishito peppers were done well enough.  Nothing offensive.  But the mains weren't as good - we were excited by, and ordered, the pork, which was touted by our lovely waiter as the best dish.  But that was the biggest disappointment.  It was moist enough but the sauce overwhelmed and made the dish rather soggy.  We also ordered the grilled chicken, which was well done.  As for dessert, my friends thoroughly enjoyed the bread pudding with ice-cream.  The couple sitting beside us clearly enjoyed their desserts -- they ordered 4 different desserts and cleaned them out! Ambiance: The restaurant feels like a spa.  And the clientele feels like they came from the UES, or Long Island.  Coupled with the food, which verges between good and too fussy, I don't think I'm going to be visiting Salinas any time soon (NYC has WAY too many superb places that I love).
