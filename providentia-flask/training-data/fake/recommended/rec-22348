During a girls' weekend to NYC, we used yelp to find Penelope, a nice walk from our hotel.  It was a wonderful place to have brunch, very cute and well-priced. Two is the magic number on a weekend morning at Penelope; there were quite a few people waiting with larger parties, but we were seated right away (I felt a twinge of guilt that a party of 5 with some children were only seated around when we were finishing).  Penelope doesn't have many seats, although there is a bar. The brunch prix fixe is a great deal - $15 for a special (think seasonal waffles or fancy Eggs Benedict - e.g. with salmon), plus coffee/tea + juice or a mimosa or bellini.  My dining companion did this to get pumpkin waffles and tea and orange juice; I had the penny egg sandwich with orange juice and we split our dishes so we could both have a sweet and savory experience.  Our waiter was very attentive and we had a leisurely dining experience. My only mild complaint is that orange juice wasn't that sweet; but in December in New York, I should've expected as much.  If I lived in the city, I would be here for brunch often.
