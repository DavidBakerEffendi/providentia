I shoooooooooooould tell you, I shooooooooooould tell you: I REALLY like this place. My gal pals and I went to eat here before seeing Rent. There is a reason that it has 500 plus reviews and is always crowded. First: Make a reservation, just do it. Ok, they are super serious about this reservation thing. If your reservation is at 7:15pm and you arrive at 6:50pm you will not be seated...even when you ask again at 7... or making stomach growling noises with your friends. They will not seat you. BUT BUT BUT you can immedatly be Â seated outside (which for some reason the lady didnt tell us until I inquired again about our seat at 7:05pm) I some times act out when I get hungry. A friend of mine dubbed it "hangry" which means that when I am really hungry, I get upset. This was one of these moments. I knew that they had the $22 all you can eat pasta, so I fasted for part of the day. Get the fixed price meal. You get a salad and three different types of pasta (all you can eat). We had gnocci (which looked like a crab cake but it was SO good), spegetti, and this other cream pasta with bacon. They go around with plates of these things and just pour it on your plate. So I didnt like the hostess, but the waiter was AM-AZING. So funny, gave us wine recommendations, and gave us lots of fresh pepper. So, he is great in my book. And overall the night was a success. We were able to sit outside in nice evening weather, with less noise, and enjoy my friends company before hitting a Broadway show.
