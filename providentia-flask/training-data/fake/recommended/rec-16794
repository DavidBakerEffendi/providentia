Honeygrow is phenomenal! I love this place! From the fresh ingredients and the ability to modify my dishes just the way I like them to the clean and modern decor with open kitchen concept, you can't go wrong. I strongly recommend ordering the egg noodles with the garlic sauce and washing it all down with one of their pre-designated fresh smoothies. The staff is also really friendly and knowledgeable. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone wanting to eat a relatively healthy, delicious and filling meal while in the Center City area.
