This place is one of the hidden gems located in Center City, Philadelphia. The place has a very cool comfortable vibe filled with aroma of great food. We had the duck spring roll special and goat cheese appetizer. Both were delicious. The spring roll had just enough punch in meat and dipping sauce to make this meal one to remember. The filet was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were the best I had in a long time. The mashed potatoes had just enough garlic and butter to make them savory but not too much to wish you have mouthwash after. I had a glass of Pinot noir that complimented the dish perfectly. Finally, the service was above and beyond than most places. I will be back to try more of what Slate has to offer. All in all a five star review.
