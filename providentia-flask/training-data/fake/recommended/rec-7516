Went for drinks and I enjoyed my peach sangria.  My companions enjoyed their cocktails as well. Great outdoor patio space, however none of the tables were cleared outside (dishes were left on them), so we had to clear our own to sit down. The bartender was fine, but not especially helpful.  As other reviewers have mentioned, go for the patio but the service is a major drawback.
