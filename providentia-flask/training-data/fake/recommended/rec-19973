One of our go-to bars for after-work happy hours, Rattle 'n' Hum is great.  Their selection is one of the best in the area, and there are usually open seats and plenty of space for groups.  Their snacks are pretty good also, especially the fries.  They also have beer events pretty often, and while I've never been to one, they sound great.
