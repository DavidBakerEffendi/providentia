Wow, another disappointment in Philly.  Terrible cheesesteak.  Meat has no flavor and semi-hard bread.   And the attitude from the staff... its like you are harassing them by ordering food and handing them your money.  But I suppose that gives it the "local" experience for tourists.   Once again, all hype and as for the reviews of a good cheesesteak, not sure what people have tried to give this place more than two stars.
