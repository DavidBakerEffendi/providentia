This place is simply AMAZING! The food is GREAT! The staff is super friendly and nice. The only qualm I have about this place is that it is always busy and super packed (although that is a good thing). If you don't mind taking the food to go, I recommend phoning in an order and just enjoying the food at home or at the park, unless you are ok with waiting for 45 mins to 1 hour.
