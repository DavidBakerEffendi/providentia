ilili is a high end Mediterranean Restaurant with a classy/chic vibe and delicious middle eastern cuisine. Place: Sophisticated ambiance and the arrangement of the interior space seemed very appealing to me. You enter into what seems to be one large, grandiose space designed to accommodate small to large groups but if you move further along, you will notice that there are sections of the restaurant that are just as chic and cozy and accommodate more private/intimate gatherings. Food/Drinks: Food was excellent! The falafel, Hommus, and Mouhamara were refreshingly delicious. Refreshing because you can expect this to taste nothing like the hommus or falafel you'll find at the regualr restaurant, grocery store, or at a cart! I had the Black Iron Shrimp for the entree which was spiced and decorated with Jalapeno/garlic/cilantro. Just loved it! Drinks/Dessert were also just as good and they complimented the food perfectly. Service: Service was excellent. We were greeted with a friendly, warm welcome and our waiter was patient, attentive, and was kind enough to replace my drink with another one that seemed more appealing. Def a great spot to impress anyone and show off your great taste! :)
