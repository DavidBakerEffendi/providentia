I came here for a weekday lunch.  The restaurant was fairly busy at the time, so I was glad that we had made a reservation.  I ordered the beet salad for my appetizer, and a skate wing special for my entree.  Everything was delicious, and tasted very fresh.  I also have no complaints about the service.  Overall, it seems like a tasty, dependable lunch spot.  I guess it was no surprise that we saw Ross from Friends sitting a few tables down from us!
