This popular neighborhood sushi joint will definitely become a staple in my dining pattern. I do recommend making a reservation as the place fills up quickly especially during prime times. You really can't beat this fresh fish in Brooklyn Heights though. Only small thing is that my dining companion though they put a little bit too much rice in the sushi compared to more traditional sushi restaurants like Hasaki. But for the price, wuality of food and location it is a great value!
