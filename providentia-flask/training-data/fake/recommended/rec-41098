Love it! we just went tonight. We ate El Acapulco tasting of three as entree then we ordered Enchiladas Borrachas, Tumbada and Paella de quinoa as main courses, and finally for desserts we ordered a Pina Colada Tres Leches and a Pastel de chocolate. Simply delicious! Each dish tasted exquisite and full of flavor. Excellent service, good ambiance and amazing food. Highly recommended.
