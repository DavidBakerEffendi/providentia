A good friend dragged me here and I'm so glad I checked it out. The downstairs is colorful, clean and eclectic. We sat at both the bar and in a little spot I'll call "the opium den" under the stairs. Drinks were affordable and yummy. Try the "Mom Bomb!" It's a glass of Mountain Dew that you drop of shot of Jaeger into. It's like a white trash energy drink and we had 4, so you know they're awesome. The upstairs should be in the basement, it's just that vibe. The walls are covered in band flyers, Sharpie graffiti, and a mish mash of crap you'd cover the walls of your room with if you were a punk teenager. The jukebox is one of the best I've seen, packed with classics and the very best hard and fast punk rock anthems. There's some cool old cars from carnival dark rides in the back room, just begging for a make-out session. I can't imagine a trip to Philly that wouldn't include a trip to this bar. Definitely one of my new favorites.
