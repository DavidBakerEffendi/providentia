I'm going to have to be bias because I love tater tots.  That's an automatic +1 right there. I came here with 3 friends and my hubby one Sunday for brunch.  It was POURING out, and I was preggers.  YEP, mommies-to-be loves to eat! Service: 5 It was pouring rain out and the host saw me and my unborn child standing in the rain with an umbrella.  He looked at my husband asked if we drove and where we parked.  We literally parked right in front of the place, so the host asks my husband to bring me back to the car and he will come get us when a table is ready.  +1 for going above and beyond for any customer.  We got a table in about 45 minutes, and the server was friendly.  He gave us some recommendations and checked on us a few times to make sure everything was okay. Food: 5 Remember the +1 for tater tots?  Well, yes, it should of been a +2.  Jimmy's Tater Tots were AH-MAZING!!  I got the Biscuit and Sausage Gravy and it was freaking good.  Everything was just right.  I also got a vanilla milkshake.  You can't go wrong with milkshakes though!  I forgot what my hubby ordered because I was indulging myself in the tater tots.  I think he ordered waffles with fried chicken and gravy.   Ambiance: 5 It is more of a hipster crowd.  The tables are spaced far apart enough so you don't feel like you are crammed into one another.  It was comfortable, and even though it was raining, it didn't have that damp air everyone dreads on the subway. Total: 5+5+5 15 / 3 = 5
