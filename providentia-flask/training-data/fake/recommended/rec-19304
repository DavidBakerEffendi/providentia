My Husband and I went here for our final dinner on our recent visit to Philly. We were having a hard time deciding what and where we wanted to eat. We had passed this place while walking around on our first day in the city. My husband suddenly remembered it and I look it up on yelp. The reviews were all positive and that made our decision easy! We were not disappointed at all. They even had delicious Boboa teas. We ended up getting 5 rolls and two teas. Everything was awesome and when we got out check they had graciously given us a 20% discount. We're not sure why but it was appreciated. Our entire meal was only about $50 which is a steal compared to the $75 we usually spend on sushi back home in Orlando. Everything about Kabuki from the service to the food was excellent. It is a must visit during your stay!! The presentation of our food was even amazing!!
