I don't understand the negative reviews!  This place is fantastic!  Staff is outstanding from the moment we opened the front door - so friendly and genuinely happy we were there.  Four of us for dinner, we tried as much as we could:  hangar steak was amazing, snapper, pork chop YUM.  Duck meatballs are great and the TOFU app amazing!  We started at the bar with Caden: a true gentleman and great mixologist!  Maria was our server, she made  fantastic suggestions, from appetizers to wine, to entrees and described everything to the tee! We had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed everything about this place!  Don't hesitate to go!
