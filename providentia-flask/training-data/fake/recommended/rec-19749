My boyfriend and I decided to try this bar out after reading about it on Yelp and since it wasn't too terribly far away (I live on 9th Ave so the walk wasn't too bad). Our deciding factor was that they have skee-ball and darts. We were in the mood for some drinks and having fun, instead of the usual bar where you just sit around. The bar was not crowded at all on Saturday night around 10 PM, which is refreshing in NYC. We grabbed some drinks and sat down for a bit, and then decided to try our hand at skee-ball. My boyfriend was so determined to beat the high score of 29,000 that he played about 7 times. But he succeeded! The new high score is 43,000...we'll probably be coming back to see if anyone can beat it :) There was a group there playing beer pong, and then they asked if we wanted to join in for flip cup. We played for a round and my team won, of course. We also tried their Disco Tots, which were delicious! Covered in gravy and melted cheese...YUM! Great bar food. We finished the night by playing darts. All in all, we had a great time and it's good to know there is a relaxed, down-to-earth bar near my apartment to go to just to have a good time.
