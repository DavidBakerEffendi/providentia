I do like this place for the hibachi and the sushi.  The sushi tastes very good and it's surprisingly cheap because of how often it's discounted by 50%.  The spicy dragon roll is very good. For the hibachi I had shrimp and scallops with the typical fried rice and vegetables.  It also came with a choice of salad or soup which to me was strange because other hibachis I've been to served both.  I chose the salad and it was pretty decent.  My boyfriend had the soup and he didn't really care for it. The food itself though was excellent.  Our cook was fairly engaging and did a good job but he didn't offer us Sake like the others. The reason I give 3 stars is because I'm very generous when I taste good food and find that the atmosphere is nice.  The truth is, it lost a lot of points on service.  I made reservations at 7:30 and didn't get to our table until at least a half hour after that.  Also, they sat us at a table where cooks have to get tables of ingredients by us and they're constantly asking us to move so they can get by.  The waiter didn't even offer us water until at least 10-20 minutes after sitting down.  And when we asked for water, they apparently ran out of water glasses.  We didn't get out of there until 10:30 at night because the service was just so slow.  And at the end, one of the cooks told us "next time don't sit here.  Worst spot to sit."  Which I thought was pretty annoying seeing as we didn't exactly have a choice on a packed friday night.  Clearly the place was very understaffed. But despite the horrible service, the food was very good and the portion sizes were excellent.  A really great value.
