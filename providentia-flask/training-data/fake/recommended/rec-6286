If you're into burgers, Corner Bistro is the supreme standard among NYC old-school dives.  Bistro Burger, Chili, and Fries is pretty much all they serve, along with a small selection of McSorley's Ales and a few other beers.  I came here in the summer after walking the High Line, and had a great time.   Don't come with a large crew or it'll be hard to get seated - stick to a 2-person party and enjoy one of the best burgers I've ever had (Bistro Burger - comes with bacon, onion and cheese.)  It's messy, big, and flavorful, served only on paper plates.  Additionally, it's super cheap.  The place has been around for almost 100 years, so it's a must-visit for any true New York aspiring foodie.
