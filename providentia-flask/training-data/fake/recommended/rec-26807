Came in town to help a buddy move in, and a big group of us were in the mood for pizza.  So we yelped a place and we came here.  I came in with high expectations because of the yelp reviews, but unfortunately my experience here fell well short of the average rated 4 stars.  We got 2 pies for about 6 people.  Their famous calm pizza and a half pepperoni and half sausage pizza.  Everything looked great when it came out:  the size, shape, and temperature, but what made it so disappointing was the fact the bottom of both pizza's were super burnt!  Them bottom was black and unless that is the style in CT we were all pretty let down about the bitter test of the burnt parts and worried about our health. I hope this issue was a one time thing, and hope your pizzas aren't burnt like ours.  To be honest I do not think I would come back unless a buddy drags me in.  Good luck!
