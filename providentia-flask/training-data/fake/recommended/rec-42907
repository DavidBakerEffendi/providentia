I don't see how this place has so many good reviews. I went here for lunch and the staff was all sitting around watching TV. Luckily the one waitress who actually was working was a sweetheart and great. But the food was boring and lackluster. I ordered a side salad, which seemed like bagged mix lettuce. The dressing, Russian, was served in the kitchen's large tupperwear squeeze bottle. My pasta shells in "marinara" (more like canned tomatoes, heated up and tossed with a little basil) was something your 10 year old can make at home. It was basically just boxed shells, boiled and drained, thrown on a plate with some canned runny sauce. The bread was heated, but stale. The butter was so cold I couldn't cut it with a knife. My iced tea was delicious. The place looks like a hole in the wall you'd find in a very small town where there's no other options. And that is key - with so many options in South Orange, why would anyone want to go here? Maybe I should have tried the pizza.
