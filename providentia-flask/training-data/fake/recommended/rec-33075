Places like these make me wonder what I was doing for so long not going to Queens for food. Our waitress was great. She knew that we weren't Himalayan (it's pretty obvious) so she cautioned us about what's spicy. I started with the Nepali chai. I haven't had chai so good since I was in India. In fact, my memory has been so saturated with inferior chai that I had forgotten what good chai tastes like. For an appetizer I had goat Bhutan, which was goat intestine stuffed with heart I think. It was surprisingly crispy and not at all intestine-tasting. It was served with rice flakes, which I never had before but were also really nice. For an entree I had roti like I've never tasted before. This is not the West Indian stuff. The roti here was spongy and great with the sauce of the chicken that came with it. My son had some yak dish which he really liked. The meat was lean, it reminded me most of Mongolian beef but was still really different from that. For desert was green tea ice cream covered in rice flour. It was like dumplings stuffed with ice cream. Really great!
