Are you looking for the best Indian or Nepalese food you've ever had?  Too bad--you're not going to find it in Burlington so you might as well give up now. Are you looking for the best Indian or Nepalese food you can find in Burlington? Good--you've found it! Sherpa Kitchen's food is good--I'm an Indian food expert (I have awards from the governing body that regulates expertise in Indian food that I just made up 5 minutes ago and will disband after writing this review) and I can tell you that the food here is solid.  It's like an Asian twist on Indian classics.  Highly recommend the Saag Paneer and Aalu Gobi--they're delicious. Owners are super nice and attentive. I've had great success there.
