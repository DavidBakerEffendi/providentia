Came here a couple weeks ago and as always The Tiger's Tale failed to disappoint. I've been here many times and consider it to be on of my favorite restaurants and bars in the area. This time I tried a new sandwich called the Tiger's Tale Chicken Sandwich. It was excellent. Chicken was moist and topped with sauteed onions and jack cheese. Both of which I love. Served on french bread which was a little different then most sandwiches which come on a kaiser roll, but I actually liked this bread better. Some of my other favorites are the burgers and the fish tacos. The burgers are cooked on the grill in the bar by the bartenders. Adds come character to the bar and always enjoy they preparing food on the grill. Also suggest looking at the specials menu. Everyday they have a different menu with about 20-25 specials selections. I never have a problem finding one or two things on there that sound great. My one warning when it comes to the food is to be careful with the popcorn. It's free and very addictive. The bar is very big, but almost always packed. They offer about 15 beers on tap and although they have the standard light beers they also have some good beers that are hard to find elsewhere. Servers and bartenders are always very helpful and friendly. It's really not hard to see why it is packed every night of the week.
