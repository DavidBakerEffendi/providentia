The sushi was pretty good, and I enjoyed the seaweed salad and miso soup, but it killed me that there was so much packaging and trash! My husband and I were dining in the patio area and the server was bringing everything to us singularly on individual paper trays (when one plate would've sufficed). It was great to see all of the utensils, napkins, cups, trays, containers mostly made from recyclable materials, but we couldn't recycle when we were done -- it all went in the trash. For a fresh, healthy dining experience, you would also hope they would run the place in a fresh and healthy fashion.
