I like many have passed this place by several times.  I remember what a dump the previous diner(s) were.  We decided to take a chance when we saw the name change, and I am so glad that we did.  I love hispanic food and this was some of the best.  The pernil was amazing, and my 7 year old devoured the homemade plantain chips served with every meal.  I am not fond of the plantain, but the chips with the homemade salsa was incredible.  This is now one of my favorite food spots.
