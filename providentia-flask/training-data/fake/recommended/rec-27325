WORST SEATING SYSTEM EVER!   So frustrating because I like the food but not worth dealing with the inconsistencies of the seating policy.  Keep in mind, this is a very small restaurant.  It has roughly 25 seats give or take. Walk-ins is like playing russian roulette.   You truly don't know what to expect.  It could be all full due to reservations or 15 minute wait.  Or there's a whole section of tables "reserved" that end up being seated by walk-ins or never seated at all.  Yes, I'm paying attention I work in the industry and watching every detail. Making a reservation is like playing russian roulette.  You might get a seat but the waitstaff will sit you right by the door (uncomfortable cold draft) and you observe a walk-in get a seat farther in where it's warmer.   In conclusion, trying to eat here is playing russian roulette.  Pulling the trigger and not getting your brains blown out is getting a table with none of this B-S. A review of the food doesn't warrant just because getting a seat is such a hassle.
