Went for brunch. Beautiful interior. Tasty Bloody Mary. But my food was meh. We started with the sticky bun, which was tasty, and the lemon ricotta pancakes were good, but I ordered the tripe and was really unimpressed. The tripe had zero flavor, so all you really got was texture and the taste of egg. Also, and I KNOW that you're not supposed to do this, but I don't like poached eggs, so I asked for mine over hard. The waitress told me that the chef was "very sensitive" about how he cooked his eggs. The best he could do was over easy, which was ok, but not great.
