The food was good and my daughter enjoyed her pizza however I will not go back because our waiter - Luis. He was unprofessional and was rarely around to take our request - except of course when it came time to tip him. My husband and I had no choice but to ask the other waiter next to our table and he was even rude for asking us where and who is our waiter?! Ummm you tell me buddy!? If I knew where he was. Wouldn't be asking you now would i?! Â Because of how unbelievably rude they were... My family and I will not be returning. Sorryyyyyy get a better staff!
