If you've ever been here, then you know that feeling when you crave their french fries so much you're willing to make a trip just to get an order. Usually I'm not the kind of person who revisits a small place like this, especially since they don't really have a large menu or space, but the dipping sauce makes it all worth it. Their mango dip goes so perfectly with their french fries in my opinion, but the other options are just as delicious. Great stop in the summer.
