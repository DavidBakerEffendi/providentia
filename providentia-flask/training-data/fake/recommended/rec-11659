My husband & I had dinner at Northern Spy recently; every mouthful was mouthwatering. I ate an amazing steak & my husband had fish, then we shared the baked alaska for dessert. The restaurant is definitely packed tightly with diners, but this is easily overlooked when you consider the beautiful food.
