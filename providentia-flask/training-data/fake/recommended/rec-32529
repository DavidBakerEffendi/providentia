The pizza was tasty but I found the menu to be kind of boring. Almost every pie has the same ingredients - fior di latte, olive oil, arugula, Italian tomatoes, etc. While it tasted good, and I don't want to discourage people from trying it out for themselves, I felt that it didn't really match up to the hype. I think I prefer Motorino's more eclectic pies. Â Add some variety, maybe some different kinds of veggies, and I'll be happy to give it another shot.
