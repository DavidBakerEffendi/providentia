Went here for dinner last night and waited over an hour and a half for a table! While the drinks were nice, and the decor was great, I was really underwhelmed by the whole experience. I have to say it was way too crowded for my taste, as we waited forever and were finally seated at a table adjoined to another table--sharing a romantic dinner is hard when you have 3 complete strangers (men) seated at the same table!          The artichoke dip and the mixed greens salad was fantastic, but everything else was pretty bland, including the cheddar grits and suckling pig.       My first cocktail was delish, with a dash of black velvet whiskey, but my second cocktail was straight up gin. Overall I loved the atmosphere and thought it had a romantic tone, but waiting forever to get a table, and then being seated practically on top of other people was not what I had in mind when I said "intimate".
