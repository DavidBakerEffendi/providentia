This is always my first stop after checking into the hotel - oysters and martini's at midnight!  We were told this is where the chefs of NYC come to eat when they finish their shifts and I can see why!   I recommend the Beef Marrow & Oxtail Marmalade on toast as it is AMAZING and if they aren't sold out, you can have some divine caviar here a well. And did I mention  the martini's and the fantastic bar staff who always remember our names even though we do not live in NY?
