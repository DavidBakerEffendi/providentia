Hoagie Haven is a Princeton institution.  Whenever I wear my orange and black Haven teeshirt smiling people come up and start nostaglic converstations.  In California. THIS is where cheesesteaks come from.  (Everyone seems to think they have something to do with Philladelphia.  Uh, people?  In Philladelphia, they but CHEEZ WHIZ on their cheesesteaks.  Cheez Whiz is a bad joke.  It is not cheese.  I mean ok, do whatever you want but yuck!) As far as I'm concerned, Hoagie Haven's pizza cheesesteak is the  Reference Cheesesteak, against which all others are measured. Extra hot peppers please!
