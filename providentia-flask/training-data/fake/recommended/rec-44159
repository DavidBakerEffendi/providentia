Thank heavens for small mercies that this place doesn't exist in Montreal, because if that were the case, I'd be here every other day and no doubt look like a beached whale by now. The fries here are to die for, perfectly crispy on the outside and smooth and soft on the inside, the list of dipping sauces makes the selection even harder, everything here sounds so damn good, which means the only option you have is to come here multiple times so you can try out all the sauces eventually. Grab a large serving, get 5 or 6 dipping sauces, get a bottle of iced tea or a beer, head over to Tompkins Square park, chill out on a bench with your fries and sauces, enjoy your drink and watch life go by easily with one of the simplest and satisfying pleasures New York can give you.
