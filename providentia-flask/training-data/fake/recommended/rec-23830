A couple of blocks from our house, my fiance and I almost always end up at Birra when we want a quick bite in our neighborhood.  The food is good, if a bit inconsistent and over priced.  We do love the spreads and breads appetizer and the mussels.  And even though there is no shortage of good beer in this neighborhood, it is always nice to find another good list!
