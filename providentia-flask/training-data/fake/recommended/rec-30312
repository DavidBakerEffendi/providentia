Came in around 8:00 am on a Tuesday morning. There were only 2 other tables. Our group of 6 got to try a lot of things from eggs and sausage, omelets, waffles to sandwiches. The eggs, omelets and waffles are decent but they are something that you would expect a 4-star place serving breakfasts to have. The sandwiches however, are definitely the highlight and worth coming back for. Prices again are high since we are in NYC but acceptable. Total check for our table of 6 came out to $120. Go there early. You'll avoid all the wait.
