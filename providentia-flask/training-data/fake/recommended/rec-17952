The previous reviewer was spot on. Amazing Rodizio! Thanks for earlier review. I ordered it and was not disappointed. There were 9 at my table eating various items and I didn't hear one complaint. Quantity was amazing from the first piece of bacon wrapped filet mignon to the skewered rotisserie pineapple served with flaming port wine, I was not disappointed. Side dishes were too plentiful to mention. Everything, including dessert was great. Highly recommended!
