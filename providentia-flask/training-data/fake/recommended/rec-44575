Oh, Cafe Orlin. Thank you for being in the East Village on the way to home from work. You are always there and your food is always good. This is a kind of place you can count on for a pleasant, casual dining experience. The atmosphere is casual and the servers behave Â accordingly. Crisp and prompt. Just don't expect to be coddled.
