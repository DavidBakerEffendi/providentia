I'm in love with this place! Me and my wife were in culinary heaven from the get go on our very first visit to this curious place last Friday night. We ordered Chef's special sashimi, miso, fried asparagus coated in pine nuts and corn flour (this was the best!), langostine (one big prawn), minced chicken gyoza wrapped in bean curd, and finished off with ice cream. EVERYTHING was delicious, and you could tell the chef put lots of love and skill in to every dish. Even the Miso (normally the laziest most boring dish in even ultra high end japanese restaurants) was absolutely stunning, a thick hearty broth (hints of hickory smoke and molasses) with bonus chunks of brussels sprouts and okra Â - clearly their own recipe. Their attention to detail here is AMAZING. The 12 year whiskey on the rocks was a super good compliment to the meal and a very generous price point for the amount they give you. Even their condiments are awesome, they use the rarer to find but much much superior togarashi (flaked chili pepper with extra goodies like hemp seeds). Their sea salt is soooooo soo good, I think it is imported from some famous river or something in Japan, there was a shpeel along those lines about the salt in one of their dishes, so I'm assuming this is the case with all of their shimmering mounds of sea salt, call me crazy but it is the best salt I've ever tasted, me and my wife were joking that we should wrap some up in a napkin to take home. Their wasabi was the nice freshly grated hand made kind! Their Sashimi ROCKED, fresh abalone, uni, tuna were some of the highlights. Staff was friendly and attentive. Truly can't wait to return to this place. Has entered in to my top 5 NYC restaurants list for sure!
