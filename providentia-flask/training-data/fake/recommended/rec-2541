There are two types of sushi places in my mind: places where you go to get the basics (spicy tuna, yellow tail) and places you go to get designer sushi rolls. Now I'll eat most kinds of sushi, but I find that rarely do places pull of both of these well. Uzu is in the latter category, and while their basic sushi isn't that bad (actually its pretty decent), its really all about the special rolls. I mean why bother getting a spicy tuna roll when you get get the "Fireman Special", a spicy tuna roll with crunchy (ah mysterious "crunchy," how I love you!) inside and more spicy tuna outside! Or maybe you're in the mood for something with some kick? Try the "Mexican," a grilled chicken, avocado, and jalapeno roll. Presentation is top notch, and the sushi itself is always delicious. There are a few downsides, hence the 4-stars. The place is small, so it can be tough to get a spot (although I think they are branching out onto the sidewalk). The service can be real hit or miss. For a place that seats about 15 people, you'd think they would be pretty fast, but two things seem to always get in the way: one is the large amount of takeout orders (which I guess could be viewed as a good sign), and the other is it seems like the sushi chefs are just slow. But like I said, its hit or miss - I've had many a good experience, and a couple really bad ones. Just bring some sake with you and you won't notice whether it takes 15 minutes or 55 minutes. One other thing: I'm a gyoza nut, and their gyoza is just fair. The wantons aren't cooked well, they sometimes have a more rubbery texture. Overall, Uzu is a good, small BYO sushi stop that is tasty and creative, without being pricy or pretentious (I'm looking at YOU, Raw). Highly recommended for small groups who love interesting sushi.
