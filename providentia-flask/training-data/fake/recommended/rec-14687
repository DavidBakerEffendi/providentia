Get the tasting menu.   Make nice with the waiter.  Wait for David Bouley to come out of the kitchen! I got a tour of the kitchen! It was an amazing experience. Unfortunately, the bill was not such an amazing experience, but I felt it was worth it after getting the tasting menu and a bunch of freebies from Mr. Bouley!
