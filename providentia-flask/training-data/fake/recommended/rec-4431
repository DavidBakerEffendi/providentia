Ninis is a understated little restaurant in the 9 square section of New Haven.  Easy to walk by and not notice.  But you should definitely stop in for dinner.  There are about a dozen tables.  We went on a Saturday in June at 7 and it was only half full but that's probably because schools are out.  Really good value.  Three of us went and ordered from the prix fix menu.  Every serving was delicious and came out at a nice pace.  Wines were very good.  Butter nut squash bisque was nice and thick.  The paella was large enough for 2.  Waitress was sufficiently attentive.  I would come back for more.
