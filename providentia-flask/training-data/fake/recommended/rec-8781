Best spot in Ne York City or maybe even the whole planet to turn up at midnight or later for fine seafood dining. Despite the vulgarity blasting from a nearby table of Nassau County jocks, staff were attentive and the quality of the food and wine was excellent! Enjoyed a superb bottle of 2000 ch√¢teau La Lagune (Haut Medoc), big succulent shrimps with no mayo cocktail sauce, perfectly cooked NY strip steak and seared scallops. Attentive refills on fresh bread. Impromptu cheese plate to nibble while finishing every drop of the wine followed by decadent homemade chocolate dessert topped with a candle for my partner on his birthday. We spent close to 3 hrs including short wait to be seated. Highly recommended!
