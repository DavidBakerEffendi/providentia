The Smith was absolutely everything I could've hoped for on a gorgeous Saturday in NYC.  Headed there w/ the bff and surprise, surprise, ordered the same thing :)  We got avocado sandwiches, but I had them add grilled chicken breast which definitely ended up being a good decision.  The sandwich comes on a fantastic multigrain bread that is toasted to a perfect crisp with a drizzle of balsamic on the outside that makes it better than you can imagine.  The creamy avocado, chicken, and sprouts just mesh so well together.  And the fries were crisp and  light.  It was definitely loud and crowded, especially during Saturday brunch, but that sandwich is worth the trip!
