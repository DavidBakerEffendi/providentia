Strolled in for some takeout last night, and it was absolutely fantastic. This restaurant has been in Montclair, NJ for a long time, but despite living here for nearly all my life, I had only stopped in once or twice. I was astounded at how good the food is, and I'm rather disappointed in myself for not going here more often. Since it had been a while, I wanted to get a taste of everything, so I got the appetizer sampler--vegetarian dumplings, spring rolls, chicken kebabs with peanut sauce and mixed vegetables. Complementing this was an order of noodles, culminating in a terrific Â meal that I continued to eat well past being full. After splitting all this food with my father, and despite being stuffed, I dove into the dessert that we each got an order of--fried ice cream with strawberry sauce. It capped off a fun time, and I'm pleased to now realize that Tuptim is one of the top eateries you can find in Montclair, among many other great restaurants.
