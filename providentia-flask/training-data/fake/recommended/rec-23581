If the beer wasn't so delicious I would probably give 3 stars.  But the menu was creative, inventive and had tons of options.  Ok so I guess 4-stars is right on after all.  The decor/vibe is what holds it back, I feel like the building they chose to locate in feels like a 1987 brick office space. That said (and we were only there for beers and dinner), we had a really good meal (burgers all around), awesome beers and its rather inexpensive to boot.  Though if you live in Burlington you may think differently, my perception is warped from living in DC.
