Thank you, Thank You, THANK YOU Yelp! for telling me about this place! I owe you one. Next time drinks are on me! I had, hands down, the best omelette of my life at Sabrina's! Actually, as I'm typing this, I'm seriously contemplating planning another weekend trip up to Philadelphia just to eat breakfast here again. It was that good! Not only will you want to eat every single thing on your plate, you'll want to eat everyone's order around you because everything looks so damn good! No really, just look at the pictures that everyone's posted. Pumpkin pancakes with white chocolate chips! Huevos Rancheros! Oh man and just look at the french toast! But beware, their portions are massive and as much as you want to eat everything in your line of site, it' s just too much. IT'S TOO MUCH! Thanks again, Sabrina's! I hope to see you again very soon!
