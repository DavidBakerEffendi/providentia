Beer aficionados will adore this place. Skip the food, as it's subpar, but go straight for the drink menu. The beer selection is incredible, and Â available on the chalkboard wall as well via the nicely printed menu that features ratebeer.com ratings, country of origin, and abv. Bring a group or just a friend, and Rattle 'N' Hum will potentially accommodate. It's particularly busy with the after work crowd, but you'll be lucky to snag a picnic style table for a few hours. Get lost for hours in the fantastic beer posters plastered all over the walls from various breweries.
