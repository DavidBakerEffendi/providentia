We tried this place after reading such great YELP reviews. Let me say, the cheesesteak is HUGE, so you WILL be full after finishing even the half sandwich. Got our with onions and cheese. Pretty good/average in my opinion. I thought it lacked any real seasoning. Also, there wasn't much of a line, but it took quite while to get our order. Staff was friendly anough and the not-so-great neighborhood that everyone seems concerned about wasn't an issue. Headed to Geno's after trying this place and , I must say....Geno's was MUCH tastier! Less meat and less filling, but seasonsed and tasty nonetheless.
