Recently refurbished to provide more space this Bloomfield Ave. stalwart has not lost it's gourmet touch. The menu selections are flexible so you can essentially order anything from anywhere and this is good because there are excellent selections from the vegan menu. Try the coquettes with spring pea sauce and then a 1/2 order of the homemade pasta. The Bronzino was melt in the mouth and on top of a flavorful quinoa. The scallops were plentiful (3 large) on top of a risotto. Â Leave room for the homemade desserts and try the specials of the day. Service was knowledgeable though a little inattentive. Not that pricey for the quality and quantity plus it's BYO!
