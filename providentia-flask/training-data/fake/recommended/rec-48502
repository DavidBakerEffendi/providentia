I don't know what to say, I can't believe that the below reviewers were at the right place?!   As another reviewer did, we chose because of pet friendly.  Um to be fair, we don't just have "a pet."  I sat down at the patio with two Great Danes.  Nobody batted an eye.  They brought ice cold water for us AND the dogs.  We ordered beer from the (extensive) draft beer menu and it arrived immediately and was ice cold.   We ordered hamburgers.  We had eaten here before and had the soup and several other items and loved them, but I had a hankering.  While we waited for our hamburgers, we sipped cold beer and ate warm cheesy biscuits while people watching in The square.  It was lovely.   Our food came in a timely manner, served by a delightful girl who acted like she serves ALL hamburgers by reaching over 275 lbs of panting dog.  They were cooked to perfection, excellent quality meat, fresh buns that were delicious, crisp fresh produce and THE FRIES.  OH MY GOODNESS THE FRIES.  They were hot and crispy and wonderful.   Everything was well priced, the waitress kept all waters full, brought drinks in a timely fashion and genuinely cared about our enjoyment of the meal.   We will go back.   A lot.
