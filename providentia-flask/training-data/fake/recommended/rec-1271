Visiting my brother out near Philly, so he, my dad and I decided to stop by and try it. The ordering pace is pretty fast so know what you want and have you CASH ready. I got a cheesesteak "wit", meaning with onions. The bread was good and chewy, how I like. That's perhaps a personal preference. The meat was good and salty. Cheese wiz is tasty and I'll put onions on darn near anything. I thought the sandwich was delicious, but I don't have a picky pallet. The service was hurried, but I guess that's part of the charm is it's supposed to be a sandwich shop you can grab and go. I think people may mistake that for rude. The seating is all outside. Price was about 12 bucks for sandwich, fries and drink. Which is steep, but not unusual for a typical tourist eatery.
