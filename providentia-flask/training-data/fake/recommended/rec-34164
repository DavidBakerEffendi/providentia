I wrote a glowing review a year ago however, some of the sparkle seems to be gone. I kept getting the impression that this restaurant didn't want to cater to the new, "young professional" crowd that lives along Center Boulevard, which is a shame because those people have a lot of money to spend and could stop by as they're getting off the subway in the evening. Â The people who do go to Open Door appear to be all part of the same small crowd from town - odd, because this place has a great selection of (expensive) craft beers, fantastic cocktails and great food. It should be a magnet for young professionals in the area. I still believe Open Door is a great little bar and hope it can perk back up!
