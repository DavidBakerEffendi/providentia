Nan Zhou is as good as some of the best hand-drawn noodle joints in NYC (no mean achievement).  Our favorites were the meatballs and the sesame noodles.  I did not enjoy the beef dishes, but my three worthy co-eaters gave them all a thumbs-up.  I found the staff friendly, attentive, and kind.  In a city that thinks Steven Starr fare is the height of fine cuisine, a real restaurant like Nan Zhou is a precious find.  Not a surprise that multiple Yelpers actually *dream* about the food made here.  Nan Zhou, you've pierced the veil of the unconsious.  Do you realize what that means?
