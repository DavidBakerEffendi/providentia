The corn, fantastic.  Burritos?  Amazing.  Cheap Six Point!  Mind the crowds.... For an outdoor venue, this place is the best you'll get in the neighborhood.  Lots of outdoor seating, constantly filled, mind you.  The weekends at this location are PACKED. The roasted corn on the cob is just unreal.  The spices, lime, and a dusting of fresh cheese all blend together.  Personally I add a little Cholula, which they always have on hand!  I don't even mind that I get covered in it.  It's good enough that I don't care.  I'd roll around in that combination of flavors.  =D So show up early, camp out a table with friends, and enjoy quality food and astonishingly cheap good beer!
