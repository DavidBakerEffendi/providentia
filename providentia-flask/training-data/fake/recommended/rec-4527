This is a solid Indian buffet, for lunchtime, one of the better places in the city.  They often have good variety and different dishes, but always have some of the key favorites, like Chicken Tikka Masala and some kind of Saag.  Great samosas and naan, and their curries are often also excellent.  Great waitstaff and a pleasant atmosphere. Have had take out for dinner too and it is also very good, perhaps even better than the buffet, as it is clearly made fresh.  All in all not sure if it matches Thali at its best, but far cheaper and pretty solid.  I go often, maybe a couple times a month for lunch, and would highly recommend it.
