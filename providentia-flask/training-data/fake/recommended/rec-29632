After going to Italy, the only Italian food that really satisified me was my own italian cooking.... which means that I couldn't find anywhere near my house that has great italian service and food. New York's Little Italy changed all that. I loved how this restaurant used simple Italian terms like Grazi or Prego or senorita and etc. It made me smile and remind me of Italy. The food felt true italian. The servers were extremely friendly and made me feel special. I loved that. The espresso wasn't as great as Italy's but it was close to it. I'm sad that a great Italian restaurant like this isn't near my home, but I'm glad something like it exists in the States.
