Mehh... Solid Thai, but I've had better.  Service is standard, nothing to rave about, no one was overly friendly, but they weren't rude either.  Decor is boring and the seats are uncomfortable (short stools with no back that are better suited in a kindergarten art class than a restaurant). Overall, the experience was average and the food was good, but there's much better Thai elsewhere
