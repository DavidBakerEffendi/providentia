After hearing about this place on the food channel network, this place definitely falls short. For starters the customer service was terrible. The, lady was VERY racist. She pretty much just through my food at me. Now onto the horrible food. This was the absolute WORST cheese steak I have ever had.  The bread tasted like plastic. The chesse was even worse. Got very rubbery. The steak didn't even taste like steak. I live in DC, and the carryouts are 10 times better. There was no taste to the cheesesteak whatsoever. The onions definitely were not cooked. Tasted like they just cut them up and through them on your sandwich. Picture they have up is very deceiving. For $8.50, please don't waste your money.  I will NEVER, EVER go back.
