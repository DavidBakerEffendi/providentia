This place is awesome! I always get the sunset hotpot. The sausage, and potatoes are really good. The corn not so much! The seafood is always fresh, and delicious! My only complaint is they should give you bread, or peanuts, or something to munch on while you are waiting for your food! It is a bit pricey though, but its seafood
