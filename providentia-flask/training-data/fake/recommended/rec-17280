My absolute favorite breakfast place in New Jersey. Every pancake I've ever tried has been excellent. Their 49er Flapjacks are my go-to pancakes - three thin, buttery, soft pancakes layered on top of one another that are perfect every time. Their apple pancake is also outstanding - an eggy, fluffy, baked monstrosity that's covered with sliced apples and a sticky butter/cinnamon glaze. Their thick-cut bacon is the best I've ever had and I've been tempted many times to order just bacon for my meal. The OJ is fresh-squeezed, which most restaurants don't do. The restaurant is super busy on weekends and holidays (you will definitely have to wait for a table) but the table service is always good. It's also an excellent place to bring kids - there are toys in the waiting area. The entrance has a wheelchair-accessible ramp. Yes, your table or chair may be a little sticky, but these are the best pancakes you'll find in the area and you won't care about getting a little messy after dining here.
