It was very good. I didn't come home raving about it, but I'd give it a second shot without hesitation. The Malbec we ordered was fantastic. Wine is served either by the glass or 1.5L which made sharing among 4 people tricky. We had to order two 1.5L which absolutely makes them money. I ordered the duck confit which was superb, and the others ordered the steak, the braised lamb, and the veal chop special (all of which had exactly the same sides). The veal came out looking and tasting like pork. When the waitress set it down on the table she even said pork and then corrected herself. I have never seen veal so tough and thick and white on the inside. About halfway through the chop, my boyfriend asked the waitress if it was really veal, and after scoffing at us then inquiring with the chef, she came back to say that apparently grass-fed veal has a tougher texture. I'm still skeptical. Kind of funny to think about taking care to grass-feed an animal and then kill it when it's young. Somewhat of an oxymoron, I'd say. But he very much enjoyed the chop. The scallop appetizer was great but only came with two scallops. The butternut squash soup was a huge bowl, but was over peppered and watery. Overall, I'm leaning more towards 3.5 stars, but the quality of the ingredients was high and I will come back to give it another try.
