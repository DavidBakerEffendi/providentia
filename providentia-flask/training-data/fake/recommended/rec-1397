I came here for dinner with a group of 10 girls for a bachelorette party and we really enjoyed it! Finding a good BYOB for a larger group can be hard and we were super happy with this one. They had the tables all set up and ready to go when we arrived and were quick to recommend what drink mixes we might like. We went with the mango mojito/rum combo and the spicy tamarind margarita/tequila and both were really good. The spicy one was just spicy enough to have a kick, but still be refreshing.The food was delicious, but more than I could eat. However, they only give you three arepas, but twice as much meat/beans to stuff it with. None of us were able to finish our meal and it would have been a better move to split the meal for two and request an extra 3 arepas. The restaurant closed at 11 and we were one of the last tables in there and the staff was super friendly even though we were getting noisy at times. The waitress was efficient and was chatting with me about the upcoming wedding. The owner came in at the end and introduced herself. It's in a great location, close to the bars on South Street, as well as walkable from Old City where we were headed out. The price was pretty good (maybe a couple of dollars more than ideal) and I would definitely go back.
