The Halal Guys are the ones who opened me up to chicken and rice.  I was introduced to them because my friends are fanatics and would drive from Queens in the middle of the night to fulfill their craving.  Whenever I was in the city I would stop by on the way home from a night of drinking.  I think they're food is good but not worth the drive.  If you're in Queens try Halal guy in front of the Pizza Hut on Little Neck Parkway and Hillside Avenue.  I think their food is banging.
