If this review was for margaritas only, it would be 5 stars. I've been here for both lunch and dinner, only complaint about taste is the hanger steak quesadilla. Very tough steak, minimal flavor. Tuna tacos are wonderful, the spicy burger is great! I can't understand why they only offer the giant table side guac though, and for $15 (WHAT?). Does not make sense to not offer a smaller portion, especially if you have not brought an army who happens to love guacamole. Also I wish you could order different tacos in the trio instead of just 3 of one flavor, but that's just me being nitpicky. Overall this is my favorite spot for afternoon margaritas and I am overall pleased with the food, however I would rather come for lunch than dinner as it gets incredibly noisy.
