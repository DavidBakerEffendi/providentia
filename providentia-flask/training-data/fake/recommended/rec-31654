St. Marks in Midtown. I can't really describe it any other way. Cheap Japanese food in a basement near Times Square. Went on a weeknight around 6:30 and there was like no wait-- maybe 10 min. Ordered a bunch of small dishes, most are pictured below. The cod roe pasta reminded me of Oh Taishos salmon roe pasta but oh Taisho still beats it. Still tasty though. The fried squid legs came with a ponzu sauce instead of Japanese mayo which I didn't prefer. Also were a tad too greasy. The lychee calico drink was tasty but just a tad too sweet. The uni clams were ok-- the hot clam made the uni eh. I think it would've been better with raw clams. Nice try though. The highlight was the seared mackerel-- get this. So much for the price and great mackerel. Yum. Watch out there's no cell phone service down there. Maybe one bar. Considering there aren't many options in the area for Japanese street food, it's a good spot to eat. If you're not in the area and simply looking for something close, you may as well go to East Village though.
