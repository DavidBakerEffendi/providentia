A cute little Japanese fast food joint built right next door to Feng, the mother ship.  It was within easy walking distance of my office, and I was in a teriyaki mood, so how could I say no?  It's a small place, but seating seems reasonable since most people get their food to go.  Anyone expecting Ginza-style decor might be disappointed; the place looks like any other take-out joint except with fancier signage. I went in at 11:45, thinking to beat the lunch rush, and I was in luck: I went right to the register and had my meal in hand a few minutes later, ready to eat.  I ordered the basic chicken teriyaki, which comes with rice and steamed vegetables.  I added my own dollop of beloved Sriracha sauce, and dug in.  Sure enough, the place began filling up just as I sat down; a nice mix of working-class people scoring teriyaki while the more white-collar types loaded up on sushi.  Ginza seems to be successfully fishing from two ponds at once, and I salute their savvy. The food is quite good, especially for the price.  You get a nice helping of teriyaki for six bucks, and it's warm and flavorful.  Pickier (or hungrier) diners can get white meat only or extra chicken for a few more dollars.  Shrimp, tofu, and even eel are on offer if you want something more exotic.  I haven't tried any of the sushi, but it was selling like crazy, so take that as you will.  This isn't food that will change your life, of course, but it's definitely on the high end of lunch spots in the area.  Oddly enough, this place is cheaper than the teriyaki food cart down the street at State House Square, despite the brand name and location. Solid food, fair prices, fast and friendly service, and a clean joint - can't really go wrong.  I'll be coming back on those rare occasions when my cheapness doesn't cause me to bring my own lunch.
