I went for brunch with two friends. All of us were not in the mood for over-the-top sweet dishes; they ordered the guilt-free omelette and I had the roasted asparagus crepe. Our server was nice but inconsistent. She didn't know what veggies were in the omelette and even when she came with the answer, those were not the veggies that ended up on my friend's plates. The roasted asparagus crepe is mis-represented as it is mostly creamed spinach and cheese and had maybe 4 pieces of asparagus. It is even labeled as the spinach crepe on the receipt! It was tasty, but it just didn't have any asparagus and the asparagus that it did have was mushy, like it was canned. The waffle fries that came as a side were yummy. Overall, the food was just okay and the service needs work. We had to keep flagging down people when we wanted to order, when we wanted our check, when I neeeded a spoon, yet at the same time the bus boy was way too intrusive and stopped by too frequently. I will give it another try when they iron out their service and to try some of the sweets.
