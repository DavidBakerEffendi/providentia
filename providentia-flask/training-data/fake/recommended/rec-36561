Cheese, wine and coziness -- count me in! We started with the cheesemonger's five cheese plate which was nicely paired with various condiments including fig jam, honey and something spicy.  The cheeses all worked really well together and paired nicely with our wine selection.   For dinner we shared a few plates -- pork ribs: moroccan spiced and citrus roasted, chicken: goat cheese polenta, red wine fig compote and gnocchi: ricotta, apple, prosciutto, herb cream.  All three dishes were fantastic but I def had a hard time picking which was my favorite between the chicken or ricotta.   The atmosphere was dark, cozy and lively. Even at 8 on a Wednesday, it was packed but didn't take us very long to get seated.  The perfect amount of time to have a glass of wine at the bar! It was a bit loud and the tables are close together but not so terrible you had a bad dinning experience.   Overall, I would def go back and have already recommended to friends.
