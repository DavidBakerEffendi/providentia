Cheap and yummy-- these traits are a must for Chinatown eateries. I came to the Noodle House on a very cold, very rainy night. I was so happy to see my friend already at a table with a pot of complimentary green tea. I had the soup with meat balls (I am pretty sure they were just generically called meat balls, but they could've been called pork balls). I was mostly pleased, although I thought the meat was a little too fatty. I'm also sensitive to that fatty taste, so it could just be me. My friend had the fish balls and thought they were pretty good. My boyfriend had the brisket, which everyone agreed was the best. The broth, in my opinion, is really the best part. Plus the fixins! I love putting tasty greens and Sriracha sauce in my soup. It's definitely a small place, and I really wouldn't come here with more than 6 people. Also if you tell your waitress that you need another minute to decide, she will actually be back in one minute. It also didn't feel like a place where you could linger a while. It was sort of order, eat, and go. Which is fine because there are a few bakeries around the corner where you could sit for a long while without being bothered.
