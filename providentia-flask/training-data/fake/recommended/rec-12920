I have heard amazing things about Clinton's. People rave about the food, but for me, quality and quantity of the food is only half the battle. Service plays a huge factor in what makes a restaurant stand out over others, and I must say I am less than impressed with the waitstaff. Of course, New York is busy, people rushing in left right and centre. But at 6pm on a Tuesday night this place was not busy at all. Two tables were occupied and while I waited for the rest of my party to arrive I was not allowed to be seated. I stood in the little cove where they have their desserts stored, and after 10 minutes I was rudely asked how much longer my party would be. After five more minutes I was instructed Â to step outside because I was a "fire hazard", even though I was standing in an isolated area where I could not have possibly been in anyone's way during a quick exit in case of a fire. I was shocked with how I was treated by the waitstaff and if it weren't for the 20% gratuity that was added to my bill I would not have left a tip at all. During the course of the meal I was never asked how my food was or if I needed anything. If I could rate the service I would give it a big fat zero. The food was great. The pancakes were light and fluffy, and definitely something to get and share with the table. However my experience with the service makes me less inclined to ever go back despite the great food. Beware of what you're getting yourself into, and be prepared for less than mediocre service.
