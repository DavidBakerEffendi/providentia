I wish there was a way to give 3.5 stars. Here's why: The drinks = great. Service = solid. Ambiance = classy and comfy. The food = hit and miss. I came in with a party of four and our waiter was very attentive and helpful when we had questions about the menu. However, after we'd ordered a few items, the waiter came back to tell us that they couldn't make a particular cocktail from their menu, that a tap beer we'd ordered had just run out, and that one of the things we'd wanted off the menu wasn't available. When we got our meal, the octopus appetizer was indeed amazing. (Thank you, Yelp!) My friend loved his branzino dish, and while our other friend's dumplings were spicier than expected, he thoroughly enjoyed those as well. Unfortunately, my burger came out well done when I'd ordered it medium. That, and even though I hadn't asked for cheese or bacon, it was pretty dry as there wasn't any lettuce or tomato on top. Not a buzz kill, just unexpected. However, my fiancee's steak was also ordered medium but it came out well done and somewhat chewy. All in all, I will definitely come back for the drinks. When I do, if I eat, I will probably just stick with the appetizers since those seem to be the winners. In the meantime, I hope they get someone on the grill who knows what they're doing when it comes to cooking meat.
