First time visiting this Gastro pub.  I took my wife and son and we enjoyed the experience from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.  The hostess was friendly but the waitress was excellent.  She spoke directly to my 12 year old son to get his order and supported us in teaching him how to be polite and talk to adults. We sampled the Calamari appetizer and the presentation was great.  The hot peppers and I think sun dried tomatoes were just right and gave it a nice zing and sweetness. We  sampled the burgers and the beef was tasty.  We liked the personal ketchup containers which is a fun touch.  I was surprised that they didn't have a few more burger selections and if they read this ... how about something with an avocado? Throw in the Hooker and the Riesling and everyone was happy. We will be back to sit in other sections of restaurant to soak in the atmosphere.
