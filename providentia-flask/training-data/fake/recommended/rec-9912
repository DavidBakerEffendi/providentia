I had a wonderful time here with my friends! The servers were all really helpful with recommendations and we basically got everything they loved. But, definitely make a reservation through Savored because you can get 30% off their food and drinks menu. Lychee martinis: I'm used to bartenders only using lychee juice but they blended in the actual fruit so these were nice and pulpy. Crispy tuna: This was amazing! It looks more like something you'd expect at a sushi place, but tasty nonetheless. Whole braised branzino: Simple and tasty; plus the plantains on the side were nice and unexpected. Grilled sirloin steak: I loved the au poivre sauce it came with. Chicken yassa: This was definitely the most Senegalese of all the dishes we ordered. I loved the heaping amount of spiced veggies that went on top of the chicken.
