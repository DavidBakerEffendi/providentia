Heard good things about BAR. Went to go there on a Saturday night and was refused at the door due to me wearing Timberland boots. They said I could wear New Balance sneakers or Crocs and would still be let in. I was wearing a button down shirt and true religion jeans and they would still not consider letting me in. When I asked why people who looked much less "desirable" were being let in the bouncer said "those are the rules." He then proceeded to verbally assault me and threaten me when I continued to question him off of BAR's property. Management needs to get their act together and hire staff more capable of thinking for themselves.
