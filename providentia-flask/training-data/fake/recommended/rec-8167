Irene and Michelle have a great thing going here.  I like the fact that after two visits, they are still small enough to remember you.  The food varies but staple favorites like the korean fried chicken (delicious, filling, fabulous) make it a place to return for comfort, while the random experimentation like "asian street food" appetizers make the small menu interesting.  A considerable, and tasty wine list, some delicious drink combos designed by the owners are a great compliment.  I spend most of my time at the bar, which means very personal recommendations from one or both of the owners.  If you sit at a table, make sure you ask wait staff for recommendations from the owners. Irene hasn't steered me wrong, yet. Personal favorite:  Viognier dessert wine.  Only place i've ever seen it. =)
