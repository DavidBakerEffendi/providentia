I came here for dinner last night and ordered takeout - I had the La Bergere crepe, which is a buckwheat flour crepe filled with goat cheese, fig, honey, rosemary, and caramelized onions. It came with a mesclun salad. The crepe was amazing - the flavors melded perfectly together, and I loved the way the crepe was presented. The servers are also extremely friendly and nice. They make you feel right at home in their cozy restaurant. The decor is also really cute. Another plus side of eating at Pates is that there is some outdoor seating that is really cute - small, but a nice change from eating indoors when the weather is pleasant outside. They serve wine, too! One downside that I will mention is that my takeout order took over 25 minutes to come out. I was a bit disappointed at the wait time, but the server did come out to apologize, as she said that the kitchen was backed up with all of the orders coming in. While I understand that might have been the case, I've honestly never waited almost half an hour for takeout before, so it was a little annoying. However, I do plan on coming back here to have a dessert crepe. The dessert crepe options, especially the crepe Suzette, sound really tempting!
