I seriously love this place. Their quality of drinks is really unmatched, at least in Newark. Their boba drinks are well made and don't just rely on sugar and fake juices. Not sure what to order? Just ask the staff. They're all super friendly and passionate about their menu, and they typically have great suggestions, especially if you give them an idea of what you're craving. For example, our server last night convinced us to try their warm ("latte") boba drinks, and it turned out to be PERFECT. (Psst, they also carry soy milk, and you can order drinks with reduced sugar!) Seriously, try this place out soon.
