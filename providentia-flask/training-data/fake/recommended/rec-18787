i usually hate asian fusion food.. but i had a couple friends tell me i should come here.. my fiancee mentioned she would like to come here.. and new yorkers told me i should check this out.. so now that i've been.. i won't be coming back.. i spent almost 30 bucks for lunch which included tax and tip.. i got the steamed pork buns and duck dumplings.. the steamed pork buns were ok.. the pork belly is a bit bland.. the combination works.. but it's not really all that good.. the duck dumplings were a salt bomb.. the salt was overwhelming.. and there was no way i could drink broth.. i honestly have no idea why this place is so popular.. the prices are beyond ridiculous and the food is mediocre.. i wish i would have kept my lunch reservations at jean georges instead..
