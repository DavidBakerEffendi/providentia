This is a neighborhood spot that is always busy. The reason it's always busy, however, is because it's the only place in the neighborhood serving up tasty contemporary American cuisine. It is, however, not great. I've even here many times and always vow to never come back. The reason I do come back is, again, lack of options. My two main complaints are that it takes far, far, far (did I say far) too long for the food to arrive. This happens on a consistent basis. Also on a consistent basis is that the cooks don't know how to cook meat. The temperature is always far different than what I request (on either side, it can be too done or not done enough). Hire some competent line cooks!
