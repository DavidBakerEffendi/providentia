This is a great, EXTREMELY reasonably priced place to grab lunch to go. I usually get the chicken salad salad with balsamic dressing, which is delicious, and less than 5 dollars. The guys behind the counter are always friendly and kind. However, I would avoid this place on the weekend, since the selection is much more limited then.
