This place has potential to be a 4 or a 5 but out server was very rude.  Bad attitude, sassy and generally unhelpful.  When I asked a question she tried to make me feel dumb for asking and said she didn't know. Then I asked her if someone did know and she told me the manager wasn't there.  Toward the end another server started helping us, who was the exact opposite; smiling and extremely pleasant.  Nice backyard setup,  good beer selection and tasty apps.  The lights hanging in front of the TV is a pet peeve of mine but overall lots of potential here.  Let's just treat customers nicely this place will be fine.
