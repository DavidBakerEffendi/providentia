Hands down my favorite tapas in the city. I really love everything about this place- the atmosphere, the friendly service, and the food. It's small and cozy so expect a wait on a weekend night but they do take reservations. The sangria is excellent and they have a nice wine list as well. Food is always stellar. Seriously. I've never had a mediocre experience when it comes to the food. The garlic shrimp is my personal favorite but my friends and I have probably had everything on the menu at one point or another. It's ALL good. Even the basic patatas bravas is exceptionally done here. Warning: Tia Pol may spoil other tapas places for you.
