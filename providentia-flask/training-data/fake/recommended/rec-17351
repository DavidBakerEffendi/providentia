This is fun place that's trying hard to creatively re-invent the pub menu. Unfortunately on our recent visit (our first) there were too many problems with the food for me to think anything other then - it was the chef's day off, or there was some other problem in the kitchen - because with the creativity of the menu & well managed staff, I can't believe that they'd let food this wrong out of the kitchen normally. A few simple problems: the signature onion rings were really WAY WAY WAY too salty. Which I wouldn't mention, except that the french fries we got were also WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY too salty - there is no way any staff member tasted these before letting them go out to a customer. One or two small problems, and I wouldn't be writing this, but a meal of small problems and you have a pattern that leads to disappointed customers, ruins a meal and needs to be addressed. The over salted fries were made from OLD potatoes - the ones that turn dark brown because the starch has turned to sugar. Get some fresh potatoes so your fries will be crispy. The fish part of the Fish & Chips were simply tasteless! They looked AMAZING - but the fish had no taste (too LITTLE salt?) and the batter was also tasteless. The last small problem: the chocolate in the peanut butter/chocolate pie contained a thin layer of chocolate on the bottom that was too hard to cut with a fork - just seemed unprofessional - most desserts of this kind would have the chocolate part a bit softer so you didn't have to shatter the dessert and smash your fork onto the plate for every bite. Best things: they were playing great music the whole time & the waitress was nice.
