The noodles here are amazing, but everything else about this place was terrible. The veggies were questionable and the egg was grey. Waiting for a table was a mess, vicious even. Other people will snatch a table out from under you if you wait for the dishes of the former customer to be cleared. But again, the noodles are starch heaven.
