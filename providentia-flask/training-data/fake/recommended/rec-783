Finally did the cheese steak thing! I have to say, only in comparison to Geno's, that Pat's won, flavor wise. Very disappointed in the quality and quality of the food. The roll was cold and the small amount of meat on it was Luke warm and bland. Sent to "next window" for fries and a drink, fries were cold and nasty! Atmosphere was not friendly, (they had an outside worker begging for tips,even if he did nothing for you and rude customers butting into your private conversations )but I guess that's Philly. Seagrave's and Italian Kitchen, you have no worries from losing this South Jersey girl! Same price for twice the size, three times the meat and it tastes great! So if you want great cheese steak come to Salem County, NJ!
