BAD BAD BAD DO OR DIE Everything is deep fried without any taste that really really doesn't need to cost you this price. You are in BUSHWICK Â in the middle of nowhere hello, and you charge 20 bucks for a tiny piece of chewy fish that taste oil?(and everything else's was as fried as the fish.I couldn't eat that.
