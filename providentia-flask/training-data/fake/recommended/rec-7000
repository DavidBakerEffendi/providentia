YUMMMMMMMM! Their chicken biscuits are to die for. So crispy and delicious. I ordered the chicken biscuit with pimento! again, YUM! Def. recommend! I also ordered dessert. I had the chocolate cake. Not my fav, but it was still tasty and I didn't leave any bites, so that says something right?! The owner, John, is so nice too. He told me all about his and his family's story. As I can tell by the other reviews too, the owners really do make this restaurant a 5-star location. Wish I lived in the area so I could return. I wish I had more as I'm writing this review. YUM YUM :)
