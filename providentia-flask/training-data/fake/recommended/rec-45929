We'd heard a lot about this restaurant over the years, and the menu spoke to us. Tried it last Saturday night. First, the good. The service was attentive from the minute we arrived. Wonderful apps - tuna tartare (substantial portion, great flavor) and wild salmon three ways, excellent. The entrees were less successful - my paella was decent. Giant sea scallop perhaps a bit overlooked as was the shrimp. Â Her shrimp iceberg wedge had ordinary flavor, and the blue cheese was an unfortunate pairing. And her truffled Parmesan pomme frites arrived cold and leaden, as though they'd been made in advance. At this price level, that kind of mistake is unacceptable. With all the dining options in Montclair, we won't be hurrying back. Not awful, definitely not outstanding. Noise level high but acceptable. Attractive, 'cool' looking space. If we were to go back in the future, we'd probably stick to a few apps.
