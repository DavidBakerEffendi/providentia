I have to say that I get a little angry when this pizza is left of the top 10 lists for best pizza in New York. I think people get down on Lombardi's for not being the hidden gem that it once was but I personally think they do an amazing job of handling the crowds and have never, in any way, compromised the quality of their pizza. We went on a busy Friday night and were expecting to wait a while for a table. Not the case. The waitstaff runs a very tight ship and they've done a great job of maximizing the space in the building. Now for the pizza itself. You come here for the oven. Just ask the Culinary Institute of America that regularly takes samples of the wall of this oven to try to figure out why it makes the pizza taste so good. No matter what you order, make sure you get at least one original margherita pizza. This is the pizza where you have the best chance of tasting what makes this place special. It's a crispy flavorful crust, ultra fresh red sauce and perfectly sliced circles of mozzarella. That's it. So f@@(&#^$ good!! Not that it needs it but the service is fast and attentive and somehow you never seem to be waiting long for your food (the oven is gigantic). I won't knock John's or Totono's or any of the other great pizza places in NYC but this is definitely my favorite.
