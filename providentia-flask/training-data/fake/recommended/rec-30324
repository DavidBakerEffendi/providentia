I have been to many New American restaurants and Market Table is by far one of the best I've ever tried. For an appetizer, you must get the octopus! I love octopus and have ordered it at numerous restaurants but the octopus at Market Table is excellent! It is cooked and seasoned perfectly. For main dishes my friend got the chicken which was also cooked to perfection. The skin was crispy to her liking and the meat was tender and moist. I got the monkfish medallions which I thought was heavenly as well. For those who have never tried monkfish, they have the texture of crab or lobster. It was delicious. For drinks we got the watermelon punch and the gin fizz. While neither was unique, both were very good and refreshing. For dessert, the peach panna cotta was super rich and a great ending. I don't think you can go wrong with anything off of their menu. All of the tables around us had ordered different items and their plates were cleaned off. The waiters are super friendly and helpful. The restaurant is busy but not too loud or crowded. I really feel like this place is a hidden gem!
