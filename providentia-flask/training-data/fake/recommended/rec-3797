Glad I made a reservation, the wait time would have forced me to make other arrangements. Very classy and relaxed atmosphere. we ordered the roasted lemon chicken and pork medallions, both were delicious. Would say the downstairs dining room is nicer than upstairs. Granted the bar takes up half of the main floor. Would agree with other reviews that this was the best Greek restaurant I've experienced.
