I am willing to update this review after they work out some kinks. They just opened and I think this place is more of a wine bar with tapas than anything else so if you're expecting more....don't. I went for "brunch" as advertised outside which ended up being a choice between what looked like a tart or a ham and cheese sandwich. Both of these items were pre made and sitting out on a plate....they were then taken and warmed for us. Also they came out cold, not warm. This will not fly in the Village. This is not "brunch". The food choices are sorely limited, however the drink menu is nice and the decor and vibe is just right for a wine bar which this part of town is in dire need for. If they want to expand their repertoire they need to expand their menu. Also it reeked of just trying to be Basque/Spanish. On the bright side, the service was great. The people involved really talk to the customers and cater to them and are enthusiastic about making this place work. My friend who was with me was very disappointed and we went to eat brunch and have drinks at Back Forty down the road. The wine selection looked respectable but not extensive. The menu was a bit strange, mostly in Spanish with minimal explanations of what the food really was. I sat there for at least 10 minutes trying to figure out what half the plates consisted of. It just felt like they were trying too hard. Would I come back at night for a glass of wine with a date? Possibly. They have a lot of potential with this location and with how committed and great the people who work here are. I really hope they pull it off and make it big but right now the edibles at this place need SERIOUS help.
