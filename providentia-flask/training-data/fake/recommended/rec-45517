Went here for the first time in FAR too long today. Had the scrambled egg special with potatoes - the rosemary potatoes are AMAZING and every ingredient is fresh, fresh, fresh - a simple menu but the ingredients made everything so bright and fresh and delicious, and our waiter (Patrick) was busy but very attentive and got us coffee and water refills exactly when we needed them.
