I really wanted to like this place, but can't say that anything memorable was left behind. I try to only post positive reviews but there's so much hype around this place I wanted to write an honest review. The "Manly" burger was mediocre at best, and teensy tiny for the price. Congealed lukewarm cheese and maybe 5 or 6 sad little mushy onion strings. The truffle fries came put cold with the "truffle" butter also congealed on top like they'd been sitting around. Maybe our food was sitting on the line? The fried pickles tasted as though something was wrong with them. I believe they brine their own pickles in house so the problem may have originated there as no one on the table finished eating their pickle spear. I will give a nod to the Tuna burger which was unique and had a good flavor. Over all, for the $100 check I was disappointed and won't be returning.
