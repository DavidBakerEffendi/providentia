First impressions: open, clean, inviting space with very attentive and helpful staff. Pork belly sandwiches were some of the best I've had. The lamb shoulder served on a bed of garnished rice was outstanding. The duck was also a hit with smokey flavoring that was very tender. The broccoli salad was mediocre so perhaps ill order the Â grilled corn or pickles next time. Will definitely be back!
