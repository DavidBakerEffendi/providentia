Had lunch here yesterday and tried the hot-pressed turkey & pesto sandwich with melted mozzarella cheese. VERY tasty sandwich. I got sides of balsamic vinaigrette and housemade garlic mayo (which was thin like dressing) and those were great for dipping. The healthy-looking breakfast sandwiches on the board caught my eye, so I stopped in this morning for a bite. I had the Mediterranean Egg Sandwich, which is a "Mediterranean egg" with plum tomatoes, red onions and hummus, served in a warm, soft pita. THIS BREAKFAST SANDWICH WAS TRANSCENDENT! They added a few dashes of hot sauce and that put it over the top. I look forward to going back and adding ham and/or cheese next time. Also tried the iced coffee, which is so-so and which is what prevented me from giving five stars. Their website tagline is "Gourmet Sandwiches & Espresso Bar," and I'd expect better iced coffee from an espresso bar, but I'm learning that most iced coffee in NYC is deplorable, so this so-so coffee isn't all that bad.
