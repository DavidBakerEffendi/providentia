I absolutely love everything about this restaurant.  The décor; the hostesses; the wait staff. And especially the food!  Wonderful.   I went on Sunday for brunch and they served the tables cute bite-sized cinnamon rolls made from flaky pastry dough.  I could have eaten a dozen. The next day I went back for dinner... and at this point I don't remember what I had. On this recent trip - late June 2010 - I only made it for one meal - Brunch on Sunday. I ordered the Parmesan Pop-over, with eggs/ham and the home fries.  The presentation was impeccable.  And again, the food was amazing.   Eating here is reason enough to move to the big city!
