My family and I have a slight obsession with philly cheesesteaks. My grandfather lived in Philly for a while and when he moved to California with his kids, he instilled a love for cheesesteaks in them and his grandchildren as well. However, I always love a chance to go to the famous Geno's or Pat's. Though I have no true loyalty having only been to each once, I really enjoyed Geno's a lot. Being a 'foreigner' to Philly, I did not quite know the right lingo to order, and though I'm sure all the employees were laughing at me, they helped me out and got my cheesesteak to me promptly. It's a Philadelphia classic and I definitely recommend it to all. In all honesty, if I didn't think I would get immensely judged by my cousin who was with me, I would have ordered three and devoured them.
