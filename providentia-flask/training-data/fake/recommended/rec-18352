Went here for the first time for a friend's 22nd birthday! One word sums the whole evening up- AMAZING. Awesome waitress with great suggestions, um, guacamole that can only be described as "mmmmm" x 100, incredible sea bass tacos, and I mean incredible, sangria that blows you away, and a candle in my friend's delish cinnamon churros as a complimentary birthday dessert. Will absolutely be here again very soon.
