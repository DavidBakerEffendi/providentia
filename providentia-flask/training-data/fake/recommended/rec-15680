Ate here for dinner tonight with my folks. Gotta say the place was up to par with Yelp review. Our waitress was nice and recommended some delicious dishes for us. My personal favorite was the Gnocchi (saw it on Yelp photo). The price was fair, please consider the fact that you're in U.E.S. Overall, I'll definitely come back to this place again. If I were you, I'll make reservations beforehand.
