Alright soo.. let's start with the easy things - superb service, wonderful intimate setting.. you must sit by the huge counter made out of wood shaped in half an octagon.. and watch the two chefs at work.. all indgredients are laid out in front of you and they grab everything and serve everything to you on these great wooden (i would compare to a pizza oven large spoon for lack of better word) spoons. Â  Great selection of drinks.. wine and sochu sake namely. We had chef tasting menu (well worth the $48).. First dish.. tuna - well prepared not too crazy about it.. but what came after well made up for it. Second dish.. macrel sushi very well prepared with amazing side of string beans and something else i dont recall... and the presentation out of this world Third dish was grilled eggplant and okra.. .very enjoyable and the lemon made it nice zesty though remained buttery throughout. Fourth dish were grilled two kinds of mushrooms... splendid.. Fifth dish was beef - made to perfection.. and wonderful thin sauce Sixth and final dish was a combo of soup with dikon and soy flavor as well as steam rice (you could choose your flavor we decided on snow crab) - so this closed the meal to a comfort level.. you are used to when you finished eating at home.. all throughout the meal had great structure and really pulled together amazingly. A must go. Period. Must sit at counter. Don't argue just do it.
