Yum! One of my new favorite places in the UWS. First of all, I love the decor. It feels like you're in Santorini or Mykonos. The white exteriors and blue decor really make you feel like you're there. We were seated upstairs. The space is large and the large windows in front are nice on a summer night. The food + wine are also very delicious and super reasonable. I highly recommend the spread platter, the mussels, the octopus salad (yum! this was super delicious). My friends had the pasta with sausage (was also yum), the meatballs, and fish and everyone was quite satisfied. There's seriously something for everyone here and it doesn't break the bank.
