Ughhhhhh! This place is too try hard. Within the one hour I spent here with my tiny cortado..I somehow accrued enough grease from the smoky air to leave smelling like butter and fried food (WHY!? Is there no proper ventilation in the kitchen?). OMG THE MUSIC (If you call it that) The music is horrible, loud and just SHOUTINGLY obnoxious! It was 4:30pm and everyone here was trying hard to think over the ridiculous mix. I suggested politely to the bartender if she could "please turn down the music or switch to something a bit milder? I love your coffee and want to come back again" but the bartender just gave me a "I'll try (not too hard) because we don't have any other music" look. 20 minutes later, she must have turned the music up because I swear I already had already adjusted my tolerance level (since she never turned the music down). ANNOYED. My friend and I up and left... ended up at the sweet Ange Noir Cafe instead. YAY! I CAN THINK AGAIN. Did someone say this place had good ass vibes? Yes. Good "ass vibes" indeed. Too bad I'm looking for good "brain vibes."
