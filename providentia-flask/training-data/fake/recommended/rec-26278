Really crazy crowded, but I can see why. The food comes out fast and tasty. Turnover is pretty quick, at the rate they move. I personally recommend either getting knife cut or hand-pulled noodles. I'm a fan of the texture of the noodles. If you want more conventional styles of noodles, there's a few other restaurants down the corner that will be less crowded and have more leg room for you taller folks out there. When I went there with a friend, a few of the other patrons seemed to be off-put by the small venue and the rather grimy decor. Well, it's Chinatown. Oh yeah, don't be dismayed by the loud "thwacking" that comes from the kitchen; one of the chefs is making those noodles that we all love so much. Recommended: pan-friend knife cut noodles and the bok choy & mushroom appetizer.
