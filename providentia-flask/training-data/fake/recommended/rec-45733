The short version: This place is awesome! Incredibly friendly, culinarily-talented owners serving all high quality, homemade comfort food with a twist. Give these guys a shot; you won't be disappointed! I stumbled upon noshBorough with my brother and his girlfriend while we were apartment hunting in Astoria this weekend, and what an awesome find it turned out to be! First impression upon walking in was that it was an inviting, cute, clean space with super friendly owners. It took us a few minutes to decide what to order after one of the owners, Johnny, gave us a rundown of the menu. Ultimately my brother and I opted to try the burgers (he got the Banh Mi and I got the nosh) with a side of fries, while the girlfriend had the kale salad. The kale salad was delicious. It had just the right amount of dressing, the ingredients were fresh, and the portion size was perfect. My brother and I also loved our burgers which were huge and had healthy amounts of their respective toppings. The nosh burger comes with bacon marmalade which totally made the sandwich. The fries were just as fries should be: soft on the inside and super crispy on the outside. We ate them with the homemade jalapeno + cilantro and spicy BBQ sauces wish I told them to start selling because they were that good. Totally unrelated to the food - Jeannie and Johnny (owners) gave us great advice about the neighborhood and other great spots to eat in the area which we really appreciated. Before we left they gave us a big slice of their peach cheesecake which was light and flavorful. Okay, I think you guys get the point - this place should definitely be on your To Try list. Â If my ranting didn't sell you on it, hopefully the picture of cheesecake will...
