Food should make you happy and let me tell you, brunch at the Clinton St. Baking Company had me smiling like the Cheshire cat. The honey cured bacon, blueberry pancakes with maple butter, fried green tomatoes and cheesy grits garnished with fresh green onions made me do my "good food happy dance" aka the at-the-table shimmy. It was well worth the hour we spent waiting for our table. The hostess even came out with pancake bites for the eager crowd outside. This place was A-mazing!
