With so many places to choose from in Chinatown, it's hard to differentiate the good from the bad. Having grown up eating some of the best Chinese food (in Hawaii, California and the Philippines) I had to find my gems in NY. I came across this place on a rainy Saturday morning. Having drunk my fair share of liquid bread the night before, I found myself looking for a remedy to ease my pains. Naturally, I thought of dumplings and/or soup. This place was empty and resembled the Chinese restaurants I passed by after surfacing from the train. However the little window facing the street perfumed of amazing broth. A man stood there making dumplings, wontons and noodles.  I immediately thought to myself "great! I'm totally going to have this place to myself!!" I sat down and was attended to immediately. Water and tea was brought without asking for it. I glanced over the menu, which listed a bountiful selection of Chinese specialties. I'm sure not every dish is a home run but I was almost sure noodle and dumpling dishes would not disappoint. I ordered pork and chive dumplings, chive cakes and beef ball (with tendons) noodle soup. With each bite and sip, I slowly felt my hangover dissipate...ahhhh! Try the pork & chive dimpling,  along with beef balls w/ egg noodles :)
