Very good food! All dishes earned 4-5 stars at our table! Whatever you order will bring you joy! Ragu pasta is AMAZING! I go there for it all the time! Good to know: 1)small portions (def not american), 2)finest homestyle italian, 3)expensive, 4)not so easy to make a booking. Otherwise, GO-GO-GO! Try everything from appetizer to desert, you wont be disappointed!
