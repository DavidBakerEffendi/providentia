Unbelievable dinner at this brand new farm-to-table spot in HK/Clinton. The space is cozy and lovingly crafted with reclaimed wood and a huge wood oven in the kitchen. The staff is professional and friendly, service was great. The cocktails are appealing and the ones we tried were wonderful. I had the Sage Advice, which was refreshing. The wine and liquor list is different and fun - all local. The Gruner was lovely with our meal. The food was fantastic and all super fresh - we had the chicken liver pate which was very nice and rich. We also had the Brussels sprouts salad which was amazing. I would go back just to eat that again: some fresh and raw, some roasted, all perfectly dressed. We shared the chicken for two with the bread salad; the bread was cooked under the chicken, and it absorbed the perfect amount of flavor and fat. Amazing. The chicken was moist and delicious. And a huge portion! I also tasted the lamb (succulent and falling off the bone) and the T-bone (juicy and oven flavored goodness, served with super tasty duck fat chips). And don't skip dessert - the sundae with bourbon cherries and hot fudge was worth the splurge! Will return many times to try everything on the changing seasonal menu!!
