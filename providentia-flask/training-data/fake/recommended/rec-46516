This is one of the best meals I've ever had.  We sat at the counter outside the kitchen, watching Canora himself work his magic.  The gnocchi is ridiculous - little pillows of potato heaven.  We also had the olive oil poached salmon, which was also sublime.  My fiance doesn't even like salmon and he was having a foodgasm over the dish.  If I could eat at Hearth for every meal of my life I would!  Can't wait to go back.
