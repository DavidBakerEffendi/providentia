We came here for a weekend brunch. The wait was about an hour for a party of four, but we had heard good things so we put our names in and waited. Everything we ordered was great! I had the classic croque madam while other people had the mushroom croque, the eggs and prosciutto, and the special. We also had the special appetizer, which was this bread with butter, blueberry, apricot, and cream. It were incredible! I am definitely coming back to this place. Everything we ordered was excellent.
