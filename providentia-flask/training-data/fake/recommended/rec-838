Love these cheesesteaks!! I have been to Pat's (across the street) and also Jim's. Geno's is by far much tastier and juicier. I like how the meat is cut into thinner slices than most other Philly cheesesteaks. I also prefer Geno's bread than any of the other cheesesteaks. I see people complaining about the service, but you know what you are getting yourself into: an establishment that has been around since 1966, quick service, and a bang for your buck. For the price that the cheesesteaks cost, I don't think we need 5 star service. It's all about how delicious it is!
