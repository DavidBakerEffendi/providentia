I wish I lived next door. I'd eat here every day if I could! Give me sundubu, galbi, beer, and lychee soju--and I am happy. Forever. The place is pretty big and able to accommodate many customers and large groups. I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes (usually no wait at all!) to be seated upon walking in. The banchan is wonderfully fresh and I always love my own personal fried fish that they include. The only negative thing I have to say is that if you're seated upstairs, you may be forgotten. I've had this happen to me on several occasions--the server just disappears after your food has arrived. No more checking-in on you...and you have to wave someone down in order to get the check. However, this will never stop me from coming back.
