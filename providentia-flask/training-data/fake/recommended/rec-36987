I was still a little miffed that I had to forgo Corner Bistro because the group I was with didn't want to wait in the long lines at 7 p.m. on a Wednesday night! So what did I do? Not wanting anyone or anything to stand in the way of my burger fix I did the sensible thing and went by myself at 2:30 p.m. Paydirt!! No lines and I sat at a little table by myself jealously eyeing the burgers of the people next to me. I ordered from the small chalk menu which consisted of burgers, chicken sandwiches, grilled cheese, chili, and fries. They did have beers and other libations but I don't drink when the sun is out so I have no comment about the offerings. I did have a delicious meaty burger. The meat is what makes this burger special. The bun fell apart after two bites but I didn't care because it meant I would get to the meat faster. I really am not one for foreplay!! The condiments were average as were the fries. The paper plates were cute but nothing for me to get excited about. The exciting thing here is the meat- big, juicy, well-cooked burgers that reminded me of the backyard BBQ's of my childhood. The $5.50 price for the burger was a bargain for NYC. Next time I will probably ask for the meat only because who really needs the bread? Fries were of the shoestring variety and they were good just nothing really to flip your skirt. I highly recommend this place for a burger and try to go between 2 and 5 to avoid the crowds. The restaurant is of average size and there is a bar area which was crowded with neighborhood drunks- one guy actually spilled his drink on himself and there was no one even near!! Enjoy your burger!!
