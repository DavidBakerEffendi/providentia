Lot 5 I've eaten here 7 or more times and its impossible to knock.  The burger, stellar.  The Sunday night "family dinner," amazing. The kindness in service, welcoming and the consistency of quality, unwavering. Katie, the mainstay bartender serves with precision, care and knowledge.  The food is always on point.  The ambiance and decor are simple and lovely.   Specifics about this dish and that are pointless, as the kitchen is ever-evolving and adapting to seasonal availability, and besides the burger, expect something new each time.  This is a good thing!  A menu with 7 or 8 items total tells you that freshness is important, there are no freezers or can openers in this place (or not so you would expect), and the fluctuation of the dishes can keep you coming back week after week.   Ok, I won't spoil it, go see for yourself.  This is how every restaurant in the world should run.
