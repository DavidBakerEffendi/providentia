fourth of july, what better way to celebrate than with bbq?  apparently, many ppl share similar thoughts too.  we left our name and phone number was told there would be about an hour wait, the wait seemed shorter and we were seated about 45 minutes later.   we ordered the honey bbq wings to start, so juicy and tender, very good.  then we both got the tres ninos plate, consisted of pulled pork (juicy), bbq ribs (flavorful but definitely not fall-off-the-bone), and brisket.  the brisket was a bit off, i got the end pieces and they were tough and very very salty.  the bf got the middle section, it was very moist and tender.  for the sides, we got the potato salad (creamy and flavorful, excellent), baked beans (tasty!), bbq fried rice (smokey, bf liked it, i thought it was ok), and the mac & cheese (excellent!).  the corn breads were great too.  to wash everything down, we had sweet tea (great, southern style sweet tea!) and lemonade (awesome!).  the portions were very generous and i had enough for two meals.  yum! overall, we had a great experience at Dino's and will be back for sure!
