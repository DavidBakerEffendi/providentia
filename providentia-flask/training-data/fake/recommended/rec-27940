OK, I confess... I'm there 4 days a week! Great value, generous portions with super fresh ingredients... I'm addicted to the kimchi hero with barbecue chicken and the pho real sandwich. This is a 24/7 deli with a very efficient sandwich counter and yes, they deliver groceries too! p.s. Now that you know that I go there very often, please don't stalk me.
