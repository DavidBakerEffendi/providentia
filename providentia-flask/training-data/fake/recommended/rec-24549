Overall good experience here. There was no wait on a Friday around 7:30 pm though must of gotten lucky as there was a line outside about 15 mins later. The staff was friendly and the food was served fast, like it was there waiting for us. The BBQ pork app was amazing and the massamam curry w/chicken was perfect (not too spicy). I did drive there and was a bit concerned when I saw the sign in the window that said not to leave valuables in the car. Says something about the neighborhood. I would definitely return though there is a new Thai spot opening everyday.
