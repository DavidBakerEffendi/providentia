I got the shrimp po' boy and the cajun fries (which are more like potato wedges). Both were okay. The po' boy was lacking some shrimp. Also, the po' boy wasn't pressed (like a panini) which may just depend on the cook, but I like that better. Kimber, our server was cool and helpful. My friend had the jumbalaya, which was okay. I've been to NOLA and I've spent some time in the Gulf Coast. Of course I don't expect it to be as good, but I know what it should taste like. I would give it 3 stars simply on food, but the service is what bumps my review to 4.
