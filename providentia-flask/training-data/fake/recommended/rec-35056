My wife and I went to Matthew's for the 1st time last night and had a very good experience.  We started off with the calamari and the caprese salad.  The calamari was cooked perfectly and seasoned deliciously.  The mozzarella used in the salad was extremely fresh.  I had the pasta special with the homemade sausage and cherry peppers.  It was spicy but not overpowering, the way I like it.  My wife had the linguine with clams in red sauce.  She said the past was cooked perfectly, but the clams could have been seasoned a bit more.  Overall the experience was pleasant.  The service was delightful and on point.  We will definitely be back.
