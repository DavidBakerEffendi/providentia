Stopped here over the weekend for a few drinks and a snack. Bartender was sweet and friendly, no complaints there. She pointed out the drink & appetizer specials. That is where my complaint is. We ordered the macaroni & cheese, which is listed in their "starters" section. What a huge let down! The mac & cheese was served on a totally cute miniature cast iron skillet, but that is where the compliments end. The menu advertised a 7 cheese sauce. There was very little cheese on the noodles, and the pasta tasted dried out and slightly crunchy. If we hadn't been so hungry we would have sent it back. Please don't waste your cash on this particular dish. We also tried the lobster bisque. This was OK, but had a very heavy sherry flavor. Based on these items alone I will skip the fare at Mac's next time. Atmosphere is nice, cozy, and dim, the way i like my bars -- with lots of dark wood. Nice place for a drink, just not to eat...
