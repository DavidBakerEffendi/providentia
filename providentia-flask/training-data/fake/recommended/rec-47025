PYT's a great place for your out-of-the-ordinary burger. I had the sliders w/chocolate-covered bacon on grilled Krispy Kreme "buns" with a Caucasian (White Russian-esque) shake. Fantastic!!! The sugar rush was kept in check by the booze. My girl had the more conservative Lobster Burger, which I agreed, was excellent. Fries (specialized for the burgers, kudos, guys!) were excellent as well. Atmosphere was quirky, as is with The Piazza. I dig dining alfresco, and if the big tv's on, you might be in heaven or hell, depending what's on. Service was attentive and friendly. Food arrived hot & well presented. Costs are reasonable, if you can stomach $10 milkshakes...but hey, they're full of booze! Parking's a pain, but isn't it most places in Philly? Can't wait until my next Caucasian.
