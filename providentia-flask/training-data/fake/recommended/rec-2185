After watching an episode of "No Reservations," I was compelled to go out and give the place a try.  I went here with a group of friends under the guise that we were going to have to wait around 30 minutes for a table to open up (we were a rather large group of about 8, and yes 8 is quite a lot of people in a bar that could probably seat around 50-60).    Despite being told that we might have to wait an hour to an hour and half, we were called up (after leaving a name and phone number) after only 30 minutes, lucky us.  Once we were seated, service quickly came in the form of menus, and warm towels which I assume were to be used to freshen up.    Ordering drinks was the next order of business and if you plan on having a lot of beer save yourself the trouble and go for the $12 pitcher.  We ended up ordering a bunch of different dishes and having a taste of everything.  I'm sure they expect people to share dishes so I don't believe they charge extra for your friends to share.  Among the things we ordered, Takoyaki was a hot, tasty, delight of which I would proceed with caution as they are served ripping hot.  Wasabi Shumai was a crowd pleaser, it tasted good, and the reaction from those who ate it is entertainment in and of itself.  The Deep Fried Chicken Gizzards were surprisingly good, crunchy, almost chicken nugget like with "squeaky-ness" that cannot be explained, you'll just have to try it.  The Yakitori was alright, granted I only ordered Pork Belly, Chicken, and Chicken Meat Ball.  The server was friendly and was always quick to get us another pitcher of beer when we asked.  In the end we all enjoyed ourselves, filled with food, and slightly buzzed for about $35 - 40 each which I consider pretty good by Manhattan standards and such close proximity to Times Square.  Chalk one up for "No Reservations".  Oh, and the bathroom is quite clean as well.
