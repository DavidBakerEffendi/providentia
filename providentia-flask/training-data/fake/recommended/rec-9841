I'm still a huge fan, but just as an FYI, if you do BYOB, each person has to order at least $15 worth of food.  This is very contradictory to my previous visit because my server never mentioned this.  Also when this new server told us of this new rule, we ordered an appetizer (nutella and baguettes which was yummy), however, our total bill didn't equal $15 per person.  Not quite sure why he told us that we had to order that much, and then didn't even enforce it...
