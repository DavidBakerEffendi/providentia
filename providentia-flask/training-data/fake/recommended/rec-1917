Ohmygosh. This place is so so so so so good! My friends always get this whenever they go visit New York. I was really surprised that the line didn't take so long. I mean, usually food cart/truck lines take forever to wait in but I was in line for a max of 15 mins. These guys are really fast! i was in the longer line because I was first confused at what I was doing, but they have 2 carts and they're both the same thing. I remember my friend telling me this before I left for the cart, but i was so excited I guess I forgot. But anyways, this placei s probably the best comfort food in the world! I remembered when on my friend took his first bite, he honestly was silent and just kept on eating. There's something about that chicken and rice that's indescriblble. I love the hot sauce that you can ask on the side. It's kind of spicy so pour only half, otherwise it'll distort the taste a little. When you come here, you should buy more than 1 for yourself! You can put the other ones in the fridge and simply heat it up for tomorrow or the next day or the next. It's that good! It won't taste bad if you reheat!! :D I recommend!OHMYGOSH. delish..
