I have always loved this place....I developed a slew of food allergies recently,  n I cant indulge in all my delicious food yummies or regular food spots anymore. MD is TOTALLY accommodating,  and prepare my food specifically for me...even when they're busy! Try the fried Zucch sticks...it was an old favie of mine!
