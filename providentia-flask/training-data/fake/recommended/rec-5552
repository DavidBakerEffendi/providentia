I've been here a few times and I really like it.  They have some really fun, creative, and delicious drinks (my favorites are the Twizzler and the Hawaii 5-0).  They don't take reservations if you're not in a large group (I think you need 12 or more people) but if you come for dinner the lounge on the second floor is a great place to kill some time, you can get drinks and appetizers and you kinda forget you're waiting for a table.   The food is pretty good, I can't remember ever hating anything but there hasn't been anything that blew me away either.  The only exception to that would be the  cheesesteak egg rolls, I've gotten them every single time I've been there.   They're also great for lunch.  The menu's a bit smaller but still great and they're really fast so if you only have a certain amount of time you can get in and out pretty quickly.
