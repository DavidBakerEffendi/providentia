My friend and I stopped in to Boqueria for a quick drink, bite and rest from a day of shopping. It was a late afternoon and the place was pretty empty so we were seated immediately in the bar and had an attentive and pleasant waitress. We split a carafe of sangria and a meat and cheese sample platter. I was happy that they put fruit in their sangria, I hate when restaurants serve sangria without fruit. The meat and cheese platter was standard, not special, but still good. I will have to go back and experience their entrees to know if this place is anything but just a snack stop.
