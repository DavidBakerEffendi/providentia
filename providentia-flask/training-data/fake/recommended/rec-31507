Authentic Italian with a cozy atmosphere. The menu offers a variety of interesting Italian dishes you won't find at your typical restaurant. Always offering fantastic specials. I highly recommend the grilled Calamari! Whenever my cousin from Roma comes to visit, he loves to go to L'Angolo... that pretty much says it all.
