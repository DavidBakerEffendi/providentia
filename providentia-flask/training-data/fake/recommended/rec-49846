My date and I stopped in before a movie and everything from the drinks to the salad to the entrees were just OK. My date had a Burger, we split a salad and I had the wasabi salmon. My salmon seemed to be missing the wasabi, it was just a plain piece of fish. The waitress assured me it was in there but I don't think I could miss wasabi. It was topped with a avocado relish that seemed like it was made a couple days ago. I ordered a yummy sounding martini and he had a long island. Â Not a bad dinner just not one I would repeat.
