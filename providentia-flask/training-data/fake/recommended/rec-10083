Caught up with the Lobster Pound truck today at the Parked festival at South Street Seaport.  Gotta say I was pretty stoked with their Maine lobster roll.  A little more mayo than I would like but overall it was delicious.  The meat was super super fresh as expected and it was seasoned perfectly.  I dont like much mayo on my rolls so this one ranks as my second favorite roll that Ive had in the city (Lukes being numero uno).  I actually went back later in the evening for seconds but they were fresh out of Maine style rolls.  Bummer!  A side note, there were very long lines today at the vendor trucks and one of the Red Hook employees was nice enough to come out and let us know that they were running low on lobster and that a new batch was due any minute.  Very thoughtful and much appreciated while we sipped on some Stella to kill time in the line.
