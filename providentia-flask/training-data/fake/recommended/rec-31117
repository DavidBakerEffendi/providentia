We have eaten here 3 times now since it opened. And Â each time has been as good if not better than the last. . Have tried many different selections on the menu . Must say the mussels are to die for and leave you wih the feeling...how soon can I come back to have more. Pizza from the brick oven is out of this world..now looking forward to Brunch...yes this weekend is looking good. I know it will be. Huge success.
