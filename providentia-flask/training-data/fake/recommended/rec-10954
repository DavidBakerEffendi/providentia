great place for drinks.bar great . resteraunt sloopy .food mediocre at best . seem very disorganized. told us there was a 2 hour wait to sign up then 20 minutes later had a table upstairs . will go there for drinks but not dinner . the service was very good but the help in general seemed inexpeirenced ,but i must admit it was a very intresting place
