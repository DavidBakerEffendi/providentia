BEST... ITALIAN... LINGUINE... PERIOD! Plus the service was excellent.  Even though the size of the restaurant is extremely large, it's always crowded because they're located in the heart of Time Square. But please come for the linguine.  It was definitely the best linguine I have ever had.  Also, they are a family style restaurant so order a few more plates to share.
