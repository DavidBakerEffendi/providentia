I literally dream about the sliced beef noodle soup with hand drawn noodles. I get this every time I come here. The service is great and prompt. The noodle soup with chicken is good, too. A cut of chicken is served on a plate on the side, resting on a bed of lettuce. It is seasoned and grilled nicely. I just wouldn't order the noodle soup with oxtails because they are all bone and little meat.
