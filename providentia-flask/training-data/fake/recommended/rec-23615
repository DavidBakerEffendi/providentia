Good typical diner. But be warned about the eggs benedict: they are drowning in hollandaise, and I'm not even 100% sure it's hollandaise and not a hollandaise/cheese combo. (I've never seen the sauce before where it's browned on the top). There's so much you can't see the egg or english muffin and you just end up with a pool of eggy cream. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, but probably not what you were expecting
