-real talk- the platter for two was tasty, but the service was SO bad, it really blew the experience. if you spend enough time making small talk, you may not notice your grimy table, lack of menus, or missing beverages. anyway. i bet lunch is run better than dinner but the space is pretty unattractive overall & the bathrooms (for a place where you eat with only your hands) was rather janky. bleh. i'll give it some time before revisiting.
