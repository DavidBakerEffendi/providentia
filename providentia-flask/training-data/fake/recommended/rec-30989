If I could classify a restaurant as a piece of culinary deliciousness and Heaven, In Riva fits the category well. An extensive list of wines and beers accompany the brilliant food. I personally recommend the meatballs and whipped ricotta along with the pepperoni pizza. To die for good. A chill place with a cool vibe and damn good eats. Cheers.
