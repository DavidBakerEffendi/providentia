A very organic type of place. They had about 15 different sandwiches and salads on offer, all 100% organic, and the two wraps we ordered were very yummy. They also had a dizzying array of fresh locally baked treats which looked so tantalizing (but we didn't try any). Fancy coffees and teas too. Only a few tables, so plan on possibly waiting to eat after you order at the counter. Service also laughably slow (this is the country). Â There is a nice view of the "downtown" village area from the front tables-- you can gaze at the village church while you relax and dine.
