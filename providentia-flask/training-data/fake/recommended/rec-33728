I came here with my friend Aaron who told me the Baja Fish Tacos were delicious.  He was right.  I honestly had never had fish tacos before since just the phrase is unappealing, but I wanted to try it.  The fish tacos were delicious, but Grey Dog was more than just good food. Grey Dog's decor is awesome.  Their menu is on a chalk board behind where you order.  Your table is reserved by putting down a bandana.  And their restaurant is mostly wood. Grey Dog is great.  Stop by and enjoy the experience.
