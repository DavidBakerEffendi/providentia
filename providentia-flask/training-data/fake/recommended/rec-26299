I came here for my birthday dinner and let me say IT WAS DELICIOUS. Funny story, we told the waiter multiple times it was my birthday, and unfortunately no free dessert :(, and when the dessert came out there were two plates... the pie and a single candle melted onto the plate. It was pretty hilarious! It's tapas style/small plates and the waiter did a great job of recommending dishes and helping us navigate the menu. They bring you what looks like a shot of bacon broth as an appetizer of sorts and DAMN was it tasty! (And SO decadent. A good foreshadowing for the meal ahead of us.) This is a good place for 2-4 people, maybe even 6...? I wouldn't come here with a large party, just because it's probably next to impossible to get seating. I feel like 4 would be the PERFECT number. We were the first ones in the restaruant (as we were trying to make a show), but the place filled up fast! If it gets as crowded as it does at 6pm, then I'm sure there's a bit of a wait later on at night. Although you're eating small dishes, you end up leaving stuffed. DO NOT underestimate how full you'll be. I recommend ordering a couple of dishes here and there and holding off until after you've gone through them. You can always order more dishes!  My favorite dish was the Fried Green Tomatos, mmmm my mouth is watering just thinking about it! My southern roots looooooved it.  My stomach is rumbling as I write this review. I cannot wait until I come back!
