Lovely food and healthy options in this take out place. Lots of vegetarian  and spicy dishes. You can find virtually anything Korean in this shop, from kimchi to wild rice, soy sauce to kimbap. Atmosphere is of a buffet style rather than a real sit down restaurant with servers. Unlike other buffets, it's not an all you can eat!  Prices are by the pound, but they also have ready made meals boxes. I like it. :)
