Woke up really late on a Sunday afternoon and decided to have some very flavorful food. I ended up coming here to have a hotpot lunch. I've been craving for this place but haven't gotten the chance to come. I walked it and it was not busy at all. One night I've tried to get a table for 2 but it was completely packed and the wait was ridiculously long. I'm glad I got to experience mister hotpot on a not so busy afternoon. The server knew that it was our first time and had no trouble explaining everything to us. I ordered some recommendations from a friend and added some of my usual items for hotpot. I went with pork broth soup. I didn't think the soup was all that, it could've been  "juicier". I love the sauce they set on our table. Then we were able to mix our combination of additional sauce and toppings from the wheel they gave us. Next time id take out the lemon because it overpowered my sauce with sourness. My favorites were the Kobe Beef, Cuttlefish Paste  and the Fried Tofu Skin Roll. Other things I've ordered is the beef platter, winter melon, watercress, taro, enoki mushrooms, etc. the usuals I get for hotpot. They seem to give a complimentary basket that includes vermicelli, lettuce, egg, seaweed knots, and a fish ball of some kind. It was a very odd basket, there was only one ball, three seaweed knot and loaded with lettuce I only cared for the egg to mix in with my sauce. I was so full after the meal and the server informed us that we can receive a free Melona ice-cream bar if we check-in on Facebook. I finished everything and left feeling satisfied. *Tip: Here's a good tip I found out from experience. You should definitely call ahead of time to try to get a reservation before coming in. They only have a limited supply of the fried tofu skin so reserve a few orders when you make a reservation!
