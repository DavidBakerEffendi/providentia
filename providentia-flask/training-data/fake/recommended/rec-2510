Once upon a time, there was a Joe's Crab Shack in Houston, Texas, that drew in the crowds by the hundreds. Well, in Texas, they know how to round them up! We stopped at our Joe's location, again, to give them a second try and once again, the place was empty. The service was hospitable, as it was the first time. This time, I didn't even bother trying their Soups, even though it was cold and it would have hit the spot. I love their Great Balls of Fire appetizer, which is Crab, Shrimp, cheese Â and jalapenos all rolled into one bursting bite. Caution should be taken when eating these, as the saliva will run. It's called the drool. factor. I make a lot of Crab Legs and Shrimp dishes at home, so when I am out, I like to try things that are more bothersome to make at home... like a Shrimp Po Boy with a remolade sauce, lettuce and tomato, on a good roll. I was quite pleased. It wasn't chintzy and was loaded with crispy fried Shrimps. I had been torn between the Po Boy and the BLT Blackened Shrimp Sliders and since hubby was not in much of a mood to care, he ordered this, which was a plate of three and we shared both the Po Boy and the Sliders. The Shrimp BLT Sliders had a good crisp bacon on them and the same remolade sauce. If I were to go back again, I would repeat this same order as both were good. Joe's Crab Shack has grown to 120 Restaurants in 28 States across this great USA. Would I run back to Joe's? No. Would I stop in, if in the area, probably! Joe, you have the right idea, but you need to up your game!. .
