Firebox! This became my favorite place to have dinner in Hartford during my business trip here! I returned for dinner many times to try their various dishes and I don't think you can go wrong with anything! I would give the food more of a 4 since i thought some of my dishes were sliiightly overcooked but i think i'm a being a little bit too picky here.
