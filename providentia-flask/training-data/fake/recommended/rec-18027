What an adorable restaurant. I love the decor. The drinks list is extensive. I had a beer from New Orleans called Abita. It was delicious. I tried the prix fixe menu it was only $20. I had pumpkin soup which was good. Jambalaya also delicious and banana bread pudding for dessert. The servers are super friendly. Loved it.
