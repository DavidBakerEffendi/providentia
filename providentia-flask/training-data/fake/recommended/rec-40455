So for starters when I walked in all I could smell was the rich aroma of truffle oil. I'm not sure if I need to go any further , but I will. I had the original burger , kept it simple, and it was perfect. The bun is soft, melts into your mouth and doesn't over power the main attraction- the meat ! I believe most of the burgers are cooked medium rare, don't you dare change a thing. They're delicious and the mushrooms and other toppings made it that much better. It's pretty good size and well worth the money ( about 10-12 for the burger ala carte ). I tried the smushed potatoes as a starter. They were ok, the sauce that came with them made them better. Just stick with a burger. You don't need much else. Do go--you'll only thank yourself later.
