This Tapas place is fantastic. The space itself is very nice. Small and intimate. The atmosphere was great. Service was great as well. But the shining star was the food. It was wonderful. They have a great menu of traditional tapas items, plus some more unique options. We tried to give ourselves a nice variety of different foods for our first visit. This trip my favorites were, the paquetitos de jamón ( one of the most delicious things I've ever tasted!!!), the patatas bravas, and the pan con tomate, which were accompanied by 3 delicious spreads. Be sure to ask for extra bread so you don't waste of drop of these. Everything else was good, but the only thing I wouldn't recommend was the fried squid special. It was nothing to write home about and definitely my least favorite of our choices. I enjoyed my wine, and the Sangria was superb. If you plan on coming in for dinner one night, be sure to call ahead for a reservation. It fills up and walk-ins will have a bit of a wait. For us it was about 40 minutes.  It's definitely worth it though.  Despite how crowded it was, the layout ensures you won't be on top of other tables and you'll still be able to enjoy some good conversation above the moderate noise level. I will absolutely be back!
