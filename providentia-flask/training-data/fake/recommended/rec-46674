The guys behind the counter are hard workers, and the sandwiches are served up quickly.  The fries are made to order, and just about perfect.  I recommend the sabich (a fried eggplant and hard-boiled egg sandwich). The place itself is dingy, and the tables never seem to get wiped. If the tables are dirty, then the kitchen is not likely to be much cleaner.
