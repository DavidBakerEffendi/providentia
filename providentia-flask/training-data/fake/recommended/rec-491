Here's the thing about Umami burger...its really just a misnomer. Something like 'umami does mildly interesting things with meat patties'. Doesn't really have the same ring to it though. Nonetheless, when you have a 'burger' that's oddly sweet from having ketchup in the burger and is served with a parmesan wafer, its not really a burger. Oh plus the meat was just not super high quality. If you want a burger, go to BLT Burger or wherever else - I don't mean to just endorse them. Heck go to Pino's (I do endorse them specifically), get some really high quality hamburger meat or buy one of their pre-made patties, and cook it yourself. That's a burger! But this is more like a somewhat interesting meat-based food item. I could see if you were really into these how one might crave a particular type of food here but its not a burger. Kind of a let-down if you think you're getting one too. Service was good, restaurant was fine. Bottle of malbec was really good for the price point. Just not a burger. Not sure if I drove that point home previously.
