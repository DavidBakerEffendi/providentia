I actually won a gift certificate in a charity raffle for this restaurant and that's what brought me here. The fact that they donated a gift certificate to a charity raffle is a plus for me! The calamari was pretty good, but their empanadas were awesome! The setting was nice, very modern, chic, and the service was good. It wasn't anything that was particularly memorable but it was a very nice experience, and I would recommend it to others for a nice time out with friends!
