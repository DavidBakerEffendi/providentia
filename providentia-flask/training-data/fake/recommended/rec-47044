i've ordered delivery at least 3 times from BXL East and recently dined in the restaurant on a sunday afternoon.  not only are the moules frites a great treat, but dessert was perfect without being over the top, and the waitresses are SO friendly!  this is rare in nyc.  they were attentive without being pushy and they seemed genuinely friendly. in addition to the moules frites, i've also tried the truffle mushroom and cheese croquettes, the croque monsieur sandwich, and the profiteroles.  everything was very good.  some highlights from each dish are as follows: truffle mushroom and cheese croquettes - for $12, we got 2 medium sized square patties that were lightly fried.  the filling tasted more like cheese than mushroom, but that was fine by me because it's rare that a dish with "truffle" in its name actually tastes like truffle and in this case, i could taste the truffle!  there was also a little side salad to make you feel a little less guilty about clogging your arteries with grease and cheese. croque monsieur sandwich - this was exactly as i had expected, but very greasy. profiteroles - amazing.  so amazing that i have no regrets or shame for having ordered these first while we waited for the unlimited moules frites special to begin (4pm on a sunday btw.)  they came served as 3 puff pastries with vanilla ice cream sandwiched in between each, chocolate sauce drizzled all over the plate and on top of the puff pastries, and slivers of almond amply covering the plate.  did i say amazing?  AMAZING. i can't wait to go back again and see how close i can get to the record of 7 pots of mussels.  for those who like to sample many different flavors, you can even choose a different broth for each pot of mussels that you attempt to devour. so glad to have this neighborhood gem.  i just hope they don't increase their prices because the area is already scarce in affordable, weeknight, and lazy weekend dining options.
