My husband and I went to this bar for dinner on a Friday night. We were drawn in by the promise of ample amounts of canned beer and an awesome selection of gourmet sandwiches. I was pleasantly surprised by the environment, and sat down to have a great Stout on draft. Upon actually looking at the canned beer selection, it was ok. Same with the draft list. Same with the menu. We ordered drinks, had the most perfect Brussel sprouts As a starter, then each if us ordered soup. For a restaurant that is known for their soup and sandwiches we were intensely underwhelmed. $7 for a portion of soup that was ridiculously small.  Not to mention, I had the cream of broccoli, and you could tell the actual broccoli was an afterthought.  Both soups were very watered down and just not great. For a main to share, we got the falafel sandwich. It was HUGE. No one person could eat this alone.  It was also ok. Best thing about the sandwich was the pickle that they served on the side- that was epic. Definitely not impressed based on the the hype they received online. Best things of the night; Brussels and pickles. Beer selection less than average. Service way less than average. If skip it and go to the POPE.
