Make sure you show up starving, because the food is just brilliant! It's all you can eat so make sure you have a ton of room to try all the different kinds of meat. I also recommennd not trying the salad bar. Don't get be wrong... It's a great salad bar... But the meat is too good. Don't waste space in your stomach! If you have extra room, try the NY Cheesecake... Excellent!
