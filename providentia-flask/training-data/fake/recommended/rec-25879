Burger lived up to my expectations. Customer experience: Front door staff a bit reserved/cool, which tends to makes me feel like I'm supposed to act fancy and unaffected as well. Dislike, but no big deal. My mom had an issue with the table (on top of waiters station), but since I'm no one special, there wasn't much to say. Michael, one of the managers/hosts, came around to check on each table during the meal, and upon hearing her dissatisfaction, sent over cake for dessert and checked on us 3 more times. He handled my mom's feedback graciously and most importantly, with appropriate humor. Two thumbs way up. Food/drink: Food was tremendous. Truly, lived up to my very high expectations. Had an excellent Sonoma Valley Cabernet as well. Get the black label burger, no question. Mom said the saffron cream sauce with the mussels was the best she has ever tasted. Dad's tuna special was cooked to perfection. Overall: Go here if this place is on your list, or if you are looking for an old school "this is why we love New York" food experience. Rating: 4 stars. One star missing because of waiter/front door staff. Waiter was a bit harried but very sweet. However, a mark of an exceptional 5 star restaurant, to me, is a staff that is totally excited to explain the food experience to you. Food is joy, so I like to get that vibe from the person serving it to me. Not really happening here, so 1 star deducted. Will be back, even if its on my own dime :)
