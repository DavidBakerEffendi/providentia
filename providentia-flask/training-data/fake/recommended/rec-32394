Visited for the first time in January. The food was out of this world, but the seating was very crowded. We were seated in the restaurant near the bar and the tables we so close to one another every time someone walked by, my chair kept getting bumped into. That's fine thought becuase the food is amazing! I had a seafood dish that was served in a pot with scallops, shrimp, fish, mussels, and an amazing sauce.  My husband had the filet mignon & shrimp that he got to cook on his own grill. We had the garlic shrimp app that was out of this world. We also had the orange sherbert & creme brulee for dessert. The sangria was ok (I've had better).  There is valet parking, so that's always a plus, too!!
