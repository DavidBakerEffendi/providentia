I've been to Room Service a few times now and I enjoy this place because of the service, the ambiance, the food, and the cheap prices.  You can get great cocktails and wines for super cheap and also tasty food (served really quickly).  The staff is really nice and the decor is awesome.  This place gets busy, but you can sit at the bar and eat the full menu as well.  I recommend the curry puffs, super tasty!
