I like margaritas. I like them more when they come in pitchers. The place is pretty chill. The guac is really good (not like El Vez good, but still really good). The only food I think I've eaten there was some sort of Â tacos. To be honest, it was after a bout of day drinking, so the details escape me, but I do remember thinking that it was good. Pretty reasonably priced, especially during happy hour. All around good. I'm pretty sure I like it better than Dos, but I'm not really sure. Oh, it does get loud sometimes. I was there on Wednesday night and it was painfully loud. Mostly because there was a large party of folks, but it was a bit much.
