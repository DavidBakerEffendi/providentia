Rogue's gallery is a cool small neighborhood bar with restaurant seating close to Rittenhouse. I live directly across the street and grab drinks there from time to time. The bartenders are great, you can play your own music on the Juke box certain nights, and the food is always awesome. Tater tots with sriracha ketchup is always a good snack. They also have outdoor seating for when its nice outside. I guess their only downfall would be is that they don't seem to really have many drink specials.
