A typical chick-fil-a, but the service was outstanding! The manager was walking around the entire time I was there- talking to customers, filling up drinks, clearing tables, etc. The rest of the staff was great as well. As I was throwing my tray out, one staff member approached me asking to refill my drink. I went during lunch hour and it wasn't too crowded, lots of available seating. Also very clean.
