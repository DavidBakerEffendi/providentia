Really disappointing.  I had been looking forward to trying this place for so long.  I have heard people say great things about it, so I don't know what went awry.  The food was bland (avoid the chicken!!!) and the servers barely paid attention to us.  The bathroom also smelled like a port-o-potty that had been peed all over. I would be disappointed by the food we ate at an inexpensive restaurant, but for the price the food was incredibly disappointing.  All I can think is that maybe they were having an off night because I can't understand how people rave about this place.
