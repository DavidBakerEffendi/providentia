Held our engagement party here and couldn't have been happier. After a long search for venues, the Counting Room (1) had lots of space and looked great inside, (2) offered us a lot of options on food/drinks, and (3) was very reasonably priced. Ruth did a great job accommodating our requests. She made sure we got everything we wanted within our budget and was on hand during the event. Drinks were great (including the house punch they made for us), food was delicious, and event went smoothly. Comfortably fit our group of 60 or so.
