I work nearby and we always order from Express.  The people are very friendly and the food is always delivered quickly.  Today I needed to stop by to pick up food while on my lunch break so I called in my order while I was on my way.  My food was literally ready in about 6 minutes.  I was greeted by a friendly face and my pick-up was seamless.  I tried the cheese wontons and they are amazing!  This place is definitely worth trying!
