This place just doesnt get enough respect. Okay okay, it's not "fine dining" but i dont think I've ever been disappointed with anything I've gotten off of their menu. They have great pizza and the town's BEST CHEESESTEAKS! I'm serious, super yummy steaks. I'm from Philly so that's one heck of a complement. The most underrated thing on their menu are their PANINIS. They are fan-freakin-tastic! Give me some extra pesto sauce on that sandwich and im in heaven.
