This is not a place for gourmet burgers or clean tables. This is a place that celebrates lo-fi. Corner Bistro is a divey, bohemian-vibing, beer-drinking-in-the-day-time, type of joint. Where the focus is on ground beef. Great huge blobs of it turned into great lo-fi burgers. The buns aren't toasted and the cheese comes in one flavor...American. All served up on a styrofoam plate. And it works. So order a McSorley's (or four) and dive into your burger. And...those of you rating this spot as a two-star: pull your head from your ass and realize where you are.
