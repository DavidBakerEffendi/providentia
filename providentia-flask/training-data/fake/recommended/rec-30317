I had very high hopes for Cookshop. I left very disappointed. My fiance and I came here for the Huevos Rancheros after reading some pretty positive brunch reviews. The dish was surprisingly bland. It's really just a skillet with beans of the bottom 3 eggs and cheese on top and some tortilla strips. Nothing special, nothing memorial. I would not recommend Cookshop for the Huevos Rancheros nor will I be returning to try anything else.
