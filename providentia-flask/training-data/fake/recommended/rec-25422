The good: The mac & cheese was awesome, waffles were good, the inside is nice, and I liked the hip hop music. The not so good: I got the 3-piece bucket and it was very mediocre. The biscuit was hard, collard greens were very tart, and the fried chicken was very greasy on the inside with a weird taste and it lacked seasoning overall. Overall, the meal just lacked balance in flavors & texture. It didn't satisfy my craving for fried chicken. I tried salvaging the chicken with the Frank's Red Hot they have, but it still wasn't appetizing. Disappointing.
