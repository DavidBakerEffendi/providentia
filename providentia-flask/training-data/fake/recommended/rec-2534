Alright, on my last day in Philly I decided I had to find time to drop by the one who started it all. Pat's King of Steaks. Yes I'm talking about cheesesteaks again. Damn I'm gonna miss them sandwiches. In my previous blog on cheesesteaks I compared Geno's steaks to Tony Luke's. Tony Luke's came out the winner. But today I went to try Pat's King of Steaks. The one and only that's been around for 70 years and always has line-ups no matter when I pass by. It's located right across from Geno's and from what the story tells they've been competing forever. Sadly, like the cola wars, it's a war of form over function. They taste exactly the same, with the same exact flat chewy rubbery tasteless bread; same greasy meat boiled tasting meat. The fries taste exactly the same. It's the same restaurant but without the culturally insulting signs. So the verdict is the same. When in Philly and you are jonesing for a cheesesteak, go for Tony Luke's.
