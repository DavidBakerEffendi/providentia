I feel like there's not much to add to these reviews, except that you should make a reservation for lunch now. Lunch is ridiculous; I have no idea why they charge so little for it. It was so much food...all delicious and nicely prepared with high quality ingredients. There were many choices, so everyone was happy; I want to go back and try the dishes I didn't get a chance to try. I had the chocolate dessert which was more like 10 different types of desserts on one plate (and this was after the pre-dessert coconut soup dish). The drink I had was delicious, and I can't say enough good things about the service. One person in our party was an hour late, and they knew I only had an hour and half (which turned into half an hour), so they did an amazing job accommodating these constraints. I can't wait to go back and have time to enjoy each dish!
