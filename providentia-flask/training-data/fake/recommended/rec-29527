Though I haven't gotten much other than beer here, Monde simply cannot be beaten for their combination of excellent selection and great prices of craft brews. The staff is extremely helpful without being pushy whatsoever. Everything is priced very fairly and is clearly marked. They also have amazing sales on 750mL bottles every now and then when they are clearing out stock. Their selection changes frequently and they highlight a good array of seasonal selections throughout the year. If you are buying individual bottles near Rittenhouse Square, Monde should be your first stop.
