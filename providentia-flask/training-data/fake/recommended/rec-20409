Great and tasty food! The staff is "on it" and attentive. I love their Mee Goreng, Kankung, Calamari, Roti Canai and Clay pot soups! Â Our favorite Malaysian spot closed in Chinatown so this spot has replaced it quite nicely. Try it out! Note that it's usually very crowded so plan ahead with a larger group.
