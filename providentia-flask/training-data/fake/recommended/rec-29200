A friend from the area recommended this place to my wife & I after a trip to the Philly Zoo.  No frills spot on the corner right across from another steak spot.  Small inside, a wraparound lunch counter or a few tables outside. Nothing to write home about.  The bottom line, you do not have to be fancy when you are making cheesesteaks this good!  Fresh soft sub roll with piled on rib-eye steak, provolone, onions & mushrooms (just my preference) with the in-house peppers that they display on the counter. The staff were friendly, attentive and made you feel at home. In fact, we met a guy from NYC whose kid lives in the neighborhood and he said he has made the place a religion.  Roxborough, you have yourself a jewel! The only down side is the size of the place and it's in a residential neighborhood, so parking may sometimes be an issue.  If you're doing take-out, no worries.  Stop in and see them.  You will not be sorry!
