There is no awning for Peaches HotHouse, only a small chalkboard by the side of the restaurant that finally gave the place away.  My bf couldn't find it and the only way I found it was because I saw the address 415 by the door.   Anyway, I was craving fried chicken and looked threw my list of bookmarks for good reviews on fried goodness. I finally decided to go to the Hothouse to try their hot fried chicken.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed.  I got the extra hot fried chicken with a side of bacon potato salad for $13.00. The server kindly advised me that the extra hot fried chicken is really hot in which I answered "I drink hot sauce."  The bf got the regular fried chicken wings and a side of fries.   Finally, the food came and it was everything my craving wanted, crispy chicken that's tasty, oily, and definitely hits the spot.  The bacon potato salad was nothing exceptional, but man their friend chicken is good.  The french fries was not on the crispy side, it was soft and salty.   And of course, I never fail to give credit when it's due.  The servers were very nice and attentive.  Bottom line, come here for the fried chicken I agree with the other yelpers.
