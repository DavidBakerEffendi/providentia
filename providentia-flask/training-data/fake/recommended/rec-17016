We were told that there was a place to get fried fish southern style. So, we took the bait. I had a fried whiting dinner with Â about 5 pieces of fish and gee whiz...we don't eat fried food at home, or out but this has to be the best fried fish i've had. My husband had the tilapia dinner. He said, the seasoning was great and he had about 5 pieces and he wouldn't talk while he ate...that's a clue. We had cole slaw, macaroni, and potato salad, and hush puppies. The sides come in what seems to be a 2 -to- 3 cup plastic tub and they are pretty good. I enjoyed the hush puppies and potato salad the most. My husband loved the cole slaw and hush puppies. We went on Friday night and it seems we will be back pretty often. They have an ATM machine inside cause they don't except any plastic only cash. It seems as if this is a family run business and this is wonderful. We will be back.
