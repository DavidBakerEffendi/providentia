Never again. I ordered from their pizzeria area not their restaurant, maybe that experience would have been better but it's too late, I will never eat here again. My wife's chicken parm was under cooked. My eggplant parm was cold and crunchy. To be fair, the potato croquets were okay but I might feel like that because everything else was so bad. With so many other bad to mediocre Italian restaurants on Staten Island, who needs this place? If you're going do Italian cuisine in an area already over-saturated with it, you better bring your A game.
