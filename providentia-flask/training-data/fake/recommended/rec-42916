I have to say that although this is a very popular brunch spot, I only give brunch 3.5 stars and 4.5 for lunch/dinner. Brunch is good Â but it's not so good I'd wait for it. The lunch menu on the other hand, is much better. The fish and chips is probably the best I've had in NY and the chicken meatball sandwich and veggie burger are to die-for. The salads are really good too. Definitely a favorite constant of ours.
