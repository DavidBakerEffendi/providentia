This place was simply great. The menu had a great selection and the prices were perfect. I ordered a chicken pita and it was only 6 bucks; 6 bucks and delicious! My meal for two costed us about $25 which was pretty darn good. There is no reason to go to any other Greek restaurant if you are close to Stamna!
