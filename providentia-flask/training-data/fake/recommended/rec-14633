What excuses can you have for denying these? It's gluten free and vegan, spicy, flavorful, crunchy, delicious and satisfying dosas! Each bite is a delectable vortex of the crispy griddle-cooked crepe-like wrap with potatoes and veggies cooked the awesome Indian way. For only SIX dollars. It even comes with a side dipping soup. You will leave nothing left in the box. My first time at NY Dosa's cart, he let me see my dosa getting cooked and filled. I recommend the pondicherry. Friendly & honest guy and an inspiration; people should be supporting grass-roots folks like him with their lunch dollars instead of spending the same amount of money on a sugary latte with a cookie.
