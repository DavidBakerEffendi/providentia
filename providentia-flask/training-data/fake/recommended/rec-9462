I was very impressed with Pio Pio. I went with a couple of friends on Sunday and was pleasantly surprised. Very cool decor, nice atmosphere, and fun menu. I had a Piscorinha at the bar, which I recommend by the way. The service was great, the hostesses were very kind in getting us a table without a reservation. The food was abundant and very good!
