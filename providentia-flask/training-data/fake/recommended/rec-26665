FIRST VISIT I WROTE: Friendly service, excellent lamb dishes. GREAT chicken kebob! Reasonable prices...only suggestion is to upgrade the pitas from the ordinary bagged ones they serve. There are the puffy ones sold in fridge section of most Middle East and Indian stores. SECOND VISIT: WOW---Did they ever FIX the pita problem. They now bake their own bread and is it terrific! Puffy, crunchy crust, heavenly taste---WAY TO GO GUYS. Can't wait to indulge again. Lamb dishes are really delicious and generous, especially for the price. With a few appetizers, one main could serve two. But this is the place for gluttony, SO ENJOY!!!
