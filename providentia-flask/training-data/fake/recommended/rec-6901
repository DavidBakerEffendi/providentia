My husband and I have been to Char 4 other nights and had a great time. Tonight unfortunately it wasn't very good, and I'm not sure I'll go back. The waitress had a bad attitude, and my fresh pea risotto was room temperature so not all that appetizing. The waitress did take it back to the kitchen, but when it came back it was watery and still luke warm. My husband's half smoked chicken with whipped potatoes and mushrooms was hot and delicious.
