Sadly, this restaurant made my day the worst. Usually, I do not review the restaurant based on their service. Food was ok. Probably a little bit expensive for brunch. Their service was terrible. I still cannot forget one staff, who is in charge of the waiting list in cafe area. She kept pretending not to understand my english because I'm Asian. She doesn't even try to understand me and treated me in a very rude way. For your reference, I have lived in the united states more than three years, and haven't had any issue communicating with other americans at all. She called a totally different name. So I didn't know it was me. When she pointed us, I said it's not my name but her answer was crazy: Â "I don't care.". It was NOT "I'm sorry". Sadly, that was not my last story while I was there. I am a little bit shocked how rude she can be. In my entire life, I haven't been treated this way. I hope that this restaurant can realize how important to discipline its staffs.
