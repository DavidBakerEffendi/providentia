Holy motherfucking crap...no, I'm not just impersonating Bourdain, but definitely reciprocating his sentiments. Freshly made pasta, and EXCELLENT sauces. My friend Chris and I went to industry night for $10 pasta plates. I got the Tagliatelle and Chris got the Tortoloni with truffle butter sauce. Both were amazing. To the point where we seriously contemplated getting another plate each, but abstained so we weren't judged as total fat asses. I couldn't choose between the two, so I will say my biggest regret of the night is not succumbing to my fatassery. Bring someone here for a cheap date on Mondays, you will probably get laid.
