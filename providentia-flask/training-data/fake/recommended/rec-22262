So I went on Sunday for brunch. I had the French toast with apples and cream filling. It was just ok, kinda too sweet and didn't see any cream filling. My friend had a mushroom omelet and loved it. They give salad instead of home fries and the only toast options were white or wheat. How can a place only have  white or wheat...not even rye?! And I want home fries not salad with my eggs. The coffee was just ok and the server wasn't terrible but wasn't overly nice either. She never told us about specials, just came took order served food and that's it.  She acted as though we had been there 100 times and should know the menu. I may go back to try a sandwich for lunch but won't be back for breakfast.
