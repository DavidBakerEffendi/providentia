I love this place! The rugged but cozy decor makes it very homy. There was an after-work crowd by the bar with a great vibe. The first impression won me over. The service was good - attentive and courteous. The food was great - 3 of us shared the artichoke and arugula salad, the special saffron and processco risotto with seafood and Prosciutto/mazzarella pizza. Everything was fresh and delicious. The salad is a small-ish serving but just enough to split for taste. The risotto was my favorite - fresh seafood in perfect sauce. The pizza crust was thin and light, seriously will not make you feel guilty for having a few extra bits! My friend did think the pizza could use a little bit more Grana. For desert (see, no guilt yet) we shared Nutella calzone which reminded us the s'more at L'asso. It has the thin and light crust like the pizza, the gooey wooey goodness of the nutella and ricotta that balances each other.  I also had an Affogato figuring I would get the espresso and desert in one  :)  And after that we were officially overstuffed, and off to shopping to walk it off. Overall it was a great place to hang out and enjoy good food.  It does get packed, so go early.
