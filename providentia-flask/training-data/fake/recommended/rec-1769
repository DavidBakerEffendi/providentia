I was just in the Philippines a couple months ago and have been craving Filipino food ever since I came back to the states. There aren't many options in NJ or PA so I was super excited when my boss (who is also Filipino) brought me here. They have lots of great baked goods, but also hot food. I got a large container of pansit which was delicious!! I also had to try the BBQ pork (on a stick) which was the best I've ever had...and finally I topped it off with a fruit cocktail in a coconut milk/coconut shavings mixture. All of it was sooo delicious. There is a Filipino market in the same plaza...check that out too!
