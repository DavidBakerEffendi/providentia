Really good place to hang out, good food and beer with a nice group of people working there.  I would suggest the off hours, gets a little annoying when it's packed.  Can't go wrong with the Fish Tacos, Burgers or other sandwiches.  During the winter try our the mulled wine.  Check out the Old City Sideshow, definitely worth checking out, get there early to get a good seat.  Also Karaoke and Trivia can be a good time.
