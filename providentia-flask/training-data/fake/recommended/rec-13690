am i going to be shot for saying...it wasnt all that? well. im saying it (as i put on a bulletproof vest). i know that there are different schools of burger making. minimal seasoning to fully experience the flavor of the meat vs. add anything and everything. i come from the latter but can appreciate the former. pros: cool vibe burgers were affordable. decent beer list cons: fries fried in bacon grease, sounds amazing...but...wasnt. ground beef found in between a bun aka the burger. i like ketchup but something MUST be missing if i have to drown a burger in it. if im in the neighborhood and feel like a burger, i'll walk a couple blocks south to the white horse.
