TIP: PACE YOURSELF... that's the trick to getting the return on your investment :P WARNING: The cheese bread, mashed potatoes, fried polenta, and caramelized bananas are TRICKS to get you full FASTER!!! Use sparingly! No wonder they're bottomless! Ensure that you take advantage of the salad bar, which has the finest ingredients ranging from sundried tomatoes, smoked salmon, aged parmesan, pickled artichokes, and roasted peppers, but DON'T go overboard despite the temptation to do so! Unless of course you're vegetarian, which then raises the question as to why you even bothered coming (stick to your carrot sticks and imitation meat, BOOM) Must keep space for all that MEAT!! :D Okay, so frankly, I think it's a WASTE of stomach real estate to get anything but the finest cuts they have available... i.e. you can SKIP out on the chicken and sausages, because they're nothing to write home about :P If you want chicken...go to POPEYES...at least then you can get your love handles on a hold of some biscuits... *jiggles* BE SURE to flip your green card for: Garlic Picanha - very tender, very fatty, and savory chunk of meat Rib eye - Mouthwateringly juicy and a slight marbling texture of the fat Lamb chops - fun to eat off the bone, good change from all that BEEF Pork Ribs - Salt crust adds to the porkiness and brings out flavor..plus, who doesn't like ribs right!?!? After every few cuts, take a breather. You can easily spend 2 hrs there and maximize your value for money. Also go for lunch $35 rather than $50 for dinner... it's the exact same thing. I would never dream of taking my date here... it becomes almost primal and barbarious eating this much meat in one sitting...I sometimes feel like a dinosaur ^^... I would also never take my kids here unless you enjoy wasting money... Meat lovers paradise... 5/5
