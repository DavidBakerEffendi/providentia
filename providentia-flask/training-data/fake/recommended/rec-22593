Stopped by for brunch the other day with the dude.  Our first time here.  I will make this short and sweet. Pros: Fair prices.  Delicious food.  Tasty bloody mary (a MUST!).  Quaint and cozy.  Friendly staff. Great ambiance. Con: limited menu. Don't get me wrong, the squash + bleu cheese polenta was amazing.  The side salad was perfect.  Would have liked more breakfast/brunch food options.  The southern girl in me appreciated the grits- the city girl LOVED the bleu cheese twist.  Definitely excited to go back here and try dinner.
