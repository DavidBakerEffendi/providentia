My favorite Indian dish is paneer tikki masala, which is what I typically get when I go to an Indian restaurant. But I'm always curious about the other dishes, wondering what deliciousness I'm missing out on by getting the same thing all the time. That leads me to my point about this place--with the vegetarian lunch special, they brought out a big platter with a salad, a dish with the tikki masala sauce (I don't know what it actually was, but it was what I wanted), an okra dish, two others, rice, naan, and a little desert. I was in awe when I saw them bring it out. The total came out to be like $10.80 or something, and it was enough food that I had to take a lot of it to go. There are a lot of Indian restaurants in the area, but I'm definitely glad I chose this place. The food was good and nicely priced, the staff was super friendly and it was very clean. It looks like a place that would have higher prices, in fact. I definitely recommend it.
