My wife is Thai. She left Thailand for nine months, and she think that the food from this restaurant reminds her of her country. I am Chinese American and I have to tell you that this restaurant is a must try if you are in the area. Signature dishes: Black sticky rice with moo-ping (grilled pork on a stick) Chicken satay Net roll Up Thai fry rice (chef special) Pad Thai woon-sen See for yourself!!!
