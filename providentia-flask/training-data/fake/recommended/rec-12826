Sotto 13 was such an awesome brunch experience! If you love brunch but you always want to taste a little bit of everything--the sweet, the savory--problem solved! This is the place! BRUNCH TAPAS! Such a genius idea! Now I can have my poached egg dish AND my french toast! GO WITH FRIENDS! Â It's fun to sample all of the different dishes like at a cocktail party. And, they're all SO DELICIOUS! GO FOR THE BOOZY BRUCH! Just $25 for unlimited cocktails for two full hours; and that's with two tappas and a side OR a pizza! Go! Have fun! You'll love it! CHEERS!
