This place has been referred to by many people as the best tapas in NYC, and I knew I had to check it out.  It is a very small and quaint restaurant, and I was able to snag a reservation for a weeknight dinner. I can't even imagine how long the wait would be if you did not have reservations.  Amongst three girls, we had the following: ensalada de alcachofa - the fried artichoke hearts makes this salad to die for patatas bravas - This is a common dish that is served at many tapas restaurants, but this one was by far the best.  I think it must be something in the aioli. pimientos estilo gernika - While my favorite shishito peppers are the ones at Ippudo, this one is a close second. almejas al vino - cockles in wine and garlic broth.  While the cockles were good, what's even better is dipping your bread in the broth. gambas al ajillo - shrimp in olive oil with garlic and chili.  It had a nice little spice to it, and was also good for dipping bread in the broth. squid ink with rice - very hearty and filling, perfectly seasoned.  As with the other two dishes above, we dipped our bread in the sauce. piquillo peppers filled with potato salad - the peppers are very small, and while it was good, nothing memorable chicken liver mousse - I was surprised that I actually enjoyed this dish.  It had a good balance between being rich in flavor without it being too heavy. sangria - i have to agree with others that they have the best sangria.  Unlike other places, it's pretty strong.  just the way i like it What made the overall experience that much more enjoyable was the service.  Our server was very knowledgeable about the items in the menu.  There wasn't one bad thing I can say about his service. 2 pitchers of sangria and the items above, we ended up spending $60 pp including tip.
