We decided to try this place despite low yelp ratings because we pass it often and it looked interesting. The end result was a very disappointing meal. I would not feed this food to my dog. The only good thing we ate decent was the sweet plantains. The salsa was a glorified marinara. The guac was essentially a mashed avocado with a few tomatoes on top. The fajita was a large bowl of peppers and onions with some pepper steak mixed in and came out cold. It was far overpriced. We also tried the mixed appetizer taste of Mexico platter. Essentially we got some frozen jalape√±o poppers that must have come out of a box. The pico de gallo was some chopped up onions with a few tomatoes thrown in. The chorizo was more or less dog food. We will definitely not be back and I would never recommend this place to anyone. If you want decent Mexican food try Senorita's in Clarke or Mojave Grill in Westfield.
