I usually don't get cravings for Greek food because I automatically think of olives and grape leaves [two of my least favorite foods]...but Kefi actually surprised me with their hearty meatball appetizer as well as refreshing salads, so if you happen to be hanging out around the Natural History Museum, def give this place a try!
