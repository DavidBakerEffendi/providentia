Honestly, the meatballs aren't bad at all. The problem is the bread. The key to a great sandwich is the bread and MMC falls very short. The rolls are bland, chewy and comparable to what you might find at WaWa. If that is your thing then you'll love this place. Personally, if they had seeded Italian rolls, they would have got a higher rating from me
