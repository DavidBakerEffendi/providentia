The burgers weren't stuffed with enough cheese and were overcooked and chewy.  The lettuce and dressing on the salad was disgusting.  The mushrooms were seasoned well and were tasty.  The buns were okay.  The fries were really good but the food took a long time.  You had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom.
