I live a few doors down from this place and stopped in for lunch with a friend after seeing it consistently packed every evening.  I wasn't disappointed, the decor is stunning and they offer a great lunch special complete with an appetizer, entree and drink.  Pad thai is my standard and I usually try that first at Thai restaurants -- it was tasty.  Can't wait to go back and try something else.
