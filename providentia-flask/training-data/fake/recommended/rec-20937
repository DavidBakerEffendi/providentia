Hands-down the BEST bagels!!!  I'm from Jersey and I've had supposedly great New York style bagels.  However, they've got nothing on Vermont.  I go to Vermont every year, and my one staple place to go is Burlington Bagel.  I've tried almost every style they make and they're all perfection.  Amazing flavor, crunchy outside, chewy inside... pair it with any of the outstanding spreads and breakfast is done.  Or get any of their sandwiches... I highly recommend the Vermonster.  Go early in the morning and get them fresh out of the oven and there's no need to toast.  I promise you won't be disappointed!
