Everything was AMAZING!!!  The wine, the atmosphere, the food!!!  Serves really good food until 2 AM.  My girlfriend and I came here for a late night dinner.  It was dimly lit with a busy loud bar and great music playing (not live), good service.  I never thought bread, cheese, and honey would be such an AMAZING appetizer.  The hazelnut gelato was very crunchy and yummy!!  I would LOVE to come back here!!
