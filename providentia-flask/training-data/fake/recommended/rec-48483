I loved this restaurant!  We were staying at the Marriott and I checked the Internet for good restaurants in Cranbury and it came up, so we went there.  The staff was wonderful.  They were all so nice and helpful and knew about food.  I'm a bit of a foodie myself and have eaten all over the world, so their answers to some of my questions proved they knew whatt they were talking about.  The homemade pasta was some of the best I've ever had including Italy.  Loved the ambience.  Very comfortable and creative.  We liked it so much, we went back the next day for lunch on their very nice outdoor patio.  Go, you won!t be disappointed!   Judi R
