This place has it's bad and good parts...but mostly good! I don't like the standing around by the stairs waiting to be seated while bus boys and waiters are passing by you and don't like the very tiny tapas(appetizers). But the atmosphere and decor completely help with those upsets. The food and drinks are very good...especially the mojitos! I totally recommend the honey dew mojitos.
