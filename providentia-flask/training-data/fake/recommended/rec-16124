Cute restaurant/concept and our service was great, however vegetarians beware!!  We went for brunch and there are extremely limited options for vegetarians and the kitchen/chef is completely unwilling to make slight tweaks or accomodations for vegetarians.  My friend and I both wanted to order the Huevos Rancheros, which looks vegetarian on the menu, but apparently meat is used in the ranchero sauce.  This is strange in itself, but even stranger, was the chef's refusal to simply remove the ranchero sauce in order to make the huevos rancheros vegetarian friendly.  We also asked about replacing the ham on the eggs benedict with spicach and were turned down (have done this at many other places without any issues!).  In the end, our only options were an omelette or something sweet (i think french toast), and as neither of us wanted something sweet, we both ordered omelettes.  On the plus side, the omelette was pretty good as far as omelettes go and they do have an unlimited drink brunch option, so we still had fun.  I won't go back for the food due to the general lack of consideration for vegetarians and special diets, but i'll go back for drinks.
