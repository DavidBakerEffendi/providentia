Decided to grab some ceviche and it's the worst ceviche I've had in my life.   I don't think I'll be returning.   Some other reviewer said that they found a fly on their food not surprised.   The reason why the ceviche was horrible was because it looked like the ceviche was kept frozen for days.  Don't come here if you're looking for true Peruvian food.  Have some respect and treat your stomach right.   El peor ceviche que e probado en mi vidal. Sinceramente, Un buen cevichero
