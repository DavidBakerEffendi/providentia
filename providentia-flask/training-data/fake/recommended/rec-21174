Very good place. Everything (and I mean everything) we tried was very good. We had BLT sliders, foie gras, scallops, guacamole, Brussels sprouts, steak tacos, duck wraps and churros. Also Apricot Tequila was great. What's wasn't great: Thai Tea Tequila wasn't really good. And they served everything with a speed of light which left an impression they wanted to get rid us out and sit other people. I'd give this place strong 4.5 stars. Definitely will be back.
