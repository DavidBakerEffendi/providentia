I am addicted to momofukus pork buns. Something about those incredibly fluffy buns with slices of fresh cucumber and fatty fatty morbidly obese go on a Jenny Craig diet pork that makes me crave them nonstop! They are so succulent and juicy and flavorful I can't get over it. I would skip the entrees and just go for two orders of pork buns (4 buns) as a meal. The spicy rice cakes are also bomb if a little salty. I usually take the leftover sauce home and mix it with extra rice cakes for round 2.
