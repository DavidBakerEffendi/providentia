Had a great time eating here while in NYC...the waitress named Tasha was great and entertaining which helps since as with the south soul food is cooked slowly...that wasn't a problem though, once we got the food all of us struggled to finish our plates because it was that much and that good...I had the Rev Al Sharpton as its called (smothered chicken breast with waffle an Mac and Cheese) excellent is all I can say...the half and half I had was great tasting but I wish i could have finished it...if ever you are near Harlem on any type of trip, make it a point to get here for good service ask for Tasha and excellent food...even the on-duty manager walked around asking of everything was ok...this place is on point
