A bad experienced that turned a relatively good restaurant upside down.On 10 17 14 there was a bug found in my brother's food & the manager totally refused to comp the bill which made an already bad situation worst.This is a restaurant close to the job that we frequent often meaning that we spend a lot of $$$ there.If I am not going to be treated accordingly,forget about the food,then guess what.I WILL NOT be patronizing your establishment anymore and I will share this experience with the masses.....FACEBOOK.....TWITTER.....LINKEDIN.....Â­You know what I mean!
