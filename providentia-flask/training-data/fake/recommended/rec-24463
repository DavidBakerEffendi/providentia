If there was ever a hibachi steakhouse that deserved 5 stars, it is this one. There is tremendous atmosphere in this place and every person who works there is a total character. If you're strictly concerned with the number of tricks the chef does, or if you're concerned about getting seated quickly, don't come here. If you want great food and like to soak a place in then there is no better hibachi. By NJ standards the sushi is very good, I typically have to go to Manhattan to find better. Hibachi-wise, I've hit the hibachi houses in every city I've visited, including the Benihana in Beverly Hills, and Izumi has the best hibachi food. The soup is absolutely the best, and the beef negamaki is awesome. If you're a true hibachi fan you should go to Izumi, drink a few sakes while you wait to be seated, prepare to elbow up next to a stranger and eat some great food.
