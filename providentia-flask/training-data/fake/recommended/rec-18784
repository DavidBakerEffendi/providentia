What a quaint little joint! Go for happy hour. Without question. A nice little wine list to choose from and you can get a fantastic taste of the best part of the menu, the tapas, at  a discount! We all win! Anything is tasty and interesting on the  'Meze menu', it's just a bite really. Notably: zucchini cake and spanakopita. We sat at the bar and made a meal from these little bites alone. But of course didn't stop there, I had the salmon main too which was just OK. It was a touch over cooked for my liking, but I guess I wasn't especially hungry anyhow. The service was good, we watched the place get busy and were still take good care of. And the owner was there getting his hands dirty, he came over the the table to take the order and chat. Love that! Also, their menu has a little recipe section worth checking out. I haven't tried any out yet but think that's so nice! Sharing means caring.
