We recently stopped by here on a whim last Saturday night and I am glad this place opened up. Â  We had the burgers - and they were delicious. The kale salad was one of the best I ever had. The help is cheerful, pleasant, and helpful - but not over bearing. I liked the fact that you ordered at the counter and they brought it to you - we don't need another restaurant with surly ironic hipster severs...more interested in showing off their ink than helping you out. If I wanted that I would go to honey's up the street. The place itself was clean and the bathrooms were clean. Way to go - I hope you remain consistent!
