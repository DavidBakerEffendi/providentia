cute little tapas restaurant.   the service was quick and the food was good.  the lamb skewers are delicious and i loved the squid ink with rice.  the patatas bravas, well, you just can't make them badly!  the octopus salad was refreshing and light.  the entire meal was enjoyable and i left feeling full but, not wanting to kill myself (which is actually pretty rare since i have greedy eyes when i order).   def try the sangria!   they need to get rid of the stool seating though.  why do tapas places do this?  even soccarat has this incredibly uncomfortable seating.
