Just had lunch here with a coworker. I thoroughly enjoyed the DORO TIBS - chicken breast sauteed with Ooions, tomato, jalapeno pepper, rosemary, exotic herbs simmered to "perfection" Â (as it says on the menu and it's true! it tastes like it's been marinated for days!) in organic Ethiopian butter and pinch of cardamom. The cardamom was just right. My lunchmate had the SHIRO (Mixed legumes prepared with ginger root, rue seed, bishops weed and garlic cooked with berbere sauce) and she really enjoyed the hint of spiciness.
