Severely underrated. I housed a chicken parm sandwich on my lunch break today (came out super fresh & hot) and continued to drink with the off duty pastry chef and the bartender, Dan, was as attentive and fun as they come. I love that Stella is so close to my office that when I have a particularly slow week or the boss is out for the week, I can indulge in a bit of liquid lunch. Great menu & variety, They were changing out their menu as I was there so they didn't have the prosecco I was wanting, but more than made up for it with delicious custom concoctions. Went alone to have a relaxing lunch at the bar and ended up makin 2 new friends. Great all around!
