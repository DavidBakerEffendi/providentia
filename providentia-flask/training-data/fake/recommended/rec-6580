Delish, delish, delish. Yes, you need to have an affinity for pork to REALLY enjoy the menu, but it rocks. Since I moved to the East Village, this has become a regular spot - I could even tell you the exact hours when there is no wait for a table of 2. Â I could... My sister was recently in town and we had the perfect meal: mortadella (not always on the menu, but as and ye shall receive - and be happy), followed by the hangar steak ssam. The thought of making the perfectly tasty little lettuce bundle makes me so excited. Plus they always have good music. Oh, and don't forget the sake.
