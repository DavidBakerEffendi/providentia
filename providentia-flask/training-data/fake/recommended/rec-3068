Affordable, classy/cute, solid food, delicious drinks. The interior was surprisingly nice, and made for a really cute date spot. I had the Tropicana salad, absolutely awesome. The chicken was so flavorful and the fruit was fresh. Loved the salty/sweet combo- nice to have an inventive, refreshing change to the usual boring salad options. Empanadas were also good with the rice and beans. Frozen Margarita with the coconut 1800 tequila was amazing, as was the mojito that came with a sugar cane in it. Overall definitely a solid place to check out if you're Â in the neighborhood or looking for some authentic margs!
