I had the traditional masala dosa. The food was quite good, though I got the coconut chutney but probably should have gotten the mango instead. The little soup that comes with the dosa is really good - very flavorful and great for dipping the dosa in. The reason for three instead of four stars is that it was a super awkward take-away meal (which maybe isn't their fault?). The dosa should be held horizontally or the filling may roll to the bottom of the bag, and the soup also has to be kept upright because the container isn't spill-proof. So, I would recommend eating in if you're going for the dosa, unless you're a professional waiter.
