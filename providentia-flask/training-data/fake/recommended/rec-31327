CALLING ALL CALAMARI lovers! This is the tastiest calamari in NYC! Dont miss this savory delight with a little bite! Very good food and delightful atmosphere. Unique Thai fusion! As a side note: i watched the head chef sample the broths she was preparing and before tasting the broth, she took a long moment to take in the aroma...very good reflection of her attitude regarding quality! Her food rocks! Great job chef! Beautiful hidden gem!
