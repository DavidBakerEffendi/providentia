This is an okay place overall and if it were not for this incident that left me frustrated, I wouldn't probably be rating it, since there is nothing remarkable about it (I prefer places with more character and individuality). I met up with a friend here who was in New York on business. Once we parted, as I sat in a cab I realized I had left my favorite umbrella (great quality, I've had it for a while) at the bar. It was raining earlier that night.  The bar was nearly empty. I called my friend who was still at the bar. He gave the umbrella to the bartender who was serving  us (she was pleasant and we tipped her generously) and told her is pick it up in the afternoon. My friend left late, around 4am. The next day at 2pm I went to the bar - they said they didn't have my umbrella and didn't even apologize for it. Once I gave them the bartender's name and all the details they told me to call or stop by later. I called later. The manager didn't even know what I was talking about. She said she'd check and call me back - she never did. In a couple of days I called again and spoke with a different manager who actually called back and said they no longer had it. I was very disappointed - although my friend left the umbrella with a specific person, the bar staff could hold on to it for less than 10 hours and the manager did nothing and showed no interest in trying to remedy the situation. I understand mistakes happen and people steal umbrellas when it rains, but a sincere apology, a proper attempt to locate my property or at least an offer for a drink, would have kept me coming back and resulted in a better review for this place.
