Really cool little bar.   The bartender was super cool and chill.  When we asked for some beer selections he was enthusiastic and helpful.  They have an awesome array of beers and won't hesitate to give you a little sample (if you're unsure of what you might like.)  I actually stopped in here because of the good reviews on yelp, and I totally concur with the rest of my fellow yelpers, this place is great.   Their menu is on the board and is veggie friendly.  I wasn't so hungry, but I did get a side of veggies that were delicious.  Everyone around me seemed to be very pleased with their food as well.  I went here in winter, but I can imagine in nice weather, this place would be the perfect vibe.   This will be a staple in my bar hopping arsenal.  If you're looking for a breath of fresh hair in S philly, stop here.  Good service, good vibes, and an all around enjoyable time.
