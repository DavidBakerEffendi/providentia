Discovered Ilili while planning a bachelorette party and think this might have to be added to my favorite NYC restaurants list (my go-tos are any Batali restaurant, Freeman's and Rayuela). Made reservations for 10 and 12 ended up showing up. Many other restaurants would have given us a hard time but Ilili was very accommodating. Service was fantastic for such an obviously popular restaurant. The hostess came and got us at the bar when our table was ready and even sat us earlier than expected (never happens!). And our server was probably one of the nicest I've ever had in the city. On to the food and drink. Started the evening with a "From Beirut with Passion" which was absolutely delicious and then moved onto the "Not So Bloody Mary" which tasted like salad in a glass. Ordered a Mezze Royale for the table which included pretty much every appetizer on the menu and a Mixed Grill. Highlights were the Brussel Sprouts and Phoenician Fries. I could eat those every day. Was so full off of the Mezze I didn't even touch the Mixed Grill so can't comment on that dish but I'm sure it was delicious. Will definitely be back and often!
