First time I went had a wonderful experience the waitress was awesome, sangria was amazing, and the platano with pernil & sourcream (plantain with pork) lt was a weird combo but tasted amazing!! Liked it so much went again and ordered the same thing.. A HUGE disappointment, every bite I took had huge chunks of pig fat in the food .. a little skeptical about going back there
