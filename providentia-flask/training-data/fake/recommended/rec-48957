This is truly one of montclair hidden gems that is making a big name for itself quickly. If  you are looking for an intimate evening and enjoy meeting new people this is the spot to visit. Everything  about this spot says trend including the owner, each time I visit this true contender of a spot takes me to a place in my head that I enjoy going. I get the feeling if Bob marly, Janice Joplin were alive this is where you could find them. The live music is amazing all the musicians are amazing and when one makes it I  look forward to saying ' I remember when" This is truly my new hang out spot.  Dimitar isn't  just the owner he's also a musician that you can have the pleasure of hearing every  Wednesday which is open mic  night. Byob with some amazing desserts.
