This place is just...sigh. Just waay to cramped. I'm not from the area and wanted to try it since it had very high reviews. Unfortunately, I didn't get the same treatment as some of the locals here. I kept getting ignored and interrupted. :( I'm not sure if the larger set man was the owner or not but who ever that was, was extremely rude. Food was bleh, nothing really special. If you are trying to have a nice quiet dinner, go somewhere else. The shouting and combined chatter of the other customers are still ringing in my ears. Sigh.
