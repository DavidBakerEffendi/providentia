all right so my friend caught wind of the whiskey king and decided we had to go check it out. we shared the tater tots, he got some weird cocktail that i tasted and didn't like but that he loved, and i got a cider and the black bean/lentil veggie burger with guac that was deeeeelicious. i would totally eat here again but i want to do all sides next time (deviled eggs? house-made cheese puffs? yes plz). definitely not AS much for vegetarians, but not completely unfriendly either. oh, and the hostess was accommodating (we strolled in at like, 7:30 on a saturday and got seated right away), and our server was super nice, efficient, and helpful. no complaints here at all about the service, and i'm ordinarily pretty bratty.
