We went to Louis expecting the best burger ever. I was disappointed. It tasted, to me, like what my Mother would have made for dinner 30 years ago. Good chop meat formed into a oval shape, served on white bread (barely toasted) with a not very ripe tomato. Boring. The burgers are done nicely to a medium rare. The potato salad is tasty. Tiny place. Long wait after ordering.
