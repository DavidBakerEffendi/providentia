It is at the best average. Nothing great in my opinion. I have tested much better tasting chicken rice in downtown New York area. The first favorite is called Haje- he stands at the corner of Broadway and Beaver street. My second favorite stands on the Broadway and Liberty street- the one with the longest line and standing in the middle sandwiched b/w 2 fruit smoothie carts.
