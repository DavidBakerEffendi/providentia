Finally tried this place after considering it a dinner option a few times. Ordered the Spaghetti and Meatball special which this evening included a taster cup side of warm bread pudding for desert added for the regular price of $9.00. Chose to try the special meatball combo of beef, pork and veal and went with a traditional tomato sauce. The overall presentation of my dish was rather nice as it included two slices of garlic toast that were quite tasty and possibly the best part of the dish. The sauce was nothing exceptional, but more than adequate. The meatballs (2) were tightly packed and hard which was a big disappointment as was their flavor. The spaghetti was actually good which helped save the meal. The bread pudding desert was actually pretty good and helped me give this place an overall average rating. For a cheap meal, under $10 it's not great, but it's not too bad either.
