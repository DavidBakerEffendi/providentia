Bijan's is a solid spot in the area, especially after Peter D has kicked you out of his apt for spilling wine on the carpet. The inside is comfortable with a few communal tables, small tables and we actually sat at a table on the elevated stage (great for people watching). The classic burger was excellent. A thick beef mix with plenty of spice, it was juicy enough that ketchup was an after thought. The lime, sumac, rosemary chicken was great as well. A perfect portion of juicy chicken, garlic mashed and some green beans. Def dragging Mr D here for some day drinking and to try more of the menu. I have a feeling I'll upping this rating a star soon.
