The extra star is for the "EFFORT" in Decor. 4 girls (like sex in the city show), Met up together for a nice Dinner. ALL this  reviews mention about the decor and service. Which I must say very impressed with all the dimmed lights and a Huge Chandelier as a centerpiece. Food came within 5 minutes after we all ordered, Pretty quick. FOOD IS AWFUL I must say. What I ordered was Shrimp Pad See Evw.  Can't screw that up, is a typical Thai Dish. SUPER disappointing! - Flat Noodles were broken in little pieces (which was hard to pick up from a chopstick). On top of that, Very Saucy and too SWEET!.  Veggies were undercooked and Should be with ONLY Chinese broccoli. Instead, They added their own vegetables.  UGH! Portions were a tad small, but the price (Under $ 10) can't go wrong. On top of that 15 minutes later, the Waiter "kinda" rushed us by picking up the plates. My friend didn't even finish her meal (she was still chewing) and asked her if she was done yet. She said NO (of course).  He walked away. After we all finished, the Waiter came back right away and cleaned the table, He "quickly" asked if we wanted dessert, we passed the Sweet part and within 2 minutes, he brought the check right away. I don't think it was a great way for us to have dinner within 30 minutes at this place. The name Room Service should change it to "Quick Service".  Very Disappointing.  Will stick with my other Thai places around the neighborhood.
