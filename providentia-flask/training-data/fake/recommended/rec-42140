So I've done takeout from here twice. The first time I did the baked pork chop with rice, and was not excited. It was undoubtedly good, but not really what I was after. The crazy part is that I was eating leftovers for two days after - which was impressive. The second takeout order (last night) was excellent. It was water spinach, mango shrimp, and the seafood with vermicelli noodles and curry. The curry was very light, but the seafood was abundant and the mango shrimp was amazing. They also threw in a soup unsure of what it was (pork, corn, carrots) that was really tasty. Again - the leftovers from this order lastest for another two meals. I think I've found my go-to chinese takeout.
