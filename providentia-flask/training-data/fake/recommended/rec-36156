Wahoo!!!  $5.50 gets you a 20 oz ice cold beverage - not a fountain drink and a delicious crepe.  Pick and choose from the menu on the menu.  I've had the veggie burger, grilled chicken and the ribs.  What a nice way to get the veggies in! I could eat here a week straight before getting bored.  Hubby had the Meat Lovers, the ribs and a couple of sweet crepes. So did my son.  We even brought others to the truck. It's that good and a great price.  Cash only.
