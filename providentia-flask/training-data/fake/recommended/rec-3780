My friend took me here when I was visiting NYC. It was a clustered looking place -- small, lots of people, not enough elbow room. Lots of things hung on the walls and the lights were dim. I sat down, looked around, and grew rather attached to the space. It felt welcoming. The food was tasty. I got lemon ricotta pancakes -- wonderfully fluffy and HUGE. It was enough for breakfast and lunch! My friend got something with sausages. I took a bite of greasy fatty salty goodness. It helped my already full stomach welcome more food. :D All in all, I would whole heartedly recommend this place!
