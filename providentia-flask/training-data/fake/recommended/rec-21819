I mentioned it before in my review, but we've since been back... 3 times and I have to say: CRISPY FISH CAKE! CRISPY FISH CAKE! CRISPY FISH CAKE! It is just so good: we fight (with smiles on our faces we do battle with our chopsticks) for the last bite of this house specialty. The chef tells me that there is no other Malayasian place in New York serving this dish, and it tastes about that special too!
