Went here last night with a group of five, figured we would try something new and Whitman and Bloom didn't disappoint. We had a variety of the drinks, both whiskey and gin which were very good, quite the change up from Artica. The food was delicious as well, the hanger steak was cooked perfectly. My only complaint would be the timing of the meals, some of our main courses came out 5-10 minuets apart but the bar tended bought us a shot in the end. Will definitely go back.
