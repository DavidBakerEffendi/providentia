Ah, the much talked about Di Fara's.  I went there in the middle of the week past 10PM at a friend's bequest and let me tell you, the wait for a slice of pizza is still incredibly long.  And it seems to be an unwritten rule that if you cut the line and get your slice of pizza first, you will be heckled and cursed at out the door. As for the pizza itself, everything is fresh and it does indeed taste good.  But I personally would've have been just as happy with a slice from Papa John's.  This place is incredibly over-hyped in my opinion. Come here if you're really into pizza or just want to see what all the hype is about.  Certainly not a place I'd recommend to go if you're not already in the area though.
