This place is fantastic. I am an ovo-lacto vegetarian so I love brunch places and Cafe Orlin is pretty close to the best place I have ever been. First off there was a line outside on Sunday at noon and we had a table for 3 adults and a baby. They have a modest outside patio but they sat us within 15 minutes because when you get inside you realize how big the restaurant really is. I had the Tunisian eggs which were great, served with excellent fresh warm pita. The breakfast potatoes were even better and nicely flavored middle eastern style. My mom had the summer corn pancakes which were just sweet enough and almost like corn bread mixed with pancakes, also very good. My wife had Diannas breakfast which was eggs served with hummus tabouli and pita which she liked as well. The food was reasonably priced ($11/entree) but the drinks were a little pricy ($4.50 for a large but not huge OJ) but if you get the Â breakfast specials OJ AND coffee/tea are included for $14.50. I'm definitely going back frequently.
