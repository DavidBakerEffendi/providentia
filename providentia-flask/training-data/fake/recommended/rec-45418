Absolutely incredible pizza like nothing else you have ever had.  I went with the new York pizza which is a bacon chicken pizza with honey mustard.  Sounds weird but honestly like nothing you have ever tasted.  Go with the small pie more then enough for yourself I choked down a medium and I say choke because 6 slices in I was too full to finish but I wasn't going to let the pizza go to waste.  Debbie was so awesome one of the nicest people you will ever meet.  The genuine kind of nice.  You don't see many people like her still around.  Back to the food though the pizza was perfect and came out super fast not more then 15 minutes to wait for a sausage sub and a medium pizza.  Eat here you honestly won't regret it and go with the new York pizza.
