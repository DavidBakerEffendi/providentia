I haven't quite made my mind up about this place. Might need to try it again. For now, it gets 3 starts: 4 for the food, 2 for service. We arrived at 12:30pm on a Saturday for brunch, and it was super packed with a lot of large groups. They told us 30mins wait. We ended up waiting for 60min. After finally sitting down, we were without menus for 15 minutes until we finally asked someone. The food took a long time to come out, which was fine... but some dishes were definitely cold. The food that came out of the kitchen all looked delicious and hot, so I'm going to assume that this was a one-off experience. So Market Table, you get 3 stars until you redeem yourself.
