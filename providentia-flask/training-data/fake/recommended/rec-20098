I would give Buttermilk five stars but unfortunately I am knocking off two for my latest experience. Over the past year I've come here three or four times. Three times for dinner, one for brunch. The dinners were all fantastic. We were seated quickly with no reservations and the service was great. The waitress was not overbearing but also very friendly and attentive. The food, was to die for--I'll keep coming back for the cheddar waffles and pecan pie sundae. Unfortunately the time I went for brunch was awful. We got there and waited at the bar for a table for about ten minutes which I didn't mind at all. The bartender was lovely. He got us something to drink while we waited and cracked jokes and conversed with us. Once we were seated however, we didn't see the waitress until TWO couples who came AFTER us had been seated, their orders taken, food served, they had eaten, and they both paid and left. We had gotten the waitress' attention twice during this period and her response was something along the lines of "I'll be back to take your order in a minute", only never to be seen again. It was just so frustrating that we left. I only wish that we had left sooner! Buttermilk, I love your food and dinner service but the brunch staff needs to get their act together!
