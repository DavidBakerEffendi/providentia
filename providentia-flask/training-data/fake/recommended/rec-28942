Awesome BYO in West Philly and probably my favorite in walking distance from campus. I've never done hookah there but they have great wall-length windows that air out the place and are beautiful. I love grabbing a bottle of wine and enjoying a glass. My go-to is the grilled veggie wrap, but I've never had anything I didn't like.
