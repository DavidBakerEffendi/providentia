My local watering hole in the closest proximity to my house- I had spent a great deal of time at KA's upon returning from Germany. An argument could be made on whether or not KA's is qualified as a 'dive bar' (not said negatively) or 'Irish pub' or even just a 'corner bar' it's all of these and none Â of them. I'm reviewing this after they have done some remodeling from a fire that happened a few weeks prior and let me tell you that any of the information below about the place being too dark has been fixed. Now that the bars are off the windows and the shudders replaced the atmosphere is bright and airy. Standard prices apply- and pretty good wings every time I stop in. Not the best but defiantly above par. If it's your first time at KA's you will get the impression that everyone knows each other- which they do... but they are open to new blood so don't be surprised if you are some interesting conversations by nights end. Defiantly a worthwhile stop for pre-gaming or an early meet up with friends.
