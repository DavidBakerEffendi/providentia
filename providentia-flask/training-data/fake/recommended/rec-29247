Italiano's has been a staple in my diet since childhood. There isn't a time I remember where summer time didn't equal daily trips to get tutti frutti or my favorite standby, vanilla with chocolate on the bottom. There is simply no comparison - anywhere! The flavors are unmatched and seriously just delicious! I was so sad last year when they decided not to open but THRILLED to see the signs up this year. I just had my first italiano's as I type (vanilla with chocolate on the bottom if you must know) and I am happy to report NOTHING has changed! Amazing place!!!
