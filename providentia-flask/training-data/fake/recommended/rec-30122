My husband and I had dinner at The Red Cat last Thursday; it was our second visit; the restaurant was packed; the hostess told me that Thursday is 'gallery night' in Chelsea - and the patrons were indeed mostly middle-class bohemian (or whatever the current expression is!) The service was good, the waiter offered a touch of eccentricity that some might find alarming; the food was excellent; my starter was a lamb tartare, unusual and deliciously tangy; my main course was duck, perfectly cooked medium rare, and wonderfully moist, accompanied by crispy wild rice. The wine list was good and varied; we chose a Gigondas, a bit young but reasonably priced. The espresso was very good for NY standards. In all a very enjoyable dinner and a restaurant we look forward to visiting again soon. Well done, Red Cat!
