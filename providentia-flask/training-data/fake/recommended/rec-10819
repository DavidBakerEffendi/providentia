The staff is friendly and fair with addressing service issues.  The miniature golf course, which my buddy and I fondly tagged as "ghetto golf" served its purpose.  The ghetto golf area smells of cat piss.  It was good to pass the time while waiting for a table.  The crab boil was good.  The house oysters were descent.  A variety of hot sauces was a nice plus.  Their fried clams basket was ample and probably was the best bang for the buck dish.  Definitely ask for the patio seating if possible.
