My favorite ramen in NYC.  Come hungry and get the extra noodles.  I'm a fan of the extra spicy ramen and always get the pork bun appetizer.  The broth is incredible and super heavy so its very filling.   Be sure to get there early and come with a small party, the wait is 30 minutes on a good day for two people.
