Brunch review only... If I was basing my review solely on the food it would get a 4 or 5.  I mean, it's actually a pretty good deal that you get a free drink with good food for only $11 or $12.  However, the server woke up on the WRONG side of the bed.  I've been a server before, so I know you have your moods.  But there are some things you just don't say unless you're charming enough to get away with it...  My friend asked, "Is your orange juice fresh squeezed?"  I knew the answer would be no and expected that simple response.  Instead she said, "Do you think we'd give away free fresh-squeezed orange juice?"  Not even a chuckly to indicate she was joking.  It was almost as if I was stuck in an awkward sitcom diner scene with the stereotypical "angry waitress." Negatives:  I don't know if it was the day or what, but the pixie-haired hostess was equally as surly as our server.  Another negative: We were seated smack-dab in the middle of the extremely narrow restaurant so our elbows were constant targets.  Yet another negative: One bathroom. Positives:  The biscuits are pretty awesome.  Free drink with entree.  All of my positives basically reflect the kitchen.  I have no complaints in that respect.   In closing, I know serving can be a pain.  But I also had a lot of fun.  When a server assumes the worst from the get-go, it's a terrible sign.
