It was tough finding a place to eat in SoHo because there are do many different places. We decided to eat here because we were in the mood for Italian. The place is pretty cool inside and we sat in the back. There's a skylight so it feels pretty open. One thing that thought was weird was that there was an hour and a half "eating limit". I guess because it was a Friday night and we didn't have a reservation? Anyway we didn't plan on staying long so that wasn't a big deal. The menu was okay, we looked around at food on other people's tables and it looked really good. I ordered the carbonara pasta and my boyfriend got the vodka pasta. We felt pretty rushed when ordering. We didn't really get to discuss if we wanted an appetizer or not before the server came back to take our order, so we just ordered entrees. The food came out really fast and it was good. It wasn't anything to yell about. I've had better pasta dishes elsewhere. The portion sizes were small based on the pricing, but then again we were in New York City so we figured that was normal. Also, they charge for refills on iced tea, which is annoying. So we each had two iced teas, four total and two entrees and it came to about $60 with the tip for the server. A little pricy but the food was good. Overall, it was a good place to grab some pasta, just a little bit pricy.
