I agree with the reviewer below.. OUTSTANDING dishes.. but prepare to pay up! portions are definitely small BUT the ingredients are TOP NOTCH. Honestly, I was more or less reluctant to go to JG for dinner based on the 3.5 star yelp rating, but my boyfriend and I are HUGE garces fans, so having faith that it would be a good experience, John convinced me to go, Â and it really was a wonderful dinner. Our top dishes: 1. Legion Lamb? (our server recommended this off-menu plate, i think she mentioned it was a special cut of lamb that Thomas Keller has dibs on and somehow Chef Garces was able to pull into his restaurant?) whatever the story was -- IT WAS THE BEST LAMB I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! juicy, rich in flavor, perfectly seasoned.. we both agree that Chef Garces knows how to do lamb! 2. Keswick Creamery Fondue: Cheesy goodness. The swiss chard was an ingenious touch and the onion jam -- yum! 3. California Organic Maitakes: A rich, creamy dish with wonderful texture. Very happy with this dish. Special mention: The Dinner Rolls -- Complementary and SOOOOOO GOOOD. Overall we were not disappointed with JG in the least. Just keep in mind that the portions tend to be smaller, which creeps up the price point in comparison to his other restaurants. But aside from that I think JG lives up to the excellence you expect from a Garces' Restaurant.
