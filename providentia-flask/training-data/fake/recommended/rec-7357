I'm a recent west coast transplant. I grew up in San Francisco and I have certain expectations for my burritos. So far, all of my NYC mexican food adventures have resulted in disappointment. But not Chavela's. I've tried most of the items on the menu and they are solid. The guac is right, the mole is tasty and the salsas are flavorful. In my opinion, they don't have a great grasp on tortas.. but everything else is delicious. As an added bonus, the staff are polite and delivery is fast!
