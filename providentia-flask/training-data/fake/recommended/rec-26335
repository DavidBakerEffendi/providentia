Unami Burger is one of those places that you know you have to try if you're in NYC.  The ingredients are a little quirky compared to normal burger ingredients but this is what makes it all the more delicious.  They're pretty big on pork and cheese- two things I cannot resist. The servers are extremely nice and welcoming, even though there's usually always going to be a wait.   Try their Caprese Argula salad.  It's a surprising twist to the traditional!  Their burgers are also super tasty, really can't complain. As for atmosphere, people kind of seem a little crowded, but its that kind of place where you feel more comfortable than not, and you can keep your conversation to your own table without overhearing someone else's.   This place may seem a little overhyped, but it's definitely a place to go!
