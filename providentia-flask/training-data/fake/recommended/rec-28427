I wanted to have my birthday at Rye's sister, Dressler...but Dressler was being a biaaaatch. They weren't keen on taking reservations for 10 so Rye's menu looked good and they were much more accommodating. Made a reservation for 7:30 2 weeks in advance with no problems...we wound up showing up 45 minutes late but they held our table and were nice about it. Our waitress was in La-La Land the whole time...she just wasn't around or helpful. Ordered some drinks, they were small and they were weak. So not a good bet for the price, around $10 for one. Split some appetizers of which all were meh...they oysters were good. The food really varied. I tried the skate which was disgustingly salty but I had lamb which was actually very tender and gamey...with juniper berries and mashed potatoes...a near perfect entree. The meatloaf was a bit gross but the short rib sammich delish....the whole ordeal was hit and miss. Dessert was a miss as well. Prices are very reasonable though. It's dark and lovely inside and there's a long crowded bar, the dining room seems too crowded though...felt like everyone was on top of each other.
