Ambiance:  It is a little weird that the restaurant is split into two separate sections with the kitchens in between.  I felt a little like I was being hidden in the backroom.  Otherwise, the ambiance is nice with simple rustic italian touches (carved wooden bowl for bread). Service:  Very good.  I may have been paranoid, but it did seem that the server was deigning himself in serving us.  While he did not create a personal connection with me and my fellow diners - he was very attentive and my water glass must have been refilled a dozen times.  Waiter was kind about explaining parts of the menu that we were not familiar with. Food:  It is true - the pizza is very good.  It is probably the best pizza that I have had in Philadelphia.  The best pizza I have ever had is from Pizza Mozza in Los Angeles - but this is a decent second place.  The wood grilled octopus was delicious on my Polpo pizza.  I understand that they leave the pieces of octopus big to maintain the beauty, but I ended up getting gigantic mouthfuls of octopus.  I would have prefered smaller pieces so that I could have it throughout my pizza and I could savor the flavor better.  The wild hare ragu with parpadelle was delicious.  The sweetbreads were delish! Overall:  I would definitely come here again for the food.  But, I would keep in mind that the waitstaff and restaurant has a bit of a hoity character.
