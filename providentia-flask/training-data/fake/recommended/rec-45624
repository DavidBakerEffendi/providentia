I feel sad to give one of my favorite restaurants a bad mark.  I used to  love this restaurant.  We went to breakfast there this morning and I did not feel the love.  Service is so important to me.  I love feeling welcomed and special.  (isn't that why we pay a little extra?)  My water was not refilled -- nor my coffee.  I had to ask.  I had to track down the waiter to get them to take my credit card.  This should not happen at the Fountain.   There are too many other good restaurants with great service for me to go to.
