LOVE BUFAD! I probably go here, on average, once a week :) Â I lived a few blocks away and Bufad (and Prohibition) are where we take people who are in town visiting. I've only had the pizza here (Rossa, Potato, Rapini, Pannocchia, Salsicca, and Beet when it was a special), and they are all AMAZING. Staff is great and BYO is a nice bonus. Never have room for dessert but it looks good!
