Visited New York on NYE weekend 2010...had a blast. Yelp some late night meals and found this place..we were at first intimidated by the 3 money sign, but it was really not too bad. The location is great, took the train and walked there within 30 seconds. The host and waiters were friendly, mildly slow on taking orders for a small place but it was quite busy..so it didn't bother me. The vibe of the restaurant was great, a little dimmed but enough to not eat with my nose. We had the bone marrow dish that everyone are so craze about! and yeah it was pretty unique! good experience indeed. I ordered a half of chilled lobster and New Orleans shrimps....wow, it was good! they were some fresh sea food! Â I was really happy with my meal and definitely enjoyed the place. It would have been 5 star if the place was just a little bit bigger because my chair legs were consistently kicked while eating haha. No biggie!
