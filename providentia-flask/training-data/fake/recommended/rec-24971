Don't forget to bring your wine, beer, or alcoholic beverage because it's byob. Â The food was fresh and delicious. Had the lobster and couldn't stop eating it while trying to take the meat out of the shell. The fresh oysters, clams casino, and everything else we ordered (a lot of sides) was perfectly cooked and didn't last long on our table. Service was quick and nice. Only sad part is the run out of food quick bc it is all fresh and brought in that day.
