This place is so good! Definitely recommend it! Go hungry though, portions are huge.   The pasta is always delicious, homeade, and super HOT. I've never had the pizza, but I've also heard good things about the sandwhiches.   The sauces are great and they use real garlic cloves. Cute place too! So Prineton-y.
