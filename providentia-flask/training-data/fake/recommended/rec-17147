Hello Everyone, I am not Cuban, however, I have been coming here on and off for a few years. The food is great and the service follows suit. I enjoy eating the Steak and Carne con Papas as a main course; the tapas are excellent also and my favorites being the chicken, shrimp and the pernil con tostones. The dishes a reasonably priced considering the location of the establishment and quantity of food. The place is well decorated and you can tell that a lot Â of thought went into it. I read several reviewes on here regarding the loudness of the music and all i can say is that its been like that since i have been coming here and its part of the ambiance and the Caribbean experience. There are 3 dining areas and I encourage you too try all 3 during your visits and enjoy the view. Regards, Peter
