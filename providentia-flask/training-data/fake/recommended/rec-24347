While burgers aren't the most romantic Valentine's Day dinner, after a mixup of reservations, the bf and I ended up at this cute little BYO burger joint. Despite being quite late, the place was still happening and we were seated right away. We both immediately acknowledged the local art on the walls, which gave the small dining area a unique vibe. Our servers were extremely nice, making recommendations across the menu and we settled on splitting the mussels, with a truffle burger for me and the BBQ rib sandwich for him. As soon as the mussels came out, we knew we had made the right decision. Piled eight inches high, the mussels were soaked in just the right amount of butter, white wine, and minced garlic. Even when the mussels and garlic bread were gone, we needed spoons to drink the remaining broth. My truffle burger was also a delightful surprise. Cooked just way I like it (medium rare), the burger exploded with juice upon biting. I got a slice of Gouda cheese with it, which provided a great smoky, creamy contrast to the beef. The accompanying spicy fries had the perfect amount of crisp without being too oily. All-in-all, a solid dish. Even though it wasn't what we were looking for, Juniper was a pleasant surprise that wouldn't have happened if we had stuck with our original plan.
