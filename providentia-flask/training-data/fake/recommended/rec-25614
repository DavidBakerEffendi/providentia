Best Greek food you're going to get in NJ. My family visits this place frequently for special occasions. When you first sit at your table, they'll serve you pita bread w/ oil for dipping & olives. My personal favorite dish is the arni kokkonisto, which is orzo pasta with lamb. The lemon potatoes are incredible as well. You should all definitely visit this place, or their Little Falls location.
