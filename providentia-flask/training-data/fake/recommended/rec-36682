Had brunch there yesterday with a friend and it totally surpassed my expectations. Compared to the original Cafe Gitane in Nolita which I already liked very much, the new and improved version offers a better and more original menu, a wonderfully decorated colonial dining room reminiscent of Casablanca circa 1940 , bright, airy, understated and un-stuffy, which is a real accomplishment with this style, and zero attitude. You really can't go wrong. Located in The Jane hotel at the old American Seaman's Friend Society Sailors' Home and Institute, the building itself is a gem so take your time, walk around, lounge in the salon and ask to see a room.
