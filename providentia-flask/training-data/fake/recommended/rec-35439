it was a horribly humid, disgusting, rainy and hot day in the city. Yosh H. had his birthday party there and i was dreading this place would be small and cramped. no way! you walk in... and there's a huge bar awaiting in the short distance, many family style tables, booths, etc. the fact that they only have ONE bathroom for the ladies- was a disappointment. you would expect this pub/restaurant to provide a bathroom with a few stalls. so, a thumbs down for that. the service is attentive and accommodating. they didn't bother us when we brought boxes upon boxes of desserts and treats for Yosh. we spent a couple hours there... the water was constantly refilled, we were never pressured to order anything and felt comfortable. every Monday they have a $20 all you can eat mussels with frites special. i think it also comes with a beer. what a deal! =)
