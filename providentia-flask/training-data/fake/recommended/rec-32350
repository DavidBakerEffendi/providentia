My boyfriend and I went here last night and as always I left feeling happy, drunk, and well fed. This is definitly my favorite bar in the city.  One of the few that has a quadrouple on tap and sells it by the pitcher! The staff here  are ridiculously nice and really know their beers! If you simply cant decide from the 500+ amazing belgian beers on the menu, just ask and im sure anyone  who works there can give you a decent reccomendation. The dinner menu is as equally tantelizing,  I ordered the lavander chicken and remembered why I recently started eating polutry again after a 10 year hiatus (Such a good idea).  You definitly can not go wrong here no matter what you get! ( unless of course its a bud light, but really when does that ever taste good)? FYI: I suggest not driving here because more than likely you will be to drunk to remember where you parked the car.
