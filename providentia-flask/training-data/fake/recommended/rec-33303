The staff is extremely friendly. In fact, the place seemed to be full of regular customers, likely neighborhood locals, especially for a Friday night. Small spot, dimly lit by candles with a fun Moroccan decor. Think a Casablanca-esque, colonized North African vibe. For example, there are like 5 rows (x5) of different sized, vintage tea pots lit-up on display behind the bar. The walls have small rugs pinned to them high up, or large, old advertisements. Prices are on the cusp of three-$'s, but then again, the two of us were quite full. We split the Spicy Carrots, Fried Artichoke, Sabicha, and the Chicken Tagine (in order of best to worst). The Tagine was a bit of a miss, not quite enough flavor given the description/ingredients. Also, I'm not accustomed to couscous being served like that, in an almost soup-y way. Definitely a keeper for "Mediterranean" food in the neighborhood.
