As many said here, me and my friend waited quite a long time to be seated, but you know, this is what happens usually in that spot, no complaints about it. We had some cappuccino, nice and strong. Â My friend ordered some pasta and I ordered the baked eggs, firmly requesting I'd like them medium. The eggs came really rare. Like REALLY. My waitress was passing by my table and pretending she couldn't see us calling her. I tried to talk to the girl that was serving us water, but she said only the waitress could take it back to the kitchen. After 5 minutes, my date had to grab the waitress or she would never come. When my eggs came back, completely burnt and dry, she literally threw the plate in front of me. Didn't even look at my face or said anything. I felt really bad, that was not only bad service, I was treated badly as a person. I'm never coming back there again and would never recommend the place for friends. Shame!
