I'm really handsome. Also, this place is highly...traditional, provided you are of the opinion that it is traditionally American to be rude, impatient, and resistant to change. The cheese-steak itself was really nothing outstanding, particularly in light of two things: 1. I was heavily intoxicated when I tried this place, and still was not impressed. Almost any food impresses me while drunk, even the offerings of the honorable Chef Boyardee. 2. I'm convinced that the average person could make more appealing cheese steaks in the comfort of their own homes. This also provides the advantage of avoiding the staff. Although the steak itself was not outstanding, I will admit that the overall dingy and filthy appearance and vibe of this place both made quite an impression. The hot sauce was fairly powerful, as well. Geno's is a fine counter-argument to anyone of the opinion that you must have the.."Experience" anywhere.
