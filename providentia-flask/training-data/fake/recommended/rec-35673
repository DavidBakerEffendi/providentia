I came here with clients and absolutely loved it.  We had the chef's tasting menu, which was a great way to sample across the menu, and everything was great.  They even worked with us to find gluten free items for one of our guests without changing the menu too much.   In addition to the food, the space was really nice.  Dark and warm.   Next time I'm in Philadelphia for longer than a meeting, I'm going to insist on coming back.
