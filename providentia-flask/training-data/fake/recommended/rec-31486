Excellent food here and a very friendly staff. I took my girlfriend here right before I left for job training in Chicago for a month and this was very memorable. I got the seafood pasta dish which was delicious and a very generous plate. The seating was the only difficult element of the evening, we took an undesirable table right next to the kitchen in order to minimize our wait time even though we had made a reservation in advance, this was supposed to be a temporary arrangement. However, they more than made up for it when they were unable to relocate us to a better table by giving us a delicious dessert on the house. This place is definitely among the top BYOB's in the city.
