Who can pass up a place built around bacon, but it's really probably just a novelty one time stop. The food was good, but not memorable, they ran out of veggie bacon for my cousins girlfriend, you really can't wait for a table inside as there's no room around the bar, and they don't have the NFL package so we were forced to watch terrible games.
