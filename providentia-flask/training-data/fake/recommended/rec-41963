I am not often in Princeton, but when I am, I make a point of going to Gennaro's. The service is fantastic, the ambiance is great, and the food is out of this world. The owner, Gennaro, is almost always there, and he makes a point of meandering around the dining room and striking up conversation with his guests. Because of this, you are made to feel like family, even if you do not know Gennaro personally. This is the type of treatment that builds a loyal following, and it is clear that Gennaro's has one. The menu offers a variety of salads, appetizers, pastas, and entrees, and they are priced very reasonably. Two of my favorites are the greens Gennaro (sauteed with olive oil, garlic, prosciutto and hot peppers, and topped with grated cheese) and the bronzino. I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu, though. And it's BYOB, which is a plus for lots of people, as it keeps the overall costs down and allows guests to bring their own favorite beverages. In regards to the review below about pizza, Gennaro's doesn't have pizza on their menu, and as far as I know they do not serve it. Perhaps this reviewer confused it with another restaurant by the same name...? At any rate, if you are in the Princeton area and in the mood for a delicious Italian meal, I highly recommend stopping at Gennaro's!
