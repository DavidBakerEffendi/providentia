I only stopped in for a few beers one day, but I remember every detail of this place! It can get quite crowded, so beware (or go early!). I was only on the lower level, but the bartenders were really knowledgeable and friendly and the dining-in tables were packed to capacity and had beautiful food (from what I could tell from the bar). I'm looking forward to going back and trying the food. I liked what I saw from just the beer selection and service! Prices were reasonable and had a mix of patrons from young to old, tattooed and pierced to Philly fanatics. Just a great atmosphere!
