Went on a Tuesday night last minute dinner around 9:15pm. Was able to get a reservation for that time. The place was packed, small and the seats were crammed together. But, we didn't care!! I loved it!! It all just worked along with the noise, good service and delicious food. Definitely trying this spot again.
