Not impressed. Meat was dry, bread was cold, the provolone cheese didn't melt. What a letdown. I guess I should have gone for the cheese whiz, but really, that's beside the point. Couldn't they make a simple10-second effort to melt the cheese with the steak on the griddle? Also, couldn't they have toasted the bread? Put it on the griddle for a few seconds to get warm, or god-forbid, get toasty? I have no idea how that chopped up crap they call "steak" is passable to put in a sandwich and charge you $7.50 for a plain cheesesteak. And it was overly greasy. They're also a bunch of jerks, wanting you to use some cut-up version of English to order. Great way to make your customers feel like a jackass.
