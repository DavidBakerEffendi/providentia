I was around the west village early in the morning looking for a good place to brunch that would have descent prices, not overloaded with a crowd & that has perfect menu options. This place was a hidden gem. The pancakes are supposedly the customers favorite.. I didn't order the pancakes but someone sitting behind me did & they looked incredible!! They are definitely on my list of must-have orders for my next visit : ) My bf and I shared the egg salmon Benedict. It was amazing. We also had the chai tea & the GoGreen juice. We didn't have to wait to be seated & the waiter was very fast putting in the order & getting us the check when we were ready to go. I will 100% be coming Â back here again!
