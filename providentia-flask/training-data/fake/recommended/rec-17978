My husband and I have dined in some of the BEST restaurants in the world and the Peacock Inn is in our TOP 3 places to eat. I don't understand how ANYONE can give this fine restaurant a bad review. The ones who have, either mistakenly reviewed this restaurant thinking it was another place or just have NO CLUE what gourmet cuisine is! The portions are appropriately sized and we always leave feeling plenty FULL. The dishes are all very creative and delicious. You eat with your eyes first, and every dish is mouth watering beautifully presented. The Salmon En Croute, is a MUST. The desserts are all delectable! The staff are all very attentive without "hovering" and are extremely friendly, especially the manager Chris who is always a delight.
