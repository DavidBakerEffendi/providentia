Visiting in May. On the outside the place looks like a country diner but on the inside they were trying to be a high end restaurant, but they fell short, very short. Our experience started with them refusing to seat us in the upper deck despite having asked.  The host did not offer a high chair or booster seat for our toddler. We had to retrieve that ourselves. The host returned to pour water, we asked if they had a children's menu he said yes, "I will get it" then left like he was going to bring it but never returned. Then after asking for out drink order the waitress proceeded to clean off a table, seat another table, pour them water, take another tables order then bring us our drinks. We then asked again for the children's menu which after about five minutes we received. The menu selection was limited and all the kid's meals were nearly $9.00 not including a $2.50 drink. We placed our order which also took a long time to receive. The food was alright but not worth the price.   There were four adults at our table and one toddler.  Since we were a table of five which I think is questionable, we were charged an automatic 20% gratuity for the horrible service we received. Would not recommend or return.
