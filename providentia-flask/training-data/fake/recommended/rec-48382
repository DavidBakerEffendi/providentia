wow!!!! finally a place in ny that is cool, amazing food, great atmosphere without offensive prices and pretentious wait & bar staff.  honestly, my wife and i didn't know what to expect, but we were blown away: the quality, the taste and the very friendly and soulful service.  the paprika tomato soup is a must have, the side lentils was the best lentil anything we ever had. and the cheese crepes was beautiful. I'm a native ny'er whose been away for away, traveling overseas, and have been very disappointed coming back to a lot of the restaurants. Steinhof is an exception, this place will become a regular.  my wife and i had a beautiful feast for such a great price... worth every penny. our only regret is that we didn't find this place sooner.
