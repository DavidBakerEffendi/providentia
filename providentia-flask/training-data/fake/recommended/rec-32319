i love this place and i haven't even had a burger here yet. i came in yesterday afternoon, when i was tooling around on my bike and getting hungry. i was feeling healthy, so i wasn't prepared to eat an enormous and amazing-looking burger, as tempted as i was by all the gorgeous options. i ordered one of the specials instead, the grilled eggplant salad, and it was delicious. smoky but bright, with mint and cilantro in the dressing. the woman who served me was clearly the owner, and she was incredibly friendly and in high spirits. even as i was eating the salad i was planning my trip to come back for burgers. i can't wait.
