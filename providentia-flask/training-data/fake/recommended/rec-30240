Delicious! Excellent spicy kimchi (my favorite) and the bibimbap was really tasty. Would definitely suggest the chicken or pork, the spicy is great. The beef is good but not as flavorful since it isn't spicy. The service is a tad abrupt but they don't rush you and the food comes quickly. Really loved the food itself, would definitely return.
