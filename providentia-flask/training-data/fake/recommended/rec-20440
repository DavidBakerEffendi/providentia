Smoked meats + whiskey = Jesus, if He were a hillbilly.  Which he is.   Appetizers are It: bacon, cheese curds, the lamb thing (forgive me, I spent an hour at the bar before sitting down to eat); steak was tiptop, and their house-made sausages are smoketastically good.  And butter pecan ice cream with bourbon topping was the belt-popping sucker punch that did me like Ned Beatty in "Deliverance".   The whole thing was like mainlining melted butter and the whiskey selection is, frankly, insane.  Do we need that much whiskey in the world?  Probably, yes, but just looking at the wall behind the bar gave me a headache and made me dread what's next: A fancy gulash emporium with 200 different types of slivovitz?     Crazy busy on a Saturday (most days, actually), but I imagine that will pass.
