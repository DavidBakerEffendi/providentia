I have been here several times, it's one of the best BYOs in the Caldwell area.  It's a lot of fun to come with friends/family and try all the different options on the menu.  Everything I've had has been excellent, my favorites are the kale salad, spicy potatoes, skirt steak, and short ribs.  For dessert you can't go wrong with any of the options.  Great place, check it out!
