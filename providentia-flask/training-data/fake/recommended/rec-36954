Okay I don't have much to offer but I can talk about price. I'm from L.A. so if I feel it's cheap there, it means things're really very reasonably priced. We only had wine and seafood plateau there cuz we needed to go somewhere for main and another place for dessert. It's fun. I like it so crowded in Balthazar, so old, so busy, so direct and vibrant. I wish I could have stayed longer. They said there's an hour wait when we first go there and that was a weekday evening, but then somebody knew somebody so we got a small table in minutes. Thank God. Come on I'll never wait for anything for an hour. We had only oysters and clams. The oysters were excellent! I loved them! We only got the Malpeque so I'm curious about the other two? The wine selection there was so good too. Made me a very very happy gal. ;-)
