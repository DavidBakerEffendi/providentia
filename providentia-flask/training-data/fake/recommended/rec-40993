Wow this is a tough one. I LOVE the people I've met there, behind the bar. I was WAITING for this place to open, but damn. The two things I've ordered, on two separate occassions, were DRY. Dry bbq. Just--- no. Chicken on the bone, the bone was moister. BBQ smoke chicken sandwich, dry. At the very least, no enough sauce. The flavor of what I got was great, but the overcooking is just a fail. Two stars because the bbq tastes good and the guys I met were awesome. Otherwise one star for services SLOWER THAN MOLASSES and overcooked food. Sorry guys.
