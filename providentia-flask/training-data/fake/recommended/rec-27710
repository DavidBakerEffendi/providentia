I've been here a couple of times for lunch, and I'm not thrilled, but it's not bad.  $15 for an assorted sushi/sashimi lunch special w/ 4 pcs of sushi, 7 pcs of sashimi, a california roll, miso soup and salad isn't bad.  Unfortunately, the salad was mostly pale iceberg lettuce with some mediocre carrot-ginger dressing. The soft shell crab special is nothing to write home about.  It was also a little disconcerting to ask for nigori and be told that she didn't know what it was/don't have any. It wasn't until it was described as the "white sake" instead of the clear one that she was able to point one out. Came back the next day and think some of the fish was left over from the day before.  Both days I was the only person in the house, neither of which is a good sign.
