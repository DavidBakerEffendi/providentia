Have eaten here twice in the last month after re-discovering this place.  Both times had a margarita pizza for the appetizer.  Excellent pizza with super thin, crispy crust.  One person had pasta both times -- both excellent.  The one with chicken in a garlic & oil sauce was amazing.  The hangar steak on the menu is also excellent.  Veal picatta is very good.  Only criticism was the mushroom risotto which came as a side.  Not creamy at all, more like rice than risotto.  Service is friendly and efficient.  Desserts were excellent - recommend the tiramisu and the crème brulee.
