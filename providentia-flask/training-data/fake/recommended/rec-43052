I went to this place last year and I liked it A LOT - it didn't scare me away by being "too New York" like some other places did (i.e. high priced, and packed full of modelizers). The food was AMAZING - I had some kind of monkfish/steamed clam combo that was perfect, and the specialty drink list had so much good stuff on it, I could have stayed a LOT longer and tried them all! Can't quite remember what I had - something with vodka and Tahitian vanilla and it was yummy. Anyway, even though I only spent 48 hours in NY, West Village was by far my favorite area - and this place (along with Magnolia Bakery) cemented the deal.
