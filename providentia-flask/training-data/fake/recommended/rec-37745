I have been to Shahnawaz Grill several times.  When ever I'm in the area I make it a point to stop.  They have both menu items and a buffet.  Their prices are very reasonable and you get a great value for your dollar.  The food and the service are excellent.   However, the meal is never quite finished until I get my Halwa.  It's by far my favorite dessert.
