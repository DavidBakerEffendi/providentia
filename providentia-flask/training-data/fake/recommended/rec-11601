I think that the reason why this place is so popular on Yelp (2000 reviews and 4 stars) is that it's one of the few restaurants around the Brooklyn Bridge vicinity and that you definitely bump into it if you crossed the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan.  Also, the greeter at the front warmly greets and welcomes people here.   The pizza was just meh here, nothing extraordinary however.  Looked very family style and the tables were all squished together to fit maximum capacity.   Had to shift the table and such when someone wanted to go to the bathroom.   Also, the way this place works it that they serve the basic pizza but they don't have any special pizza.  Rather, you pay for each of the toppings you want on it and they're $2 each or $4 for speciality items.  But a large pizza is $10 and it's sharable amongst three people at least so price wise, it wasn't that bad. The worst part of the meal was when we were trying to pay the check with a credit card and the waiter serving us rudely clapped his hands and yelled, "cash only!"  Geez buddy, sorry didn't know.  That guy did not get a tip.   Don't think I would return here and would instead make an effort to find another restaurant even if it is a longer walk.
