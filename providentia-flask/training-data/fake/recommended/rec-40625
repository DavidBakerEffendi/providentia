Quickly becoming my favorite starr restaurant. Amazing new vegetarian options. Cheese "hold the beef" burger and tofu wings are the best options for comfort food in the city (even my friends who eat meat have ordered and loved them!) Love the new fall cocktails and super friendly staff, too. Looking forward to going back.
