Definitely the best place in New Haven, hands down. There are 3 different sections. 1 section is a club dance floor, 1 is a casual type bar with pool, and 1 is a pub type atmosphere with tables. I HIGHLY recommend their pizza. It is absolutely amazing!! They are very reasonably priced, and there is parking right across the street that is also fairly reasonable. There is almost no reason to leave this place as it is almost always busy. Their cover is usually $6, which is really fair for what you get. Their pizza isn't expensive and you can get a pitcher of their home brew for about $15. The bartenders in the front have a ton of class, sometimes in the back they can kind of be sort of pushy, but mostly because they are rushed. The dance floor isn't spectacular but it is big enough for most nights and they allow you to dance on the stage. Overall I give it the best rating for New Haven and has everything you would want in a club/bar.
