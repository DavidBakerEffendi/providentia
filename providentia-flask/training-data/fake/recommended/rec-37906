I have to give Jose Pistola's the credit it's due after a befuddled friend of mine didn't know how they were able to get the sought after Pliny the Elder on tap. Here's the scoop: Yes, it might be on oddly laid out mexican joint/sports bar sharing the street with establishments like McGlinchey's, Fox and Hound and Applebee's but don't hold that against them. No, they're not the hot date spot to take your fancy new lady but they are one hell of a place to celebrate a Phillies post season win. It's the place you go to meet for happy hour, to watch a sports game or to hang out with friends and order some good food and relax. The nachos, as previously reviewed, are out of this world. The half portion proved to be enough for two people as a full on meal. All of the food here is very good, and not in the way people call Mexican food good. It's actually full of flavor, not just a catalyst for sour cream, cheese and beans. The guac is fresh and delicious, the meats are perfectly seasoned. They have daily specials so take note when you stop in. Last let's talk beer. Jose Pistola's hasn't been getting the clout on the beer scene that Hawthorne's or even Misconduct do. Their rotating draft list is world class, this being proven by their tapping a Pliny recently. The bottle selection is extensive but unpretentious. In a city full of beer snobs this place can pull their weight.
