Incredible High quality straight forward Texas BBQ. It's that simple. Not a Whiskey drinker really but the bourbons, rye etc are crazy available and they have a microbrewed rootbeer made by philadelphia brewing company that hands down rules and is better nowhere near me so I don't load up on the sugar. I see how some people have bad things to say in some respects: many people don't understand Texas style....many people look for that thick glaze sauce.... it has been salty.... the sides are nothing to be missed, soo good. It is just a little over priced for what you get to a degree. I understand the cost of producing this, but these guys have the ability to to charge a little more and supe it up and draw a crowd just on the name alone. For the price, I guess I would still buy it over anyother place since it's good. Sweet Lucy's used to be the best- they slipped as they grew...that simple. Â Since thye are only marginally better value I guess I would park and get a little less for my money and enjoy it more at Percy. GET THE PORK BELLY!!!!!!!!!!
