Very pleased - went here on the suggestion of a Sheraton Hotel Staff member, had the ravioli, which is made with a spinach dough - so it has a different texture than typical pasta, however it was great, it was stuffed with four cheese and mushroom and then there was a great white wine sauce - was very pleased.
