This is by FAR the best Mexican food in the New Haven area. $6 gets you anything on the menu and it is delicious. The portions are HUGE and they are more than happy to make custom dishes if you have allergies or food restrictions. The lunch cart on York st is also amazing and you get the same dishes for $5! The veggie tacos are great and you get 3 with sides of rice and beans, and the burritos are huge.
