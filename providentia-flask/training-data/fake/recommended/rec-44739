Quaint little place near Bleecker street and it does not disappoint with its food. Me and my husband went there for a lunch around 1 pm and had made a prior reservation although they did seem to accept walk-ins as well. The atmosphere is cool and relaxed though the space is a little cramped. For starters we ordered the Green Beans and let me tell you, the sauce that they are served in is to die for!!! We then followed it up with a Bacon Cheese Burger for myself and the Braised Italian Pork Bun for my better half. Mine was nice although both of us felt that the burger was a little too wet for our taste (i'm guessing it was downed with an aioli oil of some sorts). I liked the patty  and the soft bun it was encased in and on the whole the dish was well seasoned but i do wish that they served it with caramelized onions. The meatball sliders on the table next to ours looked good too.  I'd be back to taste more of their fare. Recommended to whoever is in the area for grub. Do try their drinks off their menu as well. Is it good enough for a date night? I'd say so...just make sure that you get the better tables though. If you're more of a huge crowd person, this is NOT the place for you. Die-hard romantics, walk in for the old world charm, cozy atmosphere.... Bon Appetite folks!!
