Awesome, awesome, awesome!  A+!  I don't know if they sold their souls in exchange for their recipes or what, but WOW are their treats delicious!  I'd eat their wonderful concoctions even if I didn't have a crazy assortment of food allergies! Basically they do primarily Gluten & Dairy-Free stuff.  They are VERY sensitive to food allergies and will help you to no end.  They are really fantastic, it's great to find a place where they actually care about people with food allergies!  It's really wonderful to be able to have a treat and not have to worry about reading the ingredients or having a bad reaction to something. Everything is great - their cookies, their truffles, their brownies, their cupcakes.  Oh man.  Just fabulous.  I've recommend this place to friends with allergies and they come from all over Connecticut.  I'm extremely happy that they opened a shop exclusively for people with allergies, I just can't say that enough!  Whole Foods is okay, but they have nothing on this shop!  You have to try their fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies when they come out of the oven, even my non-dairy-allergy friends & family eat them! The items are on the pricey side, but it's a niche product as well as something of a gourmet bakery (at least to my taste buds!), so it's understandable.  A bag of cookies runs about $13 I believe - high, but if you have food allergies, I'm sure you'll agree it's worth paying for to get "safe" treats.  Pain-free goodies, YAY!  Their pizza is pretty tasty too! (available with and without cheese - it's even good without cheese!).
