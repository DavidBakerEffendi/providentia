Tia Pol is very wonderful in small ways...other than the big wait. Our party of four arrived at 6:30 and was told it would be a 45 minute wait.  This turned into an hour wait and we were finally seated after an hour and 10 minutes.  Other than that, this restaurant is great for small groups.  The tapas is absolutely amazing and tasty as was the pitcher of sangria.  We ordered the spicy rough cut potatoes (so good that we ordered a second round afterwards), the sherry chorizo (again, second round), the skirt steak special, monk fish cheek special, the tomacat trio dip with baguettes, and ham croquettes. All were delicious -- recommendations are the croquettes, chorizo and potatoes.. as evident by our second orders.  The wine list is long and obviously Spanish themed.  The bartender and waiter were attentive as could be.   The space is romantic and dark, perfect for date night.  There is a room in the back of the restaurant with two long bench tables if for larger parties but other than that, most of the tables are 2 or 3 tops.  Ensure you come early to avoid the wait!  Just come hungry.
