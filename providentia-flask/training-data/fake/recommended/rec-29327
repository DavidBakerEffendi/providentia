I usually patronize Tony's Pizza City in Wyndmoor but we were on Henry Ave and were hungry so instead of Fiesta 2 or 3, whatever, up the street we decided to try D'Alessandro's to see if all of the raves were accurate.  Not so much.   Tipoff #1, we had no sooner given our order than the mushroom cheesesteaks came out.  Tipoff #2, chopped-up or sintered meat.  Finer grind than hamburger.  Basically beef mush.  Not much taste - how could there be when the meat had been cooked how long before?  Steam table cheesesteak - yum?  But the St Pauli was nice and cold. I'll take Tony's in Wyndmoor -- or even Fiesta 2 or 3, whatever, up the street any day over this place.
