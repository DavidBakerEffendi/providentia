I'm quite disappointed in their changes to the menu. Sushi and all related items were removed from the menu. So was Duck Confit and some additional items. I asked about removal of sushi and very detailed answer followed from someone who I presume is a manager. Details were appreciated but not quite necessary. Possibly I posed a question in a way that called for profit margin analysis. Quite possible. Sangria is served with ice slush-interesting but not really sangria to me. Burger we have ordered came with a charred patty. I'm not sure I would expected well done to be so charred. Onion soup itself delicious, however cheese/bread cap too tough to chew. Chechen liver pate was far too frozen when served. It was quite hard to spread. Raw oysters were fresh and delicious. Oyster sauces/toppings went very well with them. Bronzino was well grilled and very fresh. I'm satisfied with it. Service a bit neurotic from both the waiter and the manager. It seems later night shift staff is far more chill than evening. It took a while to get the check. I'm not sure I'm coming back to Blue Ribbon anymore. Things I like aren't on the menu anymore. You just can't take Uni sushi off the menu and expect me to be happy, but they did.
