I've been going to Bagel Train since they opened, a while back. I think these bagels are now #1 in the area (since Bagel Junction in Newtown recently closed). I love the everything bagels, and their wheat everythings are decent as well. The light veggie cream cheese is packed with veggies and delicious. Breakfast sandwiches are very tasty and filling. Bagels are light and chewy. I love this place! A heads-up: they only take cash - no credit/debit cards, so make sure you come prepared. There's a Wawa down the street and a couple of banks.
