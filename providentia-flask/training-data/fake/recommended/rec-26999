This place is an okay late night hang out. Good beer. Ok Service. Ok menu. It's not a "must-go" in Burlington VT. If you ARE a beer-snob, then have a blast on the samplers. They'll feed you a HUGE selection, and you won't go home mad. The prices are excellent, but this is not the place for a first date or business meeting. You want to go with someone who doesn't need to be impressed - bring friends or family that love to drink a ton of beer and it won't bankrupt you. When school is in session - it's a huge college crowd. But Summers are easy breezy and the staff has always been very nice.
