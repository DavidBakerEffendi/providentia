I just love this place!!! The crepes are absolutely delicious (and HUGE!!), and the service is perfect! If you like to try a sweet crepe follow my advice and try the Fred's crepe (catalogue#13 if I am not mistaken), the combination of fruits nutella and cheesecake creme is to die for. CAUTION - sweet temptation DO NOT TRY THIS BY YOURSELF - DIET HAZARD ! ! ! share with a friend :-)
