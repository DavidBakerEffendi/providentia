Went here for lunch with my parents when they came to visit.  We enjoyed their lunch special, $17 for a salad and trio pasta sampler, which is unlimited.  The restaurant is cozy and service is on par.  Caesar salad was great and the pasta was ok.  It seemed like they cook it in big batches for this lunch special, and therefore isn't the freshest.  Some of mine was cold.  I would like to go next time and try an entree instead of the pasta special.
