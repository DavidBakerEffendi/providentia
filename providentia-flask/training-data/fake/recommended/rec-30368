Service was excellent. However the food was okay. Ordered the Penne con Melanzane (eggplant) and the Mezzi Rigatoni alla Ragu. Pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. Loved the penne con melanzane but was overwhelmed with too much cheese. Mezzi Rigatoni alla Ragu didn't have basil in it which is supposed to have. Would come back again for the Penne con Melanzane and to try out other dishes.
