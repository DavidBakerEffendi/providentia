beyond amazing taste! the sushi is SOO GOOD and I don't even miss the fish! The staff is also lovely! However...I am a little worried about their cleanliness... with food storage in the basement and i noticed the chefs leaving the work area with gloves on and not changing... and some small things not worth mentioning. I will keep going here and enjoying it until the sanitation grade comes out SO PLEASE .... beyond sushi ppl.... keep it clean! the food is TOO good :)
