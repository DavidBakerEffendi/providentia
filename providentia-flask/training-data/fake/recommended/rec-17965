If you're looking for a nice and quiet cocktail Happy Hour time with your girlfriend on a Friday evening, then Ivy is NOT the place. When I stepped inside around 6PM, this place was shoulder-shoulder PACKED- it was so loud I had to scream at my friend, who was standing right next to me. I want to return to Ivy on a Monday night and see why Yelpers love it here!
