This is a very nice looking restaurant.  The inside screams swank and chic. I came here with my boo as one of our first restaurants when dining out here. They had no problem sitting our group of 4 down with a bunch of random strangers.  This happened twice.  Once as we sat down at the long table behind the chandelier - a group was already seated there.  The second time happened as the other group got up and a new group sat down right next to us.  It wasn't that bad, I'd prefer that over having to wait. The food I thought was alright.  I wasn't wowed by it, and then again I wasn't repulsed either.  With so many thai options on this street, I wouldn't come back until I've tried them all.
