I came here for lunch just because it had outdoor seating and I could keep an eye on my bike. I will go back for dinner because I really enjoyed the food and service. There are two types of crepes - savory and sweet. The savory crepes are made of buckwheat and the sweet ones are made of wheat. I had one of each at lunch even though I was full after my first (savory) crepe and had a long ride ahead of me. Beau Monde offers a savory and sweet crepe in every price range, from reasonable (6 bucks) to ridiculous (20 bucks). The crepes come out square, which was interesting, and scrumptious. What arrives on the plate from the waiter looks underwhelming, but one bite opens up the delight on the inside. The only downside is how hard the crepes are to share because they're so floppy and creamy. And, speaking of creamy, Beau Monde uses real Chantilly creme on their sweets. Just dreamy!
