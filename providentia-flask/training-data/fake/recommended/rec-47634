My wife and I had our rehearsal dinner for our wedding at BAR on October 25th and what an awesome choice! As much I love pizza (of course I do, I'm from New Haven) I was still a little apprehensive about having our wedding rehearsal dinner at a pizza place, but BAR made it a pizza party with class! It was clean, elegantly decorated, beautifully lit, service was exceptional, and the pizza of course, was amazing. Â Our family and friends were all treated very well and were incredibly pleased with our choice of venue for the dinner, as were we. The staff always checked with me to make sure we were taken care of, needed anything, and just to make sure we were having a great night, which we did. It was a great choice, I'd do it again in a heartbeat. Thanks for an awesome and memorable night BAR! Special thank you to Kate, Jen, and Erica for an incredible job and service that night and to Danielle for helping putting everything together!
