Nice brunch spot! The brioche french toast is AMAZING and it came with bananas, strawberries, and blueberries which I saw as a bonus. I didn't get a cocktail but my friends' drinks looked really good...they don't kid around with the bloody marys. This place was also shockingly empty for a Saturday morning. There's nice outdoor seating, and street parking was easy to find.
