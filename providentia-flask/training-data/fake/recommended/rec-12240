Went there Friday with friends for dinner.  The food was fantastic.  There are so many restaurants on Ferry street that aren't good, so that is what I thought I was in store for.  Great surprise.  The service was great, very accomodating.  We had the broiled chorizo first-amazing, as well as the garlic shrimp-standard issue but very good.  The complimentary salad, bread, and olives were a nice touch, and delicious.  I had the chicken with garlic sauce which was awesome--enough for 3 people! Next time i will share with someone.  My friends had the steak which was huge and delicious. Only con is the red sangria is horrible, don't get it.   Can't wait to go back!!
