Always great service and quality food. The pizzas are by far the best deal on the menu but everything I've had has been very good. Only thing to watch for is getting the specials. The unusually taste great but the price is not special...apps usually 15 plus and entree easily 20. One would expect the special to not be the most expensive thing you order, Â only reason I don't give it 5 stars.
