This is Â a solid 2 star place. If you make a reservations expect to wait 45 minutes to an hour anyway and add an extra 30 mins to whatever estimate the hostess gives you. The drink selection is good, beer I'd say is 4 stars, mixed drinks 3 stars, food 3 1/2 stars. The food menu is really good, but strange there's a wait because most of the people waiting are barely legal chicks that don't actually eat- kind of a waste of table space. If you complain about the wait they'll comp a drink or an appetizer, but after waiting over an hour you may not even give a sh$t. I wouldn't ever go back, not worth it.
