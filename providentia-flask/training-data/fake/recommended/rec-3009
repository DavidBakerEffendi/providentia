Great sushi lunch place (I haven't been for dinner). It doesn't look like much--its a small place with no hint of the over-the-top-steve-starr-esque decor you find in some old city establishments. So if you're looking for a scene, go elsewhere. But if what you want is tasty, not overpriced, sushi then zento is great.
