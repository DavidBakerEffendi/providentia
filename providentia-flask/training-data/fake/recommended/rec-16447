2 words: MONSTER. TORTAS. My chicken torta was spicy (win!) and huge enough that I did not feel bad forking over ~$9 for it. It was filled to the brim with chicken (duh) guacamole, jalape√±os, and pickled onions! The salsa music and the fun colored Jarritos posters on the wall make this a great place to go to by yourself (aka reading your twitter feed) or with a couple of friends before going out (to Jake's Dilemma nearby!)
