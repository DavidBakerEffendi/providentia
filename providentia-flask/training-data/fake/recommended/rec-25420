To my surprise the FOOD was amazing !Me being 100% Jamaican , I know REAl Jamaican food when I see it/smell it/ taste it. The ambiance was chill. went with my sister.She had the oxtails and I had the jerk chicken .Both were delish ! The plantains were done to the tee rice & pease were done well , only problem was I needed more rice to go with the heavy portion of meat. The owner was very polite :) Â so were the cooks . Big plus was the fact that you get full service . No alcoholic drinks tho. Price is right $$
