I'm a Nuyorican married to a man from Ponce PR, and my parents were born in Aibonito PR and Santurce PR.  We walked into Surrender Cafe, and it was like walking into my abuelita's kitchen!  Between us we had the 360 platter appetizer, the pernil asado, bistec encebollado, churrasco a la parilla, and canoas rellenas...DELICIOUS.  We skipped dessert because we were all happily full, but we each ended the meal with a cup of cafe Bustelo.  Everything was declicious and served with a smile.  It was a Sunday and the place was packed so the service was a little slow, but I'm not complaining.  And it's a BYOB, making it a real bargain!
