Had plans to head to 5 Guys for a burger today and ended up pulling into Mooyah Burger since we had heard it was as good as 5 Guys and Jake's Way Back. Should have wondered why at 11:00 am on a Saturday there where only 3 people eating. I had the cheeseburger combo and my wife the regular burger combo. She did ask about the bean burger and was told it was one of the Morning Star black bean. We get those. I like them a lot but they missed the boat by not having there own homemade bean burger. That would be worth 5 bucks or more if they get a good recipe. Really liked the way they served the food on that nice big tray with lots of room to eat your lunch. Awesome idea. Fries where good, but to me not as good as 5 Guy's. The burger was very dissapointing. Neither of us liked the dry bun and tasteless burger. No one else came in the whole time we where eating. The two guys working where great. Very nice and took care of us. No complaints. We won't be back but I wish them all the luck. 5 Guys have set the bar pretty high.
