Unbelievably packed, not worth all the hub-bub, but certainly tasty. I recommend you wait till the attention dies down. Loved the idea of design-your-own ice cream sandwiches for dessert. Veggie meatball I got was odd - I'm not sure it was veggie, may have been a mistake. If it WAS veggie, it was remarkably pork-like. So I guess that's good, right? ;) Terrific beer and wine selection and they have Depression-Era beer servings (ie, smaller glasses for $3 and $5 if you don't need a full pint)... I ate at this place alone, after suddenly realizing I was in the neighborhood and was curious. The waitress in my section completely ignored me -- allowing one of the busboys to take my order and deliver most of my meal -- until near the end of my meal at which point she got really, really attentive and friendly. I TRULY DESPISE SERVERS WHO DO THIS. But I'm not going to blame the kitchen. I will go back, but never alone.
