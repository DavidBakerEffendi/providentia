Let me start off by saying I love yelp, but in a selfish way. Selfish in that I use it daily, and take all the advice, suggestions and comments to heart...but do not contribute my own. I love food and I love restaurants, but I can honestly say my experience at this restaurant was by far, the worst I have ever had. I recently went for my friend's birthday. To be fair, we were a large party and most of the food was brought out with no issue. However, the birthday girl did not receive her food until after we mentioned it to our servers several times and after we were all done with our own meals. Furthermore, after we asked to speak with the manager because the food had taken so long, the owner had the audacity to verbally assault my friend and I several times. Not only was he disrespectful to just us and the kitchen staff, but he made a conscious effort to come to our large party and accost us at our own dinner twice. To the point where a couple of the guys tried to pacify the situation, but to no avail. It's upsetting to me that this is what it took for me to contribute to the awesome yelp community...but I want everyone to take this into consideration before visiting this place. If I could give negative stars I would.
