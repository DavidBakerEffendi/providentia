Get the calamari dish!  I dare say that it is the best calamari dish that you will ever have.  It's all about the special sauces. I also find the staff to be incredibly fun and funny.  The decor is fairly simple and classic, but the place exudes personality and the vibe is great.  I also like little touches like the supremely clean bathroom with the nice candle.  It sounds dumb, but it's a great touch.  Anyway, one of my favorite places anywhere.
