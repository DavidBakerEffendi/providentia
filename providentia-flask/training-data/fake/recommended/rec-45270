One side of my family traces their American roots back to Kearny. My father tells me stories about how this area of Kearny Ave used to be littered with delicious Fish & Chip Shops from the local Scott/Irish population. The area has seen some of these shops disappear, but thankfully this gem is still around. The hospitality at this place is the first thing that stands out, and is quite literally friendlier than any restaurant this side of the Atlantic. I have been here twice and got the Fish and Chips both times. Malt Vinegar, crispy chips and flakey cod make for a out of this world experience. It really brings you back to the old country. Don't forget the gift shop. I got a cadbury crunch bar post meal, which is only available in Europe and it was the best candy bar I have ever eaten. HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!
