Sidebar: The ambience in this restaurant was perfect and fit well except for the music. It would be perfect if the music fit. My boyfriend and I came here after being denied the lottery to see Kinky Boots. Greatest denial option ever. We actually did the prix fixe menu and if you do it as well, you won't regret it at all. I had the beef skewers where the beef was wrapped around sugarcane and was DELISH!! Next up was the pad thai shrimp and was that a big dish of tastiness with the shrimp, bok choy, sprouts, noodles, egg and fish all wrapped up into a lovely bowl presentation. So filling, so comfort foodie, although it left me no room for my apple cake that was also a big piece of heaven although I could not finish it. My boyfriend had the coconut curry miso soup for an appy and I thought that was ok and then another cocunut curry dish for dinner with the same as I for dessert. We both agreed mine had the better flavor!!
