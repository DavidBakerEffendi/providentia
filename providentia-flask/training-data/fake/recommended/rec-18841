Maybe I'm not used to the taste of a cheese steak... Don't judge me for this. I ain't Aretha Franklin, but I have to give RESPECT to any business that has been around for decades. That being said, I would have to go back a few more times to find something that will make me sing to the heavens. From what I read from the internet (I solemnly believe everything I read) this place does a bang up job with a philly cheese (hands down) of course I had to find out if the stories were true so off we went. The staff is great, they are wonderful, fun, and generous. The building has a charm to it that includes wooden benches, and pictures along the back wall boasting the history through black and whites.. I honestly had the most fun ordering my food, as I didn't realize cheese wiz may be the secret ingredient. Taking the first bite, I imagined something more moist and flavorful. The beef was literally just that, it didn't have too much flavor so I added salt and pepper.. then pickles...banana pepper... hot peppers, and finally ranch and ketchup. *still no judging!* I know (in my heart of hearts) this is a really great sandwich, personally I can't get down with dry beef ;) However, you don't have years and years of clientele that are exactly alike, and still manage to remain consistent with what you serve. People change, but here the products do not and that in itself is amazing. Abner's leaves me feeling like there is something for everyone! What more is there to truly ask for in the city of Brotherly Love...
