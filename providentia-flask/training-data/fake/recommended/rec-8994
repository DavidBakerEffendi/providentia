I'm not going to fall out of line with the overall average rating for this place!  I love their coffee and unfortunately tried the iced latte (vs. the iced coffee) and I can't go back!  It is super strong and wakes me up in the morning.   I have had their sandwiches and don't understand why people say this place is expensive!  It is super cheap and huge portions.   I would have given 5 stars but they aren't open on Sundays (when i want 30 iced lattes) and cash only.
