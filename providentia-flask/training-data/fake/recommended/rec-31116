Horray for In Riva bringing some life to East Falls!! Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere, great service, score. Â Do not miss out on the caprese salad or tuna (whachamacallit). I look forward to taking a stroll down kelly drive and hanging on the outdoor patio come spring, and trying everything else on the menu.
