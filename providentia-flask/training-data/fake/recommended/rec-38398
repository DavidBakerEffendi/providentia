Thanks to Yelp we found out about this gastronomic delight serendipitously looking for someplace to eat in New Haven. Â If you are within 30 miles of Sandra's, go! Order anything and everything like we did. I guarantee you'll love it or I will come eat it for you! Blackened tilapia (thickest, sweetest piece of tilapia I've ever been served), BBQ chicken, chopped BBQ turkey with a kick, collard greens that I could eat everyday, fried okra so lightly breaded and tender, plantains I wanted to order again for dessert, plus homemade Mac & cheese the best I've ever had. And get one of their specialty drinks -- special lemonade or special green tea. You won't have had any like it before. We even stuffed in a piece of banana pudding cake (actually not that banana-y or pudding-y but still moist and delicious). Miguel is one of Sandra's sons and treated us like family, as did the other staff. You will leave wishing Sandra was your mother too!
