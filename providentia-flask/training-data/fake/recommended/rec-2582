Give me Whiz or give me death. After walking around the stomping grounds of our nations forefathers, hubby and I went to the intersection where Geno's and Pat's duke it out daily, Â with ongoing rivalry for the best sandwich. Let me just say, fellow Americans, that Pat's took my breath away in more ways than one. The cheese! The cheese! Let us stand and rejoice! Who would have thought that Cheese Whiz would be such an integral part of a Philly cheese steak sandwich? I would have honestly never tried it, but a coworker of mine swore up and down that this fake cheese was better than the viewing of the Liberty Bell itself... and she was right. Deliciousness rang, folks, loud and clear above the lines of hungry patrons, looking to free their tired, their weary, and their huddled taste buds. This is the stop for the best. Geno's? Yeah, they may have signs that diss people who can't fluently speak English... But you know what my momma said? When you can't say nuthin' nice, you shouldn't say nuthin' at all. Relying on bad manners for media coverage is a travesty, and when you have a great sammie across the street at Pat's.. well, I guess you gotta do something to make yourself well known.
