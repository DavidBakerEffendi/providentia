Tony's was very busy when we arrived for our 6:00 pre-theatre reservation; however, my sister and I only waited a few minutes to be seated, and with the personalized, friendly service from our waiter, Ryan, we almost felt like we were the only ones in the restaurant. We ordered the special, Parmesan-encrusted chicken breast, potatoes, and white beans. The food came out very quickly, and the chicken was moist, the potatoes were delightfully crunchy on the outside but tender inside, and the beans balanced the flavors. I especially liked that the dish wasn't too salty or garlicky; the savory flavor of the chicken came through. Throughout the meal, our water glasses were always filled, and Ryan even took a few minutes to talk with us. The only disadvantage was the portions; they were actually too large for our party of two, and we felt a bit guilty leaving so much food uneaten. I think the dish would have been better suited for a group of 3 or 4.
