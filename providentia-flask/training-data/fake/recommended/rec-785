We came here for dinner on a weeknight at about 8:30PM.  It was crowded; however, most of the crowd was at the bar.  We were seated immediately for our party of two. Our server was nice; however, appeared rushed and she only came back once during our meal.   The food was good; however, it did not stand apart from any other typical pub food, and in fact, I thought I had much better at other places I have been. We ordered the Alfie's Burger and the Brat Sandwich and split them.  Again, we thought they were good; however, did not exceed expectations. With all of the choices in NYC, we would go back again if someone else wanted; however, would bypass for another choice next time.
