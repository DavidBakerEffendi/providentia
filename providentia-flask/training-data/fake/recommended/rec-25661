New and Clean! Such a treat in relation to normal nasty dirty midtown lunch spots. Good selections: -Tossed salad bar (just need to add croutons, good ones, IMO) -Mixed bag-o-treats hot/cold/FRESH gourmet offerings middle of venue (nice plates-- yes that makes a differnece to me) -Japanese noddles (Ramen & udon, etc) highly recommend the spicy chicken Soba [buckwheat noodles -Pasta station -Sandwich and panini station- best wraps in midtown - Sushi (still wont get sushi anywhere in midtown- but pre-prepped rolls don't Â look horrible) - Whole pantry of healthy snacks (yay- for working late) - Bibimbap (seriously- awesome) - more beverages than you could possibly know what to do with-- and GREAT ones- very eclectic ice teas Really nice and quick service. Nice friendly smiling people (also a nice change for midtown). Not bad for 50 ft from my office.
