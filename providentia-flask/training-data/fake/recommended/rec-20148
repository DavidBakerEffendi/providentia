The first time I came here, it was a Friday. I was to meet a few friends for drinks to start our adventure for the evening. It was pretty humid night, and we just so happened to grab the only seats left open. Which was at the front entrance, with no AC but the hot blast of air that came in every time someone opened the door. It was ok, I didn't mind too much once I had my rye and beer. The d√©cor is clean and modern, Cool overhead lighting, whiskeys lining the bar wall and even more so below in the drawers. The place was busy, but not loud. On another occasion, I had just went to do some light shopping on a Sunday afternoon and walked in to grabbed some brunch. The bloody mary was amazing, the chipotle bourbon gives it a smoky spicy kick. I asked for a suggestion comparable to a benedict and the bartender had me order Char no. 4 biscuits benedict, with house smoked ham, poached eggs & bacon gravy. Everything tasted great, seasoning was perfect, and the biscuit was awesome, but it was just way too big of a portion for me to finish. But overall I really enjoyed my meal. I need to come back for dinner.
