I discovered this place about a month ago and i've probably been here over 10 times now. I go for lunch all the time. Its in the middle of nowhere and its usually empty. Everything is good. One of my faves is the cold buckweat noodles extra spicy. If you order hand pulled noodles, you get to watch someone pull the noodles out in front of you -- sweet. And its cheap as can be. Probably the best deal in Brooklyn i can think of.
