**3 stars for the food plus an extra star for beautiful barmaids** What can I say? I am a sucker for good looking people. Put a cutie in front of me, and I turn into silly putty. Oh yea, stretch me anyway you like. Oh wait, I'm getting this review mixed up with a yoga place review. Or am I? After seeing Chinglish courtesy of yelp, we were pretty hungry. I mean, we sat through dinnertime with only wine (out of a sippy cup basically) to keep the appetite at bay. We walk over to 9th Ave., and this was the first Thai place we stumbled on. I didn't catch the name, and my friend couldn't remember it. This is what happens when you get two fishes together. I was immediately mesmerized by the decor. It is quite impressive. Everything is dark with a gothy vibe to it, but also a very classy, sexy twist to it. Just my kind of place. Candles everywhere and also a massive chandelier encased in glass in the middle of the dining room. There was also a small Buddha statue in the corner. Wait, but can I tell you about the drop dead gorgeous Thai barmaids? Oh my god. I have died and gone to Thai heaven. Tall, trim, fancy updos and beautiful, beautiful shoulders. I think we gawked for a good few seconds before sitting down. My friend had already experienced this in the past. In fact, he told he was drooling for the first 30 minutes when he first came here. Service was pretty quick here. I asked them to make me a "spicy" drink and indeed, they delivered. Tamarind on the rim was a good touch. I found myself licking all of it. But the drink was too sweet, so after that, I just switched to a martini. My friend ordered the pad ee sew with veggie duck and he ate all of it, so I assume it was good. I had a tom yum soup and a green papaya salad. Sad to say, both were decent, but not mind blowing. It's quite OK if the food is just mediocre, because the place and the barmaids were gorgeous. God, I can be so superficial at times...
