Peaches HotHouse is pretty good for a southern style comfort food brunch. It is very small inside so it's not really great for large groups although I happened to go with a bunch of people. I had a pretty simple meal with scrambled eggs and cheese and sausage. Very good. I tried a few bites of my friend's fried chicken and while it was crispy and juicy, it was way too spicy for me. This brunch was good but nothing about it blew me away.
