All I have to say is that VPB is nothing more than a train wreck. Well hell you would get better service AT a train wreck. And hell eating a dead body might even taste better than their food. Just do your self a favor if you see this place...Just keep on walking. First of of all we got here for a Birthday dinner for a friend around 9pm on a Saturday night. The crowd was small and to be honest it wasn't to busy. So we thought "Perfect!". The host here was pretty nice and sat us inside as we requested. We all sat down and ordered drinks, food and apps. I got a class of cold apple cider. Only for it to be served to me and I tasted it and it tasted OLD. It was pretty nasty. So I changed it to a root beer. Who what? Same thing. They mix their own sodas and it was again just bad. My girlfriends lemonade was noting more than a glorified lemon water. Huge waste of $1.99 per drink. The food was also just plain bad. Poppers came out over cooked my wrap was missing its cheese and some of the veggies I ordered. The girlfriends BLT was cold and damp from sitting to long. So over all the food was nasty and we left hungry. Our waitress never came over to see how we were doing. But she was happy to give us our bill. We had not been rude in any shape or form. Not sure how they manage to stay open. The service is god awful and we will not be returning anytime soon. This is a place I can not even recommend for its beer. Just do your self a favor a go else where. Never thought I'd say this....But the chains are way better than VPB.
