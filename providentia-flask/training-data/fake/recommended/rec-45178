Food:  Pretty good.  I prefer a good cheeseburger and fries. Beer:  Great.  Excellent micro-brews. Location:  Right in the heart of it all, not too far from the shopping, the Wyndham Hotel, and the bars. As an out-of-towner VPB is one place that I know that I can count on getting a decent bite to eat when I am in town.
