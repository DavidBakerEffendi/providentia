All of his Tamil food is so good that you don't have to know that most of it is vegan (lassis aren't a traditional Tamil drink, and they are what hold up the menu from being entirely vegan).  (Pro-tip: Most Tamil food naturally falls in the vegan category.)  Thiru makes everything on the spot.  And he remembers all of his customers (and he has a lot of regulars).  He has offered a viably edible vegan option to the NYU / E. Village area, and his faithful vegetarian & vegan clientele have gotten him to become vegan too.
