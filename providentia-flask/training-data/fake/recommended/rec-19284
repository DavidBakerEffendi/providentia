I've been here twice. The last time, I tried the Shio vegetarian ramen. It's a bit overpriced for what it is ($12+)--but it's ramen, so it's still super affordable. It is lacking in vegetables--but overall it's warm and tasty. I think there is a need for better ramen bars in Philly though, because this isn't anything spectacular. I'm surprised people give it such a high rating. The ramen is not something I'd travel out of my way to taste. If it wasn't a few blocks from my apartment, I'd skip it altogether. However, the day I went was cold and the warm ramen was very satiating. I will try the pork bellies next time I go. Â  Cash only.
