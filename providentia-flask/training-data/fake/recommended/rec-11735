Definitely had one of the best Lobster rolls I have ever had before at Red Hook Lobster Pound.  The lobster is deliciously fresh and the sandwich,albeit small, left me quite full.  Order at the counter and then your lobster is served to your indoor picnic table next door.   They have several sides including mac-n-cheese, potato salad, and cole slaw.  The sides were all tasty but did not compare to the delicious lobster.   This place is not cheap so you will be paying a hefty price tag for lobster, but every once in a while this is definitely worth it.
