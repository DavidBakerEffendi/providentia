Gleaner's is probably one of the closest coffee houses to my place and is, for me, its biggest asset. I realllly want to love this place--great location, cool decor, etc. However, nothing I've ordered has ever been that good (or that bad, to be fair). They are vegan-friendly and have gluten free peanut butter pie, and I love a good socially-conscious business! Unfortunately, that pie wasn't good, but I doubt they make it. All this would be okay except that I often feel rushed or judged when I go. Seems like everyone already knows each other and they definitely make that known! I'll go back if I just want coffee/chai/tea from a place that's close, but probably not otherwise.
