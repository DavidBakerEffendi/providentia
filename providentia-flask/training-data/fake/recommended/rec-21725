As tapas goes I don't think it gets much better than this place Great ambiance, try to get a seat at the bar, you wont want to leave . So lets go through the menu ...what haven't I tried here ...my personal favorites are; Liver mouse on toast Lamb skewers Artichoke and white asparagus salad. Scallops with Brussels and Bacon . Potato bravas , the aioli Â and paprika is amazing . Shrimp gambas, with bread to dip on the side. The prices are very reasonable when compared to Salinas round the corner which will cost you an arm and a leg and still leave you hungry . The staff are very friendly and always attentive with zero attitude. Tip- check out the specials board . Try the pigs ears if you fancy something different. they don't take reservations , so grab a sangria and order some fried chick peas while you wait ...
