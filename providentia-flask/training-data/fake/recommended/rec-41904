I am slowly working myself through the entire menu. The sandwiches are heaping piles of flavor. You cannot go wrong with any of their sandwich offerings. The pork is unbelievably tender, and the brisket is flavorful. Both benefit from a hearty Sarcones roll. Do not forget to order a portion of the potatoes, then plan a nap for the remainder of your afternoon.
