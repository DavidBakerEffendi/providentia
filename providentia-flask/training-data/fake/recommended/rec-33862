I have been going to the Marrakesh since 1979 or 80 while growing up in Center City.  My last trip was last week on July 12th this year.     It is great  to see some of the Philadelphia 1970s restaurant rennaisance establishments still going strong (Others include Fri,Sat,Sun; Warsaw Cafe; Astral Plane).   Marrakesh is currently celebrating it 30th year.   Kim P's  9/21/2006 review was great (and the pictures of her are gorgeous!); and I am glad she and her group had a great time.  One question she raised was the lack of wine selection.  I am wondering if they charged her for the wine since they are currently giving it away in celebration of the 30th year.  Free wine is just one of the ways the Marrakesh shows you they care about their customers.  They don't have a liquor license.    They are happy to give you free wine and they are happy to let you BYO.   While much of the Philly's Center City dining scene seems to be a reflection of places in New York with weeks long waiting lists and rediculous prices, Marrakesh is a happy reminder for me of now defunct places like Freddy's Pizza (which became JJs Grotto)  Pagganos in U of P (the Paggano special rocked) that I liked gorwing up.  Just remember.. cash only; dinner is about $25 per person..and that includes the free wine!
