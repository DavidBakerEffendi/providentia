11 pm tonight, looking for something to munch on, and found myself on St Mark's Pl tonight heading to Xi'an noodles but since they're closed, stumbled upon Five Tacos after looking on yelp, for nearby cheap eats. Man I was pleasantly surprised with the place. No one was in there and I was able to ask the guy what was good. He ended up recommending the spicy chorizo and beef taco. The tacos were a pretty good size for about $4 each plus a buck for guac on one. It was sloppy and tasty and downright fantastic until I put some slightly spicy masala sauce on it. I was hooked (my mouth is watering now thinking about it.) I cannot wait until I find myself in the east village again because i'm definitely heading back to get more food from here.
