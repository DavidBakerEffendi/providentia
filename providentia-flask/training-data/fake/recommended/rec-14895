I went to the Khyber to see divey shows. Upstairs is still a venue and I think they are remodeling it. The downstairs I did not recognize. They remodeled and got a new menu, new chef. I was adamant about trying the food there. I was pleasantly surprised. I had the pulled pork sandwich. It was delicious and the diff bbq sauces were awesome. They had a vinegar one which was oh so yummy. I also had the sweet potato fries with their bacon gravy. Can't wait to hit a show there get some grub and beers.
