I tried a few cheesesteaks while in Philly, and I don't get it.  Really...it's chopped meat, melted provy cheese, and some onions.  Should I have tried Cheese Whiz?  What am I missing here? However, this was good - the meat was good, loved the pepper relish, and the service was really nice.  I was expecting the hostile "wit or wit-out?" attitude, but the ladies running the show were really polite.  Also has a good location - no problem finding a spot to park. The only downside is that they are CASH ONLY.  Good thing I had made a rare ATM trip, otherwise I suppose they'd have been subjected to a song and dance routine for me to earn my grub.
