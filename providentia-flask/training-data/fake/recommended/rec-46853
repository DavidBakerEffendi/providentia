In my opinion this is the best restaurant in Philadelphia.  The chef really does have passion about his cooking.  All the other reviews about the scallop noodles are spot on.  They are absolutely delicious.  I've been here twice.  The first time we got the 6 course tasting which was worth every penny.  We've had fluke, octopus salad, scallop noodles, beef cheek, short rib ravioli, trout, melon gazpacho, all delicious.  The cookie dough ice cream is also amazing.  Wait staff is very knowledgeable and attentive and they also make good cocktails.  Would highly recommend hitting up this little gem.
