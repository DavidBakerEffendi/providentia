I'm a big, big fan of RyBread.  I can't give it 5 stars, however - the lack of indoor seating (and my apparently crummy timing) prevents me from  singing from the hilltops.  Without fail, whenever I go, the room is full and I am forced to take my delicious sandwich out.  I can't wait til spring when I can sit out back in their lovely patio area. Moving on!  This place is great for Fairmount. It's family-owned (and the family is SO NICE), the ingredients are fresh and delicious, the coffee is tasty, and everything is just... NOM. It's good. My personal fave - the Santa Fe Panini (portobello, onions, zucchini, pesto) with provolone cheez.  Wow. I will say that the service goes an awful long way here. I am always treated great, and I'm only an occasional customer. Good going, RyBread - keep it up, and take over the insurance office next door so you can expand your indoor seating. :)
