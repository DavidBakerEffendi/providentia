I have been to KC Prime for both the Sunday brunch and regular dinner service. Hands down, the brunch receives five stars. The all-you-can-eat buffet has everything you could ever dream of and more. On top of that, there are omelette, carving, and Belgian waffle stations. Enough said, this is a must-do if you are interested in a fun, indulgent breakfast/lunch, aka brunch. At $19, this is also an absolute steal. Dinner was also excellent. I particularly liked the fact that the entrees included a side and salad. Steaks were cooked perfectly to order and the burger is to die for. Overall, this is a great place for a nicer dinner, but I wouldn't place it in the same class as most fine dining steakhouses. This is not to say that it isn't a great place - I will certainly return. One more tip - I signed up for their email list and they send me a $20 off coupon for every Sunday evening.
