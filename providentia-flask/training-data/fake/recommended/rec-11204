Really enjoyed or meal at North 3rd. We went on Â Friday night and service was decent. Everything we ordered was good. Of special note were the steamed clams with chorizo, cilantro, and lime. They were definitely the highlight and worth future return trips. The ambiance of the establishment is interesting to put it blandly. I would agree with a previous reviewer who stated that each seating area is slightly different and can be somewhat unsettling. Nonetheless, it is something to comment on in your conversation for the evening.
