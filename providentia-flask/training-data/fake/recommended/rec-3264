I've wanted to the this place for a while. Finally made it in today for a lox bagel sandwich. The bagel ended up being pretty yummy, but the bagel isn't as warm as I wanted. Not a deal breaker though. The thing that stands out is the wait time. After I ordered, I noticed all of the people waiting around and seemingly for a while. In the end, it took 20 minutes to get this damn sandwich. And there weren't even many people waiting when I got in! Clearly a little unorganized or understaffed back there. There is also no room to wait, so I was awkwardly sitting on the window ledge, trying to not get smacked in the face by the door every time a patron entered or exited. I'll be back, but I'm definitely ordering ahead!
