Sunday Afternoon in Williamsburg and I have a need for a quality meal. Pates Et Traditions is the remedy. I had the La Bergere and that was wonderful only to be trumped by my friends plate, the most beautiful Croque Madam I've ever seen. The food was positively delicious. We shared a Banana Flambae which was the cherry on top of an outstanding meal. As far as decor, it Â looks like there was a woman on hoarders who loved France and they took three bins of her hoard and decorated the restaurant. On the flip side there is a lot of stimuli, so your eyes get a full experience in addition to the awesome meal you'll be served.
