I was recommended by a New Yorker friend:" best pancake. You don't want to eat pancake in any other after you Clinton's. And you need to go when it open at 9. Otherwise, you ganna wait for 1.5 hr" When we arrived, it was already 930am so  it really kept us wait for 1.5 hr. We ordered country breakfast, Spanish breakfast, egg benedict with smoked salmon. The ham is grilled lightly so you can taste the grilled flavor and not dry at all. It's thicker than average. Smoked salmon goes with biscuit not bread. The orange juice taste like fresh squeezed but not for sure.   The most famous dish is their pancake.  You may think pancake all taste the same.  That's what I thought.  But their pancake is very dense but not hard or dry at all.  It is just so different from other pancakes.   Everything is just great!
