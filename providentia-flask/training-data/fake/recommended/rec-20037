I was skeptical about this place because of all the hype, but this place was excellent. A bit out of the way by train but everything I had was delicious and the waitress was great! The sangria was pretty good, and the F-que wings were quite tasty! I wanted more by the end. The sauce is sweet and savory, and just perfect. My friend had the red velvet waffle and fried chicken which were very good and I had the lobster and shrimp grits. The grits were to die for the. The broth was a creole sauce, and this rivaled my mom's shrimp creole (sorry mom). We also shared the mac and cheese which was quite flavorful. I will most certainly be back! Thanks Soco for living Â up to your reputation!
