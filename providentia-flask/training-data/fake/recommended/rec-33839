This place was amazing!  It was my first time here and I was blown away by the authentic food, atmosphere and belly dancer. We ordered drinks, sat back and our 7-course dinner arrived.  The 1st course was the 3-salad platter with cooked eggplant in tomato sauce, cucumber and bell peppers in mediterranean seasoning and carrots with coriander.  It came on one big plate, to share with all the guests from your party.  They were all delicious.  We were given bread to scoop it out. Our second course was the B-stella, which is a pie with chicken, eggs, and almond.  It was a little bland, and we did not like it as much as our first course. For our 3rd course, we were given the choice between a non spicy chicken with lemon and olives or spicy chicken.  We opted for the spicy chicken which was AWESOME.  Best chicken I've ever had.  The meat was tender, and soaked in all the spices and juices. For our 4th course, we were asked to pick between beef and lamb, so we picked beef, and were served marinated berber beef shish kebabs.  The beef was very good, but I wish the chunks were smaller. By the time our 5th course came out, we were all pretty full.  The 5th course was couscous topped with veggies, chick peas and raisins.  It was a-ok. Our final courses were desserts, which were a bowl full of fruits, baklava, and hot mint tea.  I've had better baklava, it needed a little more nuts, but the fruits were very good, and the hot mint tea tasted delicious. Our belly dancer came to entertain us between courses, and was very talented.  She also invites customers to dance with her.  Service was a little slow, but the restaurant was full on a friday night. As other yelpers have said, this place is more for entertainment than gourmet food, they have hit some highs and somewhat lows, but it is a very nice place to go out to if you're looking for something ethnic with a large group of friends.  Very nice experience, cannot wait to come back!
