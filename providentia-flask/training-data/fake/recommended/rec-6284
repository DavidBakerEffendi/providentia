For the lady and I, this is our usual default spot when we just want a quick, light, usually healthy meal. For non pork eaters we find that there is a lot to choose from and be very happy about. Sit out back when it gets warm. Service is always friendly and prompt. Here is what we recommend - Soups are always on soul warming: Rustic creamy tomato soup Cream of onion soup Potato and roasted mushroom soup Salads are perfect to start out with: Panzanella Chickpea & Feta salad Baby String Beans Potato salad Crustini before the Panini: Tomato fresca, rosemary ricotta, black olive oil Goat cheese, honey, rosemary oil Spicy avocado and goat cheese - Israeli favorite Paninis after the saladini: Roast Chicken mozzarella, arugula and spicy mayo Fried Eggplantroast mushrooms, goat cheese, spicy mayo Drinks: Sixpoint Sweet Action, Cream Ale Iced coffee Awesome wine specials -get the Riesling when they have it 4 stars because they need to get a proper espresso machine for after dinner doubles. If you have room: Red velvet cupcakes
