I love this place. Was a regular when I was lucky enough to live right down the street and just revisited while on vacation. Nothings changed, same great bagels and service that has always kept me coming back. The Bagels are always fresh and delicious, big fan of either the everything or onion breakfast bagel sandwich. They have a great selection of flavored cream cheeses and plenty of other choices if bagels aren't your thing...like banana pancakes, waffles or french toast; all of which are topnotch. Great service and great food keep me coming back every time!!!
