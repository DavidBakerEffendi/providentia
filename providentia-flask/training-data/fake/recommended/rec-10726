The food and ambience were pretty good, felt like you were in New England instead of Brooklyn. The service, however, was seriously lacking. I will say that our server was great and attentive for most of the night, but when it came time to pay (there were 6 of us), that's where the problems began. I won't go into all of the gritty details, but there was a dispute about our multiple payments (there were 6 of us who wanted to split the check and they would only accept 4 cards on one tab), and instead of allowing one person in our party use a card after she refused to accept one of the bills he paid with, she went and got the manager. I don't blame this dispute on the server, I know there are restaurant policies in place that she could not get around, but when the manager came over, she was a complete and utter BITCH. I have never, ever, in my 10+ years in restaurant service, seen a manager be so inconsiderate and rude to a table of paying guests, especially when the dispute involved such a small amount of money that a restaurant like that can easily let slide. We had a nice dining experience until she came over and completely ruined it for us.
