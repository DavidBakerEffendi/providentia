I don't get the hype. At all. Went for lunch and got the infamous meatball sliders and sauteed snap peas with cauliflower. I was expecting some sort of party in my mouth from the sliders after reading these reviews ("amazing!!!" "Best ive ever had!") ... And they fell short. They were moist, but i found that they lacked punch--sad to say that besides a hint of fennel here and there, they were ultra bland. It makes me wonder whether the other reviewers have ever eaten a meatball in their lives, if this is what they'd consider a 10. I'd give them a 6.5, tops. The sauteed vegetables were fine--nothing great but not bad either. The waitstaff was super nice and attentive though, which is the only reason i'd give this overpriced $30 lunch three stars.
