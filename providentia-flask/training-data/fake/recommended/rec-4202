Checked out Fare last night for dinner. The food was tasty but there a few areas that need improvement, specifically the service. After being seated at our outdoor table, it was awhile before our server appeared to take our drink order and once she did, we waited some more for the drinks to show. I seemed to be more patient with the wait than G and enjoyed listening to the diverse music playing and tune out any complaining from my dinner companion. Onto the meal; I went with heirloom tomato salad and after reading the yelp reviews, the chicken meatballs. My meal was fresh and flavorful, great choice for me. G went with the beet salad and salmon. I did sample the beet salad which was fine but the salmon tasted fishy to me. G seemed to enjoy both. The menu offers lots of choices and the prices are extremely reasonable. Although our service was slow, the server was friendly.
