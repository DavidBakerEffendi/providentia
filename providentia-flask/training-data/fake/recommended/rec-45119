Actually more of a "3 and one half" but we like Barbuto when we can't think of anywhere else to go and we're romping in that hood. Usually, it's because we can't get into Spotted Pig (in fact, I wonder how much overflow they get from the Pig). My husband loves this place for some reason. Probably because the prices are decent, the food portions are generous and the wine isn't expensive. I like the roasted butternut squash dish and could eat two plates in one sitting. I usually don't do this because  people we are dining with would think it was weird. I also enjoy a good dry martini here (with extra olives of course). The chicken is one of the best dishes.  It's nice in summer when the restaurant is entirely open to the natural elements.
