I have been here many times since my original review and the 4 star rating still stands. I have to say that there are many Thai places in the area for the same price for lunch specials but room service stands out as the best, i have taken many of my friends there and there is yet a single one to say they have not enjoyed the food. By now I have convered almost everything on the Lunch special vegetarian menu and would pick the vegtable & Tofu green curry with the sesame Tofu as the appatizer or the spring rolls, you simply cannot go worng with this order for 8$ enjoy.
