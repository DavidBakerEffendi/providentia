This place was fantastic. I loved the rustic feel and friendly waiters, in addition to the casual ambiance. I strongly recommend the mushroom crostini, which was light and fragrant, and the farro wheat in parmesan sauce - piping hot and equally delicious. For my entree, I had the sweet potato ravioli, which came and went very quickly. I was most impressed by the fact that Frankies does not attempt to overwhelm you with food. The waitress gave the two of us three medium pieces of country-style bread with an incredible house olive oil, not a basket of raw dough like you'd receive at most cheap Italian eateries. The ravioli were just enough to keep me full, and the appetizers were similarly appropriately sized.
