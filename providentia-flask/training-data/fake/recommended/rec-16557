This place is amazing!  Both the space and the cuisine are unique and impressive!  It's a very small but cozy restaurant and the service is great!  My favorite dish was the pork buns.  All of the dishes have great flavors and are very aromatic.  I also loooved the chickpea encrusted skate wing!  The ginger flavored scallops were delicious but the portion was too small - it appeared to be just one large scalloped finely sliced.  My dessert was one of a kind - strawberries with almonds flavored with truffle oil and served with a scoop of pepper gelato!  It was excellent!  Overall, it was a great experience and I'd be happy to return!
