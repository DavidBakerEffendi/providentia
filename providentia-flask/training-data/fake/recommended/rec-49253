Me and a friend  went here based on the reviews and a love for southern comfort food. I got the fried chicken,  candied sweets, and cajun fries. My friend got the ribs, dirty rice and green beans, and both our plates came with cornbread. All of it was heavenly, and the price was perfect. The only thing I didn't like was that the candied sweets were put on the same plate as the fries, and it got some of the fries soggy. But everything came out quickly, the service was good, and the food lived up to it's expectations. Highly recommended.
