So I'm definitely not generous with my stars(I don't think) but this place definitely deserves 5.  This place has the best fries in New york(trust me, I know my fries).  They're just thick enough, just crispy enough(they'll make em extra crispy if you ask), and not expensive.  Plus you get to choose between so many sauces it's ridiculous.  Mango Chutney is hands down the best sauce.  The Poutine here isn't bad either.  The only downside, limited seating.  Don't worry there's seating outside of the Starbucks just around the corner.  If you do manage to find seating, the tables come with little holes to hold the cones that the fries come in(VERY convenient).  This place is open late so after a couple drinks at any bar down St. Marks, Pommes Frites is the place to finish your night.
