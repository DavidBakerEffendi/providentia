Paulie Gee's has some damn fine pizza. My favorite was the one made with baconmarmalade. That's right, BACONMARMALADE. It was divine. All the pies I tried were delicious & really fresh tasting. Crust was just right too. The interiors were cozy & warm and service was spot on too. I can't wait to get back here again.
