I was really hoping this place would be a nice lunch spot. I have ordered takeout from there several times before and have had great results from there - the only reason I'm giving them an extra star. Unfortunately, one day I decided to go inside to eat. The hostess did not seem to be thrilled in the least to seat a table of one. The waiter took a long time to get to me. I should have known then it was not a good idea to stay. Twenty minutes after i placed my order, my food still had not arrived. Takeout for the same exact item would have taken 10-15 min. They wasted over a half hour of my valuable lunch break. I couldn't risk being late to work, so, i left and grabbed a quick fast food meal. So, maybe if you have time to spare, check it out, the food from takeout was pretty good.
