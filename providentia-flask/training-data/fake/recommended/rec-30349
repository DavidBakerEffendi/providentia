Food was great and service was terrific. The place is definitely expensive but what's not in nyc? The wine guy (sorry don't know the technical term) was really educated and super friendly. He gave us a taste of wine before we ordered, but then gave us a full disclosure, I made this wine... His wine was good but not enough body for us. So we then had to awkwardly ask to taste something else. He then brought over the bottle of pinot that we asked to try. He opened it, poured it and said enjoy. He left we all looked at each other laughed and enjoyed the wine and a great meal!
