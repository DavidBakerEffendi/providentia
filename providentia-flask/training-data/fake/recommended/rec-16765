Great steakhouse with amazing prices in Elizabeth. You have the option of cooking your own steak on a hot stone - very fun! The atmosphere is very nice though it gets super smoky in there with everyone cooking their own steaks. Any meat dish here is very delicious and the paella was not as hearty as I am used to but it was not greasy!
