Room service is the quintessential modern Thai interpretation place, though it tries very hard to convince you that the flavors and dishes are as authentic as they come.  When was the last time a Thai place claimed to be inauthentic. Thais are proud of their culture and their food, and Room service menu is decent and nothing disappointed, nor stood out particularly.  In the neighborhood of Thai restos all clustered next to each other,  flavors get muddled in all the other places nearby.  I got their version of pad thai, that the waiter was pushing heavily, while my compatriots had chicken and panang curry. As a I said nothing really fell flat nor partcularly stood out. Decor is pushing 4 stars, the food has yet to soar that high.
