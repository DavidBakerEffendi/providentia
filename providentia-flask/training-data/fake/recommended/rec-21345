What can be said about a restaurant already known to foodies and reality TV junkies everywhere? Though made famous by its Top Chef roots, Perilla stands on its own with truly new New American. The duck breast is remarkably tender, and the accompanying popcorn made in duckfat just adds on the flavor. When in season, the almond-crusted softshell crab speaks for itself. For those looking for a taste of Top Chef history, try the steak with sunchoke creamed spinach - the same spinach you may remember from the Top 4 episode of Harold's season (in which he was criticized for not cleaning his mushrooms, and the French chef got angry because Harold proclaimed a distaste for dairy). Selective editing or no, Perilla is a gem in the New York culinary crown. And brunch? Don't get me started about brunch. Delicious shrimp and grits, with ham for added measure, and topped with a deep fried whole egg. I know. If you're not craving the south in NYC, stop reading dig into the corned beef hash or the perfectly poached eggs. Feeling lunch? The spicy duck burger rocks my socks (although the fries leave a lot to be desired). The best part about brunch? Your entree and a cup of coffee will cost you under $20. Which is dirt cheap for brunch in the City, and even cheaper for some of the best. A Must-Try
