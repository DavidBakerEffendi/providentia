Tingas is consistently good, service is always great  but I have to say I will never EVER bash them because I wanted to send my boyfriend tacos on his birthday and knew they were the only place that would and even though they had told me their delivery guy just went home sick I told them my predicament and they still DELIVERED IT.  I just saw that as a really nice gesture and I will always continue to go there and recommend to friends! it really did make his day. tingas rules.
