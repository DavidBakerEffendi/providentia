So after always hearing about Kochs, reading reviews and walking by peeking in, I finally turned the door, but it did not open but luckily someone let me in. All the pictures on the wall were overwhelming and the barely see thru meat case told me Kochs was a fixture in my working district of Univ City. I was greeted with delight by the cook? My coworker had called in order so I just had to make sure we Â were on the same page. The cook was hella funny as he helped the lady before me. He wouldnt let me retreat to my phone to text he engaged me in conversation while stuffing my face with delightful deli selections I really love the horseraddish cheese...because that was the first thing i ate I think it threw my tastebuds off to the rest of the meats, pickles and cheeses I sampled while I watied for my order. In between chuckles I found out that they have so many convienent ways to get an order in, texting, online, and they use my fav Level Up (if you have not joined do so). I had to say no eventually or I would not be able to enjoy my Cornbeef Special with horse raddish cheese. All in all it was a delightful experience. If you are in a hurry call it in or text it so you can get in and get out. I had some time to kill and I enjoyed the cook? candid sense of humor. My penny is on the shelf now. I will def be back and I will take advantage of the specials like the U of Sciences or Resturant School Special. I didnt notice a VA special, but the Cook? said if I came up with one he would list it. So check it out maybe one day my VA special will make the cut. The sandwhich was full of goodies piled bigger than my mouth, cole slaw, russian dressing and gobs of meat. I only managed to eat half....at least I have dinner now...
