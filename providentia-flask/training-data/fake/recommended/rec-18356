HoneyGrow is great- the location is prime, (next to Steve's Prince of Steaks) so I can choose a healthier option for post-bar food. The product is fantastic. The first time I came here, I ordered the Red Coconut Curry stir fry. I was overwhelmed with how many veggies they put in there- it was nice to know that even though you are paying top dollar (pretty expensive), you are getting what you paid for. My biggest pet peeve is when restaurants overcharge and leave you out to dry on the veggie front. The second time I ordered a salad- amazing pear parm dressing and the lettuce was very fresh. The only qualm is my salad was pretty pricey for how small it was. It will set you back $10- however, I will return here. The stir fry is THAT good.
