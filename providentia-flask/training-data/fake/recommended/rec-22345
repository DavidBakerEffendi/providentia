A personal neighborhood favorite of mine - great ambiance and in warm weather a wonderful outdoor space. I love the oyster shooters and every thing I have tried here has been delicious. Great place to stop in for a drink at the bar, snack or full fledged dinner. No matter the need, this place is always inviting.
