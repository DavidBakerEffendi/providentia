Great experience! Food was definitely amongst the most unique Chinese cuisine. I found their pepper ratings on the menu very useful, though one was off...the dumplings were amazing but were hands down the spiciest dish I've ever had. I can't wait to go again...I highly recommend this place. Give them time, as they are still new.
