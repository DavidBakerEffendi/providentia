Whenever I had heard about Koto in the past I heard that it was a pretty expensive place to eat. Because of that, we had generally stayed away. This past weekend we were looking for restaurant to go to for a celebration dinner and decided we'd try Koto. It actually wasn't as expensive as other restaurants that we've tried in the area and the food was excellent. We sat at a hibachi table. There was another couple and a family of four already seated. When you get there you get drinks, a salad, and a bowl of soup while you wait for a cook. We probably waited something like 15 minutes before a cook came. But as soon as the cooking started we got a show and the food was ready very quickly. You probably spend less time waiting to eat then at most other restaurants. They have an extensive menu and in the back of the menu they give you a page full of single and combination hibachi meal options. My fiance got a double lobster tail meal and I got the steak and lobster tail. Everything was very good and cooked perfectly. We will definitely visit again.
