Holy crap.  Holy holy crap crap.  I don't know where to start.  All I know is that I ate a bunch of stuff and I don't know what it's called and couldn't pronounce it since it was all Greek to me (you heard me), but it was all great.   It started with the warm fluffy pita bread with this pureed bean stuff.  Quite tasty.  Then we had this thing...it was just a pan of fried cheese -- no, THREE kinds of cheese all fried, and you squeeze half a lemon over it.  It's like having the best part of the pizza without the stupid dough and sauce if pizzas were Greek.  Then there was the salad, but at Pylos it's not called a Greek salad, it's just called a "salad," since calling it a Greek salad when you're in a Greek restaurant would be stupid, and over at Pylos, they're anything but stupid.   Then the entree.  I had this braised pork shank with some kind of sauce and fingerling potatoes.  This is the reason I gave up being kosher (that, and free will).  I also had a bite of this braised lamb with these mashed potatoes and another kind of sauce.  What was in it?  Who knows!  Was it good?  YES!   For dessert there was this parfait thing all layered with Greek yogurt (or just "yogurt" as they call it), honey, walnuts, and cherries.  I practically soiled myself it was so good.  Do you think those snobs over at Zagat's or Michelin are going to admit that something was so tasty instant incontinence took over?   So head over to Pylos already.  Just check before you sit down, since I might have been there before you.
