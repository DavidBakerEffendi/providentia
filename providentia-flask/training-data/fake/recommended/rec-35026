I ordered the Florentine omelette today.  It was supposed to contain spinach and feta.  I only found one or two pieces of crumbled feta.  But my real problem was that the spinach used in the omelette was obviously prepared for some other purpose.  It was loaded with garlic.  So garlic-y. It has been four hours since I ate this omelette, I've brushed my teeth, and my breath still tastes like garlic.  Really weird breakfast. Service was good.
