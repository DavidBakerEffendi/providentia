I really enjoyed this place.  I loved the decor and vibe in this place as well as the quality of food.  The staff is also extremely friendly.  There is a somewhat open kitchen so you can see the chefs cooking.  This is a great "date night" spot. I had the fried olives (so good)! with Labne/yogurt sauce and a special mushroom appetizer to start.  The mushrooms were served with dandelion greens and parmesian cheese.  It was very creative and a nice combination! For my entree I had the Orecchiette Pasta with wild mushrooms, fresh ricotta, thyme & olive oil.  The Kale was absolutley delicious, no taste of bitterness at all.  The flavors of mushroom, kale and cheese tasted so well together.  My only suggestion is to have the pasta made on site. Fresh homemade pasta! I'm definitley excited to go back and try some more items on the menu. Thanks for a great experience!
