One of the best BYOB joints in Philly. I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. I must say that the last time the food came out incredibly fast and our meal didn't last more than 30 minutes. That's what I call a speed dinner. I think they could have waited to take the food out another 10-15 minutes. Usually, I don't complain about this but it just felt kind of weird. They have the most authentic Laotian cuisine in the city and the service is very friendly. The ambiance is nice and quaint but still perfect for groups or small gatherings. I may need to give it a break considering there are so many other places to check out in the city but if I'm recommending a nice, delicious, cheap dinner with a BYOB policy, Vientiane is usually among the first places I mention.
