Came here for an impromptu lunch. Got the salmon teriyaki lunch box and they let me exchange tha California roll for extra shumai. Â Everything was solid but nothin blew me away. Good service. Good food. Really comfortable couches in the back right area. I'll be back again to try the sushi. The person I went with had some and it looked good!
