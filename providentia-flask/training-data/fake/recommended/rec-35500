Testo is uh mazing. It's one of those restaurants that you hope won't blow up solely for selfish reasons. Teeny little place (no more than a 20-top) on the corner of a residential street, this spot is warm and cozy Â just like the food they serve: house made pasta made with sauces of which no corners have been cut and typical northern Italian apps & entrees. I recommend sharing the seafood soup as a starter if you're into market fresh seafood and the most perfect tomato broth. Their pasta dishes run about $8-$10 with entrees that are a tad more expensive. Rumor has it, they've started a weekend brunch and you can hear the prep staff pounding out tonight's pasta while you revel in your hangover remedy. Testo is... The perfect date spot. The perfect night out with friends. Don't forget to stop by the ATM as it's cash only. Mangia!
