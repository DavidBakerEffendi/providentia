Great! Only negative if you consider it one is that it felt like a chain, but bot a mcdonalds type... More of a Chipotle. Very clean, very friendly. We had the chicken bowl with noodles. Very tasty. The tempura sweet potato fries are why you should come though, incredible. Three pump style sauces include teriyaki ketchup, Wasabi Mayo, and Spicy Mayo. Also serve beer at a decent price for NY
