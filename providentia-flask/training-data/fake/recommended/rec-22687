An honest place. I'd ditch the plastic cups and move to quality glass mugs or glasses, in line with the quality pub environment that they are building. I liked the beers, but if I were them I would commit the ultimate heresy and add Budweiser or similar Â to the beer menu, since many of their potential Bay Ridge audience will want that. There is no reason why craft beer and Bud cannot coexist. Service was cheerful and competent. It was chilly in the back. They'll need to do something more when it gets colder. They're a welcome addition to the area, and I wish them success.
