I'm from LA and I love Umami Burger, was so happy they finally opened one in NYC.  Came here on the 2nd day of opening, wasn't disappointed, same quality and taste as the outlets in LA.  Order the sweet potato fries, truffle fries, truffle burger, and the original burger.  Can't go wrong with those options. Wasn't a fan of the dessert selection.  The ice cream sandwich wasn't memorable.  Hope they add more items. Tip: Come on a weekday before 6pm and you'll probably have a less than 15 min wait.  Highly advise not to go on weekends, you'll be disappointed with a wait time of 2hrs +.
