This place was not worth the wait or the sweat. The food is solid, but the restaurant was hot,  the line was long and the service was not very attentive or friendly.  I don't know what it was, maybe they didn't get the memo about the heat wave, but seriously, it had to be near 80 degrees in there. I'll stick to Honey's.
