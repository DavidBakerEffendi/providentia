This is my absolute favorite place to go n NY. Â It is so beautiful, unique, romantic and most importantly-delicious! Best place take a date! Everything I have tried off the menu is fantastic, especically the Chicken and Mashed Potatoes, all salads and the steamed artichoke. You must save room for dessert, the Date Cake is my favorite dessert in the whole world..
