Like most other Yelpers, I had a mixed experience (but it still rates an A-OK, it was good, I'll be back...brunch brunch brunch). It probably helps that I arrived tipsy from wine consumed at cheese-making "class" and was in the company of good friends.  Bottles of wine were ordered at the bar while we waited for a table in the back (as opposed to being squeezed in the front).  Settling in, we made the owner explain, oh, pretty much every single dish to us.  Which was good, as I'm not an offal eater and there was quite a bit of that in the appetizers section.   An absolute must is ordering both the avocado and the tortilla appetizer--and one for each person.  Don't even think about sharing.  The avocado is basically deconstructed guacamole and while you can't f*ck avocado up, this? was? DELISH.   I ended up ordering the fatty pork chop.  The pork was melty fatty delicioso (so much so that I will admit to gnawing on the bone).   The order their meat by the whole (meaning he gets in the whole damn pig) and they slice and dice and come up with the menu based on the pig/cow/turkey/bunny/meat of the day.  I'll be back for brunch.
