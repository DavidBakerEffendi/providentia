I came here for dinner the other night, and ended up spending a ridiculously long time enjoying the outdoor seating, good food, nice wine, and fun ambiance.  I had never been, though I live close by, and was surprised at how spacious their outdoor space is.  I walk by fairly often, and never realized how much additional seating there is in the courtyard.   My panini was absurdly good - good quality bread pressed until crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Fillings were fresh and bright tasting, even though the sandwiches are served warm - limp vegetables and fillings in a hot sandwich are a pet peeve - and the sauce was bursting with flavor.  It was the roasted chicken one with the spicy aioli.   Crostinis and salads were imaginative in terms of flavor, and definitely not your standard fare.  We got a couple of bottles of wine - neither of which had I ever heard of, but both were quite good.  One was the organic California one, and was light, fruity, and refreshing. Overall, very good service, food, and atmosphere - will definitely be back.
