I went to Fogo with an old flame who was in town. Didn't really think about how much I'd be spending on a girl who isn't going to eat much anyway! Outside of that, what a meal! It's all you can eat, so that's awesome! The lamb is amazing! they also offer like 16 different types of meat that's a wide range. The real catch about the place is it's a bit pricey, which... totally worth it for a guy who's gonna eat... most of the time I was pondering why she wasn't eating more! That is the ONLY bad thing I could say about it. So, skip the girl and take your dad/son/brother/business associate out to celebrate! Save the girl for some French food or Tapas
