I've only been here a few times, always for brunch/lunch. Pretty cool place. The food there is pretty good, a little more to be expected than the standard diner food. My last visit was for brunch with my boo. We got there around 2 in the afternoon, which evidently was a little late because not only was the place pretty full but they were "out" of about half the brunch menu. My fianc√© was a little put off by them not having the first 3 things we wanted to order, but I was starving so we stayed and managed to find something we liked. I ordered the silk cakes with sides of bacon and eggs , playing it safe, and a pomegranate mimosa. He had the braised pork belly hash with poached eggs atop and a side of sausage. Both dishes were...good. Nothing spectacular, and our server was nice. We do plan on going back again, perhaps a little earlier next time. Also when it gets warmer to check out the neat beer garden.
