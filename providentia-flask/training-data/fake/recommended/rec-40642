Gorgeous feel, so warm and relaxing. Love this little gem in Rittenhouse Square! Rolled up for lunch and just sat back and relaxed while taking in a signature cocktail: the Harper Lee: Basil vodka, ginger beer, lemon and orange liquer. I could have bathed in this. It was such a nice, refreshing cocktail for lunch. The service was lacking as we entered and with no staff in site, we waited five minutes then just sat ourself. After that we were approached and taken care of but it was a bit weird. My order was also wrong but I went ahead and ate it anyway. I wanted the Turkey breast sammie but they delivered the Pulled Chicken Sandwich which was Carolina style bbq chicken, house made cole slaw on a sourdough bun. It was okay, a little dry but I did dig the flavors! Overall I would totally check this place out again for drinks or dinner. It was a nice spot worthy for stopping in !
