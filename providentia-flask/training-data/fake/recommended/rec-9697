There is one Vietnamese restaurant I used to go to in Tampa all the time that was amazing and is my standard for Vietnamese food. There have been many places who have tried and failed, but this place meets the standard. I had a bun and it was delicious. Service was great and friendly. Didn't charge me extra for peanut sauce. The bathroom is even clean and doesn't smell. A great experience.
