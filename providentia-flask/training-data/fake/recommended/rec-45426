I loved this place. My husband took me here for my bday and it was awesome. Everything we got was delicious. We got the Tito Santana Guac which was great, the Open Face Shrimp Quesadillas which I would definitely recommend. Then for meals I got Chicken Tacos, which were pretty good and my husband got the Enchiladas Mixtas which was a mix of three types and all three were delicious. Plus we got the Blood Orange Margaritas, they were good but actually very strong. The atmosphere is loud but very fun. I can't wait to go back.
