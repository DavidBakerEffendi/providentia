I HATE Good Dog because of the staff. I really wanted to like it because it seems so chill, and the food is ok, but they reallllllllly don't know how to treat people. Among several bad experiences (shady double chargings, a friend losing her wallet and management telling her to stop f***ing calling because they didn't have it), I went one night to meet friends. At this point, based on several bad experiences I mentioned, it was not my top choice, but that's where the crew was.   At 1:45 they called last call.  At 1:48, with full beers, they told us to GET THE F**K out, they were closing.  Now, (with a few drinks in me especially) that doesn't sit well.  I turned to the bartender and said, "c'mon man, don't talk to us that way, we just ordered a beer, we had a long night, and we're in the industry, we'll be out in a few minutes." He responded, "If you're in the industry, you should know when it's time to (yelling now, in my face) GET THE F**K  out!"  Ohhhh how I wish I hadn't already tipped him, but of course he knew I had, and it made no difference.   My friend, who is also a bartender, could see me getting heated.  He shook the guys hand, said we didn't mean any trouble, and ushered me out.   The bouncer chased us outside, and accused that same friend who diffused the situation of spitting his beer out on the door.   I wish I were exaggerating, but I'm not.  Also, I wasn't drunk, I had only three beers.  It was beyond absurd.   The next day, I called management, something I had never done, and haven't since.  I explained the situation, and the woman I spoke to said, "Ohhhhh honey", (I don't like to be called honey by stangers btw), "you've just gotta understand...they had a long night, they deal with a lot of people, don't take it personally". I will NEVER go back.  The staff was beyond excusable, yet they were excused by management.  It's the whole culture of the place.  I can get PBR elsewhere, thanks.
