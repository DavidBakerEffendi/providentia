I came here recently for the first time and have to admit, I enjoyed my overall experience here significantly more than any of my countless visits to their East Village location. The food still lives up to standards, which was a given - I had the Westside Special ramen, pork buns, and hirata wings. Service still on point, with numerous attentive servers. But my favorite part is that this location is a lot quieter than it's OG counterpart. I love the way the food bar area is well-lit, and how the main dining area, where larger parties are seated, is kind of separated. As a personal preference, i don't like being in crowded areas, ever, so the East Village location always gave me anxiety. But anyway, I came here on a Sunday by myself, about an hour after opening and had to wait about 30 minutes for a table, nbd. Overall, go here, if you want to eat great ramen in peace.
