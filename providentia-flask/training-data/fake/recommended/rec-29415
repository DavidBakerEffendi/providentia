Reading the reviews on Yelp decided to give Sotto's a try & overall not a bad meal but not sure if I would return. Based on the other reviews had a good idea where it was located so no trouble finding this out of the way location. The atmosphere inside was nice & service was very good. We started by sharing 2 of the appetizers, the Roasted Red Peppers was just OK as needed a bit more seasoning while the taste of the Broccoli Rabe & Sausage was excellent but the sausage was way over cooked, it seemed like it was cooked earlier & just end heated up for us. For our main course the Spaghetti Matriciana was tasty & a special that evening Rigatoni with a Mussels & Clams was good especially the pasta itself.
