Came here looking for a local brew and a decent meal while on vacation.  I ordered a sampler of the Irish Ale and the Euro Dunk.  The Irish Ale was warm, flat and had little flavor.  The Euro Dunk was very good, but was a little syrupy for me. I ordered the 1/3rd pound cheeseburger which was not 1/3rd of a pound.  I took four bites out of my roll before I hit any meat.  The cheese was good and plentiful.  I don't think I've ever had more cheese on a burger before.  I ordered my burger medium and it came out well done, but was still juicy.  I also ordered a side of mayo, but received honey mustard.  The honey mustard was actually pretty good though so I used it. Overall not very satisfied.  The beer wasn't very good which at a pub & brewery should be paramount.  The food wasn't bad, but it was definitely the worst food I've had in Vermont thus far.
