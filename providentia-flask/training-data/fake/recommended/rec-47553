I am speechless .....no words to describe the worse Mexican food ever!! I wanted real salsa  for the chips and got spaghetti sauce, I wanted fresh guacamole  and got guacamole paste!!!!! It was recommended to me by a friend ...A very bad friend!!!and my chimichanga.....uncooked rice, tasteless meet and no pico de gallo at all. Well I guess I am not that speechless after all....Too much money for such horrible food, please don't waste ur money this is so not worth it.
