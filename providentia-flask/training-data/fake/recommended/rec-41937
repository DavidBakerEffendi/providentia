I have been here three times and always am happy when I head home. The bartenders and wait staff are friendly and helpful, the beer is tasty, and the food is good. We went for beer week and had two delicious Dog Fish Head beers while sitting on the sidewalk (great for people-watching). A perfect evening! Also, the falafel sandwich is fresh and delicious. By far my favorite Fishtown bar!
