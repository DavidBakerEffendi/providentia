One of my favourite breakfast places in New York. There is always a wait but trust me it is well worth the wait. I had the blueberry pancakes, bf had an egg dish and we ordered a side of the sugar coated bacon. Everything was delicious! The sugar coated bacon can not be missed- it is a must try. Clinton St. Bakery is known for their blueberry pancakes because they are a perfect combination of dense and fluffy. The blueberries aren't sour and blend nicely with the cake and syrup. Just thinking about it is making me drool.. a lil.. Service was fast, no frills and the coffee was flowing. We'll be back but hopefully with a shorter line.
