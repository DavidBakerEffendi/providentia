I went to this place for a first date, picked by him. I liked the atmosphere. the menu seemed to lack choices at first glance, but actually after taking the time to read it, it was fine. I had the sea bass tacos and they were AMAZING. the pure√©d sweet potato was perfect. I do wish the oortions were a bit bigger. I also had a guava mojito from the bar which was refreshing. my date ordered a "Mexican Coca Cola" which was different that they even had that choice. definitely would go back.
