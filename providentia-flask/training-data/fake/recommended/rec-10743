I'm not a huge fan of seafood but my fiance is so I took her to Red Hook Lobster Pound once I moved to my current 'hood (it's walking distance). I have to say that the lobster rolls are pretty good. I prefer the standard roll, but my soon-to-be other half is a fan of the warm CT style with butter. I've also been to the truck when it's in Park Slope on Saturdays but the portions seem a bit smaller there. Mind you, paying $16 for a sandwich is not my cup of tea (Katz's Deli excluded), but it's worth it for the freshness of the food and the smile it puts on my fiance's face. The main shop took some pretty bad damage from Sandy, but they've rebuilt and even increased the menu a bit. Customer service can be a bit challenged when the place is crowded. One night we waited 45 minutes after ordering and then they served us sandwiches that had been sitting out for a while. However, after we made management aware of the situation and they we were disappointed, they rectified the situation. Still, I'd probably try and stop by during the slow season.
