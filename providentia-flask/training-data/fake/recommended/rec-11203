I have been to this place two times. The food is decent. However the service is terrible!!! the waiters are the type who are there for show and not to work! My last visit was this saturday, we ordered something light and waited almost an hour! the place was not even full! The couple next to us complained for the long wait too. Â  They need to hire better trained waiters or people who are there to serve the customers and not just hang out!
