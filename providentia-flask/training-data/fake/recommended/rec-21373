The food here is wasn't bad - I got delivery, and in my experience that's usually not as good as dining at the restaurant. However the delivery time was waaaayyyy to long - they said 40 minutes and it took about 70 minutes. And I'm not very far from the restaurant! There was a $15 limit (before tax) for delivery and it was cash only, so that was kind of inconvenient. They had good queso for the chips and dip, but it was $4 and you only got a really small amount of cheese dip. I got the quesadilla and it was good but nothing crazy. I would probably try somewhere else before I ordered from here again.
