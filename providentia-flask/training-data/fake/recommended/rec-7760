I sometimes stop at the Essex Street market on account of Jeffrey's Meat Market being one of the few places with a "real" butcher and quality meats.. So was intrigued one day as I saw this new oufit.  Nothing flashy but the small image of the chef/ owner's parents clicked in my head and I gave the spinach pie a try after a confirmatory talk with the owner - seemed like good vibes.  I was not disappointed,  tasted great and had that 'real' touch. Definitely on my circuit now whenever I'm in the area. Looking it up I see she's been written in the New York Times and some blogs, see the photos nytimes.com/2010/09/01/d…
