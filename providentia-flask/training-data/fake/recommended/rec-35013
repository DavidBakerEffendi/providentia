Just had dinner here tonight with a couple of co-workers. The food was awesome. Collectively, we ordered 7 different dishes and we all agreed that each one was fantastic!! The reason I am giving 4 stars is because there was only one waitress on for the entire restaurant at the time (8pm on Tuesday) so service was a little on the slow side...definitely worth the wait though!
