I LOVED this place.  The food was amazing, as was the ambiance.  At first when I saw the menu I was a  little skeptical because I am not a fan of "fusion" cuisine and Alta's menu has influences from everywhere: Asia, South America, Europe... but one taste of the food assuaged all my doubts.  Absolutely delicious!  Our waiter was pretty average, friendly, but not amazing.  If I did have one negative, it would be that this place can get very loud on the ground floor.  There is a second floor that appears to be quieter (because it seats fewer people)
