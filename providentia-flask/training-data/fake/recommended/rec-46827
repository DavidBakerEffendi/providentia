We had our wedding ceremony and intimate dinner in Yellow Plum's private room. The food was superb (mixed salad, leek risotto, shrimp scampi, beef short ribs and mashed potatoes, and fried brownies and mini cheesecakes for dessert) We had our own servers who were very attentive! All around, a wonderful evening!!!
