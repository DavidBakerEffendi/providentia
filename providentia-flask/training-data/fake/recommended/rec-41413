Had the whiskey burger and those absolutely wonderful duck fat fries! I went with a friend who said to get the s'mores shake but decided to go with plain ol' vanilla. I did try hers and definitely needed a few seconds to myself because it was soooo delicious! They ended up making the wrong shake and I got comped a strawberry rum shake. I have to say the shake was pretty forgetful and definitely no where near as good as the s'mores. The burger was perfectly cooked, thick and juicy looking! I swore it had to have been painted like that because I've never seen something as evenly cooked as that burger. The taste was wonderful too, not grainy, not tough but perfectly done! The duck fat fries were delicious. Not greasy and you can definitely taste the potato, whereas with other places you can almost tell that they used peanut or canola oil. Overall, it was a very good dining experience. The prices are definitely richer than I was willing to spend and the place is very small. We had to sit at the bar because all 5 tables they have were taken. The bar also holds about 14 people so I would definitely avoid going there when it's busy.
