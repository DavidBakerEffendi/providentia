This place rocks!!! 'nuff said. The sandwich menu is huuuuge. Lots of stuff to try. Great variety. Interesting combinations. I love the kimchi and roast beef. John Kerry is good too. I had no idea the dumpy looking place on the corner had sandwiches and I never expected the sandwiches to be phenomenal. I love splitting a sandwich with my girl as a lunch/snack before going on a wandering food tour downtown.
