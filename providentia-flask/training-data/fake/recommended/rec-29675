My friend & I went to Benito on May 31. The place looked ok. The waiter service was ok. The white sangria was very good. Well flavored. We each had the calamari. It was Â Good. I had the penne a la vodka. My friend had the stuff sole with seafood. This is where everything went downhill. The fish was spoiled & smelled terrible & they still served it. We told the waiter. He told the owner. The owner said nothing to us. We asked for the check which was $45 & left. I spoke to the owner outside & he brushed it off. I would never go back. If an owner doesn't care it says a lot about the restaurant. Good luck to future customers.
