I don't get why this place has over an hour wait on a Wednesday night. I just don't. I ordered the veggie burger and it was kind of the most tasteless blob I have ever had. And it even came with guacamole, caramelized onions and "sharp" cheddar. It all just tasted bland with a mushy texture and was more tepid than hot. And it was like a $14 burger. Maybe it was just an off night in the kitchen and yeah, I am a vegetarian, but burgers of any kind just shouldn't have the consistency of play dough. Meh.
