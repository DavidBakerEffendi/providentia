This review is based on their Brunch offerings. I. Love. This. Place. The service is amazing, the food is great and the atmosphere is cozy and welcoming. My last visit was this past weekend (3/15). The restaurant opens for Brunch at 10 am and tables go fast! The restaurant is not very big so seats are at a premium. I am a bit of a tea fanatic and insist on the hottest water and warm milk. Both were brought to me without my asking when I ordered it! I especially recommend the pancakes and bulls eye eggs. The food is fresh and tastes great.
