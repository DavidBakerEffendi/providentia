This restaurant gets 5 starts for the ambiance and people, however, the Manhattan that they made me was horrible, who puts Grand Marnier in a Manhattan.  That dropped them a start.   What drops it three more starts was them changing the tip that was on my credit card bill, adding an additional $6.   I would recommend that anyone using a credit card to pay at this bar check their records thoroughly and hold onto their signed copies in case you need to dispute a charge.
