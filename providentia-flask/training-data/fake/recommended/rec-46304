Absolutely fantastic. We had great service from both our server and the sommelier who came over to help us with wine pairings. This is a fantastic little gem in Tribeca and not in any way pretentious especially considering its association with a celebrity chef. I would highly recommend this place for any type of nice dinner, special occasion or not. Dimly lit, not too loud, just a nice hideaway in NYC.
