I CANNOT EMPHASIZE HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS PLACE. This is easily my favorite place to eat in NYC/Brooklyn/Queens, hands down. I'm salivating just thinking about it now. If you are reading this and debating if you should eat here or not, put down your technology and head over here right this second. Their happy hour is the best - huge discount on tacos and amazing drinks. Their mexican bloody mary beer thing is spicy and something unworldly, but I'm a die hard fan of that Margarita. The service is great, the ambience is amazing, and this is the closest (if not fully) authentic Mexican food I've eaten on the East Coast to date. Chavela's. Tienes mi corazon.
