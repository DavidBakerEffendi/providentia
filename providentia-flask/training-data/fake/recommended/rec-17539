Really fantastic food. To start with the salad is done just right fresh and seasoned. The entrees that I have had were all done right and tasted great, I really like the way they do their spanish potatoes really crispy. The meat on a stone thing is gimmicky to me and when they have too many going at once its hard to see/breath. That still wouldn't deter me from ging there to eat. The sangria is great I've been to a ton of portuguese places down neck and if you don't want to deal with the traffic and parking check this place out.
