Went back for the second time with a coupon, and this time, it was completely waste of my money. I bought 50 dollars worth of sushi, and it wasn't fresh at all, and definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. If you're gonna run a business, do it right, you're taking someone's money to serve them good food. If you can't do that, then you shouldn't be in the restaurant business. Won't be going back to this place anymore.
