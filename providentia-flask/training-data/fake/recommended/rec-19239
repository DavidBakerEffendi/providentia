A friend and I walked in after a movie down the street.  Cute place.  I thought it was new, so now that I know Char No.4 is indeed not new... my opinion has changed. I am not going to lie, the food was amazing! I loved the Brisket sandwich. The only thing that ruined this place for me was the stank faced bartender & bar back.  I swear neither of them smiled at us once.  After our drink was ordered, they never came back to see if we wanted anything to eat.  I had to specifically ask her if we could order.  When I asked her If we could order, she just stared at me. Being in the hospitality business, I would never treat a customer like this. Not coming back.
