One of my favorite low key Lunch/Dinner spots in SoHo. Very small hole in the wall Australian cafe on Mulberry.  Everything i've had here has been really really good, it's quite surprising actually! Considering i've never been to an "Australian" cafe or restaurant before. The two things I always get here are either the Bronte Burger or the Shrimp Pasta.  Both really really good, just depends if you're in the mood for a Burger or a Pasta.   The burger is not like an American style burger, it's more like a sandwich but it's delicious. Service is always super super friendly in their, and they deliver in the area as well! Highly recommended.
