It's good, but 80-minute wait on Sunday afternoon good? I don't think so. I only do waits like that for food I can't make at home, and let's face it--I can make nearly everything on the menu here. Service was good, food was good (we got the salmon-wrapped poached eggs and the punkin' waffles--mm), drinks were too sweet (especially the pomegranate bellini). I just don't like waiting 80 minutes, and then another 15 because the table's not ready. I'd go on a weekday morning when there's less of a rush. It's a cute place and the food is decently priced, so on a morning when I don't feel like cooking, why not?
