Came here for lunch today.   I ordered the katsu don dish, my wife ordered the lunch box with sashimi. The pork on katsu was pretty good...seasoned well.  The sauce, however, way underseasoned.  Left way more rice than in the bowl that I usually do due to the lack of flavor...and I normally eat a lot.  My wifes lunch box looked good.  It came with soup, shredded cabbage, soup and some fried foods.  The cabbage had a ball of potato salad on top which we were unable to eat because it rolled off on to the table.  We asked the server if we could get another one but she said no.  I thought that was being a little cheap.  In hind sight i should have given her a poor tip...it's a potato salad ball, not a big ticket item.  I think she should have just given us a new one.   Most restaurants would have just replaced it.
