This is my first review ever, I've always thought about it, good and bad, just never pulled the string! Our first time around was outstanding, as fluid as you could ask for with great friends, food, drink and service... it was effortless. On my way out that night I noticed the bar area which looked amazing, warm, comfortable, vibrant.... So, the next time my wife and I wanted a great meal and drink, and didn't want to worry about reservations, we were going to head back to Eno Terra and hang out in the Bar area.... Well the night came the this last Friday night, when early in the day friends wanted to get together, so I went to Open table, through Eno Terra's website, 6:15 was available and I requested the bar area if possible. They had a table in the Bar area waiting, but also offered the dining area...the bar area was prefect, Happy Hour was just winding down, the energy was great, and you could still have a conversation around the table...amazing! The food, drink and service was as good as we've every experienced in our 38 years of dining out! Amazing job Eno Terra!
