I lived in Elmhurst for a year and had tried a lot of different food in the neighborhood. I have to say JoJu is the only one I have kept going back to. WHY? Delicious Banh Mi with the same top-notch quality every time! AND reasonable price that's even cheaper than a Subway 6-inch. JoJu is my family's go-to spot if we need to bring lunch for a group outing. e.g. -   Going to the zoo? Let's have JoJu for lunch Going on a hiking day trip? Let's pack JoJu Going to the beach? Let's swing by JoJu to pick up 5 Banh Mi... Be careful if you want your sandwich "spicy," the jalapeño pepper could leave your tongue burning for a while (in a good way for pepper lovers :-)         Top recommendations - Beef Bulgogi, Pork Chop & Pork Belly! Yea, get the Kimchi Fries, too.
