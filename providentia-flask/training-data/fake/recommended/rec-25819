came here 3pm on sunday, waited Â about 15 minutes before taking a seat at the bar. cool atmosphere, nice bartender. the saltiness of the beef meatballs overpowered any of the meaty taste, so i did not like my meal very much. i ordered it with parmesan cream, which got kind of disgusting after a few spoonfuls, and sides of risotto and polenta. my favorite was the polenta -- light, fluffy, aromatic, and just a touch sweet. if i went back, i'd probably try the meatballs over salad with tomato sauce, which seems like a pretty good deal for $10 given the variety of vegetables.
