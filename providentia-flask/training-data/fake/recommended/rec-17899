This little restaurant, below the main floor cheese shop, has a menu full of delicious food, terrific happy hour specials -- including a bartender's choice cocktail, excellent wines by the glass, and smaller portions of their famous mac & cheese -- and helpful, friendly wait staff. Try the cheese plate with perfectly paired accouterments, the perfect kale salad, and of the assorted charcuterie, or whatever your waiter recommends.  You won't be disappointed. The place is rather small, filling up this Wednesday by about 7pm, which means it can be a bit noisy.  Get there a little early and enjoy a hidden treasure.
