This is my new favorite lunch place! I was not sure if I was going to like it. When everything is under 500 calories you are thinking there might not be too much taste!! But I was so wrong!! Everything is so good. My go to is the chicken and Gorgonzola wrap!! The best part is there is always a groupon $10 for $20 worth of food.
