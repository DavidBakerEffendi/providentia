Not only do they serve superb soup dumplings, they cook some of the best tasting Chinese dishes in Chinatown. Highly recommend this restaurant for anyone craving soup dumplings aka Xiao Long Bao. I also am a fan of their pan-fried noodles; the noodles are crisp & soft and topped with this wonderful sauce (I have no idea what it is except it taste really good) and protein(s) of your choice.
