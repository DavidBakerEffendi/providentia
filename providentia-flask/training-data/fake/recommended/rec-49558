If you are looking for a good date spot in the area then look no further. This place is a hidden gem. They didn't take reservations for a party of two, but they were able to seat us immediately (on a Friday night) Â - what kind of sorcery is this? They gave us the option of sitting downstairs or in the small area before you get to the garden. I imagine the dining room downstairs would be nice ambiance-wise with it's wood-burning fireplace and all, but the garden area is def where it's at. We managed to grab the last available table, and as cool as the setting was, the main attractions definitely turned out to be the food and the good service. The entrees that really stole the show were the lasagnas. The pesto lasagna is the type of thing you think about several days later and are compelled to write a Yelp review about - it's that serious. And the pizza was definitely as good as any specialty pizza place I've tried in nyc. The wine was reasonably priced with a fair selection. Lastly, this is the type of place that is impressive while being low-key and romantic at the same time. Probably one of the best values in town.
