Brunch: 3 Stars Dinner: 3.5 Stars As everyone knows, this place is packed on the weekends and honestly during the week too. An adorable country themed spot to go with just two or perhaps a small group. The hype is suppose to be brunch, but honestly I just wasn't wowwed given the wait and the dedicated crowd that is always present on the weekends. My eggs were not fluffy and a little salty. As for dinner, we still had a only slightly shorter wait on a weekday night for four, however dinner was decent. I had the grilled cheese which was delicious. Anything you order here for dinner is going to be comforting and simple. This is one of my friend's fav spots and she swears by the meatballs as does another friend of the mac 'n cheese. I would like to go back for dinner and try some of the other recommended dishes.
