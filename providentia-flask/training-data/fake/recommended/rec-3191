This is definitely one of the solid places in the city for reliable good food that won't empty your wallet. The cash-only kind of sucks, but maybe this will change in the future. Whether you are coming for brunch on the weekends or regular dinner, this little gem won't disappoint. The restaurant is very cozy and has a homey feel to it. During off peak hours they play some banging salsa music from the 60s/70s (and being a salsa dancer, I appreciate the good music!) At other times they sometimes play techno or some other crappy music. The food is of decent size for the price and the presentation is equally satisfying. I have never had any of the appetizers so I can't comment on those. The beef here is wonderful, but the chicken is definitely the stand-out entree here. They rub it with spices and herbs and it is so delicious it will make you want to come back again and again. All entrees are served with rice and beans as well as tostones or maduros. NOTE to everyone: If you ask to substitute maduros for tostones (or vice versa) they will gladly do so. The maduros are at times a bit "oily" but overall deliciously good. For deserts, the flourless chocolate cake is definitely my favorite. I haven't had the others, but I have heard they are just as good. Drinks-wise the mojitos are a bit small but pack a powerful punch. They carry Presidente beer here, which is a rarity in the city (and Presidente is one of my favorites!) Only negatives I have is that the waiters can often be blank slates and not very warm or welcoming. At times it takes a while to get your order taken, food served, or the check. But the food more than makes up for it.
