4.5 stars. Love UVA. It's hard to mess up Italian in New York, but it happens. UVA is possibly one of the best things going on Second Ave. The decor is somewhere between uptown hip and rustic kitsch. Upon entry, the host is the no-nonsense type, while you get the sense the place is a bit of a scene with that normcore vibe. However, it gets better. The waitstaff is laidback and seems to be comprised of newcomers to the city, boriquenas, aspiring actors, pretty chilled out. The ingredients are brilliant, fresh, and each dish I've had here over several visits have been super delicious. Each experience has always been divine, highly recommend this place. Experience / Ambiance - 1 star Beautiful decor. Definitely a scene of sorts. Service - 1 star Wait staff is knowledgeable about the menu and prompt. Quality - 1 star Beautiful ingredients. Hard to mess up Italian in New York, but it happens. Value - 1 star Value, for me, is equal to the price in relation to the overall quality of ingredients, dining experience, worth traveling to from other parts of Manhattan and NYC, and service. Excellence / je ne sais quoi - 0.5 Can't really give UVA the full last "michelin"esque star, but it's up there.
