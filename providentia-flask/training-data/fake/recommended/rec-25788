Solid 4 Star NYC restaurant. Top to bottom, great meal and the staples did not disappoint. Bruscheta w/ Riccota and Mushrooms (excellent) Insalta w/ Brussels (forgettable, and probably the only time in my life I'd ever complain that a dish was too "parmesean-y".) Gnocchi w/ Squash (excellent) Orrchieta w/ Chorizo (awesome) Pollo al Forno (moist and great to split) Hangar Steak (very solid) With a bottle of wine, it was very reasonably priced. Pace could have been a bit faster. Overall very worth the visit, will definitely go back.
