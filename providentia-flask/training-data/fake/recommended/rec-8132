I wish this place had opened earlier, rather than during my last year at Penn. Local 44, just off the usually beaten track among Penn students on 44th and Spruce, is AMAZING. The food is awesome (burgers and fries, and other pub grub is to die for) and the beer selection is probably the best on campus. You can go there for days and still find tasty, craft beers you've never tried. Not as loud and crowded as the other Penn-stitutions, but Local 44 is fast becoming one. Best bar near campus, in my opinion.
