I fell in love with this place from the minute I walked in. The atmosphere is nice and pretty romantic. It's a great place to dine in with a group of friends and also good restaurant to go on a date. Â  I started with the duck salad while waiting for my friends to arrive. The portion is quite small but it was soooo good that I was tempted to order another plate. For an entree, I had the lobster "kao soy" and my friend had the famous pad thai. Other reviews were right about the pad thai, OMG! One of us who said she wasn't eating because she's on a diet ended up eating half the plate of pad thai. We all agreed that the noodles (for pad thai and kao soy") were really good. I enjoyed the kao soy so much that I wish I could lick the plate clean :x Ngam is not like any other Thai restaurants in NYC. It's very inventive, better yet you don't lose the flavors of Thai food. I would go back to try the rest on the menu before they change it. Don't forget to try their homemade sodas!!
