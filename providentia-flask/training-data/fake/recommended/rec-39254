Could've expected better. We liked the decor and the waiting staff was very nice, however I knew I wouldn't care for it after I found a small hair on my soup bowl. The soup itself was decent but had far too many vegetables than I expected. My entree had a nice mix of mushrooms and cashews but it was otherwise bland.
