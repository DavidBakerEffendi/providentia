Grabbed lunch with a brotha from another motha and did not disappoint.  They had the best Veggie burger I had in quite some time.  Lunch was very packed but able to find some seats at the bar.  This place is more suited for mixed drinks and adult beverages.  If you order a Diet Coke, comes in a small bottle.  Not a deal breaker but prefer fountain.
