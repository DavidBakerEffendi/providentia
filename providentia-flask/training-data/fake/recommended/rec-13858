after finishing the new york city 1/2 marathon on sunday i decide to play russian roulette with my stomach on sunday night by visiting this halal cart.   well, what do you know?  this cart rocks!  the food is good.  as you can see by the number of reviews and i didn't get sick.  i was pretty sure i wasn't going to sick since they turn over the product fairly quickly due to the amount of business but you never know.   i got the chicken & lamb platter for $6 bucks.  it was a lot of food and for that price it was worth it to stand in line.  if you get a chance go check this place out.  it's great street food.
