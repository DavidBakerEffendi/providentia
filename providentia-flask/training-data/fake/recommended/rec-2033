What is the fuss.?  What is the hype?  Seriously, who made these guys so famous? They must have made better cheese steaks back in the day because this place was not impressive to me at all.  The long line is understandable because of the fact it is tourist trap but the food was not worth the wait.  With that being said it is better than Geno's.
