Chavela's, what can I say? You are so very very close to my place of residence. You have the best margaritas. Sometimes, when I'm lucky, you have them for five dollars. This is dangerous. You have a massive platter of vegetarian goodness that I inhale at ridiculous speeds, everytime. You have that yummy appetizer thing-with-the-cactus of which I never remember the name but fantasize about (too) often. Great food. Good service. Always wonderful.
