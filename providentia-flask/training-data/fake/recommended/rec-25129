Ugh classic example of 5-star food and a 1-star experience. Hate to do it but they need to step up their customer service a whole bunch. We show up for Sunday brunch around 1:30 and are told it'll be a 20 minute wait. We're pretty surprised because its a small place and there's at least a couple groups in front of us. But we say great! 15 minutes later we get called and seated! Wow this is awesome. We sit, we drink water, we decide what we'll order. And then the woman who took our names down comes over and says, oh you skipped a group in front of you. And we say oh no (with a tone expressing apology), and begin to explain that the guy who seated us definitely said our name. And she basically told us that he couldn't have and insinuated that we intentionally skipped the line because our name sounded similar to the group's name that we skipped. We assured her that he said our name. And THEN SHE HAD US GET UP FROM OUR TABLE AND GO BACK OUTSIDE. Most ridiculous experience. What horrible customer service. She assured us it'd be only a few minutes and we were too shocked to object. No apology, no complimentary warm beverage (it was cold out). Nothing. 40 MINUTES LATER we are seated. And that's not all. We're given menus and full waters, but it's at least 10 solid minutes before anyone comes over. Mind you by this point we're quite hungry. They finally take our order after we flag them down with much effort. (They were very understaffed.) Good news is the food ccame out quickly and was delicious. Very very good crepes (galette style...like actual French crepes from France). I had the Savoyarde (bacon Camembert onions potatoes Swiss and white wine), my friend had the bergere (goat cheese honey figs Rosemary and caramelized onions), and the third had the one with the spicy merguez and egg. All delicious. My cappuccino was very good too. And well-priced! $9.50 for a crepe that will leave you comfortably full. I'll give this place one more chance.
