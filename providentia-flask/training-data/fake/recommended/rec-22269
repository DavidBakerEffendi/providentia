I ate here for the first time today...I was having a bad day...my friend decided to take me to lunch to cheer me up....I was concerned that we wouldn't be able to order and eat in time for me to get back from my lunch break..Well..my friend said I needed to eat some comfort food, and omg was he onto something! We both ordered the grilled cheese with sliced tomato and bacon...it was phenomenal! The bread was thick and crispy, the tomatoes were ripe and juicy, and the bacon wasn't your ordinary strip of bacon! It was thick cut chunks of bacon! Amazing..Next time I go I am getting the mac and cheese..Oh, and they give a beautiful side of greens with the sandwich...it was so good...only gripe....they don't have straws for their drinks! I don't like to drink from cups when dining out...no matter where I go.! Other than that it was awesome, and I will totally go back for more!
