This is a great place recommended to me by friends.  The staff is very friendly, attentive and the food is great.  I've tried the lamb and branzino to name a few dishes and they are simple with great flavor.  Their choice of music is odd late night (I think they just choose some random playlist with hiphop that makes no sense in the environment) but during regular hours when they play Greek music it's pretty cool...lends to authentic vibe to match the food.
