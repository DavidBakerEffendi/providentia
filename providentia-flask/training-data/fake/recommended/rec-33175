Phenomenal!!!   Malagueta has the key to a successful restaurant:  intimate/clean setting and fresh/delicious food.  After reading great reviews I decided to have Sunday lunch and it was superb.  The only negative thing I have to say is that we weren't made aware of the daily specials but aside from this detail service was great: timely & polite :) Malagueta is a hidden gem :)
