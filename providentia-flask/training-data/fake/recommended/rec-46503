Where do we begin? Don't sit at the bar, don't order the cod (order the snapper or the burger), and better yet don't order anything. We are regular hungry people on a monday nights and this was a suggestion..but this was an overpriced and over recommended disappointment of the highest order. We should have gone to Reade Street Tavern and invested the money saved in a bond at 1%, would have made out better...The server was clueless, careless, incompetent, misguided us, and then over charged us...but we feel better after writing this unbiased review. Go elsewhere!
