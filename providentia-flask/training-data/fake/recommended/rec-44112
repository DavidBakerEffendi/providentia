Walking from the paid parking lot towards the Pholadelhphia Flower Show, we glanced towards 9th St and I saw Rangoon.  Hmm Burmese Restaurant.  Fellow Yelpers gave it good reviews and I am in the mood to heed yelp advise. It was great advise!  Rangoon had very friendly and helpful staff.  The place was clean and the decor while minimal was impactful.  The artwork was delightful. We had the thousand layer bread, a tad oily, but otherwise very tasty with the potato curry dip.  The String Bean and Peanut Salad was nice, cool, crunchy and flavorful. Sweetie and I both chose vegetarian dishes and both worked well together.  He had the Tofu and Veggies with Mango Sauce and I had Tofu and Veggie Curry.  We both chose Mild, as this was our first time to eat here.  It was mild enough that we would venture for the hot next time we come over.  But I did bite into a piece of hot pepper and my ears were on fire!  Hahaha, it was delightfully hot (I love hot food) but I did gulp down my Tamarind Juice!  Had to wait for a few minutes before I could start eating again.  But all in all it was great food. We had the Rice Pudding with Mango and it was not overly sweet.
