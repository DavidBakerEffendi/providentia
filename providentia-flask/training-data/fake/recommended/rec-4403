Hot dog. Bacon. Cheese. Swish. Right? This hot dog, the Texas Hold 'Em, is a hot dog that can't let me down, I figure, because I have a blind faith in pork and sodium nitrates and cased meats. This is the hot dog equivalent of a Rick Perry prayer rally and I'm in the front row singing hymns and swaying back and forth with my eyes closed. But the entire dog was shot down by a lone gunman; one bad ingredient perched a top the book depository: trusty, unsuspecting cheese. The cold, dry texture of the shredded cheese stood in stark, unfavorable contrast to the hot dog and bacon. Instead of blanketing it in a warm Snuggie of melted goodness like it's cousin, Texas Tommy, biting into it was like opening the door on the first really cold fall day and being taken back by the chill. Hot Diggity uses Liscio's rolls with the noble intention of stepping up the bun game from the supermarket shelf variety, but they're too much for these skinny dogs. They're putting an anorexic model in a fat suit. The quality bread is too chewy and puts up too much of a fight as you try to rip the dog from its casing, allowing too many toppings to avalanche off into toppings purgatory. While it suffered the same bun suffocation, the Seattle Grunge was good. I think cream cheese and onions on beef would lend it's naming rights more to Philly than Seattle, but the dog is a simple pleasantry. The most pronounced flavor is the garlic cream cheese and the toppings create a cool, creamy comfort. But the alpha here are the fries. They are more or less a blank canvas for the sauce but that's all they need to be with options like spicy ginger. The ginger rolls over your tongue first, smoothing the way for a subtle kick of heat. Simple and perfectly executed. There's the swish that Texas clanged off the rim earlier.
