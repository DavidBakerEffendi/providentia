We had a good experience here for Fathers' Day, but I don't think I would return; the price for value is not worth it for a regular meal. The service was fine, but not exceptional.  My stepmom and I did not buy the meat meal, only the salad bar, and there was some confusion with the bill, which required the waiters to confer and verify that we did, indeed, not eat the meat.  It's good that they care enough to verify, but it did take some time.   The salad bar was good, but not really worth the $25.00 price.  There was definitely enough for a meal, with cured meats/cheeses/etc., but $25.00 was a bit steep.  The people with us who ordered the meat enjoyed it overall, but said that some was poorly cooked (lamb well-done although it was requested to be sliced as rare, etc.) and that after a few rounds, it was overwhelmingly salty.  Unless you're a teenage boy, you will probably have a hard time eating enough to justify the price.  The sangria was good, with lots of fruit.   The desserts we ordered (chocolate lava cake and caramelized pineapple) were ok, but not worth the price or the calories.   Overall, it was fun for a once-off experience, but it is more about the experience than the food.
