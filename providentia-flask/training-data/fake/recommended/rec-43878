We just moved to Clinton Hill from Williamsburg and we have yet to find "our spot". Until tonight. It was our 6 year anniversary so the stakes were high to have a good meal in an unfamiliar neighborhood. I'm a bit of a picky eater so a lot of Clinton Hill restaurants are intimidating for me with their beef tongue carpaccios and such. Which isn't to say I want boring food just something my taste buds will understand. We were running out of time to pick a restaurant at 10:00 pm so we decided to take a friends suggestion and head to Alice's Arbor. I'm so, so happy we did. From the moment we sat down, Gina, the manager, made us feel super welcome by giving us our choice of tables. We chose our spot and Paul, the most wonderful, courteous waiter came over to take our order. I had the cheverny and the trout and my fiancé had a Kelso and the bass. As soon as our drinks arrived we discussed the wonderful flavors. I commented on the apple taste of my wine and he commented that the tap was the cleanest he's tasted around the neighborhood. Both of our fish were flavorful in different ways and we each agreed to give the other's a try on our next visit. Then Paul came over with a complimentary apple brandy that was fantastic! My fiancées parents are German so an after dinner brandy (or schnapps) is expected and how wonderful that it was thought of! Then we ordered dessert which was the best cheesecake I've had in NYC. Most are so dense you can't finish a slice but this was so deliciously light and airy with an amazing brown sugar laced crust. I ate the whole thing. Overall, this is the best place I could imagine our first anniversary in Clinton Hill and we will be back for brunch on Sunday!
