I probably eat at this restaurant 3+ times a week! That is how much I love it! Virtually everything on their menu is something that is delicious and I enjoy trying something new every time I go! My favorite appetizers are the tuna tartare (add avocado), the white tuna carpaccio (add avocado), the sushi pizza, and the tuna tataki. I always start with any one of these appetizers, and when I go with my friends I con them into sharing 2 of them with me. My favorite special rolls are the spicy girl roll, the tuna lover roll, the monster roll, and the ocha roll. All so delicious and the sauces they add make it so yummy! My favorite normal rolls are spicy white tuna, banana tempura with tuna, Philadelphia, Alaska, spicy salmon avocado, and spicy tuna avocado. Clearly I absolutely love avocado but can be replaced with cucumber or just with the fish. The food is amazing, which is why I continue to dine at the restaurant. I suggest going very early for dinner or else you may be stuck waiting for a period of time. Also, make sure you have patience when dining because it gets so packed! Definitely put this restaurant on your list of go to places !
