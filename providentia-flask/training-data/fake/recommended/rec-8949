there are enough reviews for Ssam Bar so this will be short. Very fun place, that's worth the wait to try. they're just very good at making unexpected ingredients go together VERY well. definitely start with the sake lemonade - i think i could drink this all the time. well, other than the fact that there is a decent amount of alcohol content in here. but OH so tasty! To be honest, i wasn't that impressed by the pork buns, but my favorites of the night were... - santa barbara uni - yes i know uni (sea urchin) sounds a little bit scary, but trust me - the two girls i were with who had never had it before even loved it! The dish was amazing, unlike any uni i've ever had. all the flavors were surprising and distinct, yet Â cohesive. - fried brussel sprouts - amazing and is a toss up between whether or not ssam bar wins or Boca in cinci (6 hr braised in butter) - desserts. tried both the pb& j (oddly curious but amazing!) and the Queen Stilton which is by far the strangest dessert i've ever had (pumpkin ganache, stilton cheese, and pear sorbet), but totally enjoyable in a funky can't stop eating way. would love to come back here and try the roast pig dinner some time! plus everything else that was yum=) so, wasn't as short as i wanted - but hopefully helpful ;) only negative about this place is the seating situation. crowded, uncomfortable seats, but i guess it's what keeps the tables turned=p
