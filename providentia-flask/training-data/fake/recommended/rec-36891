My girlfriend and I recently went to Balthazar for dinner.   We both felt that the ambiance is excellent and the mix of casual and business crowd fits right in with the entire experience. The food was outstanding and affordable (at least for New York), considering what we ordered: We started with the Balthazar salad, which is an outstanding salad and we highly recommend.   For main entrees, we had the joues de boeuf - the tenderness of the beef is perfect. The duck confit is also outstanding and for dessert we shared the warm chocolate cake, which is good, though not superb. I highly recommend this restaurant as our entire bill: one appetizer, two main dishes, desert, two herbal teas, and two glasses of red wine came and tip was quite reasonable. Of course, the food is the best part.
