I was pleasantly surprised by Uno's.  My experiences with Chicago-style pizza haven't been good in the past.  We started off with a salad with a pomegranate dressing that was fresh and tasty.  My husband and I split the Número Uno (meat for him and veggies for me) and it was tasty and not at all greasy.  We even had leftovers!  Price was also good since we both had beers and our bill ended up around $30.
