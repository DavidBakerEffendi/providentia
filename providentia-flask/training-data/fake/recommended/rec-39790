the sangria was mind meltingly delicious. i was looking forward to the crab cakes with mango jalapeno sauce, but it ended up being more like crab cakes with mango bruchetta, if that makes any sense. i was looking forward to spicy sweet cheesy goodness, but it was diced mango with a vaguely tomato taste. a little expensive for the portion sizes, but the service was friendly and the atmosphere was nice.
