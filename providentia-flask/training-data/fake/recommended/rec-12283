We arrived at 2pm for brunch on New Year's Day expecting to wait awhile.  For two of us, the wait was 3-3.5 hours, but we expected as much, and we put our name down. We ordered the clam chowder (that came with a warm biscuit), which was delicious and the highlight of the meal.  We also had the blueberry pancakes, fried chicken sandwich, and a side of apple chicken sausage patties. All of these things were good but probably not good enough for me to come back (especially with that wait).  I really didn't see what all the fuss was with the blueberry pancakes and maple butter - they were good but definitely not 3-hr-wait good... Service was good - I think our server was covering the whole restaurant by herself!
