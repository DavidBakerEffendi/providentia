This was our first time eating at Casserol Bistro in Bloomfield.  I always worry when i walk into a restaurant with a neon blinking sign that reads "OPEN." We started with appetizers which took over an hour to come out. The stuffed mushrooms were delicious, the onlon soup was great but way to salty. Then we went to the entrees which took an hour and a half to come out. The skirt stead was almost unedible and extremely salty and the sauce that came with the steak was way too hot and spicy. Monkfish was fresh but needed some sort of sauce. The Chicken Marsala dish was so salty I could only take a few bites. The mashed potatoes and chicken were fresh I just wish my lips didn't pucker every time I ate the sauce. For dessert we had a banana bread and the Italian flan which was delicious as well. Overalll our meal took 3.5 hours. Which was way too long. When I told a waitress our food was too salty she  just said "ok," and never offered to fix it or give us a free dessert or anything.. so that was disappointing.
