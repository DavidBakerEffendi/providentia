So, friends and I were on the hunt for good thai food, and SriPraPhai was recommended to us by a local. They actually said, "People come from Manhattan and Brooklyn to eat here." This made me laugh, but I went with it. It was kind of late when we got there - no wait at all - and the kitchen was closing in 30 mins, so we put in our entire order at once. We ordered a bunch of appetizers - my favorites were the vegetarian spring rolls (Ah-mazing) and the sauteed chinese broccoli. My husband ordered the crispy friend tofu thing, and it was pretty good - not spongy at all. I ordered the crab fried rice, and it was definitely lacking some salt, but otherwise very tasty. Other friends ordered curry (which I don't usually like, but this one was okay) and the squid, which I didn't try, but was told it was excellent. Overall a great experience. I want to go back again and try a noodle dish... I think I'll like that much better than the fried rice.
