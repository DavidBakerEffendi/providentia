Me and my family have been coming here for years.  It is the closest you can get to old fashion dim sum.  Not the greatest food but the other choice for better food is to shlep all the way to New York and sit with other strangers at your table. My family and I always get some meat and some shrimp with our dims sum.  I wouldn't go too early...it seems they serve what is left over the day before if you do.  The waiters are nice to us now that they recognize we are regulars.  Don't leave a tip on your credit card as I used to do in the early days...I don't think the waiters and waitresses even see the money then. I always order the shu mai and the different tripes.  My mother who is the most pickiest eater, gave this place a thumbs up.
