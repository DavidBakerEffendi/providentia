We walked by Dino bbq and decided to stop in since we were hungry and had some time to kill. And boy did we kill some time! While we were seated right away, our server was MIA for a few minutes before coming over. We started to joke that we may need to flag him down by the end of the meal (and this actually became the case quite a few times since you wouldn't see him at all for about 20 minutes at a time). I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with loaded mashed potatoes (gravy, cheese, and bacon) and corn bread on the side. The pulled pork sandwich was a good size but the pork inside was huge chunks which made it pretty sloppy to eat. The mashed potatoes were just average to me, plus there was some sort of pepper in either the gravy or the potatoes themselves that gave them a little zing which my friend and I didn't like. The cornbread was just average as well; it was very corn mealy and a bit on the dry side. The desserts passing by our table looked pretty good though! We left full but to me it was average at best. Worth a try if you're in the area, at least for the ambiance!
