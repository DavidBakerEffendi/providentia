Mom, Sis n I were here 2 Sundays ago for dinner, n food was good! Dishes full of fresh veggies n sauces were tasty! I had level 4 spicy which was tolerable, as i luv spicy food. We also had soup which was very good, I couldn't stop eating it til it was gone. I would have to see a menu to recap names of dishes n soup we had. For dessert I had fried ice cream which hit the spot, n Mom n Sis had the fried bananas, which they liked. The restaurant was beautiful n clean, staff was very polite, helpful with menu and attentive! The restaurant was very busy. The one thing I DIDN'T LIKE...was the 2 FLYS that kept buzzing about n had to Shoo them away every now n then. Oooo, n didn't like that Sunday dinner didn't include soup or Salad :-(
