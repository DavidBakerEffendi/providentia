I went here eager to try the veggie burger after so many rave reviews.  But I am allergic to mushrooms and it turns out the burgers are pre-mixed and include mushrooms, so I could not try one. I had totally mediocre squash soup that was quite a rip off at $6 for a small bowl.  The $9 beat salad I had was very tasty and good (though not filling enough on its own).  Two different waitresses asked how I liked my meal and I told them honestly that the squash soup was boring and barely edible, and I recommended a few ways they could make it tastier such as adding cooked pureed apple or fresh ginger.  Their only other soup option was Campbell's tomato soup out of a jar (so the waitress told me).  It's also a place to go to socialize with friends but only if you've got time on your hands: I was there by myself for 90 minutes waiting for my soup and salad...
