I don't think there was one thing I can say I liked about this place. I was in the area with my very picky mother in law, my 1 year old and my 2 month old. After some convincing, my mother in law agreed to eat at El Camino Real. We started with chips as salsa and fried pickles. The chips had a gross seasoning dumped on a few of them which made them unbearable to eat. The fried pickles were mushy and tasteless. She had a smoked turkey BLT which she said was good but how could you go wrong with a BLT? Her fries were shoestring which is always good...except for here. They were raw so they were crunchy and mushy at the same time. They were also tasteless and greasy and just plain EW. I had the Cobb salad which was gross because of the pork belly. It was straight chunks of uncooked pork fat (think bacon fat except an inch think and 2 inches long. And raw.). Pork belly is supposed to be cooked until it's crunchy, or so I thought. The hard boiled egg was doused in pepper and for the price, the tiny, greasy, salad was definitely a rip off. There was just nothing really great about the food, at all. Also, this place isn't family friendly in the least. They didn't have high chairs and the server got all pissy because we brought the stroller to the table so my daughter would have somewhere to sit. I had to change my 2 month old daughter and there wasn't a changing table in the filthy bathroom so I had to change her in the stroller which isn't very easy. This place is probably great for a group of people who are drinking their faces off and can't tell what they're eating, but not for people who want to go out for a nice lunch with their family. I'm definitely never returning to this place.
