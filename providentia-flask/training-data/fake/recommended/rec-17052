Tavola is a beautiful Italian restaurant with delicious food located in Hell's Kitchen. The decor gave off a very nice European feel, which was beautiful to look at as we waited for our food. The pizza oven is also visible from the dining area. It was cool to see the chefs whipping up the pizzas! We ordered the wild boar & veal meatballs and the burrata to start, both of which were delicious. The burrata was particularly melt-in-the-mouth good. My friend and I both ordered pizzas, which seem to be their speciality. I got the Vendetta Sarda, which was a savory combination of wild boar, mushrooms, and mozzarella, and my friend got the Parma, which was topped with prosciutto and arugula. Both of our pizzas were incredible. The prices are a little high but still reasonable, especially for the quality Tavola provides. I will be returning soon!
