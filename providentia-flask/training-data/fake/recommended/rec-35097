Outstanding food.  Went in during happy hour.  Tried one of the special beers.  Amber was a great waitress,  very attentive! We had the spinach avocado dip to start followed by the burger with the aioli and truffle fries were outstanding! Beer selection was very extensive and menu had beer pairing with all the dishes.  Again,  truffle fries...
