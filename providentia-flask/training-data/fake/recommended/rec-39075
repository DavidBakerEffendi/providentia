We have gone into Trading Post a few times now and every experience has been better than expected. Great ambiance. Wonderful service. Great food! I highly, highly recommend the mussels! The PBLT and spicy shrimp flatbread are excellent too. The cocktails are well-executed and can really get you into trouble (just as a good cocktail should). Nice addition to the neighborhood! Look forward to coming here on a regular basis.
