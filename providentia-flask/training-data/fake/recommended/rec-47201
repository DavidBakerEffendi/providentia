When I was in town last spring, my mom and I went here for dinner. It's on a really quiet, quintessential tree-lined West Village street with beautiful brownstones and buildings. Ah, I love New York. The service was gracious and quick. I still remember the pumpkin ravioli; it was texturally perfect, and light as can be. I love pasta and ravioli, and this is one of the best I've had. When I'm back in The City, I'll try to stop in again!
