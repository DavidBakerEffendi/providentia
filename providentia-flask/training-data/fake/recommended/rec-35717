Went to Tinto while in Philly for a quick weekend trip and it was one of the best meals I or my boyfriend have had in ages. On a busy Saturday night the service was attentive and helpful without being over the top. We were seated downstairs and while the tables are close together, it feels cozy without seeming like you are sitting on top of the other tables. The food. They recommend 3-4 per person and this actually seems like a good estimate, though it obviously depends on the size of the dishes you choose. We started with the mixed cheese plate that contained one goat cheese, one blue cheese and one hard cheese. All were very good, and the goat, which I'm usually not a huge fan of, especially pleased me. We had the ham wrapped figs as well, which were also a tasty start to the meal as well as chorizo that had great very slightly spicy flavor. We were debating between two sandwiches and settled on the braised short ribs which was one of the best things I've ever eaten. We also had the duck canape which definitely was neck and neck with the short ribs sandwich. The sea bass and cockles were super tasty and had the perfect texture, though they were on the salty side so be warned. The organic chicken was very good with crispy skin and amazing truffle mashed potatoes on the side. We finished off the meal with the chocolate y cafe for dessert, just because everything else had been so good I couldn't leave without at least trying a dessert. It lived up to the high expectations that had been set by that point. All in all, I highly recommend Tinto and think it will be hard for you to go wrong in whatever you order!
