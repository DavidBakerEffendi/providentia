My vacation was pretty swell until we cruised into Al's.  And then it became superb.   While they may do poorly when it comes to proper plurals (FRYS, what's that?  Or shall I say FRIES?), their mastery of said potato done fried more than makes up for it. I had the corndog.  Maybe it came off the SYSCO truck and dunked itself into the fry pan.  No matter.  It was one delicious breaded meat popsicle. Hubs had the burger.  It was satisfyingly lean and tasty.  A slider if you will. As a family, we try to challenge ourselves to eating for $40 a day.  It sounds absurd, but it's fun to see the budget materialize.  At a place like Al's, we could have a field day.  And we did. Also -- The booths were taped up, but the tables were pretty dang clean.  Condiments and straws were ample, so extra points for that department. Ice cream window outside was a briliant idea.  Playground 'round back was genius, as well.
