We have been here a few times for lunches while at work. I am a big fan of flat bread pizzas and I have tried all of their meat free options. I really love their selection and the way they pair flavors and cheeses. I also love that I can get a root beer float! wood-fired grilled flatbreads I have tried at tria: 3 Cheese Kennet Square Burrata Greco All are excellent I prefer to go with someone who likes to split so I can have half of one and half of another :-)
