Four stars for the tender and juicy briskets they served! Our party of three agree that the whole slab of ribs could well enough feed four as it was accompanied by four sides of choice. We enjoed all the sides, but loves the fried rice most of all! Trust. Take two of those. I also went for the cucumber and tomato salad, which was a crisp and refreshing contrast to all the sticky saucy stuff I was enjoying. Only one bbq sauce/house sauce but you can pair it with their garlic pepper sauce. Sauce was a 3/5 for me but the ribs they were on were definitely QUALITY. Â Wished that the fried green tomatoes were cut a bit thicker but we had an overall great experience. Come a bit earlier than dinner rush to get the best service. The servers are cordial and try their best to be promt but this place gets busy!
