Such a lovely neighborhood place. We went recently on a weeknight and ate at the bar.  The burrata eggplant was delicious.  DH loved the octopus. We went again on the weekend and there was a busy crowd but no wait.  The service was warm and helpful.  This time I had the grilled portobello salad which was tender and flavorful, and the kale pesto pasta which was the perfect blend of healthy and tasty.
