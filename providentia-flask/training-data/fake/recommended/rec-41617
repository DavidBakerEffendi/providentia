Lovely little place.  Great coffee and lattes.  Sandwiches  were delicious, but it's all about that bread! They also do different types of iced teas daily - I love the grapefruit varieties.   I went in once and realized I'd forgotten my wallet after ordering.  They let me have the drink on the house, and I paid them for it later. Awesome!
