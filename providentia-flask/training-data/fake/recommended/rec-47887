Food is okay here. The problem is the wait time. Do not go at lunch time unless you have 2 hours for lunch. a 15 minute wait turned into 45 minutes. Should really start holding a certain number of tables for reservations only. Right now they do not take reservations which sucks! hence the 2-star review... Management needs to get better organized if they want to thrive in New York City!
