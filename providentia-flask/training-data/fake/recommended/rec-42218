Blue Ribbon has been one of my good old standbys ever since I first moved to Brooklyn. The service is warm but top notch professional, and waiters have always been honest about recommending dishes; they know the menu inside out as they should. Whether its coming in for a full three course meal in one of their cushy back booths, or just some oyster and a cocktail at the bar, Blue Ribbon has never failed me. It is  truly  "classic" in all the best senses of the word.
