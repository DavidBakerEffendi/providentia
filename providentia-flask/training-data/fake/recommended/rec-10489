Surprises and spontaneity: sort of sums up this city for me.  In a good way and in a bad way.  Miriam is the good kind. We knew we would like it because a good friend had recommended it to us, but we were not expecting the feast of delights we ended up experiencing!  This place is crazy amazing. The Mediterranean Salad: now, when the menu says "fresh vegetables and chunks of avocado wrapped in grilled eggplant," it means it.  As in, the entire mini salad is wrapped in long slices of grilled eggplant.  And it tastes heavenly.  Fresh and savory at the same time, it was a perfect starter along with my white wine sangria and the bf's red wine sangria. I picked out the Jerusalem Bread and the Watermelon with Feta Salad from the meze (think tapas) menu.  Both winners, especially the latter.  Which was a pleasant surprise, because we weren't sure quite what to expect with that combination. My boyfriend's couscous:  wonderfully light and so tempting I nearly stole it from under his nose. Dessert: a rose-water-infused, kefir-like concoction that was as fragrant as it was sweet, and some of the best baklava I've eaten outside of the Middle East. As if that weren't enough, the restaurant itself is characterized by a fun, laid-back atmosphere.  Miriam gave us one of the best--if not the best--dining experiences of the summer.  If I were still in New York, I would stop by again and again.
