This was third time and Cuban Pete's and from a food standpoint it didn't disappoint. From the Sangria to the Tapas the food was great and satisfying. The place is loud and on a Saturday night it will be busy. Sadly what faultered on this visit was the service. While we got seated in about 20 minutes it went downhill from there. It took 30 minutes for someone to take our order. Once we did nothing we ordered came out right. Our waiter either didn't speak English well or refused to understand us. Out of 13 tapas orders half were wrong. He kept bringing out the wrong dishes. Ass to that a fallen glass that got onto our coats and water that was spilled down the back of one of the four of us, we weren't happy. We asked to see the manager twice and it wasn't until I searched him out that we were able to complain. We even had to get our own plates. Cuban Pete's is a great place and fun. Sadly, last night was a bad experience for my party of four.
