If you read through the reviews of Savor you will get the feeling that this is a love it or hate it place.  What's really happening is that a key member of the staff, Giuseppe, is the star in the kitchen and makes the whole place run great.  I've been here when Giuseppe is not there and while it is still a very lovely place to sit, the food experience goes way down hill.  Otherwise they would rate a solid 5 star for me.  It's just the inconsistency.  Luckily it seems that Giuseppe is there most of the time these days and I can't say enough about how delicious the food is.  The pastries are also a delight as is the Blood Orange Mimosa that they've been pouring for the last month.  Put that together with the rustic french charm that the place exudes and it takes me back to little  village cafe's in Bordeaux or what I imagine Provence is like, still have yet to get there.  Relax, enjoy.  Frankly even if Giuseppe isn't there its still a good place, you just need to get past food not coming out at the same time or taking forever.  Just think like the French.
