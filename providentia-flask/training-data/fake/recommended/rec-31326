Cheap eats on a late night...especially when you are in a car and can drive there. Albeit, there can often be a bit of a wait in the wee hours, but it's worth it. It's definitely more fresh than others, and the sauces are the bomb. But it is, STILL...street meat so, it's probably horse meat. But the Dutch eat horse meat, so it can't be that bad! ;)
