Went twice over the last week.  Today's trip (around 2pm) was only a 5 minute wait.  First trip was 20something minutes, 6pm on a Friday.  They have an app that tells you your place in line and you get a text when your table is ready.  Very nice. Both trips combined: I had the original burger and the 5-spice duck.  Both were good, but could have been a bit juicier.  Probably because at their medium rare not enough of the fat is rendered to get the juices going--the duck especially seemed really lean...could've used some duck fat mixed in for some juiciness.  Boyfriend had the manly burger and thought it was delish.  Truffle fries were good, but once cooled the truffle cheese gets a little gunky.  Sweet potato fries were very crispy, not too greasy.  The sweet salt was interesting, but I don't think so much sugar was necessary.  Fried pickles were a total disappointment.  Thick crust of breadcrumbs, mehh pickles.  Not sure where the umami flavor is in that.  House ketchup...I think there's some truffle oil in it.  Couldn't really tell what it was on first trip; 2nd trip more pronounced. I'll be back...tempted to try a medium burger instead of med-rare to see if the fat renders more to my liking.
