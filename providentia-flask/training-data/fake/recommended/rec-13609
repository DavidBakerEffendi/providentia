Beautiful decor, dim lighting, cute staff, great flavor. Obvioulsy, there's no shortage of Thai restaurants in the city, and especially on this stretch of 9th Ave. Room Service, by far, stands out as my fave. The menu has the usual Thai staples, as well as a great drink menu. The lunch specials are awesome and the presentation is simple and beautiful. They definitely pay attention to the details and the fact that you eat with your eyes first! So all in all--yummy, elegant... you can't go wrong. ME LIKEY.
