Came here with a veg friend of mine (actually my idea) and loved it! We ordered the spicey mang roll, the green roll and the mushroom roll. You can guess which one was my favorite since it's the only one I remember the name of...hah! But they were all beautifully matched flavors. We also had the Watermelon mint lemonade and the strawberry kiwi lemonade...next time I go, I'm bringing a flask of rum with me!
