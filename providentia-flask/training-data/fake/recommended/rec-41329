As the night cooled down, it was the perfect weather for a ramen-filled evening. Being in Brooklyn, the list was short and Chuko was on top. The girlfriend approved. The wait was a bit on the longer side, 30-40 minutes (fully packed, people hanging outside) but all was well once our order started arriving. The pork bun was as soft as freshly-made dough with juicy slices of pork inside. The chicken wings well-fried with just the right amount of crunch (and seasoned adequately) and then, the miso ramen came. We basked in it's broth-appearance;  the pieces of tender roasted pork floating leisurely, a poached egg teasing us to poke it vigorously and the noodles wanting to perform acrobatics on our chopsticks (the fork could only watch this time). A spectacle for the mouth! But then the chilli sauce (?) made an appearance and with a droplet or two light up our tongues (in a good kind of way)   Chuko, my heart & stomach request another visit. But before that happens, keep all your other guests warm & happy. They've been looking for someone like you for quite some time.
