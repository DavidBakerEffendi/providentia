One of my fave restaurants on the Island! Yes I am a foodie and love this place! Great ambiance and some nights they have live music. I love the salsa and chips which they give you before u order. Me and hubby always ask for more! They have parking in the back and street parking which is great. Food is delicious even though I only order their chicken quesadilla. Hubby always gets the cowboy burger. I love their carafes of sangria. They give a nice buzz and have great flavor. Nice spot to visit to have good food and drinks.
