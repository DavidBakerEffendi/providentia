This place is overrated. I'm going to get straight to the food. Chicken and ribs were decent. Nice charred  texture, flavor was average. I liked the  habanero BBQ sauce they offer as well. The sides however were trash, basura, gahbage. Mac n cheese was so basic, not much flavor at all. Collard greens were overwhelmingly vinegary and too sweet at the same time. And the cole slaw was SOUR. In addition to the underwhelming food, the drinks are so weak I feel like I got robbed at gunpoint. Couldn't even taste the patron in my patron and pineapple. All in all, I'd give the place a 2.5, I didn't leave here feeling like I got my money's worth and that usually = no return.
