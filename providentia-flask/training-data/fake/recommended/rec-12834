When you're in the mood for one of these, there is no substitute. For just 6 bucks you can have yourself one hell of a platter. I get the combo every time and it never fails. Beware of the hot sauce; it will literally set your mouth on fire after just one drop. Also, don't find yourself at the wrong one! They just aren't the same. Opens at 7pm, 53rd and 6th, the one with the long line on the south east corner near the water structure. Enjoy!
