Delicious, authentic Afghan food served with style, elegance, and class. The dishes looked so beautiful and colorful I almost didn't want to mess them up by eating them! Almost. For an appetizer, we ordered samosas (fried pastries stuffed with peas and potatoes). The real highlight of the dish was the green chutney sauce to dip them in, and it took me a little while to figure out that what made it so amazing was the cilantro! For my meal, I had the chicken kebab, succulent and moist chunks of spiced chicken grilled on a skewer. It came with light spinach rice and a pumpkin puree (I love anything and everything pumpkin). I also tried the eggplant side dish, which was cooked perfectly in a sauce and was one of the best parts of the meal. If you want to try something unique to make the whole meal come together, order the Afghan tea on ice (black tea, cardamom, and milk). It was similar to Thai iced tea, but with its own distinctive flavors. The ambiance here perfectly complements the meal. Downstairs is a bar and hookah lounge, but upstairs is a gorgeous dining room, with oriental rugs, paintings, romantic lighting, and fine china. I felt as though I had travelled to Afghanistan. To make it even more special, go on a Friday night for a live oud performance. Although expensive, this restaurant is worth it for the unique experience.
