Before I moved further West I was a regular client at Desi Chaat living just 1 block away (I'd eat their food 3-5 times a week). Chaat became an obsession of mine. Nowadays I live right next to Mood Cafe and it has become a local favorite of mine (for good reason). The owner, Hassan, is a good man who aims to please and has never once lets me down. I often stop by after class not bothering to look at the menu and always asking about any new creations or concoctions as I love to explore and try new tastes and flavors. Fair warning, there is no kitchen on premises so don't expect the meals to be made in front of you from scratch and magically served within minutes. I love and recommend the samosas (with all the fixings on them) and I always ask for a nice kick of a spice. Hassan often tells new clients of his money back guarantee if your not pleased but I have yet to see anyone take him up on it. What I really love about Mood Cafe and why I happily give it 5 stars is because of the menu; it isn't stale or rigid, rather more of work of art, dynamic and ever-evolving. The other reason is because it's one of the few places that takes me serious when I say I want "back home" spicy spicy, NOT white man spicy ;-). hehehe
