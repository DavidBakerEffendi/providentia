The food is worth 5 stars.  The only 2 reasons that I took 1 star off is 1) No lunch on weekends (their breakfast menu is great but I'm more of a lunch guy). 2) Hard to get a table... get there early or you might not get in. Other than those 2 things, this place is great!  For a weekday lunch, there is no better choice!
