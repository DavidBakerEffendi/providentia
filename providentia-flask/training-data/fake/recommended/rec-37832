My boyfriend Marty and I have never had a bad experience here....the manager is top notch, he remembers us and everyone else whether you're a regular or not, that goes a long way. We always will wait for bar seats because the staff is so attentive and genuine. We love walking here on a Saturday afternoon for a drink and a Joey pizza or one of the pizza specials on the board. Great cheese plates too. But the one thing that brings us back is the manager and his staff, they should be commended for how awesome they always are to us and everyone around us.
