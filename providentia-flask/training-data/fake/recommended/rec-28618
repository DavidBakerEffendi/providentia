We came in for lunch and were seated quickly.  Unfortunately we were given a table right near a door on a freezing day and staff kept walking in and out.  We also didn't get offered water like the tables around us for some reason. The pizza was ok.  Yes, it was crispy and had a nice amount of topping, but they skimped on the basil and for the price,  I've had better - even in Australia and this is supposed to be the home of pizza. The staff were brusque to the point of rude and even made us remove a piece of pizza from the serving tray so they could clear the table before we had finished! You can probably do better easily for pizza in NYC.
