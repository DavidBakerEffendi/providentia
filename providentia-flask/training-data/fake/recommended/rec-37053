Just had drinks and dinner here with some friends. The unagi was awesome and the bartender made me an off-menu tequila cocktail for $4. Great vibes all around -- they had some bangin' R&B-infused house playing in the corner, but not too loud to stifle conversation. Will I come back at a later time? Hell yeah.
