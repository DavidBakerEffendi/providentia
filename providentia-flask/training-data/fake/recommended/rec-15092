I used to think that bagels were just a bulky vehicle for cream cheese. Feldman's Bagels opened in my work neighborhood, and I have since seen the light! Their bagels are amazing, the staff is consistently kind, friendly and patient. The space is airy and comfortable. On top of that, they make their own pickles, bagel dogs and soup! The matzo ball soup is worth it's weight in gold! I have taken to bringing it to any friends who get sick. The coffee is great, and my boys love that they can get hot chocolate! Thank you Maddy and Roy. You're a great neighbor. Ita
