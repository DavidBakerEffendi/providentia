This is a great place to have a good time and enjoy some beers. They offer a good variety on draft and it rotates often while still keeping some of the same. The food is GREAT. From the sausages to the pretzels to the potato latkes, everything I have ever tried is just delicious. The only issue with it is that it is often packed on weekends so I would recommend getting there before 9:30 or so. The outside area is nice but the weather has been so bad lately that it is hard to go out there.
