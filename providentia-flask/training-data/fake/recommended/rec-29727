In my quest to find a burger in NYC that could rival an In-N-Out cheeseburger, I've been pointed in many directions by friends and even strangers. A couple of people suggested Corner Bistro. First of all, the name itself is a bit misleading. Yes, it's on a corner. But something along the lines of Corner Dingy Pub or Corner Dive Bar seems more appropriate. Other than that, the burgers are good. Not great, but good. They're even better washed down with a cold McSorley's Ale (for just $2.50!).
