Went for an early dinner on a Wednesday around 5 pm. Three of us ordered the all you can eat rodizio. They only had a few tables occupied at the time. They were quick to seat us and take our order. However once we ordered, it took awhile before we got served. For the first 10 minutes the food was nonstop to the point where my plate was almost over flowing. I couldn't keep up with their pace. However after the first 10 minutes, the servers never came back. I was not hungry, but could definitely eat more. After sitting there for another 30 minutes without being served, one of the waiters reluctantly came over to ask if we wanted more. At which point we only got 1 more serving. They definitely do not serve you until you say stop. They stop whenever they want. In addition, their food is super salty. Couldn't really tell what meat I was eating. Everything just taste like salt. Overall, I was not impressed.
