Damn good BBQ!  In fact, probably the best I've had in CT. We went as a party of four and ordered the family pack (1lb of any combo of BBQ meat, 7 ribs, a half chicken and 2 large sides for $40 ).  The brisket was phenomenal and the pulled pork was great too.  Baked beans are terrific and the cornbread was moist and tasty.  The quantity of food was perfect for 4 people and we all left thinking about coming back again.  This is a small little place ( about 6 tables) , but you can tell the owner is a real BBQ lover.  The  environment is relaxed ( think rolls of paper towels on the table, plastic cutlery and some BB King music ) and unassuming-- the perfect fit.  This place is great for kids, as well, and should be a good take out option.  Note : the location we ate at is on sawmill rd. , it seems from other reviewers that it's moved around a bit.
