Mmm mmm mmm. After loving their Classon Ave brunches for years, I finally returned to try the Franklin Ave location. First impression: cute interior, but a lot smaller than I was expecting, considering it's supposed to be an upgrade of the original location. The place is really narrow and if you're sitting on the outside, you will probably be bumped by a server once or twice. Especially if you are seated at the very last table next to the delivery door. Ok enough of the nit-picking. The food doesn't disappoint. And the portions are massive. And delicious. And combine flavors to make new mind-blowing flavors I didn't even know existed (just try the pescado a la veracruzana). They have a nice menu with a wide variety of options. And my fiance is convinced they make the best guacamole he's ever had (upon hearing this I think I cried a bit inside... I thought my guac was good). The end. Go to Chavela's. Por favor.
