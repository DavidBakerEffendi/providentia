i loooved this place. I was in town visiting and went here as a suggestion from a local. I didnt even get a main course because i wanted all the appetizers so bad. (i got a beet salad and scallops --- very yum!) the atmosphere was dark and cozy - the perfect place to unwind after a looong day of work. Â (really good music too!) Lastly my friends and i got dessert... cream brulee to die for. Next time im in the city i'm def. checking it out again... maybe I'll even get a main dish!
