1.) Friendly service (and made sure my mimosa glass was always full) 2.) Adorable, cozy atmosphere. 3.) Delicious brunch! I had zero trouble making a reservation for 10 for Sunday brunch. It was really nice to receive a confirmation call from the restaurant the day before my reservation. Due to the snowy weather though, only 4 guests showed up but the hosting staff acted quickly with getting a more suitable table for our party size. The restaurant was decorated for the holidays and the whole place was really charming. The pastries and bread that come out with brunch are a great touch and $12 unlimited mimosas, blood Mary's or greyhounds with your meal is WONDERFUL!! Food was served hot and in a timely fashion. Country fried steak topped with a sunny-side-up egg with sweet potato mash is so tasty. Overall, really great experience and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. Looking forward to visiting their Wayne location!
