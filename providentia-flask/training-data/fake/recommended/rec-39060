The Odeon is a Tribeca institution. The help is very friendly and attentive. My favorite items off their menu is the Country Frisee salad, and Grilled Prime Hangar Steak. Pair it with a good wine and your all set. On evenings they get very busy especially on weekends, so be mindful of the fact that there will be a 20 minute wait, and you will be sitting on top of other customers while you eat!
