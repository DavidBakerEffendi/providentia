So review number 238 for this place..what can possibly be said that would give new perspective or insight? Well nothing. I just felt like giving them praise so they can get another People love us on Yelp! sticker for them to display proudly on their door. Service: A+  The waitress was helpful, receptive to humor, and the wait time was minimal ( around 3 minutes for a carry out order! Plus it was busy.) Value: A   Quantity of food for $5.75 was plentiful, and served for my lunch and dinner. Savoriness: A   Delicious ( I got the Beef Brisket ) I've recently shied away from giving 5 star reviews because lets face it, its far more fun to be critical. But gotta give credit where credit is due. Do it.
