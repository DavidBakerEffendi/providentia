The name Umami now comes with a heaping serving of hype. I came with high expectations, and left satisfied but not blown away. We arrived at around 7PM and the restaurant was filled but not crowded...by the time we left at 8:30PM it was packed. I ordered the Manly Burger and my partner ordered the off-the-menu Five Spice Duck. We also got sides of tempura onion rings and truffle fries, which were both great. The onion rings were some of the best I've had...they were less greasy than your norm allowing you to eat a few without feeling sick. After splitting the burgers perfectly, we were upset that we hadn't ordered the famed Truffle Burger. The Manly definitely delivered, their way of cooking the patty is unique and very rare even by the standards of someone who enjoys a medium rare burger. Extremely high quality beef and beer cheddar made for an enjoyable experience--other condiments i.e. tomato, lettuce are not present and the crispy onions tend to lose their crisp in the molten hot cheese. The Five Spice Duck Burger made me feel like I don't have a refined palette because it was definitely too fragrant of a flavor profile for me. It sort of tasted like the smell of the food bar at Whole Foods, that combination of every pasta and salad dish from cuisines of every realm of the world melding under a single hot lamp. My apologies for the ridiculous and graphic description, but when you bite into this thing, you'll know. We finished our meal with the sea-salted caramel ice cream which was great. I found the prices to be fair and the service to be helpful. Our server did warn us about the cooking preparation and the medium rare treatment, unlike some reviews have mentioned. Having expected a much different experience, I'm not sure I'd travel out of my way for Umami again but I could see it becoming a semi-regular jaunt if I lived in the area. Although it's not my absolute favorite, it's definitely worth stopping in at least once.
