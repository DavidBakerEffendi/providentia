I agree with Donna K on this one -it's overrated. And to those who think two stars is too critical, keep in mind it says, "Meh. I've experienced better," which is absolutely true. You can find better in Korea Town for sure. However, this is an initial reaction, and I still might try it again as it's close to where I work, and a lot of people swear it's good. I got the Bulgogi Deopbap lunch special. As far as Bulgogi goes, it's nothing special. It's okay. A little bland. Definitely not spicy enough for my tastes. The portions were small, and I don't need all that white rice. For $12, I can't really say this is worth it. A messy salad, a squirt of some soup... Meh. I've experienced better. Also, the place is "hidden", meaning there is only a little sign and you have to walk into an office building through a hallway and into a dingy little kitchen that also sells a few convenience store items, oddly enough. I think this appeals to some people - the fact that it's "hidden" or "tucked away", so patrons can feel special that they know about it, or they can try to impress their friends by having knowledge of the place. However, ultimately it's a fluorescent-lighting- and nicotine-colored little sweat box of a room you would not want to hang out in for long, let alone eat in. SUMMARY: * Mediocre food at best * Unappealing atmosphere * Too pricey for what it is
