Simply put, Pat's and Geno's are in a league by themselves and it's not because of taste.  They are the Wrigley Field and Fenway Park of cheesesteaks.  I pefer Fenway Park (Pat's) and it doesn't mean that Wrigley Field (Geno's) is chopped liver.  But you will never find and I do mean never!!! find a place where two rival food legends meet in the "culinary octagon" on a daily basis!  They are an absolute must for any human who considers themselves a "food Phanatic" (get it). Pat's beat Geno's by a whisker, I think chopped is better.  Best advice if you are seeking taste is the onions,mushoom and peppers "wit".  And that only happens at Pat's, either could stand alone on taste with about 4 or 5 shakes of garlic salt on the meat.  But whoose stupid enogh to change the recipe with lines of people 50 deep 24/7?
