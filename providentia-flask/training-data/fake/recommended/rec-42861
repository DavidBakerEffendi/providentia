As far as authentic Italian cuisines go, this is a spot that shouldn't be missed. First time dining there was with a group of nearly 20 people, during an afternoon brunch. The place wasn't awfully crowded, however the reviews state otherwise. Make your reservations, try it out for lunch, or an early dinner. It's a quaint, intimate restaurant, with not a lot of seating, which in my opinion adds to the value of the restaurant.  Albeit loud, because you're sitting close to other patrons, thats just the vibe that you need to be in the mood for. Pizza was comparable to that I had in Naples, Italy.  As with most cuisines, the appetizers are your way to go! Cheese platters, grilled shrimp, calamari, bread with dipping sauce, just order them all, and have a party in your mouth! Remember, authenticity means the food will not compare to the commercialized italian dishes you've had elsewhere. So be prepared for a palate adjustment when eating. You'll enjoy the simplicity of their ingredients, and feel like you're having a home cooked meal from Nona..
