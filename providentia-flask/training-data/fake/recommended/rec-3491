Came here yesterday after I went to the gym. I was hungry and needed some good pizza so I turned to yelp. This place showed good reviews and the outside looked nice and clean so I gave it a shot. I ordered a small regular pie and it was so good I ate it all myself. Although I was very full it was worth every drop. It has a crispy crust the sauce is just right and the cheese isn't cheap. If your passing by stop in cause it's worth it. Great cozy ambiance inside a little nicer then a typical pizza joint.
