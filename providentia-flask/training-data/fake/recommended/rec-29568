In a stylishy-designed (done by the firm AVRO KO) space, some of the most interesting food in NYC is being prepared -- all with a vibe that will keep those 'scenesters' happy as well. The food is a weirdly wonderful fusion cusine that can only be described as Australio-New Zealand-Cali-Middle Eastern-Nipponese-Nouvelle.  Rarely have there been places in NY that have kangaroo on the menu, and this may be the only one where you'll want seconds.  The chef clearly has a great command of cooking with fish & other seafoods, and the desserts are uniformly excellent. There's a bar-side for those who are more concerned about the cocktails than the foods, there's a room for oenophiles (quite a good list of southern hemisphere choices), and there's the main dining areas, too.  All of these are almost as beautiful and interesting as the food itself. As another poster mentioned, there's also a great weekend brunch... Overall, one of my favourite places.
