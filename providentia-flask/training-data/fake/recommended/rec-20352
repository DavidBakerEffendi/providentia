Bar Tano is a great place for more authentic Italian food than most places. Pizzas are delicious, pastas delicious, antipatsti delicious. I was most impressed by the salad here--it's hard to make a well balanced, simple, interesting salad, but the succeed! The atmosphere is wonderful as well, though I prefer it when the bar area is not so crowded. It can get a bit loud. Also, as other reviewers have noted, it's a bit hard to navigate the dining room area and the bar area even when the place is not crowded.
