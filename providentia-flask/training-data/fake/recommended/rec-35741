Went to Tinto on a Friday night for the first time and decided to go with the Chef's Tasting Menu and the Wine Pairing Menu.  Though it raised the price a bit, it was fun to let the Chef do his work and decide what we were going to eat that night.  But, dont worry, they take into consideration any dietary restraints or problems as well as your likes and dislikes.   The food that we were served was delicious.  Portions, of course, were not large, but the Chef's tasting menu offers many courses and we were definitely not hungry when we left.   As for the atmosphere, the restaurant is very nice and romantic and the whole place smelled absolutely delicious - definitely a plus!  The only reason that we opted to knock the restaurant one star down is because of how loud it was.  Though this is not necessarily the fault of the restaurant itself, it is definitely something worth mentioning. But, the wait staff was really friendly, really helpful, and very welcoming.  In fact, we had a mishap with a glass of wine and they had no problem giving us another one for free! Next time you are in Philly, I say give it a shot!  You'll have a fun night!
