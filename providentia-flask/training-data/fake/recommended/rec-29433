Delicious, juicy, and flavorfull burger on a brioche roll. Make no mistake, this burger packs some real flavor and even though it is only about 5 ozs of meat, you feel pretty satisfied. The brioche roll is delicious and a welcome change from the standard buns. Only complaint is the truffle fries: they're excellent when the guy doesn't put too much truffle oil in there, but sometimes they overdo it and truffle oil, being powerful stuff, completely overwhelmes the fries. It actually made me sick one time and I couldn't finish them. Â  5 stars for the burger, but overall 4 stars because of inconsistency with the the fries.
