Good touch with the ambiance, but it ends there. Ordered seafood bim bim bop, portion was small, and the seafood did not taste fresh. Just my 2 cents: go north to New Brunswick and you can have better Korean options for almost half the price here. (the food court at H-mart has better food than here, seriously...)
