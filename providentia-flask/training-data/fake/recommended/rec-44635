Our waiter was very friendly, service was super quick, and the place has such a cute rustic feel to it. I've been here twice - once for dinner and more recently for brunch and had good experiences for both! Deducted one star for the following: -Would not recommend the clam pizza for dinner - it was pretty watery. Since clams most likely came from a can/jar, I think it made for an odd topping for the pizza and altered the texture. -The place opens at 2pm on weekends. Not sure why, as they are missing out on a good 2-3 hours of brunch business, but I guess this is fine if you eat late brunches anyway. -Brunch pizzas come with "farm fresh egg" but note that they're not sunnyside up eggs (like I had assumed). The yolk is broken and then baked on top so you see that white/yellow "swirl" mixed in. It still tasted delicious (we got the Puglia) but was not as aesthetically pleasing. Overall, I would definitely come back. Their pizza menu is pretty extensive so would love to try something else next time.
