I started with a glass of red wine from Finger Lakes, NY. A Cabernet Franc. Delish! I can't recall ever having a NY wine before. I love the local option. My husband and I both ordered the Monday night dinner, 3 courses for 25 bucks. Great deal. While everyone else in the restaurant seemed to be ordering the fried chicken and waffles I went for the fresh linguini. So summery and yummy! The H, ordered the chicken too so I was lucky enough to try his.....better than Side Car in Park Slope and better than Brooklyn Bowl. Go get it. The salad was good, but not great. The pecan pie sundae, wow!! Sweet and gooey goodness. Love the space, our service was fantastic and the story about the real buttermilk channel was a cute addition to the check. Overall, excellent meal! Cant wait to go back.
