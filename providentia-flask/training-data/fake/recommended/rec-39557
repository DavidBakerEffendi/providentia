I dont really do reviews, but for this place i absolutely had to. I come from a strong background of restaurants and Yuca Bar has been some of the best food and service i have received in years. From management to the staff, everyone was welcoming and helpful. Manager Chris was exceptional, helping us out from the menu to anything we needed. The food was DELICIOUS...expresso BBQ ribs? Fantastic. Shrimp quesidilla's were amazing and skirt steak tacos were also very good, could have been a little more juicy. I'm not much of a sangria person but wow did it blow me away. Loved this place, the atmosphere and especially the food...will definitely be returned very soon!
