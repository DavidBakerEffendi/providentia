How I miss North Third! Love the atmosphere, menu & delicious drinks (mmm, blood orange margaritas). I come here with friends every time I'm in town. It's a great place, especially if you're indecisive about ordering like I can be and want to share a bunch of plates... Great outdoor seating, too, if it's a warm summer night. Minus one star because the food is a tad overpriced, in my opinion.
