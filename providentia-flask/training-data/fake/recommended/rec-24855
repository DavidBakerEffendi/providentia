I really loved Melograno. The place was packed but we got a table immediately. Our served was very attentive and helpful. We had: 1) Gamberi Calamari e Cannellini Inzimino: This was listed as a salad, but it was more of an appetizer... and the most wonderful appetizer I have ever had! Warm shrimp and cannellini beans served over baby spinach in a lemony/tomato-y juice. I could eat this all day every day! 2) Pappardelle Tartufate: We shared this pasta dish because every review raves about it. The bf liked it a lot, I thought it was good, but the truffle oil was too strong for my liking. This is why i gave it 4.5 stars... too strongly flavored. 3) Quaglie Arrosto: I loved, loved, loved this. The presentation was wonderful (two small quails completely deboned and stuffed), and the dried fruit stuffing was both savory and sweet. 4) Special Lam (I don't remember the exact name): Bf had this and he really loved it. 5) Molten Chocolate: Yum! I don't normally have chocolate desserts, but this one was hot, sweet, fudgey, delicious!
