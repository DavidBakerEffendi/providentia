We're not from Philadelphia (in town for the Philles game), but we are big fans of Burmese food.  Our other experience is Burmese Superstar in San Francisco.  Rangoon did not disappoint.  The thousand layer bread and tea leaf salad were great.  For the amount of food, the price was very good.  Highly recommended.
