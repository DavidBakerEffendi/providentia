I wish I could give this place negative stars! Awful service and they ruined my Father's Day brunch.  Waited for our food for over an hour with absolutely no apology acknowledgment and then to add insult to injury they charged $25 for sub par eggs.  In fact, I signed up for yelp just to write this review since I was soooo appalled.  Beyond annoyed...
