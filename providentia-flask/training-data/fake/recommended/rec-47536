Unfortunately, Newark is not a vegetarian/vegan-friendly place. But The Green Chicpea saved the day. My friend and I managed to get in right before closing on a Thursday night. I gotta say, upon entering, I was super impressed by all the fresh salads and interesting sauces/dressings. I also love the green interior and the chalkboard tables. Very fresh and lively! I ordered a veggie bowl with falafel ($6.54), which comes with a choice of two salads. I gotta say - this really bummed me out. As someone who likes to sample and who enjoys a smorgasbord of many ingredients in her salad/bowl, I wanted more! How the heck was I supposed to pick only two things from the list of NINETEEN salads on the menu. Seriously, HOW?! And, hold on, why is hummus considered a salad and potentially part of my two salad limit? A little blob of hummus should just be standard Each additional salad is $1.17, even the plain lettuce, which one would think would be standard in a bowl. Oh well. I settled on the beet salad and the slaw cabbage flavored with lemon and dill. I would say the portion size of each salad is about 1/2 cup. In addition, I was served four falafel balls. I chose tahini sauce as well. Anyway, the food was delish, and the falafel were made fresh for me, even though the place was about to close. But this place REALLY needs to work on its pricing and menu-building options.
