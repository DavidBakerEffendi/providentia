Amazing banh mi spot in Bushwick! The bread comes out toasty and soft - doesn't cut your mouth when you eat it. I've tried the classic and it's good. The pickled veggies are light and doesn't overwhelm. Their Viet ice coffee is also strong and pretty amazing. Expect a hole in the wall spot and cash only! They also deliver in the neighborhood.
