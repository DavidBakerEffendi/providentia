My favorite Thai place in the city! I'm a sucker for Pad Kee Mao and they make it as spicy as you want it. I usually do 3 out of 4 stars so I can actually taste the food and avoid sweating like a serial killer. Their summer rolls are delicious! I have gotten the catfish clay pot-- SO GOOD! Their crunchy noodle soup is spot on as well. It can get a little cramped, but that's to be expected when a small place makes incredible food. Cannot recommend enough!
