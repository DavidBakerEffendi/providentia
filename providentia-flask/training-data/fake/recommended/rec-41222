Had a dinner for 7 people for my mom's 60th birthday here last week and it was absolutely perfect. The atmosphere was very nice - happening but not so noisy you couldn't here each other. The service was fantastic - very helpful and responsive but not rushed at all. And most importantly, the food was excellent. We had a special burrata and smoked prosciutto appetizer that was creamy and divine, and a mussels starter that was also great. Some of the entrees included the pasta with wild boar ragu, the Bronzino, the fettuccini with shrimp and scallops, seafood risotto, and the bolognese - all were outstanding. The server recommended a great red wine to go with the meal that everyone really enjoyed. And the desserts were equally delicious. Â I highly recommend the crepes with chocolate sauce and the gelato. Couldn't have been happier with my experience here. Will definitely be back soon!
