I don't often write reviews unless the food/service is horrible or great! I have eaten at Cuban Pete's at least 20 times and have brought co-workers and Family a number of times, we all loved this place! I grew up in Jackson Heights in the 60's where we had a huge influx of great Cuban restaurants, and I had a ton of Cuban friends that their Mom's were terrific cooks, I have been to Victor's in the City many times, have been to Little Havana in Miami- So game over- Cuban Pete's tops them all!! And pricing....the best bang for the buck meal!! Service is fantastic!!! I have yet to have a bad service experience!! The owner is a real character! He is usually around asking how your meal is!! Again- if you are in NYC- it is well worth the trip! you will be totally ruined on Cuban food! The decor really brings me back to Little Havana in Miami in the late 60's!! What I can say is this, if you do not really know authentic Cuban fare and what it is suppose to taste like, than this type of cuisine might not be for you! If you know what real cuban food is than this is on par with the best! Their Lechon Asado (Cuban Roasted Pork) is just fantastic!
