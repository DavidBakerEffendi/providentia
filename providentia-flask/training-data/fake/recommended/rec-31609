Today my daughter and I stopped by to pick up lunch.  I had the Salmon/Avacado salad which was amazing!!  The only thing that could have made it better was on a bed of spinach versus iceberg lettuce.  But I ate every last bite!  Highly recommend!!!  The Tofu Teriyaki lunch special is what my Daughter had, she said it was really good!  The most tender Tofu she has ever had!
