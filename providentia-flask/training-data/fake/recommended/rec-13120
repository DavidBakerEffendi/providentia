went here last night before a show.  BYOB is big plus.  very small, definitely call ahead.  if you go here in the cold weather wear an extra layer as there is no foyer so there is a cold blast of air every time the front door opens depending on where you are sitting . Nook has a very simple atmosphere and is quite relaxing. We had the mushroom cigars and the tuna tartare.  The mushroom cigars were very good with light pastry shell.  The tuna tartar was excellent.  Both appetizers were big enough to share. We each got the Thai marinated lamb chops which was a substantial meal with three lamb chops, mashed potatoes and cabbage.  You won't be hungry afterwards.  The lamb was prepared just as we requested and the tanginess of the cabbage was a great compliment with the marinade. Very nice dinner - we'll be back.
