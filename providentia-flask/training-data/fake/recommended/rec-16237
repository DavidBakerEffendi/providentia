Uva delivers what many "Italian" restuarants in the city do not- that is, uncomplicated, fresh cuisine. Overall, an excellent, casual restaurant. The service has been consistently at par and friendly. The wine list, while somewhat pricey, is well rounded - with an emphasis on trendy labels. The restaurant does not accept reservations. Indoors can be noisy. Â However, after your third visit, you will most likely be seated in the more intimate dining room. Of course, if possible, sit outside on the back patio.
