Amazing food! My husband and I shared a primi of Involtini Di Melanzane and a secondi Gnocchi Di Ricotta and I must tell you that food here is very tasty and filling too. Staff is friendly and we were allotted a table within minutes of reaching there even though it was a weekend. All in all the food and service is worth time and money.
