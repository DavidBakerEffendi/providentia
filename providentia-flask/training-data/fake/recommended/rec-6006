I am not usually a fan of ramen, but I would wait an hour for a table here. The soup and noodles here are that good. It has such a different flavor and texture than the instant ramen you are used to. I've had the pork and miso ramen here and loved both of them. They also make very good meat buns. The pork belly is really delicious too.
