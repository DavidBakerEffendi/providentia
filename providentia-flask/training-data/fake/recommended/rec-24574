Ate there for the second time on Friday and enjoyed both visits. Chicken fried steak, mac n cheese and meatloaf were as delicious as advertised. In fact, our friend visiting from Texas said it was the best CFS he's ever had. Two minor complaints: $1 oysters only available at the bar ($18 for 6 at the table!) and T-bone steak was served rare instead of medium rare.
