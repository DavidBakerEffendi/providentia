Um, no. Drive a mile up the road to Palermo's for a much, much better tomato pie. Staff at Danny's was great, the bread and olive oil for dipping we got before the pie arrived was good, the tomato pie looked awesome but...it was tasteless. Perhaps amping up the salt in the crust might help but the cheese also didn't have much flavor. Tomatoes were sweet though not as sweet as Palermo's. It was worth a try, but since we live an hour away, it was a disappointment realizing we'd come all that way and wouldn't be enjoying a great tomato pie that day. Also, I thought I saw a banner in the window that said large tomato pies were $10, but we were charged more. Not that I care, we'd pay $20 for a great pie, but if you go, look for that sign and inquire.
