I walked out of here pretty satisfied with some greasy burgers, fries, and beers in my belly.  The inside is a hole in the wall, and that was exactly what I was looking for in a cheap burger joint.  It was pretty busy, but we got seated after waiting 10 mins or so.  Service was slow, and unattentive, but we knew that before coming in.
