Notwithstanding the discomfiting nearby presence of a serial groper and a demented and deranged stalker (not Fogo's fault) during our first visit, Fogo receives five stars  in every category!   The first thing to love is the elegant, warmly lit space.  The beautiful wood paneled walls and columns, coffered ceilings and crystal chandeliers transport you to another time when architectural details were essential to creating a mood.  The second thing to love  is the legendary extensive salad bar.  Worth every calorie but don't overdo it; save room for the  gorgeous meat to come.   Third, the grilled meats are positively divine.  My fav is the filet, which is flawlessly seasoned and charred.  On subsequent visits, I have largely ignored the other offerings in favor of the filet.  The Mister also enjoyed the lamb, about which other Yelpers have gushed.  The fourth lovable item is the eagle-eyed service staff.  At Fogo, your water glass and dinner plate will always be full (unless you have displayed the red "do not serve" coaster).   We love the fact that Gauchos can be found in Philadelphia, even if they are confined to toting meat indoors and not atop their trusty steeds and galloping free on the Pampas.
