The owners are as friendly as their polenta is creamy.  I would replace my circulatory system with it's soft textured goodness if I wouldn't die of extreme deliciousness.  This place is class; great vibe, great selection of wine or draughts and always great people stopping in for a drink or some mortadella.  Great date spot and outstanding tapas!
