I have gone to the red onion several times as i live very close in Burlington, on this particular day they had a turkey lemon barley soup, i asked for a sample thinking i would get  a tablespoon of soup so that i could taste the broth to see how pronounced the lemon was. The kid behind the counter said "we don't give out samples", confused i asked why i couldn't sample the soup and he said "because of the homeless people, they come in and ask for a free sample and we don't know if they will buy anything",as he said this I thought it was pretty ridiculous  and the fact that they had free samples of scones out on the counter added to the ridiculousness of the situation. I ended up trusting their word that it was good and getting the soup and a sandwich anyways, the food was as it has always been good, nothing fantastic. However, I  have a bad taste left in my mouth, not from the food but from their costumer service and their values, I do not want to support an establishment who has such an established paranoia surrounding the less fortunate and are so greedy and cheap that they are not willing to spare a tablespoon of broth due to the chance that the person might not buy something. Several other sandwich shops on church street, Stone soup and New Moon, openly provide costumers with samples of soup and I would recommend going there.
