Nice, kitschy atmosphere, good service, and a huge menu with tons of yummy stuff.  You get chips and salsa, a small cheese quesadilla, and a dessert banana chimichanga for free, but you'll make up with it for what you pay for your entree... so yeah, it's not cheap... average $14-18 for an entree I'd estimate.  But the food is quite good and seems to be freshly prepared.  I had chicken with salsa verde, garlic, and sliced onions, served with rice and beans... very tasty.  Boyfriend had something with mole sauce that looked pretty good.  Nice-sized portions. There was a two-man band there, playing acoustic guitar and singing in harmony, but not accosting you at your table like they do at some places, so it was very nice.   Margarita was good, but tasted very much like it was made from a mix. We especially enjoyed the mural next to us of some... hmm... Mayans, perhaps?... sacrificing one of their compatriots.
