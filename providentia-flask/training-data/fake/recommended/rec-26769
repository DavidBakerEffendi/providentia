Recently opened and I have stopped by twice for lunch.  Nothing fancy, just a great place to have some of the BEST meatballs, (I had the chicken meatballs), in the city.  Sometimes keeping it simple is the key to success and Marabella has dialed it in perfectly.  They also have some great dinner options that I plan to try next.  I look forward to coming back and seeing the mom, dad and son team that run/own the operation.  It's nice to see a good family running things together and doing it right!
