This is a small unassuming place. They have cleverly created a menu with a werewolf inspired theme which is kind of cool. They make the wrap right there in front of you and they give you a ton of food for a decent price! I got the tots and the carnivore, it was soooo good. I would have given this 5 stars but the service was really slow, but there was only one person taking orders and cooking food so she had enough on her plate. Overall an awesome place, I would definitely come back.
