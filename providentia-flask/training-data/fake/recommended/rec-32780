Over all experience kinda sucked. We made reservations for a large group which they accommodated us by putting us in the down stairs area which is kind of dark and dull. But they had only one waiter for a group of 20 people, which in my opinion is a bit unacceptable. Took 20 minutes to get a drink order in, food took forever people's orders were incorrect. My own plate was decent I got the vegetable ravioli but they had 2 sizes and charged me for the dinner portion which was actually quite small for a dinner portion, seemed adequate for the smaller portion. I don't think ill be going back there are much better places in the area
