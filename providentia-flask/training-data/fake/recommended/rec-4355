Had brunch here this past weekend. Although the place was very warm and charming (the old meme space), the food was just average. We tried the Tomato Ragout with Poached eggs and feta - the ragout was seriously under seasoned and even the egg yolk couldn't help recover the dish, we also tried the steak and eggs over grits - this was a little better than the ragout but the steak was quite chewy but manageable. Customer service was not bad. Judging from all the reviews, I guess they do dinner better.
