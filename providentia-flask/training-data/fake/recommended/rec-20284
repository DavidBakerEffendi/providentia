Had my first Buttermilk Channel experience a few weeks ago and was pleased! Brunch was worth the wait. We left full and pleasantly surprised by the value. I like when the adult beverage is included. The chic atmosphere lent to the positive experience. Pancakes were plentiful and pumpkin soup was good at best.
