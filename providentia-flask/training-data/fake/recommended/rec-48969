Excellent addition to the Essex County restaurant scene -  beautiful renovation bar was hopping on a Saturday night - greeted and treated well upon arrival - sat in side room which was a little quieter - thats the only negative think I can say about the entire experience was the high sound volume  hard to hear people at your own table Food was delicious and choices eclectic   - nice size portions and wait staff helpful not too in your face - definitely on the pricey side Would definitely go back
