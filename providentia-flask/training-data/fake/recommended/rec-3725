Oh why don't they have this in CALIFORNIA! During a trip to NY a few friends and I were craving for some Asian food! We were yelping around to find a cheap and fast place to eat! We stumbled upon Woorjip and it was one of the best food stops we did all trip! Other than the place being small and packed. It was exciting to see how the place was set up. Similar to a food to go, but pack your own. This place had a lot of different Korean foods. They had some tasty beef bulgogi and yummy chapjae! Good place to go for cheap and yummy tasting food!
