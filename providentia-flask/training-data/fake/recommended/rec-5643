I had a very nice time here this past Saturday! I was taking my bride and my mother to the Michael Buble concert and decided on Mercato for our pre-show meal. Apparently they take reservations now. I have not been here in a while and was unaware of this! We were offered a table outside, and accepted. It turned out to be the perfect night to sit outside! Not too warm or too cool with the perfect light breeze! Oh, the food! Everything was solid. The olive oil and vinegar list is the perfect little starter to whet the appetite. Meatballs were quite tasty (even though they were SLIGHTLY cool) and the sauce was outstanding. I had the chicken special (stuffed with broccoli rabe and cheese and wrapped in proscuitto), which was tasty. I sampled my wife's short rib ragu which was delicious. No room for dessert unfortunately. Overall a nice meal! Service was a little on the slow/inattentive side, but I didn't mind because I was in such company! Â We will keep Mercato in our rotation of BYOBs!
