Despite there being so many great bars in the area, I always am drawn back to Swifts. This place was recommended to us by a friend who owns a very fine midtown pub because Swifts has excellent Guinness. It's no lie, their beer is so good! The atmosphere and food are an added perk which makes this a place I'd go for dinner, too.
