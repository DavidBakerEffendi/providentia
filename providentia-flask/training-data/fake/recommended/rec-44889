Every since I had a tasting menu here 10 or so years ago, I've been a big fan of this place. (It was the Niman Ranch lamb chop that won me over at that time--the best lamb--by a long shot--that I've ever had.) I work nearby and so take the opportunity to schedule business lunches here every now and again. I had one yesterday and, as expected, Lupa did not disappoint. We had the salumi plate, which was wonderful (although I'm not adventurous enough eater to try to the tongue or head cheese while with a business associate), and then I had the special fish--a wild striped bass served over purslane and a green sauce that had, I think, lime juice and other herbs. Seriously good. The fish was salted in just the right way, moist, and meaty. My associate had the sausage and peppers, which he said was great. (He took home his leftovers, if that gives any indication). So, if you're in the South Village area and looking for something a cut above, try Lupa.
