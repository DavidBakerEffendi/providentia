Half off appetizers from 4-7pm. I'm a happy camper. Suggestions: Honey wings - AMAZING Grilled Chicken Quesadilla - Equally AmazinG! Plantains for a little fun - crispy and oh yeah Amazing. Great and attentive Bartender/Waitstaff as well. Great location close to train station. I would give more stars, but as someone else mentioned, some of the main courses could be a bit tricky. For example, the fried rice comes with a lot of dishes and it is a little dry. Some of the dishes could use a little less salt as well.
