Pretty and that's the end of the positive side of my review.  Pricey, $250 for dinner for four with 1 bottle of $40 wine and no desert.  The would not matter if the food and service was good.  Appetizers were good, we shared oysters and mussels with French fries.  Unique way to serve mussels but by the time we got plates and a serving spoon the dish was cold.  That would have been OK if the main course turned out better.  We had paella, chicken and rice were overcooked.  I had cod over beans and mushrooms, it looked great but had no taste. The last dish was scallops over squash.  This one was OK.  So in summary, appetizers were alright but 3 of the 4 entrees were not worth the price.  With so many other fine places to dine in Montclair this is not a place I plan to visit again.  If you go and have a better meal then you should write a rebuttal review.  Save your money and go elsewhere.
