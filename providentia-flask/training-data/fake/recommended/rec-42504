Awesomely lo-fi in the normally hi-fi Manhattan burger scene. These sliders set the bar in my book. Cheese is gooey, patties cooked with optimal grease, and the onions taste like they were born inside a burger. Add pickles to make it pop. And the best part... they're cheap. Menu is as straightforward as it gets. Burgers. Fries. Milkshakes. Beers. Service has always been excellent. If you happen to go in the winter and they have their peppermint milkshake (or candy cane? I can't remember which they called it), get it.
