Went to Uva last night on the suggestion of a coworker for a great Italian place...We shared several appetizers; the wild mushroom bruschetta, the eggplant rollatini and a cheese plate. All were very good- especially the truffle oil and chili cheese. For entrees we ordered the scallops wrapped in prosciutto, the lemon sole and the pesto cavatelli. Again, everyone was very pleased with their entrees. The pesto cavatelli was creamy and perfectly al dente. We also tried the sparkling red wine served in a bowl...not sure what the name was but saw it on the menu and had to try it- very interesting! Would highly recommend for a neighborhood Italian dinner!
