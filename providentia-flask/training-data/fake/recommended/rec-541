I love spicy food. I was drunk. The red sauce is super spicy. More spicy than I anticipated. Do the math. But in between the useless panting and milk drinking, the satisfying taste of lamb over rice and chicken over rice definitely shines through. Adding the sauce is IMPERATIVE though, as it brings the whole plate together flavor-wise. You don't eat Buffalo Wings without the sauce, right? Don't do without the sauce here either. All in all, a pretty darn good meal. Is it better than other food carts? Probably. But is it THAT much better? Probably not. Just don't expect Per Se here and you'll be fine :) 4 stars for a great drunken meal Revisit? If I'm ever in the area again late at night, sure
