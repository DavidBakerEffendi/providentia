The food was good, nothing out of this world. My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary, I was a bit hesitant on coming to a restaurant called Pio Pio (in Spanish that's what you say for a bird like of your saying tweet tweet) and right when we came in I noticed that they had a rating of C! Almost died. Lol. I've never eaten anywhere with a rating other than A. But because of the location we went for it (and because it was our anniversary) I wouldn't recommend this place for a date though, it was really, really loud. A lot of tables just had groups of people. We skipped the appetizer and had a pitcher of sangria, it was alright, a little strong for me but not bad, I had the grilled salmon with vegetables which was delicious but HUGE, never had a salmon that big before, and my boyfriend had the pio which was a whole chicken and he then just ordered Spanish rice and beans on the side, juicy chicken. We didn't like our desserts, I had the tres leche and it was too spongy, plus the bananas on top made it taste funny, he had a pie with an ice cream which we both didn't like either. Overall the experience was nice, I loved our waitress, very attentive and kept filling up our glasses. The bathroom was clean (very poor lighting) and the decor was interesting. I wasn't amazed with the restaurant in general so I probably won't be going back, if I don't love it I don't go back.
