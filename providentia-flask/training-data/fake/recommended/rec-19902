Honestly this is a 3.5 star review but given that I don't have that option I have rounded up to 4. With that said, this place is a little pricey considering you don't get fries with your burger. Service was very speedy. Also, I know they said the burgers come medium rare but my burger was straight up not cooked in the middle...like certified red. FYI, you CAN have a burger that's juicy and actually cooked. Given all that, the burger was definitely flavorful. So flavorful I would actually come back on my own and pay $15+ for an uncooked burger?...probably not.
