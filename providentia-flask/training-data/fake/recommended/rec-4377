I have never returned to a fast food place so many times as Underdogs. They quite simply make delicious quality food that is served quickly by the most friendly staff I've ever seen. The prices aren't too steep either for what you get... $3 to $4 for some delicious, crafty hot dogs on burly buns. If you have room for fries, get them too! They are fresh and tasty and go well with one of the dozen dips. Not all items are the standard beef hot dogs. All items live up to their name such as the Warsaw Packed being made with a kielbasa, the Adonis actually being a lamb sausage, the Haute Dog Parm having a chicken herb sausage, etc all topped with delicious and plentiful toppings. Once this place was discovered, most of the team now goes to Underdogs often for lunch!
