The bar/dance club is on one side and the pizzeria is on the other.  Though the overflow pizza seating extends to the bar area as well. This review is about the pizzeria.  What can I say.  This is New Haven pizza.  Second only behind Sally's. Awesome choices of toppings.  I usually like to get the mashed potato with sausage on a white pie and clam on a white pie.  The crust is thin so you don't lose all your flavors with a lot of bread.  Also the tossed salad was excellent; mixed greens with pears, pecans, blue cheese, and vinaigrette. I do have to say the service was a tad off.  Our second round of drinks came as we were ready to leave.
