Great Brunch spot. We had omelette and toast, truffle scrambled egg on country bread, avocado on toast (very delicious) and buttermilk pancakes which are very very good. The pancakes were the highlight for me- melt in your mouth and very tasty. All washed down with an English cup of tea! I will definitely be brunching here again!
