I hate this place, it's not because their food is horrible, it's reasonablly priced , the protions are big, and authentic. The problems are a few other things. First of all the lady that runs the place is a total jerk to say the least. If you sit and try to order she keeps pushing for you to order the most expensive thing on the menu or the special and says things " thats are your gonna get" as if your obligated to spend alot at her restaurant, Â And forget about takeout, it never fails i always have to take all my food out the bag to check because they always get something wrong, which is always forgetting the rice, like rice cost them alot to make, then when you tell them they forgot something they treat like your lying or something, their rude on the phone, and one waitress was so rude that she litterally followed us out the door because we gave her a dollar less then the 15% tip she was suppose to get, if you go there prepare to be there for almost two hours for the entire process cuz the service sucks. I will never go back again, they've done it to me too many times and I reached my limit, Topaz Thai a few miles up the street is way better.
