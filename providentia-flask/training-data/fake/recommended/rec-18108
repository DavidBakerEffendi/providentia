Love, love, love this place. I've been there multiple times now, and just getting around to writing a review. It has a great atmosphere. It seems like when you walk in, you're going to be hit with hipsters, but the neighborhood vibe really just overpowers. The people drinking in there love good beer, but they aren't snobs about it. Ask the servers about the beers! They know their stuff and they aren't condescending with their answers! The selection of beer is always interesting and always changing! The food menu is just as great and interesting as the beer. I've never had anything there I haven't liked. My favorite was the brunch selection of bacon, eggs, and cheese fries. Despite how small it is, I've never had an issue getting a table. So glad this place exists!
