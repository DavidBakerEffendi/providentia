I met friends and we went to Obao for the happy hour.  They had a bunch of $5.00 specials all night which was great, the bartender Alex was crazy cool and welcoming.  I ordered the shrimp roll with peanut sauce which was good and very light after all the drinking so my friend and I shared a the crispy pork rolls.  I would definitely come back to this place and try dinner
