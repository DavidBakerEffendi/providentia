Terroir Tribeca is a great date place, dim lights but not too dim, general quiet ambience with noise around you so its not awkward.. fantastic and knowledgeable servers. Did you know they have boxed wine here? And its pretty good! The food is fantastic - have the veal ricotta meatballs, the steak, just about everything is pretty fantastic. The bill can get pricey quickly though, but its stlil nice to grab a drink and a bit of food here if you are not too hungry.
