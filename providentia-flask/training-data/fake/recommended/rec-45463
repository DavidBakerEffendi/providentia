We went to One53 on a busy Friday night with a group of 10 and were seated in the beautiful downstairs cellar. Overall, we had a great time and would say the food was very good but not spectacular. However, the deserts were all extremely good. Â The cocktails list is very good and they have a great craft beer list. I would recommend One53 to those in the Princeton area as the overall atmosphere, meal and service is worth the visit.
