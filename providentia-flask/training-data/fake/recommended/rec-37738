We always go to Kite & Key after work and we are never disappointed.  The beers on tap fit everyone's tastes, although I will say that the wine list could be updated.  The food is good & shareable.  This is always one of my favorite spots to hit on a warm spring day or cool early fall evening.  The staff is friendly & attentive.  This is definitely one of my favorite hang-out spots.
