After seeing this on MvF... I decided to check out the roasted pork sandwich... I was quite disappointed... it wasn't bad, but definitely isn;t as good as it looks.. The combo of broccoli rabe on the sandwich is good.. Pork wasn't juicy like I expected.. My whole sandwich was kinda dry to be honest.. I feel like it could have been alot better if they pour a little more juice on my sandwich.. Will give this place another try one I visit again and make sure they know to dip my sandwich or something so it wouldn;t be so dry...
