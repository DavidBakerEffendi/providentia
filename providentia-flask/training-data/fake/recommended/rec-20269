This place is really great. The ambiance is just beautiful. Its got a comfy country feel. When we got there we sat at the bar for a while. The have these cool vintage syphons that is filled with brooklyn-made seltzer water. After a while we were taken to a table which had a cool church bench behind it and above the bench there was a huge mirror. The place is totally a great date spot. Now for the food... We specifically went there for the chicken and waffles because we heard so much about it. The interesting thing about the meal was that it was entirely savory and not sweet. Usually with chicken and waffles the chicken seems sweeter to match the waffles or there is a balance between sweet and savory. The meal there had cheese waffles and the syrup was something like balsamic vinegar and honey. The chicken was very crispy and moist but they definitely could have marinated it longer. Would I go again? -- Definitely. Its a cool place and they have a great menu. Monday night prix-fixe? -- Heck Yea!!
