As far as diners go, this one is as average as they get.  Then again,it is the true diner experience.  Even the name!!  It seems like every other East Coast city has a three brothers diner!  Why is it always 3, why not 2 or 4?  No sisters?  How I digress, back to my review.  Luke warm so-so tasting food for breakfast.  The inside was very traditional (for a diner) split into two sides with lots of booths.  The help was older but not as cranky as some diners.  You won't die of food poisoning here but I wouldn't recommend flocking out of your way to go here.
