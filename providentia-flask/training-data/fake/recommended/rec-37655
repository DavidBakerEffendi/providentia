After living in Staten Island for close to 40 years, somehow we never went to the Staaten (either for an affair/party or just lunch).  Yesterday we had lunch there.  What a  (pleasant) surprise!!!!!  Lunch specials are amazing - for under $12.00 you get soup or salad, main dish with vegetable & rice or potato plus dessert (and of course rolls).  Even better, the food is really good!   Hubby had monk fish; this is something he loves & it is something that isn't always available.  I had chicken rollatine.  Both dishes came with delicious risotto and a string beans.   The drink of the day was bloody Mary's - $3.50 a glass! Our server (Kaitlyn) was wonderful.  As it was our first time there, she was super-attentive.   If you don't mind sitting in a very large dining room (which can be a bit noisy), but love large portions of good food, you should try the Staaten.  Be sure to check the days it is available.
