Thousand layer bread with curried potato dip was delicious! In fact, it is an absolute must have whenever I'm in China Town. While I've had the thousand layer bread with curried chicken, it was good, but not a force to be reckoned with as far as the curried potato. The thousand later bread alone without any accompanying side dishes is also delicious. The bread is made up of several buttery layers of goodness that has air in between. You can even pull the layers apart. Can you say Mmm, Mmm, good?
