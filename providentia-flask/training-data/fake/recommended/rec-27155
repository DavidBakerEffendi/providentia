My 10 year old son and I walked around 30 blocks to try out Gena's! Thankfully it was worth it! Â The chicken is outstanding. Habichuelas are great as well. The pork needed a little hot sauce, but hey you can't have it all. The place is tiny but authentic! If you are used to REAL Spanish food, you will like.
