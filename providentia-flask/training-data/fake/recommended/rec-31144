Like coming here for the wings...better than planet wings wings and the owner/staff is welcoming. Still have to try the burger. World just recommend, for a better profit, a more active location like near broad and market or along Bloomfield ave. ....jeez I keep forgetting to get my card stamped each time lol. That's a nice old time nostalgic thing I like as well.
