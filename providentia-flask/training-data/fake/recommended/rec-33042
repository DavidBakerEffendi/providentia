I was excited to find an indian restaurant right down the street from my house, but I guess you don't get THAT lucky in life. I ordered Chicken Curry and Lamb Vindaloo for take out. They told me 25 minutes, but I ended up getting held up and showing up after 35 minutes. The first bad sign should've been that they seemed flustered when I told them I was picking up my order. The food obviously was not done yet, and I ended up waiting an extra ten. The food was decent, tasted good. But the worst part was the bacterial infection from the food that made me so sick for about a week that I almost thought going to the hospital and paying medical bills would be better than suffering through it. I won't give this place a second chance.
