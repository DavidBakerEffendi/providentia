not much to say about this place other than it is just an all around outstanding mediterranean tapas restaurant. i've been here 6 or 7 times and pretty much every dish they make is delicious. we've brought 3 or 4 different friends and every one has agreed with our opinion. and the atmosphere is great. dark wood floors and walls, very west village.
