Went for brunch today with the mom... we got there about 11 and were seated immediately.  Their coffee is yuuummm!!!  I got an avocado, goat cheese, and tomato omlette which was big and really good, though 4 star kinda good, not 5.  My mom got millet pancakes which were wonderful! I would go back for those.  They were served with some kind of chicken sausage with pistachios in the middle... I didn't try it but it seemed like an interesting concept.  The prices were very reasonable and the service was good.   I'll be back!
