The big wong. Went here Thursday night for some quick dinner. I went safe and ordered the wonton noodles, my friend ordered what they thought would be beef and noodles - it was beef. Beer intestine lining. haha so they mostly ate the noodles and skipped some of the lining. Then my friend Jeff dropped some of the intestine lining into my bowl and I tried it - it was .... chewy. I think I'll skip stomach lining from now on. Other than that Â - the roast pork was delicious. The noodles were good and my wonton's were good! and it was cheap which is always nice. The service is ... well they get the food to you fast. They tend to skip the niceties and just ask what you want and bring it to you.
