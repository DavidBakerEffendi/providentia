Smurfalcious! On our last morning of our weekend in Philly, we went to brunch at Sabrina's.  As luck would have it, I think we got there just before mass let out as our party of 3 was seated within 5 minutes of arrival.  Soon there after, the crowds arrived and the hostess was quoting wait times which were much much longer.  I had the huevos rancheros, another of us had the breakfast burrito, and another had Asriel's special.  (There were several smurf centric offerings, which I loved, but not enough to forgo il mio preferito - uova e tortillas!)  Our dishes were tasty with generous portions and reasonable prices.  I'm determined to return soon for stuffed french toast.
