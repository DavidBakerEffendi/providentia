Lovely, little place with fresh branches of cherry blossoms decorating the bar... I had an excellent brunch there with two girlfriends two weeks ago, and all three of us would definitely come back. I had the french toast and it was covered in lots of fresh, chopped fruit (BONUS POINTS). The orange juice is freshly squeezed, and mimosas were perfect. The waitstaff are extremely attentive in refilling your glasses. I was a bit annoying when I arrived because I asked to switched tables and then moved some chairs around so that my girlfriends and I would be more comfortable (it's a small place)... The waitstaff were really funny and teased me the entire rest of the meal, but in a nice way. And by the end, one of them ran out to say "goodbye" to me. Very cute!
