When I visited this restaurant, it was my first experience with this type of fine dining. Not sure I can describe what I mean by that, but suffice it to say, I was out of my element. I felt I was dressed wrong, didn't know the right words or the appropriate protocol. To me, Bottle Label examination and cork sniffing and swirling and sniffing is something from a Honeymooner's Episode. But no one there made me feel that way at all. They welcomed me, did not allow me to make a fool of myself, and the food was excellent, and very reasonable. And, I know it doesn't sound like a lot to ask for, to not be made a fool of by restaurant staff, but what I mean is, they allowed me to have the full experience of their world class service, without making me feel like an ogre because I didn't understand it LOL.
