This place was great! I came here last year with a group of 25 students visiting NYC.  We called and they were so accommodating and gathered up tables for us in no time.  We come to NYC every year and plan to go back.  Actually planning to go back this week!!! On top of the service the pancakes and flavored butter was out of this world delicious!! I only wish I lived in NYC so I could come more than once a year!
