I took my parents, who were visiting from North Carolina, here one night because it looked like a very nice place for some satisfying a delicious food.  We were seated and were the only people there (early dinner).  First surprise: the staff dress code.  Yea, it's hot in the summer, but for a place with a menu in the $20-$30/plate range, I expect better than ripped jeans and Hanes' Comfy Fit tees...at least match the elegance of the decor. Our waiter came by a couple of times and razzed my Dad about a drink order, don't remember what exactly.  I was not amused.  The chef came by... nothing better to do since we were the only people there - wearing a dirty undershirt - with the waiter when we were ready to put in our food order.  My Mother was a little indecisive and the waiter was extremely pushy.  I understand that this is the north and people are jerks in general, and it's thought of as playful and fun, and apparently appropriate at fine-dining establishments.  However, my parents were visiting and the service here was pushing me to walk, much less leave any tip.  The food was decent, nothing good enough to bring me back. Seriously disappointed.
