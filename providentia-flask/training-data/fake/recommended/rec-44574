I hate being one of the few people giving this place such a low rating but I can't lie. The food did not impress me in any way. Went here for a late dinner a couple of nights ago, we were seated immediately. Service was great, so no complaints about that. If anything, that was the most redeeming part of my experience. Got 3 tacos: the Bistec (steak), Carne Enchilada (pork) and Pescado (fish). To be fair, I'm EXTREMELY biased because as far as fish tacos go especially, my heart lies in Nolita's Tacombi. I don't know why I even keep trying fish tacos at other places because Tacombi blows the competition out of the water. Every. Time. So my dissatisfaction with my tacos here is more related to my all-encompassing love for the other place. Now to break it down... Tortilla: a bit too dry for my taste Meat: I did enjoy the steak. The pork wasn't particularly memorable and the fish was like a slightly overcooked fish stick. Fried (as far as I can remember) but no crisp. Though it may have gotten soggy since I was trying to "save the best for last". It wasn't the best. Extras: I did like the pineapple in the pork taco, but there must be a better way of incorporating that flavor. Like instead of just putting chunks of pineapple in there, maybe make a pineapple salsa out of it? Just sayin'. Drinks: Got the sangria. Yummy, but nothing you can't get anywhere else. Do take this review with a grain of salt, because I know I'm being unfair as someone who's had the best fish tacos ever. So do what you will with it.
