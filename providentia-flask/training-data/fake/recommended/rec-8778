Went in there 2 mornings ago for a quick breakfast and a little introspection.  I love how small it is.  The two people working there were cool and calm.  No pressure and not overzealous with the order taking.  I loved their chicken, avocado, egg salad.  It was delicious.  I think it's almost impossible to find a good, satisfying salad that doesn't feel like some romaine lettuce was chopped with yesterday's carrots.  Salads are an art form of good food.  It takes effort.  Great salad.   Also, HUGE note, I'm a big tea drinker and they brought the extra saucer for the tea bag without asking.  Thank you!   I wonder if they have french fries...
