Great spot for authentic cuban food. Insanely cheap too (nothing more expensive than 7.95. Great fresh empenadas and ropa vieja was really good. Owners personally talked with us several times to make sure everything was good. Desserts, and the three layer milk cake specifically, are really good and again, cheap (cake $3, flan $1.50) Already making plans to go back.
