This is *the* hand drawn noodle place. It's the only one in town, and it's the place to be when you want some authentic hand drawn noodles (basically another type of noodles made in its own way). There are a variety of flavors for meat lovers and vegetarians alike. I'd recommend either the beef or the lamb. All of the bowls are under 7 dollars and should be enough to satisfy your appetite. Your visit to Chinatown will not be complete until you check out the hand drawn noodle house!
