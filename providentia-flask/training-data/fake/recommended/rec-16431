I found out about this place after one of my Korean employees walked in with something that smelled good and I asked WTF he was eating. He mentioned some hole in the wall joint off 28th St. I happened to swing by the place one boring afternoon and decided to check it out. I ordered some spicy pork dish that came with a mess load of tasty appetizers. It was awesome with the right combination of sweet and spicy! Since then I've come in once a week to order something different. My favorites are the spicy pork, bimbimbap, and even the dinky soup thing that comes with some dishes. The cool lady that works there told me she grows many of the veggies they use in the dishes in her garden. I prefer this place to KoFoo around the block. HIT Deli rivals some of the spots I've been to in K-Town, plus the prices are awesome. The owner, Kevin, is mad nice and always strikes up a good conversation when I swing by.
