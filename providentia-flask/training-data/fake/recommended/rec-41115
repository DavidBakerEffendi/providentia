Food and service were excellent. We had a bad table but that is not their fault. However, when we left the restaurant both my date and I noticed how much our clothes stank of old oil. One day of airing later and our coats, sweaters and scarves are still stinking. I'm not going to go back there unless they do something about the ventilation.
