Came here for brunch on a Saturday (like most of my fellow yelpers). The place has really nice decor. Unfortunately, like most of the dining in Park Slope, it's tiny. The hostess was really nice though. We got seated and ordered from their brunch menu. So, it's 14 bucks for an entree and a drink. Unfortunately, no alcoholic drinks. I had the lemonade and my GF had their Strawberry Rhubarb. My GF liked her drink, but this is my review not hers. I tried both and they tasted pretty bland to me. Not sweet enough. I ordered their bread basket (7 bucks for bread!?!?) It was really really good bread!! There were 3 kinds of bread and a scone. I wonder if they freshly baked it because it tasted that good. Everything was warm and didn't even need butter or jam. Best bread I ever had. It did come with their rasperry jam which was really good too. I didn't need it though. Our dishes came much later. I had their three eggs your way and my GF had the blueberry crepes. The eggs were a little overcooked for my tastes, but the bacon and roasted potatoes were really good. Bacon was crispy and potatoes had some seasoning or something. Crepes were good too, you can taste the blueberries. Overall, really good experience! Plan to come back for dinner one day. Pros: Great food for $14. OMGOSH DO YOU BAKE YOU BREAD WITH CRACK!? Service is friendly! Nice Decor Cons: Slow service (I think is the small kitchen) Small (like most good places) No Mimosa or bloody mary included!?!? Drinks are BLAND
