Sorry, Maddys, but I'm thoroughly confused about all the positive reviews.  Have your reviewers never eaten Mexican food before??? I had lunch here recently and was incredibly disappointed. Ordered guacamole appetizer and was given a bowl of onions with a little bit of unripe avocado and tomatoes mixed in.   Entree combo of enchilada with chile relleno was likewise very poor.  Sauces tasted flat and I left more than half of my plate behind uneaten. I might not have bothered to write such an unfavorable review for a small, family restaurant, but I I feel like all of the, apparently fake, positive reviews need to be tempered by some truth.
