This place is nice, pretty snug.  I've had my share of pho before and I've never seen anything as skimpy on the size of the dish, that's not to say its bad.  The spring rolls were excellent.  Service was mediocre, its kind of like the factory atmosphere I've seen from other peoples reviews.  I'd give it 4 stars if the soup was bigger and the service friendlier.  I'll definitely be back and hope it's a little better next time.
