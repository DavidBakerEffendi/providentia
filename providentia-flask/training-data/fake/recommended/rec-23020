the only thing to dislike is the wait for a table, UNTIL YOU GET YOUR TABLE!!!  this place is amazing. great beer selection, menu, waitstaff, vibe,... We ordered pickled veggies, hard cheese plate, onion rings, and bleu cheese toast apps, all delicious and delivered almost immediately. i mean like less than 5 minutes. I didn't care for the menu mussel offering and asked if they had another preparation, the waitress informed the chef and he made a kimchi broth for them that was delicious, with enough grilled toast for the table to help mop up the sauce. The chicken leg entree was reported as the best chicken they have ever eaten, the fish and chips tender, perfectly cooked with a light not greasy batter, and the veggie burger with jalapeños and caramelized onions was awesome. The table split a Pumpkin Pie/Cheesecake- amazing. This is the type of meal that i dont care what it costs, because everything is so good. cant wait to go back. great patagonia store across the street for the table wait.
