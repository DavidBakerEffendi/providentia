I'm going to preface this review by saying that I am half Cuban, and my father's family has owned several Cuban restaurants in Florida over the last 50 years. This is by far one of the most authentic (and good!) Cuban restaurant I have been to in NYC EVER. I even brought my Cuban relatives (who have owned Cuban restaurants themselves) here and they loved it (and they are tough critics!). We've tried almost everything on the menu, and you can't go wrong. It's also pretty affordable for NYC. Love love love this place!
