This is THE ORIGINAL steak place. Went to check out all the fuss. Very good steak... but just not a ton of meat for the roll. All in all, flavor is good, but size is too small for 8 bucks. Environment is cool... if you're okay with feeling pressured to get your order in quick so they can get to the next customer. Actually felt stressed as I approached, cause the dude at the counter was just yelling 'Next' over and over again every 2 seconds... and with a line around the building... u get the point. Even though I only gave it a 3, I'll still go back if I'm in the area.
