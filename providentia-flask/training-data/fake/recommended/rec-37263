This review is only for the breakfast, as I have not tried the lunch options. Sometimes, you're just in the mood for a breakfast sandwich.  Nothing fancy, nothing too involved, just egg, cheese and meat on a roll.  The Ranch House is a good choice if that is your aim. The location is set back a bit, just after the Hartford line and right next to Exit 34 on I-91.  There is always plenty of parking, even around prime breakfast hours.   The breakfast sandwiches are good and are prepared quickly.  They use sausage links for the sausage, egg and cheese, and the sandwiches are just the right size (not too big and messy, not too small so you feel like it's a snack).   If you need a quick breakfast on the way to work or before a long drive, this is a good option.
