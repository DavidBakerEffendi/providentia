I loved everything about this place, and the owner herself is amazing. Coming here was very random. Me and my girlfriend were just out cruising the town looking for something to eat. The 1st place we ran into just closed, but nevertheless the bartender guided us to "The Tavern on Camac". Everything about this place was amazing and the food was so flavorful and the customer service was out of this world amazing. I'll be going back today BTW to get there grilled cheese and tomato soup for lunch :)
