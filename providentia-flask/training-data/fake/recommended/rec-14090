My boyfriend took me here for dinner to celebrate our second anniversary and wow, was it good! First off, I like how cozy and comfortable the restaurant is.  It's not shoebox small like some places in Manhattan can be but it's not huge and doesn't feel cramped. Second, the FOOD: - I ordered the special, which was rare ahi tuna with capers and chickpea fritter.  It was very good. - My boyfriend ordered the hangar steak - wooow.  Tender sliced pieces with perfectly sauteed mushrooms.  I'll probably get that the next time I come here. - The risotto.  Probably my favorite thing we ordered that night.  It has a great texture that's not super soft like you're eating almost-porridge.  And those chili grapes add a surprisingly pleasant kick to the whole dish. - We were so stuffed that we could only have a scoop of ice cream for dessert.  We got the salted caramel, which was not as good as I was hoping but it was still a nice way to end our meal. Thank you Yelpers for showing my boyfriend a great place to take us!
