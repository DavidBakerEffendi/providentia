I was walking to grocery store one afternoon when I came across this lovely place. I was very pleased with the rotisserie chicken, the meat was so juicy and the herbs were delicious. We had the kale mashed potatoes and creamy cauliflower, both equally good. And The CARROT CAKE was the best carrot cake next to my grandmothers carrot cake. So moist and fluffy Yumm!!! My mouth is watering now. A must for lunch or dinner! Or if you need a quick dinner on way home for your family. The workers were all very friendly and helpful. Â will be going back, for sure!
