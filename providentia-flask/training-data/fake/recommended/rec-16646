I'm sad to have to say this but I was disappointed by my visit here for brunch (10/26/14). I'm under 5 feet and weigh less than 100lbs, and left hungry. Extremely small portion sizes. I ordered the $22 Char Brunch and opted for the pulled pork and crispy grits. The pulled pork could have fit easily into the palm of my very small hand.... maybe 1/4 cup if I'm being generous.... the crispy grit cake was fine, decent flavor but also small, approximately saucer-sized. I left brunch hungry, went home and cooked myself a meal. That should not happen at that price point. I've visited several times before and do not recall the portions being that small. Perhaps someone underestimated the brunch rush? Smh. My friend ordered the pancakes which had good flavor but were a smidge bigger than silver dollar sized (3 to the order). I would stick to drinks here.
