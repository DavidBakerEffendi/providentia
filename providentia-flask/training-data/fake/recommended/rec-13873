seriously good pizza. i came here on a friend's recommendation, and tried a slice of the margherita and a slice of the spinach & artichoke. the margherita had a fairly thin crust and spinach & artichoke was pretty thick -- and both were delish. slices were huge. i ate the margherita and probably would have eaten the entire spinach & artichoke if the guy sitting next to me on the bench hadn't suggested otherwise. so i took it home and heated it up the next day, and it was just as good. prices were cheap. ordering was a bit confusing, and then getting your pizza after you ordered was also a bit confusing (the space is tiny and crowded). but i got my pizza, and it was good, so all turned out well!
