I like their food. However, when normal places sell Chocolate Bars for 150 they sell for 399. I know, it's preposterous. why do they do this?! Maybe to make up for all the flowers they dont sell at the end of their week. But, their prices do not make the food taste worse. The food is good. Location is great. It would be better if the workers enjoyed their job. Starting with that Korean Lady who sets the mood for everyone.
