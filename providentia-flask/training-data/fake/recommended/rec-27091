All this is is a late night drunk spot to get a slice or steak or wings and THEY KNOW IT! They know they're gonna get ur money so they decided to cut back on food and service. Tonight i ordered 10 wings. When I got home (after waiting 20 mins following a phone order) i encountered 10 recently frozen wings and a side of hot sauce and bleu cheese dressing. Â I called and the manager (i recognized his voice) told me "well thats how we do wings now. Previously i had gone for cheesestaeaks and found them lite on steak and VERY heavy on onions. Im not a jerk ive been going here a lot because it was local and had had several bad experiences there. They have screwed up deliveries, and made cold, crappy food. This place totally blows. If u want frozen wings, over- salted food, and shitty customer service, then look no further. I will not go back. And this is the first place i have EVER said that about on yelp. Do us all a favor and let this place blow in the wind. Update: i just threw out 5 of my 10 wings. This place sucks. LARGE
