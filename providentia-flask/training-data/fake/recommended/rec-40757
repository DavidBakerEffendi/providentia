the food is fairly cheap, but much better tasting than any of the other shitholes in the same price range. the delivery is ridiculously fast. they cook the food real quick which is good cause once i've set my mind on ordering from here, i want it now. lunch specials are great, and so are the small dinner plates, cause you can get a full meal for like 5 bucks. the chicken with garlic sauce is banging. i would highly recommend going into the restaurant, because Sam will only further enrich your experience. i had to have a talk with him in regards to his fortune cookies and their horrible non-fortunes, like "it is a sunny day". so we decided to come up with our own fortunes, and he said he wanted to make one that read "don't fucking come back" *said in the voice of an angel. perfect.
