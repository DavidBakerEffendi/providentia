Amazing!! Best hot chocolate I have ever had. Perfect sizes menu. My husband loves the brenner burger above all other burgers. The waiters are always happy to help me find a gluten free entree. Never had any problems with gluten here. I purchased a tin of hot chocolate to take home only to realize it was expired. I called the next day and by the next afternoon they had shipped me a new tin. Wish I could go here everyday!!
