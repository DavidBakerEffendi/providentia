Got there just before 11am today and didn't have to wait coz it was just me, so I settled in at the bar. Ordered the Clinton St omelette with tomatoes and mushrooms which was really just meh. The omelette had such a consistent color and texture to it that I wondered if it was pre-prepared and just wrapped around the fillings. Nothing fantastic in terms of flavor. The hashbrowns that came with it though were pretty yummy but not something worth waiting in line for. Maybe I should have ordered the pancakes, but stuffing my face with a big portion of carbs for breakfast isn't really my thing. Also, they need to fix their toilets. Overall: a nice option to have on your dining list but not a must-try.
