Where have these pancakes been all my life?! My friend and I had dinner here on Friday night since we both were in the mood for pancakes, and since the restaurant is known for their pancakes, it was a no brainer. We both split the banana walnut pancakes and added chocolate chips and I have to say they were the second best pancakes I've had in my life (first best was at a pancake house in LA). We also had the bacon and eggs pasta which I also highly recommend and the cheese grits were pretty good too. Bottom line, if you want delicious fluffy pancakes with a side of crack (aka warm mapple butter drizzle) then this is definitely the place for you.
