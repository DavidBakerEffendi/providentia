I had walked by this place about 1,000,000 times and finally decided to stop in for dinner with the BF.  The hostesses were super friendly and sat us at a table in the back, the server was a little...overly attentive and kind of pushy. Not as pushy as the girl serving the table next to us. If she was my server the review would be 3 stars.  The food was good, boarding delicious.  My boyfriend got the mussels and I honestly I forgot what I had. I only remember the jalapeno cheddar grits. OH MY GOD AMAZING! Best grits I have had in the city and I have been to many a brunch locals. I might go back but probably for brunch, maybe dinner but only if it is someone else's idea. I wish I could give 3.5 stars. I am kind of a fan but it is better than okay.
