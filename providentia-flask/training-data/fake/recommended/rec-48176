Seriously, no one in Bayonne should ever order from Fontana's ever again. They messed up my order and I've been waiting over 45 minutes for them to come and fix it. When I called to complain the owner answers the phone and tells me she has no driver, that I need to just wait until they get around to bringing the order back, and HUNG UP ON ME. I called back to say I don't even want the food I just want a refund, and she hung up AGAIN. Never again. Ever.
