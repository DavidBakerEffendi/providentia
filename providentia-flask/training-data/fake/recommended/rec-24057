Excellent Service, excellent food, overall great experience. My husband and I got a gift card to this place, decided to stop in last week and both left waaay happier than we expected to. It feels like mediocre service nowadays is something to rave about. Most Philly establishments are "too cool to need your business" and people still support them for some reason. But this place had a really old-school Philly feel. As in, they wanted us to enjoy our time and food. The server was pretty young but still handled everything like a pro, and made us feel like she was personally hosting us in her home or something. She was very warm! I got a burger with extra cheese and long hots and my husband got a Stromboli and both were *delish.* Â Portions were superb if you're monster-eaters like us & prices were pretty darn good too! Its a shame to see the bad reviews because we had such a good time. Not sure what that's about, but I TOTALLY recommend! Yayyyy Santuccis! *UPDATE* got delivery--they messed up our order, then the girl on the phone lied about it, then i caught her in the lie which was awkward, and then they promptly delivered the correct order and asked us to give them the other back....... laaaame. dissapointing. so i would say eat in I guess.
