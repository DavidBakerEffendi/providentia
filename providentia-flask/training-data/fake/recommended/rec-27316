I was taken to this lovely place yesterday by my lover, was a surprise date so I didn't know what to expect or what choice of food I would be eating that day. We walked right passed the location, in the midst of talking trying to find bodhi tree.  Finally found it and that's when I was told I would be eating Thai which happens to be one of my favorite foods. Waiter that sat us was really nice and perfected the right amount of attention to give us. We were given the option to choose our own table, so I picked the table alongside the open doors on this beautiful Sunday afternoon.  I chose to go with the lunch special, which included two appetizers and one entree. I decided on the veggie dumplings, chicken wings - fried rice with shrimp that had a mixture of salad included. I couldn't believe how much food came with order to the point I forgot I had food left over. More surprised of how pleased I was with the food and service. Bathroom- extremely clean and modern. Background Music  & Atmosphere-  Gentle peaceful vibe with ambient music.
