Have you ever wondered what the food in Heaven would taste like? If you have than head to Chinatown, Philadelphia's best neighborhood when it comes to consistently good food at an affordable price in this reviewer's opinion. The food at Rangoon, is simply transcendent. I've been going since the Summer of 2001 and have never had a bad meal. Now I've eaten at several good restaurants in Philly but the one I always go back to for a meal that not only nourishes the stomach, as well as the soul is Rangoon. Located right across from a recently built condo called the Pearl, think modern Dharma initiative architecture, you can't miss the large green and gold sign with the former name of Myanmar (formerly Burma) written in letters so large they may be visible from space. Once inside Christine, and the staff are efficient and friendly. Willing to explain Burmese cuisine, think a happy marriage between Thai and Indian. For appetizers start with the Thousand Layer Bread with either Vatana Bean Dip, Barbecued Beef, curried chicken or potato dip. Despite it's name the surprisingly thin fried dough bread is a crunchy, slightly greasy treat that really compliments any of the available sides, think of it as the Burmese culinary equivalent of a Swiss army knife. Entrees such as the curried beef, Chili Monkfish, mango chicken, or any of the assorted rice dishes are well seasoned and flavorful. However, be warned if you order any dishes, whether it's meat, fish or vegetarian, and don't pay for the coconut rice you will have gotten to the gates of Heaven only to have St.. Peter deny you access. Coconut rice is a must with any entree! For desert try the Thousand Layer Bread with coconut syrup, which will leave you wondering where has coconut syrup been all your life. So try Rangoon and only tell those you truly love and respect about it. After all Heaven wouldn't be that great if you had to make reservations.
