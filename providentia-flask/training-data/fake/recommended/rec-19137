This is a French Rustic Restaurant in NYC if I've ever seen one. Decor - authentic. Wines - authentic. Attitude... ok, no, New York French, which is a much nicer version of the original. I must admit. Maybe because the owner is from Strasbourg and I am just too Parisian. I don't know. As I sat there admiring the bottles and the decor with my handsome man, the owner came over to take our order. We just wanted some wine because we were waiting for friends, Â we didn't know how many or when, and that was fine with him. Given the authentic feel of the place, I asked if he had some Buzet (it's so rare in NYC, but Buzet is my favorite) . He said we used to, but Americans are not familiar with it so they don't buy it and we had to cancel our orders. You should have this (whatever it was), instead. As he came back, he was holding three glasses of wine instead of two. He said he had just ordered a bunch of cases of a wine which was not yet on the carte, but would be much more to my taste. And that was a free glass of wine, just to get a random customer's feedback. And it was exactly the type of wine I was looking for. I'll pass on the food (home-made, delicious, very "terroir"). I'll pass on the decor (I am sure you can find pictures on line). It really was one of the most pleasant French restaurants I have been to in a while, in France or otherwise. The atmosphere, the space (much bigger than Veloce, by the way), the prices, and...just the quality. I am just sad I had to leave New York so shortly after having found it.
