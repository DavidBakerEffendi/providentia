I was lucky enough to dine here to celebrate my birthday.  My fiance and I ordered, you guessed it, steak, and it was delicious!  I had the filet, he had the NY strip.  Salt, pepper and butter is all this meat needs - definitely the best steaks we've ever eaten.   Sides are a la carte, and can be shared - against my better judgment, I ordered mashed potatoes instead of fries.  I would definitely not order them again, I've had better at Bonefish Grill!  There were at least 10 other sides to choose from, including veggies, so next time I'll opt for something else. As others have mentioned, bread and butter is complimentary.  We also had the calamari, which was good.  But the only thing really spectacular was the steak! Our waiter, Eric, took good care of us, along with his "assistant" (i.e. busboy).  Staff really go out of their way to be...formal.  Where else does the hostess hand a black napkin to persons who happen to be wearing black pants?  I've never seen such a thing.   I don't know much about wine, but I know enough to tell you that the wine list here is extensive.  If you're not a fan, go with a Belvedere martini!  We looked at the dessert menu and our waiter recommended the Chocolate Explosion Cake, but we were stuffed.   We'll definitely be going back for more steak.  :)   If you get a craving, be ready to spend some dough.  As others have mentioned, the whole show about the 500 degree plates is...interesting...but the waiters take it VERY seriously and will repeat the warning several times!!  Be ready for it...
