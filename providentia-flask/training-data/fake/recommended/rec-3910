Been going to this place since they were located on Classon a few years back. I'm glad they made the move to Franklin Avenue and have more space now. The quality is still as good as ever, but now you don't have to wait forever for a table. Amazing lunch menu where you can grab a delicious torta and some great soup for $6.  The happy hour deals are fantastic also.  It's hard to find anything that isn't good on the menu.
