I mean how can you possibly not leave five stars here ? The worst that could happen to you at this outrageously charming restaurant français de la Côte d'Azur pendant is that they run out of toilet paper on a Sunday brunch cause the place gets packed ! The various Crêpe Variations here are a charme to the gourmand. If you're a connoisseur of the laisser faire of French dining, if you enjoy guitar solo music and an adorable wait staff then sit in their little sunny sidewalk seating area, wear your RayBans, a mime shirt, order their fabulous fresh mint ice tea and vibe the savoir vivre at Pâtés et Traditions ! You guys have a new regular now, I'll come with a mustache next time
