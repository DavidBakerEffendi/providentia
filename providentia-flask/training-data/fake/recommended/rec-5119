i finally got to the Brooklyn Beet Company. It is a super cute, farm to table, kind of place. I have only heard good things. Today I ordered up my favorite drink, the Bloody Mary. I saw it was premade. No big deal-it saves time, i get it. I took the first sip-terrible. It was more like a horseradish drink. Huge chunks of horse radish took over my mouth. Im not sure if they understand that lots of horseradish does not a bloody mary make. No olives. No olive juice (that i could taste). No hot sauce. No black pepper. It was nothing but horseradish, ice and tomato juice. gross. BUT THEN...YALL...BUT THEN! THE FOOD CAME OUT! i ordered the korzo burger with a side of greens and cole slaw. it was amazing. the burger was perfection with applewood bacon and some kind of sauce. what was it? i dont care because it was amazing. the greens consisted off beet leaves (surprise surpise) and tomatoes and an amazing rosemary-lemon vinaigrette. My partner got the Â potato latke dish. also AMAZING. she cleaned her plate. Moral of the story: the food is an A+++ but the bloody marys are an F. I just stick to the beer next time.
