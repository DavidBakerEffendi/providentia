This place is cool.  You order in one area and then go two spots down and eat in another spot.  The dining area looks like a picnic area and is really clean and nice.  The staff is super friendly.  Their lobster roll is not very traditional, so if you're looking for something like they serve at the Lobster Roll Restaurant in Montauk (LUNCH), it's not like that.  It is good, but not amazing or great.  I'm not saying I didn't enjoy what we ordered, BUT, for us, it's not worth the trip out to Brooklyn to get it.  :/
