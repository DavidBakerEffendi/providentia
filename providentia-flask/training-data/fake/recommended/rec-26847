Yum Cha in NJ?!? After living in New Jersey for 5 years now I finally found a Dim Sum restaurant worthy of being almost but not quite as equal as those found in San Francisco.  The quality of each dumpling (Har Gow, Fan Gor, etc.) are as plump and flavorful as those found in the Bay Area.  The pai guat (cut up pork ribs steamed in blackbean sauce) came out hot and tasty!  A couple servings of this juicy dish with a bowl of rice beats a burger any day!  It's too bad that this restaurant is a good 35 minutes away from Bergen County.  Else, I'd be there every Sunday!  They also serve Cantonese BBQ dishes and hearty char siu wonton mein soups during the week.  Check out this link for pictures of this restaurant:  offthebroiler.wordpress.… If you're ever in New Jersey this is one dim sum house not to miss.
