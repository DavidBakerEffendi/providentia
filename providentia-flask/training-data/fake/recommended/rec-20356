We went to this place last night for my best friend's birthday - it was amazing. First of all, I had flowers delivered that day to the restaurant to surprise my friend during dinner and not only did the owner Doug call me to let me know he'd spoken to the florist, but they kept the flowers in their refrigerator during the day so that they wouldn't wilt. When we arrived the lovely hostess seated us promptly despite the longish line and our lack of reservation (since we were less than 5 people) for a table because they could tell that it was a big occasion. They also brought the flowers over to the table at the perfect time so that my friend could be surprised by them. The food was amazing, the fried chicken is out of this world, even if you're not a fried chicken person. Â Ditto on the squash ricotta tart and the homemade pickles. Absolutely delicious. In addition to the superb food the service was just as excellent. This was our first time at Buttermilk Channel but they made us feel like regulars and that's what will keep us coming back. Thanks again for making my buddy's birthday special!
