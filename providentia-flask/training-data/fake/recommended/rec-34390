Wow - this pizza is over the top! My husband and I were visiting from NY and had a desire for a thin crust tasty pizza.  We heard about this place from the locals and sat at the pizza bar to watch the pizza being made.  We first came across Jason, who made each crust with care using a unique method to spread the dough to a perfect thin crust consistency.  Next, Richard loaded up the crust with a sauce that was sweet yet authentic (being of Italian descent, I can honestly say this sauce was one of the best I've had outside of my grandma's).  The sauce did not make the crust soggy and my pizza was topped with roasted (not fried) eggplant, carmelized onions and the most freshest basil and homemade motzarella cheese that made the pizza extra special.  A drizzle or two of extra virgin olive oil was added just before Griffin put the pies in the oven.  The oven (which I'm sure was imported from Italy) cooked our pizzas quickly and I was amazed to watch Griffin take pizza after pizza out of that oven without burning one!  The flair and timing to have these personal pizzas cooked just right was a talent in and of itself !  The dining experience at this place was certainly enhanced by the staff.  Our server Jenna was also personable and helpful as we ordered wine and checked in  on us from time to time to ensure we didn't need anything (despite the busy pace and tables full of hungry diners).  This place was a home run for food, service and friendliness!  A heartfelt 'have a good night' in  Italian was wished to us as we departed.  What a great place to eat and locals are lucky to have such a gem in Burlington!!
