I was very excited to try this place due the pretty great reviews, I left disappointed. I went at 7:15 on a Wednesday night which apparently is not the night to stop by- we were the only ones in the whole place. I ordered the sweet tea and thought it was meh. Too sweet overall. Then when my boyfriend and I went to order the waitress told us they were not only out of cornbread*, they were out of three sides (dirty rice, red beans, and potato salad)! So I ordered the ribs with greens and candied sweets. The ribs were very fatty and while the candied sweets had a great flavor, they were very mushy. The only redeeming part of my meal was the greens. They had a little spiciness to them which I though was delicious. My boyfriend had the pulled pork with greens and mac & cheese. The reason I gave this place two stars instead of one is because of the pulled pork. It was some of the best we've ever eaten and I'm not usually one for pulled pork. Very tender and the BBQ sauce was tangy and sweet- my favorite. He loved the greens but said the mac & cheese was so-so. Lastly, we wanted to order dessert and were excited by the options listed, however when we went to order, they were out of everything but peach cobbler. We decided not to bother. I may try this place again for the pulled pork but at lunch time instead of dinner time. Maybe they won't be out of so many items if I go earlier in the day. (* the waitress did come over later with one small piece of cornbread, saying she remembered she had one left. The small piece I had was tasty but not extraordinary)
