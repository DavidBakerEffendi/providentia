You know a pizza has a nice thin crust and is cooked in a blazing hot oven when you order it fresh and it's ready in 7 minutes flat. I used to go here once every couple weeks when I worked in Bayonne the last few years. I'd usually go with sausage, peppers, onions, and mushrooms. The toppings are good but the crust is the real stand out here: nice and crispy on the outside and good and gooey on the inside.
