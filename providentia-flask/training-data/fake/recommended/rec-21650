MUST for happy hour.......good food, good drinks.....the bartender Jason is wonderful....very attentive.....When ordering off the happy hour menu, I would not recommend the caper/goat cheese flat bread....the others are great.  Also, the lettuce cups are greasy.....stay away.  I always get the chicken satay...awesome....
