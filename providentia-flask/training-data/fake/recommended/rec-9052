I like the interior and general vibe of this place, I live close by so I've been several times. This last time I ordered the " All you can eat Maryland Blue Crabs" everything was fine, the crabs were small but seeing as it was an unlimited quantity and low price that's expected. I think some crab paper, or news paper on the table would have been nice, four people eating crabs makes quite a mess, our bucket of shells was never emptied, we kept crunching down the shells to try and make more room. Also Mallets? I mean if you have MD hard shells as a regular special all summer long you gotta get some crab mallets. Â  I like Fish, but I hope the next time I come back for the crabs they've made it more crab crackin' friendly.
