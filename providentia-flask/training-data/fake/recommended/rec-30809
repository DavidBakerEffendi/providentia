The food wasn't bad, but it also wasn't the best food I have ever had. I'm giving it two stars because it was insanely over priced. Although food in Brooklyn is expensive a lot of the time, I felt like this meal was especially outrageous. It cost me 17.00 for a muffin, a small sandwich, and a small orange juice.
