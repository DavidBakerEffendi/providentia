This restaurant featuring Northern and Eastern Indian cuisine is hands down my favorite restaurant in Prospect Lefferts Gardens. This superlative-filled rant comes with a very rare five stars from me. Why haven't I reviewed this place sooner? The thing that struck me most about this place is the obvious family-run nature of the establishment. My first visit was on a first date and involved a late realization that they had closed down the restaurant (we had overstayed by a few hours AFTER paying the bill); the staff were outside chatting, patiently waiting for us, and bid us sweet farewells despite that we kept them so long. Seriously: where does that happen in New York?? -And less than $20 total for two people, including generous tip. The food is pretty amazing. It isn't haute cuisine, but this isn't your average Indian joint either. Everything from the chutneys, and the breads, to the entrees have well balanced and unique qualities. Even the saag paneer, what some might consider one of the more mundane options at some Indian buffet, is rich in garlic and showcases fresh (not overcooked or mushy!) spinach. If you ask nicely, take the opportunity to use the restroom. You have to go through the kitchen, and you'll see quite the spectacle: this is an awesome kitchen full of fresh ingredients. I've started ordering more or less randomly off the menu and have yet to be disappointed. If I were to find any faults, they would include slightly overcooked chicken and shrimp (I suppose preferable to undercooked), and a respectable but uninspiring house salad. I also find their baingan bartha on the sweet side. -But I'm really nitpicking here. The delivery has been good to me (plan for 45+ minutes for cooked to order food), though apparently not to some of the reviewers here. Do yourself a favor and eat in-restaurant at least once. I find I get excited every time I decide to eat here. It's truly a gem!
