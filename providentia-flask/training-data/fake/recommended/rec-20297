Had a fantastic brunch on a lovely sunny day. BF ordered a salmon, poached egg and asparagus special, and I had the chai French toast. His meal was stupendous, mine was good - the chai was sort of sporadic, so some bits were very flavorful and others just tasted like average French toast. The two slices were nice thick Texas toast pieces. Whipped cream and berries topped it off!
