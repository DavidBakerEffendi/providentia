As a Thai aficionado, I'd def recommend  a pit stop to Brooklyn for their Pad Thai and green curry.. mouth watering! They also have neat specials and great prices.. but bring cash, no credit cards accepted.  The bar cocktails are pretty great.. and also be prepared to spend some time there as I've never waited under a half an hour for a seat for 2.  On warmer days they open their back patio which is intimate and cozy.. Oh.. and seating is very tight, so expect to have ppl listening in on your conversations!
