Attitudinal "hostess" ruined it all.  we had called ahead after making the res, mentioning it was our anniversary.  Eye rolls, attitude when we questioned being placed at a table IN FRONT OF THE DOOR.   Sorry dear hostess that we interrupted your fun in the back of the restaurant by wanting to be seated.  Ugh.  Went to Los Cosnuelos and had a FAB meal.
