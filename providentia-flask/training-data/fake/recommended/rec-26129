Don't buy anything from PizzaMaster and the nasty owner Vinnie Sita .The way he spoke to my wife was disgusting .He is lucky I wasn't there because I would smashed his face with his pizza paddle .The way to talks to his employees is disgrace .We bought a large pie that wasn't cut through and the cheese was all over the place .He told my wife the reason why the cheese was that way was she dropped it .He screamed at her on the phone in front of my daughter .He than told her to bring it back so he can look at it . Please people don't waste your money going to that assholes pizzeria .
