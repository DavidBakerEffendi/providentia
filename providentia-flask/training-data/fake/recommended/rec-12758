This review is long overdue... I booked this venue for my best friends bridal shower on a Saturday afternoon in July. I reached out to dozens of venues about this event, but something about my initial contact with the owner's sister, made this venue the stand-out early on. The owner's sister was completely receptive and responsive. After that initial contact, I communicated directly with Isabella (owner), who was equally responsive. I can't say how important that quality is... I found so many restaurant's unresponsive and I felt more like a burden than a welcomed customer. I was very honest with Isabella about my budget and we came up with something that worked well for both of us. The restaurant is cozy but accommodated our group of 25 women perfectly with enough space for a dessert and gift table. The decor is adorable and all guests agreed that it was perfect for the bride! The waitstaff was wonderfully accommodating. And the food was AMAZING. My party was served family style and the food was more than enough. We enjoyed the adult grilled cheese, pretzel fried chicken, a summer pasta, and the "bride's bouquet" salad. Everything was delicious. My cousin and I also had brunch there and we were very pleased with the French toast and shrimp and grits. Soooo good! A number of guests commented about wanting to return to the restaurant and I know I definitely will!
