Tom's rules. When we moved to the neighborhood one year ago, we found this gem of a restaurant and fell in love with it. Not only is the food/service/decor great, but the owner Gus is the friendliest and most overly gracious host you could hope for. Crabcakes are some of the best I have ever tasted. Where else do you find egg creams and lime rickeys? Eating at Tom's is like taking a trip back in time.  Members of the Brooklyn Dodgers used to wander over to Tom's for ice cream after the games at Ebbets Field. Whenever we need to know something, like where to get our car fixed and not get ripped off, I  can go to Gus and ask him. He always steers me right.
