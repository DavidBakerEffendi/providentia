Food was OK - the green sauce was the best thing about dinner.  Sangria was especially good - sweet, but still gave a decent and not overpowering buzz.  Prices were a bit high, service was unremarkable, and the atmosphere was loud.  There were several birthday celebrations a la Olive Garden - I was not expecting that at a place that cost this much.  Definitely not a place for a business dinner, but it is fine for hanging out with friends because you'll be yelling the entire meal to be heard above the enormous crowds and house music (BOOSH BOOSH BOOSH BOOSH BOOSH BOOSH!).  I'd go again if a friend wanted to go, but it wouldn't be someplace I'd personally suggest as a first-choice place.
