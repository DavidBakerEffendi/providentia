Great place to stop and get some quick Korean food. Especially if you dont know what you want or if you want to try some new items. There's premade lunch boxes and a buffet serving hot and cold foods. They have a variety of asian soups and desserts as well. You can get $1 white rice, brown rice, and miso soup too! I also like the buffet set up cause it allows me to create a vegetarian lunch. Highlights: Steamed Bun with red bean filling - delicious! Kimchi Fried Rice Chili Tofu Im sure I could find better Korean food elsewhere but for the convenience this place is great. If youre looking for something quick (lunch for example) this is a great place.
