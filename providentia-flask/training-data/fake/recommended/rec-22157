Yo, I'm like the super average dude, and this place, THIS PLACE, was phenomenal. Seriously, went here for a friend's birthday (my gf and some of her friends) and we had an awesome time. The bartender reco'd a tasty wine. It was well priced, but didn't taste cheap. Which I appreciate, cuz they could've screwed us over with something that tastes like Yellowtail, but they didn't. It was a semi-dry full body red, hints of a ton of different shit...blah, blah, blah...all of that, Bottom line=delicious. I drink a lot of wine, and I know good ones. This was one of them. Just ask, they're good at suggesting the right ones. Next, the food. Small plates. Not always my favorite, but these delivered portions that we shared between four people. The big plates, um, equally as delicious, and well worth our time and palettes. We had a bunch. Definitely try the POLENTA. It's not to be missed. Which I'm sure tons of other people will reco, so I'll add the MEATBALLS to the list. Why? Because I'm a dude, I like to get full, and they were delightfully soft, full of flavor, and swimming in a tomato sauce that would make an Italian grandmother proud. The chef came out to check on us, which is always a nice touch. My GF grilled him about his techniques, and he was super hospitable about answering questions. This place is a no-brainer. If you like robust food and honest service, you'll quickly find out why this wine and tapas-esque bar has "Austere" in the name.
