"The Birthplace of the Hamburger"  This is by far the best burger I have ever had.  This place is no frills and No they don't have ketchup!  The burger is cooked just like they did back in 1898.  Be sure to bring your patience and don't stop here if you are in a rush.  A Burger and drink was about $7 which I thought was a little high, but I have been charged more for a lot less.  The line starts forming about 15 minutes before they open and they don't precook ANYTHING.  Some people order a couple burgers, but big orders like the guy in front of me ordering 15 burgers can really make your wait time very long.   The kitchen help and cashier are funny but working very hard to get everyone served as quickly as possible.
