FOOD WAS SO FCKN GOOD. Small place, looks like they just turned a basement into a restaurant. Gives it more of a authentic feel. Our waiter was pretty nice. Â  Gnocchi Al Gorgonzola was SOOOOOO AMAZING as the appetizer. We had to order another one because 1 serving was not enough for two people. I ordered La Bistecca for the dinner portion.. it was so good. Grilled steak + rucola salad. Huge portion for me, had to share. Definitely coming back again! :) xo
