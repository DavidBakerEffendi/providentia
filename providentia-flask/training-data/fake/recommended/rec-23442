Girlfriend and I went here for an early dinner. I ordered a duck confit sandwich and she had a brisket sandwich. Both were so good we go another, the chicken biscuit sandwich. The chicken breast was perfectly fried and glazed with sweet chilly served on a delicious buttery biscuit. Â I am planning on heading back for another chicken biscuit in the next couple of days. They were three of the best sandwiches I have ever had.
