ate here yesterday with some friends - great food! i had the salmon tacos. I cant even tell you how good they were. i am so happy i ordered them. all my friends got burritos. they all raved about how good they were. i also ordered the said of guacamole. very very good. they had a nice size drink list and it was really cute in side. cant wait to go back with my husband!
