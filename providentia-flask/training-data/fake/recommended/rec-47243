Meh. I really used to like this place. I've ordered delivery from here multiple times but tonight will probably be the last. I waited an hour and a half for my food . When it arrived it was cold and smushed. The shrimp was rubbery and the SO insanely salty i could barely eat it- my esophagus is currently burning. Not to mention the dish was maybe half the size it normally is- I would know because I've ordered it several times before. Bye bye Fonda!
