A.kitchen has broken so many molds for me. I don't live by many codes, but never going to hotel restaurants was a rule to live by.  I broke this rule when I went to a.kitchen and it's been my guilty pleasure ever since.  I generally don't eat out during restaurant week - mainly because it gets so crowded and I feel rushed. But a.kitchen gives you wonderful service whether you're eating for a bargain or not. I also never really like chef tables, but again, it's somehow awesome here to eat at a bar and watch the cooks make food for other people while you're eating your own. There are mainly small plates, but you some how leave satisfied even if you choose not to order the whole menu. My best advice however is that even if you're here for brunch, save room for dessert. And - if you're here for brunch, get a Bloody Mary. If you aren't, get any other one of the inventive cocktails. Really, I'm from Philly, but this is a hotel restaurant that makes me consider staying in this hotel.
