I've only been once, and it was fine but not enough to bring me back.  It was recommended by several people.  I've heard it described as Laotian-Thai.  I haven't eaten Laotian food anywhere else, but I've eaten a LOT of Thai food.  This place wasn't very exciting.  Maybe because I don't know from Laotian cuisine and didn't know what to order.  I LOVE green papaya salad, but theirs was just meh.  The other entrees were adequate--not bad at all.  You could do worse.
