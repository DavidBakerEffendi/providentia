Excellent service and delicious, authentic Thai food. Our server/the owner was very helpful in describing the food and how it is made, when we asked. The Satay Chicken and Crispy Spring Rolls appetizers were amazing - especially the homemade sauces for each! Â Entree size was a little smaller than at some other Thai places, but that may be because we ordered from the lunch menu. Reasonably priced, especially for the neighborhood. We will definitely return!
