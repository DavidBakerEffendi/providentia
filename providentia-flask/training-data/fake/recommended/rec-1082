This is the place to go!  Go to this place and experience their great food, drink, and service.  Best mediterranean place in NYC...in fact, one of the best restaurants I've been to anywhere...period.   These people are masters of the spice rack, grill, and mixed drink/alcohol.  You see and taste their attention to detail in every dish and drink (we had). COCKTAILS: great balance and delicious; best cocktails i've had to date in NYC. Not a cocktail type of person and had 2! Must try the refreshing Fresh Meadow and tasty seasonal option Cedar Cider (served cold or hot; opted for cold). MEZZAS: Brussel sprouts!...uniquely prepared and assembled. A perfect marriage of sweet and savory; is very light but you feel guilty cuz it tastes decadent. Just try it and you won't be disappointed. Shrimp hommus (that's how they spell it): so very creamy; must get with shrimp Octopus: perfectly tender (very difficult to do with THICK cuts) with yum lamb pastrami and a citrus vinaigrette dressed greens to cut the richness of the pastrami. Grape leaves: subtle tomato based bite sized snacks similar in size to vienna sausages (vs. the overly lemony versions at many other places) ENTREE: Mixed grill (for 2): 2 perfectly black and blue kafta lamb chops (as requested) served over herb roasted tomatoes, chicken shish taouk (juicy and tender), lamb kebab, and the unassuming yet very tasty ratatouille.  Served with garlic whip trio each specifically made for each of the meats. DESSERT: Get the huckleberry cheesecake and candy bar.  Cheesecake went oh so well with a glass (ahem...2 glasses) of their spanish Moscatel WINE: A bottle of Grgich Hills Zinfandel...yum Last but not least: SERVICE: Great, very knowledgeable and attentive staff....and they gave us some complimentary lip smackingly good passion fruit cocktail and a strained yogurt dish. :)
