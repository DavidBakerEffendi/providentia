Went to Hillstone last week for lunch and it was very good. It is in the basement of the buildlng near the food court. The place looks outstanding and I was dining alone so I sat at the bar. The staff and bar tender who waited on me were great and very attentive. I had the chicken sandiwich for lunch which was about $15, so very average for NYC. It was very good and I would definitely recommend it for lunch, dinner or even just drinks around the bar.
