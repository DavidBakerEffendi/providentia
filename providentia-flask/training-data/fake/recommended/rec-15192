Pizza is decent but it does not compare to Modern's.  Service was friendly today but the server did forget to bring one salad and one drink.  Pizza is a bit pricey too.  It's really not worth the trek from NYC if that is your plan.  Stick with NY pizza.  It's better and you won't have to stand outside a half hour waiting for a table.
