The wait is ridiculous of course, but my suggestion is to come on a Monday morning if you have the time.I had the banana walnut pancakes with a side of cheese grits.It was fluffy ,crispy on the edges and gave me that warm fuzzy feeling after i licked my plate clean(not really but i had a serious urge to) The cheese grits were creamy and wholesome.My only regret is that i didn't ask for a tub of the maple butter syrup to go. Seriously i want to bathe in it.
