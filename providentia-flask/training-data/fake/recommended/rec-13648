Last year I was delivering an ebay package around the corner at about 5:30 in the evening it was cold and it started to rain.  I ducked into Clinton Street, No waiting and had the Best Blueberry Pancakes ever!  For dinner.  Loved it. My advice don't follow crowds in NYC to brunch & Sat night movies. Movie mattinee and brunch for dinner.  Perfect.  No waiting. No worries:)
