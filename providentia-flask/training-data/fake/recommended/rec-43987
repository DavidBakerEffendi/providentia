Since the sight of snow excites me in the best way, by the time we had checked in and got to our lovely room overlooking the slopes, I was not shy. However, I was startled to hear the voices of several vivacious children, crystal clear and very audible,  coming through wall! I have never quite experienced that level of sound transfer between hotel rooms... luckily, we decided to use it to our benefit, and it was with satisfaction that we overheard and the large and fiesty family changing to a different suite the next day. Coincidence I am sure. Great pleasure of this little-known resort was the lack of crowdedness, gliding down sparsely populated white slopes with gorgeous Vermont views. Watch out for strange hotel personnel here: the Spanish women they import to work at desk are charming, but there is also small population of evil and disgruntled male hotel clerks who did not want to give Natashka hairdryer in room! I  secretly put Russian curse on him... he will be bald within a year and his children have stringy hair. Overall, Great spot to spend romantic weekend and to get legs back into shape for the season. I mean on the slopes of course.
