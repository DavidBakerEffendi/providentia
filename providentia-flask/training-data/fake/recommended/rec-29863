I had heard and read good things about this place and while I agree the place is quite nice and cozy the food is another story.  Whenever I try a new italian restaurant I always get Chicken Parm as a test, if you can't make chicken parm correctly I don't really trust you to make anything else right.  Well sad to say they failed my test, the chicken was horribly tasteless and the sauce was quite bad too, definitley not freshly made and there were about 4 pieces of cheese just thrown on the whole thing as if it was just decoration.  I'm sorry I really wanted to like this place especially after all the reviews but it just didn't work for me.  Maybe I'll visit again in the future and try something else or maybe not...
