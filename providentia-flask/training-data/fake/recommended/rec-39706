what can i say, PLACE IS GREAT!! it gets packed, but that doesn't stop you from being seated once you enter. i say try everything on the menu, especially the tapas, the drinks are fairly priced and are very strong (major +) . it's nice inside and feels like a home. staff is very friendly and try to help with anything they can.. i will return and you must try it!!
