The Burger has been perfected!!!! The girlfriend and I were in the neighborhood and I have been wanting to go to this place for a while so we said why not. It was a Saturday evening and at first we wondered why we were the only ones in the restaurant, but as other patrons walked in and asked to be seated in the back we learned that the place had a back area. We kind of wised we were given the option to sit in the back but inside was just fine. The food is made to order so expect to wait a while for your meal. It's also BYOB. Both waiters were really nice and personable, they held small talk with us and this place definitely has a family feeling to it. On to the food.... Slamming!!! My girlfriend had the Truffel burger and I had the regular. This place has perfected the burger in such a way that cannot be described with words. Even the fries are excellent. I will be sure to return.
