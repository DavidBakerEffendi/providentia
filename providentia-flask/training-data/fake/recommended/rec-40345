Loved this place, reminds me of Southern Europe. It's such a beautiful place with amazing views of the Rittenhouse Square. Their drinks are really really good and you must get the Steak Tartar; it's SO good. I also love the country chicken club; yumm, my mouth is watery just thinking about it. Overall, a great place and would love to visit again and again.
