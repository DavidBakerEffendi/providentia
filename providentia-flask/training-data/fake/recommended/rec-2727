We recently enjoyed brunch at Rex 1516 to celebrate my fiance's birthday and I plan on going back very soon.  This was hands down the best local brunch I've had in a while. The restaurant has a unique vibe, with wooden speakers, old movies playing above the bar, and perfect high ball glasses that I wanted to bring home.  The food was wonderful.  I had two eggs over easy-- a basic brunch item-- but enjoyed them with a sweet potato hash, house made sausage, and cinnamon raisin toast.  We both commented on how simple but awesome cinnamon raisin toast is-- why don't more brunch spots offer this as an option?  Served with homemade blueberry jam to boot. My fiance had the sweet potato biscuits and gravy which was flavorful and rich.  We shared a side of grits and it might have been my favorite grits ever, I kept going back for more even when I was full.  Being full didn't stop us from ordering dessert, something I never do at brunch, but I couldn't resist when I saw fried carrot cake on the menu!!  This sweet delight was accompanied by a sweet cream cheese semifreddo, candied pecans, and a pineapple rum sauce.  I can't wait to go back to Rex and try more brunch items and dinner, too!  We had reservations, which I would suggest because it's not huge and did fill up.
