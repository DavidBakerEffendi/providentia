i love this place on nfl nights. wings are 25 cents and you can get certain drafts for $5. i love the beer selection and the bbq wings are to die for. see your there on game day! they have a drinking club there, if you drink 40 different beers ( they ahve a checklist) in 30 days, you get a special mug with your name on it, in adddition you get discount for all the beers. try the sam adams utopia, its quiet good.
