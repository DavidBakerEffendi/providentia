Great freshly made Chinese food at a very reasonable price.  Interior décor is not like your typical whole in the wall Chinese place.   You get good service and the owner cares about your feedback and comments.   Would recommend this place, definitely much better than the other Chinese restaurants in the area.  I'm from SF and Vancouver so I know my Chinese food and the quality here is definitely up to par for a casual restaurant.    Its also convenient to W. Hartford and downtown.   They mainly get takeouts but there are some seats there to eat in.
