I came here on a trip to Philly, hearing the thousands of stories about it. I really love cheese steaks and was really excited to try the " famous genos". The stories plus the travel channel shows really made me want to try them even more. But something was wrong, it wasn't the best it was suppose to be! Wasn't even close to some other ones I've had. A few things were lacking such as size and cheese. I was expecting a monster sandwich and all I got was a average one. I am also not a huge fan of cheese wiz but I won't doc them from that. Maybe I should give them another chance. But considering all the the good eats in Philly, I might not. It's up to you to decide!
