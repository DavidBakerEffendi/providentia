I had heard good things about Green Eggs so decided it would be worth a little trek down to South Philly. At no point did this restaurant disappoint. When you first walk in you notice an amazing environment that instantly makes you feel like your at home. As you're ushered to your table your eye gets caught on mountains of amazing meals and most importantly on the amazing looking Red Velvet Pancakes which is next on my list of things to order. Â  The menu has a little something for everybody and the food was phenomenal. I got the Steak and Eggs and the steak was amazing. Some people may be put off by the slightly higher prices but that should not deter you even remotely. Every meal is amazing and worth every penny. I only gave a four star rating because the waitress wasn't necessarily the friendliest but other than that I loved this restaurant and can't wait to go back again.
