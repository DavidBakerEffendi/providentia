Another place recommended to me that I go. I guess if I'm in the neighborhood it would be great.  But I purposely looked for this place so my expectations were high.  It begin this appears to be a popular place so it's Crowded.  I ended up eating at the bar which was fine.  Ordered the turkey burger and the presentation was very good not to mention the burger was pretty tasty.  The female bartender is very attentive,  she deserves Kudos.  The decor is very nice and its a clean place. If you are old fashion or traditional you may not understand the community bathroom.  I personally loved it. The crowd caused me not to rate this higher - getting to my seat was like being in a subway car at rush hour.  Oh the host manager in the front of the house was very rude to his staff.
