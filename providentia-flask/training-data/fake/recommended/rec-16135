Uva is a fantastic and cozy little Italian spot on the Upper East Side. Upstairs it can be a little noisy, so ask to sit downstairs (not always open) or on the patio if you want a quiet place to talk during dinner. The bar is busy every time I've been there and I consider it a great place to meet for a date. The staff is always gracious, attentive, and friendly. The food is definitely good Italian. The are also willing to work with you on some menu items to craft your meal to your tastes. I really like their fish specials and other meat selections. Pasta and sauce are excellent. The salads are always good too! Bottomline: for the price, you're hard pressed to find a better Italian dining experience in NYC!
