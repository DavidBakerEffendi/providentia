I enjoyed everything about this place.  Food: Every mezza was ordered was delicious! Some of the memorable dishes were the labne which was creamy and delicious, the chankleesh which was tasty and refreshing as well as the kibbeh bi laban (beef dumplings) which were submerged in this amazing yogurt sauce but were not as heavy as they sound.  Has other mezzes as well which were tasty but those were the best, in my taste. The service was impeccable.  Our waitress often had recommendations to cater to our requests and they often brought fresh bread to eat with our dinner.  Never had to ask for anything more than once and all went smoothly with the reservations. It's a very large space so I think it's good for groups but could even work for a date with the intimate lighting.  Overall, very pleasant experience.
