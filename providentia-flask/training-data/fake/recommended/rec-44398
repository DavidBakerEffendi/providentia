Looked pretty great from first appearances, glance at the menu, and long wait to get seated but after a more thorough investigation of the menu and actually eating I wasn't very impressed. It's good...period - nothing to get too excited about. The menu appears to have lots of choices but it's really the same kind of thing with slight tweaks so there isn't all that much variety or anything innovative. Since they're a "green restaurant" and serve vegan, gluten free, etc., we also expected the place to have more vegetables in their offerings (real ones... potatoes don't count). The service is good and they are pretty nice - our food took about 40 minutes to come out though (party of 2). No explanation offered. I got the pumpkin bread french toast - sounds fun and exciting but it wasn't very good at all. I'd go with an order of pumpkin bread (plain) and some regular french toast next time. Wife got the Bo Knows which is a mix of stuff. Oatmeal pancakes are big...sausage link tiny and overcooked. Meh.
