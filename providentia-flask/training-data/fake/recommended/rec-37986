I just had the avocado/hummus wrap and it was quite tasty!  I'm also not a vegan so I was a little hesitant to go in, but I'm glad I did.  I will probably start getting lunch here more often since it's near my job and everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked delish!   The staff also seemed friendly so that's a bonus.
