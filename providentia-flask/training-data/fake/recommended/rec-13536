If there is no one sitting outside on the patio, you just might walk by this unassuming, surprisingly large, cozy cafe. Went for breakfast and was super glad that we did. The amazing breakfast special for $7.95 gets you 2 perfect eggs your way, tasty toast, salted buttery potatoes, delicious fresh squeezed orange juice AND a cappuccino. They don't serve coffee here, just espresso drinks. Service was just ok. The place is huge (by NY standards) with 3 separate dining rooms and an outside patio. The separation of the rooms makes for nice intimate conversation. You would think the place was French, but I was a bit confused by the theme. The decor is whatever. The place didn't seem to have a real identity. There was Mediterranean music playing and random art hung on the walls. Great for breakfast when you want a simple meal to warm the tummy. Worth a go.
