We had an 8pm reservation.  We were seated around 8:15. After ordering,  we waited quite some time; our salads were served at 9:30. Two of us ordered a salad that was supposed to have goat cheese;  however there was no cheese and the waitress disappeared so we couldn't ask about it.  When she finally showed she she apologized and said she could add it to our entrees - really? We weren't offered bread until we asked for it and by this time we were starved. The dinners were good  but not worth the wait. We try to support local businesses but they really need to work on their customer service.
