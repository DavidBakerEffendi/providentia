I came here around 1 pm for Sunday brunch w/ 2 gal pals.  We thought the wait was going to take forever, but we were seated after ~25 minutes because a lot of people decide to leave after hearing about a 1 hr and 15 minute wait. Their prix fixe brunch menu for $14.50 comes with an apple cider mimosa, which is a good deal considering the drink is regularly $9 on the menu.  All 3 of us shared the the punkin waffle, salmon poached eggs, nutella french toast.  I was a fan of everything, but the nutella french toast was a bit disappointing.  It was made with french bread, which wasn't as soft or thick as I would have liked, and there wasn't enough nutella in it (i LOOOOOOOOOOOVE nutella!)
