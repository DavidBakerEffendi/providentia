In the winter, this place is definitely more of a take-out place than a sit-down place like others have mentioned.  The service was quick and friendly, but I was a bit disappointed by the food.  The ribs, cornbread, and baked beans were okay, but the coleslaw, collard greens, and BBQ chicken were quite bland.  (Okay, so I was *really* disappointed by the coleslaw and collard greens because I really like both, and I thought that it was pretty difficult to make coleslaw taste bad.)  The chicken was a bit dry too.  The fried pickles and fried okra were so-so.
