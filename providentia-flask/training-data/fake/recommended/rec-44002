Love that the waitress thought I was my daughter's friend lol very friendly staff, tasty food! I highly suggest the Pad Thai. I got mine medium spiciness and no shrimp. SO delicious. Service is friendly, food is great, salad was fresh and crisp. This is one Â the hubs' favorite places to have lunch during the work day!
