awesome guacamole, margaritas and pretty much everything else you order. chips are homemade and the salsa is perfect! the tacos are Â also tasty but some of the less usual dishes are really good. try the nogada thing if you go for dinner. it's delicious! cool people working there so the music is nice (some form of indie rock/pop is on their ipod) and you're never embarrassed about bringing someone there. go early or late if you don't like crowds. brunch is a good time to check it out as well as it's a little more mellow. as a local- i love being here often.
