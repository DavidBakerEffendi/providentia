Simply amazing dinner all around!  I'm still at the restaurant as u type the review... That's how good it was!  Tasted everything that all four of us got & it was incredible. Beef tongue was buttery & tasty. Gnocchi & lasagna were fantastic. Duck was incredible!!!  Eggplant & veal were great. Tiramisu & Nutella ice cream were great. Didn't care too much for the bread & ricotta spread.
