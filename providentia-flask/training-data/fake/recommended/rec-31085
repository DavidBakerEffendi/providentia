Chaat, their signature dish, is like nothing you have ever tasted before.  Others here have described it aptly.  I will just add my own experience.  It is a combination of tastes and textures that are absolutely incredible.  To steal an inane but appropriate phrase, chaat is a party in your mouth.  Open your mind and try it.  The owner was so confident that he said he would not charge me if I didn't like it or just thought it was ok.  I was happy to give him money.  Then for dessert he gave me some sweet homemade cheese, a little like ricotta but sweeter.
