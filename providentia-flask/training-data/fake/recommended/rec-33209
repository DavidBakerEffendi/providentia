I've had my ass handed to me at this "Authentic Thai" restaurant (which basically translates to "Crazy Hot").  I knew I was in over my head when I was seated next to Josie Smith-Malave (from Top Chef, season 2) - she's very cool both on & off air.  I had a great time with friends here and I plan to go back and dine in the garden because the food (however painfully spicy) was tremendous.  Now pass me the Tums!
