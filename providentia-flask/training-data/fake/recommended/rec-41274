The slices are a bit pricey, but the 12" personal pies are delicious and a great bargain. I've tried the Home Made Sausage and Breakfast (pretty much carbonara) Pizza, and they are both solid. Always a nice, relaxing atmosphere, and it's BYOB to boot. Shame I only lived in Brooklyn Heights for a month--had I been there for longer, I definitely would've become a regular at Table 87.
