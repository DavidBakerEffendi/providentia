I learned about the amazing Nanzhou Hand Drawn Noodle House from Yelp. It just goes to show that Yelp reviews by and large are a great resource. We tried the hand-drawn and shaved noodles with braised beef and pork. They were great. The broth was favorful, the noodles fresh and tender yet just chewy enough. I think I could eat here daily. We (two) ate here, got stuffed and run up a whopping $16 bill.
