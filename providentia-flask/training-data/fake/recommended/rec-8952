This is a cute little spot not too far from my apartment. We came into Saleya to grab a bite to eat before a movie on a Friday night. I've tried coming in before around happy hour but it was way too crowded. Not so much this time since we missed happy hour by a few minutes. The downstairs bar area is small and cramped. It's difficult to maneuver through the tables when coming and going no matter which way you go. I had the spicy shrimp pizza and the salmon. I really enjoyed the pizza, great combination of flavors. The salmon was good, not great. The service was decent. I think the guy was the only person for the entire downstairs area. I'd stop in again for an inexpensive bite to eat or maybe to check out their happy hour. Not sure I'll be a frequent diner considering all the other options in the area.
