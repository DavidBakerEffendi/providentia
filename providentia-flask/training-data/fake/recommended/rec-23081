The restaurant is new to this location, having taken over a space occupied by a former pizza restaurant.  The decor has not been updated at all, and it's still a pleasant-enough atmosphere.  Two of us went around 7 PM on a Sunday and were the only patrons during our entire visit.  The menu is very large (perhaps too large as some of the options just seem to say "let's throw ingredients we already have together and call it a new menu item").  I ordered a turkey burger panini since it sounded interesting.  What I received was a small turkey patty much like you'd buy frozen at the grocery store on a large focaccia roll.  I am not exaggerating when I say that the patty only filled half of the roll.  Condiments included cheese, lettuce, and tomato.  Nothing about the presentation indicated "panini" pressed.  It tasted like something I'd throw together at home and not like something worth 10 or 12 bucks at a restaurant.  The person I was with ordered a pasta dish.  I didn't try it but it appeared fine, though the cook and server came out to ask us if the menu said the item contains sausage because the cook wasn't sure whether or not to add it (it is included on the menu).  I don't need to go back anytime soon as this area is flooded with pizza restaurants with tighter menus.
