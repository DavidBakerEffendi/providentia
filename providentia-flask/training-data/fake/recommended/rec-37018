It was sooo good. Girl friend and I came for happy hour. Best decision we made the whole day. She got the Calamansi Martini and I got the Spicy Mango. The spicy mango martini had just the right amount of kick to it. I was a fan of the drink. We shared the Sizzling Sisig between the two of us. It was SO good. Perfect amount of pork belly fat. Fat, how could you be so good? The liver was just the right texture too. We would definitely come back and try the other entrees.
