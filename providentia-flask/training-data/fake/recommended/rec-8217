I've put off writing this review for a few weeks now but it really needs to get done... I've lived in VT for 16 years now and have never made it to Bove's before this spring. Sure, I had heard about them. Sure, I ate their sauce from the grocery store and yes, I knew that most people raved about them. So I have to go and boy was I underwhelmed. The place is a small hole in the wall. It's comparable to a little diner that missed out on all the changes for the last 50 years. I found it slightly charming but mostly depressing. The place is also seat yourself and not at all customer oriented. The waiter that was working with us was a clear cut stoner. The ummmms and ahhhsss and "let me check" really clued is in on that. Anyways we managed to order food and were very disappointed. Though the portions were large, the taste was very much lacking. Everything was soooo bland that it's indescribable. The Alfredo sauce dish that my partner ordered was watery and flavorless-I really think you could get a better sauce from one of the dry packets at the grocery store. The red sauce I had was very much garlic infused but also tasted sour which I was not impressed by. Marinara sauce shouldn't make you pucker... I really did not enjoy the experience or the food here. I do not understand or see what the fuss is about. It really is not at all delicious or anything special. Sure the prices are cheap and the dishes large but come on- offer up some flavor! As my partner said "next time, don't smoke the whole bowl, bro"!
