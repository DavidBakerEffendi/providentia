Been here 2x for brunch. Food is pretty good although it's kinda expensive. $15 for two eggs, meat, potatoes, and toast. $14 for French toast. $4-6 for sides. You get the idea. 1st time I went the service wasn't that great, but they were pretty busy. Today the service was much better but the restaurant was not that busy so it's kinda hard for me to judge the service. Restaurant is neat looking inside and they take reservations on open table.
