I understand that the standard they had awhile back is not comparable to who they are now.  But the fact of the matter is that they serve some really good food. I go to Great NY Noodle Town every time I visit friends & family in NYC and I'm never disappointed from any of my visits.  I've been left out in the cold because of some late night lines outside, but once inside, I experience nothing but goodness. The SOFT SHELL CRAB is the best here.  It's what I basically come for.  I've yet to find a place from the Chinatown in SF that has a similar dish that equally taste as good.  The ROAST DUCK and ROAST PORK are a staple for the restaurant too and should not be missed for first time visitors at all. If money is a little tight...well, they have rice/noodle combos that are so affordable and good that it made my cousin from Brooklyn a big fan of the restaurant.  The items listed on the walls of the restaurant are the items that Great NY Noodle Town makes the best of, so if I were you, going to this establishment for the first time...I would order off the wall and not from the menu. The thing about Chinese restaurants that people have to understand though is that you cannot order "gringo food" (sorry...I don't know any other way to put it).  Beef broccoli, sweet and sour pork, etc. are not items that make Chinese restaurants great...no one in China really orders that stuff.  Instead, go for what the locals order.  They may not be what you're accustomed to, but they will have an impact on how you view Chinese cuisine, for the good or the bad.  A good tip for any first visit to any restaurant is:  always order what the restaurant is known for. The SALT & PEPPER SHRIMP is delicious too...my mouth is watering right now.  I'm not kidding. Pay no mind to the decor of the place; the fact that you might have to share a table with a stranger; or the sometimes shotty service.  Just enjoy the food.  Your late night will end well.
