We stopped in very early one Saturday morning  for breakfast.  We had an apple topped waffle, which had some whipped cream put of a can and cinnamon dusted on top.  It was OK, as the reddi whip was a bit over the top and unexpected.  Also, there were home fries, chopped fruit, and a pastrami omelet.  All were fine and par for the course as far as diners are concerned.  Service was good, efficient, and quick.
