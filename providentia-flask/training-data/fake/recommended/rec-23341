Having used to live in the area, I was so excited to hear there was going to be a well-established bar in Point Breeze. And then to hear it was being done by the same folks as SPTR, I was stoked. Lets cut to the chase. The building is beautiful. Old staircase, awesome tiling, and the wood beams upstairs are a great touch. The tables, all rough wood, are so large and inviting. And though the christmas lights may have been residual from the holidays, they gave a warm glow everywhere. Beer list was awesome- 22 on tap. Stuck with the South Hampton Chistmas Ale for the most part. Food was great too: onion rings, sardine sandwich, brussel sprouts, sandwiches (we tried the pittsburgh cheesesteak and krab cake sammys) and fries (Just a spoiler their sandwiches dont come with fries; if you want some, you gotta order them seperately. But its worth it). And they have Heinz ketchup. Not a homemade concoction. Like SPTR. And it is delicious. Two thumbs up, ASB.
