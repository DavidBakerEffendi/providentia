This place was amazing!  The atmosphere was decorated beautifully, the service was top notch and the food was great.  I was only there for some dessert and tea.  We order two appetizer which were excellent and the Vanilla oolong tea was also great!  The water, Kyle, was extremely friendly and helpful.  To top it off the whole bill for a kettle of tea, two Mambo Iced teas, two appetizers, and two dessert trays was only around $27!  We enjoyed it so much we are planning a usual dinner there and left a generous tip. The only downside, which I am now looking forward to, is that you need to BYOB for something like sangria.
