I did only take-out, but I will definitely make an effort to dine-in next time.  The food was great and not too greasy or heavy.  The Pad Thai was light and airy and delicious.  The Thai Iced Tea was good and so were the Spring Rolls and the soup.  My order came up to 20, but I have leftovers so its was definitely a meal for 10. Worth the trip if you're in the Bloomfield area.
