Went for brunch with my two friends and from the moment we walked in we really loved the atmosphere. The Pepsi-Cola reverse sign is super cool. We opted for the $4 unlimited Bloody Marys. The mix is awesome- a bit salty but I like that. We ordered the Chilaquilas, goddess salad, the Eggs Benedict with homemade Canadian bacon, pulled pork and the lamb and garlic hollandaise. All were awesome and only $8 - we loved that you could do two different hollandaise combinations on each egg. The rest of the menu was really cool. I like the concept that you can do tastings of things since I like to mix savory and sweet with most of my meals. Midway through the meal the owner, Nick came by the table with a pitcher of Mimosas and asked if we would like any on the house. He called himself the Mimosa Fairy! Who says no to the Mimosa Fairy? No one. :-) We started chatting with him and eventually he sat down and told us more about the restaurant and how he had built the booths and actually created the Pepsi-Cola sign wall hanging. He did much of the decor in the place. He's also the chef. Very nice guy. Best part of everything was the bill: $42 for three of us. And we each had 3 drinks! We were not stuffed but the portions were satisfying. The only reason I don't give it five stars was because in the beginning of our visit, our waiter seemed pretty overwhelmed and we weren't able to get our water and drinks very quickly, but I think maybe they were short staffed at that time. I was surprised it wasn't busier as I think this place is great. I'm looking forward to trying Monday Night $4 Mussels!
