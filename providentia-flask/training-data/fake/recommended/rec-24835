This place is a joke.  Our flight from Seattle got in late, so we decided to grab a bite in Philly before heading to the suburbs to visit my girlfriend's family.  I remember Alma de Cuba being great from a business trip a few years back, so we headed over.  Unfortunately, it was closed and yelp recommended this place Rouge a couple blocks away.  I don't know what passes for enjoyable dining in Philadelphia, but like I said, this place is a joke. First, the good:  I ordered three wines by the glass (an Albarino, a Syrah-Grenache blend, and a Cab), and they were all excellent.  Someone put some time into the wine list.  The bread and butter was the other high note.  After that, everything was downhill.  We had bland lobster bisque with rancid lobster.  We had "spicy scallop ceviche" that was so insanely spicy and acidic that it was inedible (and forget being able to taste the scallop--no chance of that).  At that point, I asked if our entrees were going to be of similar quality, and in that case we could still catch dinner somewhere else.  They couldn't respond to my criticism of the food (despite trying to be pretentious, the manager and waitstaff were unknowledgeable), so they said "Well, everyone has different tastes."  They convinced us to stay for the entrees. We ordered the ribeye and the fluke.  The ribeye was huge and untrimmed.  It was at the right temperature, and it tasted it pretty good, but a lot of this is due to it being covered in bacon.  So, decent, but clunky.  The fluke was in, I guess, what you would call their interpretation of a dashi broth, but it was overcooked and the broth tasted mostly of soy sauce.  It was way too salty. It 's always possible that the usual kitchen and floor staff were on vacation (this was on Tuesday, December 27th).  In that case, the restaurant would have been better off just shutting down for the holidays.  Yuck.
