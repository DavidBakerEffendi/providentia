After reading recommendations, I tried the Roti Canai. It was worth all the hype! Stretchy, crepe-paper thin roti bread dipped in a chicken and potato curry sauce.  Just thinking about it again makes my mouth water!  We ordered 3 of them!!! Tried the Banana Leaf Chicken Wings appetizer, which came out piping hot and super crispy. Straight up good fried chicken for the kids. Also would recommend the Thai Basil Beef and the Mee Siam. The beef dish was savory and fresh with its strong basil flavor which highlighted the beef and made the whole dish stand out. The Mee Siam had thin noodles with tofu, shrimp, eggs, bean sprouts fried together with a slightly spicy chili oil. Not heavily sauced and not too salty. I would not recommend the sizzling beef, which was way too heavily sauced and salty. The Mango Chicken, while tasty, was a bit too sweet. I also thought the chicken could have used some ginger to take some of the "gamey" poultry taste away. Great service, even when it was busy. My water glass was never empty, which was a necessity. You need to order rice separately if you're getting a meat dish. Extensive menu is indeed accurate. Takes time to review. Definitely something for everyone.
