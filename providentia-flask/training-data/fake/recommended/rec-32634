Date night at Scarpetta--sooo good! I haven't stopped bragging yet. Started off with a glass of Prosecco and it was heaven from there on in. Supposedly this place is known for the best Spaghetti in town but I can't justify going to a nice restaurant to order Spaghetti. Absolutely order the CRISPY FRITTO MISTO for the app....its a little pile of well seasoned greatness!  For dessert, don't leave w/o trying AMEDEI CHOCOLATE CAKE....OMG! The ceiling is glass and you can see the night sky...its a romantic little restaurant. The waiters are so sweet & attentive. Everything is so clean. My reservation was made 4wks ago and we couldn't get an 8pm opening on a Thursday %$#@# (very annoying) Had to settle on 6:30pm.  Overall, it was great!!!!
