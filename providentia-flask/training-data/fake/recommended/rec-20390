BYOB, BYOC* and BYOA** for a pure fish experience.  This is not fussy food but rather pure presentation of delicious ingredients and plate that lets the food speak for itself- and this food doesn't just speak - it sings.***  Ask for bread, the dipping sauce is like crack and the waitress doesn't always remember to bring it. Oh yeah, and don't come here if you have something private to discuss the tables are close. *Bring your own cash, they don't take credit cards **Bring your own appetite, the portions are large. ***When I say the food sings, I don't mean how I sing, I mean it sings well.
