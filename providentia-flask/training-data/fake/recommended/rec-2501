If I could travel to any place in the world to get a sandwich, I'd come here. I used to come here during work for lunch a few times a week. They pack the sandwiches with so much meat and veggies, it's hard to take a bite. You end up with a big mess and an even bigger smile. Don't forget to grab a mini sweet potato pie. FYI - No offense to Sandwiches Unlimited 2, but this location is brighter, takes credit cards, has more tables, and more spaces to park. Sandwiches Unlimited 2's parking area is tight [try backing in an ambulance in a spot made for a compact car on a daily basis, maybe you'll get as good as me ;-P] and they're cash only. Other than that, it's all good.
