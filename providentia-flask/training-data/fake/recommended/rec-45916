Great friendly service.  Hibachi was good for everyone including a couple nephews.   We had 8 and filled up one of the regular grill spaces.  Normal what you expect from a place like this with the tricks and fun stuff.  Good atmosphere.  It looks small when you view it from the road, but then it opens up a good bit when you park down behind it.  The whole staff was very attentive and very friendly.  The prices are reasonable, and I think we will be back again when we are looking for another good experience like this.
