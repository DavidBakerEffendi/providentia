We stumbled upon this little gem not knowing who's restaurant it was until he came out of the kitchen and the penny dropped! What an amazing experience. I am intolerant to gluten, nuts & seeds, soy and eggs but this chef made my dinner one of the most special I had in years! He really had to think on his feet and this Iron Chef did just that - he made me a great little amuse bouche from scratch & substituted the starch w/my main for something that was not only safe for me to eat, but absolutely dilish. I had the dry aged steak - pricy at $54 but oh so worth it. I savored every little bite of that steak until it was completely done (and it was BIG). The cheese platter was a home run with the great condiments and the wines and desert wines were winners all around. Top that by sitting in an amazing, cosy, warm, rustic, modern environment in the middle of Greenwich Village while being served by a lovely waitress and this is a night that goes into the books as one to remember. The next evening we went to Gordon Ramsay in The London and that experience could not have been more worse!! So, next time we're in NYC - it's Marc Forgione all over again!
