The menu is very simple and they describe what is on each different burgers, fries, etc. I ordered the Cali Burger and my friend ordered the Manly Burger. For appetizers we got the truffle fries and tempura onion rings. For drinks we got the Tropical Green Tea. For dessert we got a cinnamon chocolate chip ice cream donuts! (I think the dessert change every now and then) We got four different sauces to go with our appetizers, two are spicy and two aren't (one being ketchup). The sauces are so good, especially the orange one! The tempura onion rings aren't like regular onion rings, their skin aren't a thick layer but thin. The truffle fries were good too, especially with sauce if you don't want to taste too much cheese. Eating my burger got really messy because the juice soaked the bottom buns. If you don't want to eat something messy, you should get the manly burger. Both burgers were really good nonetheless. The patty wasn't hard like regular burgers, it was soft and easy to eat which I love! The cinnamon chocolate chip ice cream donut was good, however the donut might be a little hard since it's cold.
