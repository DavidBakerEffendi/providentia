Read the reviews.  Wandered around the Washington Square against the rage of August's heat to finally find him.  Was not disappointed.   This man clearly has standards: He threw out a tub of chopped raw veggies because he was concerned about the heat and did not want to risk spoilage.  When I told him I wanted heaps and heaps of veg, almost unnatural amounts, he offered--as a token of compensation--a free "mock chicken" drumstick made of soy protein and sugar cane.   The dosa crepe was a real delight.  Watching him make it was even better.  He is so so so very nice to talk to; he has such a pleasant disposition.   Definitely recommend.  Will come back again.
