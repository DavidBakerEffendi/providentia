We stopped in here late on a Saturday night and Nick, the owner, greeted us as we came through the door (while also working his ass off for a wedding reception out in the back room). Had never been in there before and was made to feel like a friend & local from the get go. We originally wanted one last drink but then we saw the menu. Yum. Three small plates which we shared were delicious. It was great to have something different to the normal pub fare. For the food and the friendliness this is definitely worth a stop. If you live in the area it should become a regular stop.
