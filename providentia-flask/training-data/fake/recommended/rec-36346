Halal~ Oh how we love thee.  Every blue moon, we make a trip out to NYC and we always make a list of places to eat.  On that list each time, without fail, is the 53rd and 6th Halal Cart.  Mind you, I usually steer clear of street food like the plague.  The uncertainty of the cleanliness of it all makes me extremely nervous.  I still refuse to eat hotdogs on the street.  But the first time I tried the Halal Cart, I was in street food heaven.  Chicken and rice with extra white sauce and extra hot sauce.  So grubby, so guiltily pleasurable, so good.  In fact, our friends formed a club in which whenever one of us goes to NYC that person must bring some back for the rest of us.
