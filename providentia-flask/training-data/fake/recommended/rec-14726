The creative drink menu alone will get me back here! The space is light and not too crowded with tables, with a small bar up front and expansive back room that could easily fit a group of 50. We got our beautiful drinks (a pickled watermelon concoction and a blood orange pseudo margarita option) and ordered a few appetizers. The caviar dip is one of the best I've had, with the yougurt dip being a close second. The mussels are very tasty but the gigante beans were undercooked which was a bummer. The cod over potato was the most bland of the three, but still good and just in need of a bit more crunch and a little salt. We stayed for a second drink, which our waiter helpfully got us even though they were closing up. And when they packed up the leftover dips we had hardly touched, they helpfully threw in some added warm pita bread. I'd go here with a friend for a nice dinner out, or on a casual date, or with a group and a table full of shared plates.
