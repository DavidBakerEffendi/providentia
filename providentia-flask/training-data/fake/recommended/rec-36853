I just love this place. GREAT BREAKFAST!! I wish Anisette, here in Santa Monica, served their cafe au lait in a big bowl like Balthazar does. Can't go to NYC without going here. Even you're short on time, stop by their to-go bakery next door and grab a croissant and coffee. If you come here for dinner, pass on the profiteroles for dessert...choc. sauce is no good.
