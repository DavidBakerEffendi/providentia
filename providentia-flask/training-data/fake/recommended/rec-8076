A solid place where you can always get a table, a delicious margarita, and an endless basket of chips with yummy salsa. It may not be the best Mexican food I've had, but it's quite solid with a few things that are downright delicious. I am vegetarian and regularly get the taco salad with seitan or the vegetarian buffalo wings. I'm a huge fan, have been a gazillion times and will always go if someone suggests it!
