Went here for breakfast with my boyfriend one Saturday morning and I fell in love with the decor. I have to have one of those chair swings in my backyard! But that's neither here nor there... Our waitress, I think her name was Roxanne, was a sweetheart and made a great suggestion I ordered the spinach and turkey sausage omelet and my man order the banana fritters both were delicious! The banana fritters were light and so tasty and my omelet hit the spot, the sausage was tasty and the spinach tasted fresh! I keep pestering him about going back but we like to try different places. Hopefully we'll be returning soon!
