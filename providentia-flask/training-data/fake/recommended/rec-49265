Simply Outstanding! While on a business trip, I came to Cast Iron Soul based upon the previous reviews. I was more than pleasantly surprised. Fabulous portions, excellent service, friendly and caring owner, and outstanding fare. The next time I am in town, Cast Iron Soul will be my number one priority when it comes to dining. For the record, I had excellent Pork chops, Red Beans, Dirty rice, marvelous sweet tea, and coconut pineapple cake.
