I stopped by yesterday for a beer and a sandwich in between apartment viewings. I met Brian at the bar who was helpful as far as giving me the low down on the area. Service was great and friendly.  Chicken panini sandwich and fries were delish.   I could easily see myself becoming a regular at this place once I move into New Haven.
