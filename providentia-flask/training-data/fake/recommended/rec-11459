i love johnny b's.  the food is amazing and affordable, staff is friendly, and it's a great little music venue.  had my after wedding party here so jb's has an extra special place in my heart.   music is always good, crowd is diverse, range of ages so i don't feel like an old fart out of my element.  yay for johnny b's!
