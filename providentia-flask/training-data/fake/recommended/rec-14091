Delicious, filling, and spicccyyyy. What else do you need? Midtown is a desolate and pitiful place to be if you want some good food, but the Cart will always satifsy. Everytime people visit from out of town, I make a big deal of having them try the combo, and it's never failed. Chicken and rice, Combo (chicken and lamb) and rice, or falafel and rice are ALL SO GOOD! And apparently not a lot of people know that there is a cart across 6th ave, at the corner of the CBS building during the day run by the same family. It's exactly the same! I've asked the real cart about the one across the street, and it's not a fraud, like many other places. So when you're craving cart food, and you know that the one on the southwest corner of 53rd and 6th has an outrageous line, go to the one on the southeast corner for a fraction of the wait!
