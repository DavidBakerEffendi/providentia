The first time my best friend and I tried to go here for brunch there was a 2 hour wait. Yea, passed. We decided to try again though and I'm really glad we went back. I had Belgium waffles and delicious mimosas. The place itself was really adorable, the staff was really friendly. I don't know that I would wait an hour for this place but like I said, glad we tried again :)
