great atmosphere, kind & knowledgeable staff.  i've been twice.  once, i sat at the bar with a friend and had wine and the meat & cheese plate with their house focaccia.  the focaccia is terrific and the meat & cheese plate delicious.  some restaurants don't fill up the plate with meat and cheese and there is only enough for two people to each have a little taste, but this was a nice serving and a good variety of flavors.  the restaurant is a little expensive for my budget but the cheapest glass of wine was delicious and i didn't feel like a slouch ordering the cheapest glass on the menu because the wine menu is very thoughtfully chosen.   another time, i was with a big group and we shared a lot of dishes.  we had a reservation but the group before us arrived late so we had to wait a bit.  the staff was very apologetic and i really don't know how they could have helped the situation.  its a small restaurant.  i had the trout and it was very good.  i tasted my friend's pork shank and it was so tender i wished i'd ordered it.  the chocolate pudding is delicious; definitely order it!  i never would have thought to order it but i really enjoyed it and think i am addicted.   my friends and i splurged on a big celebratory meal and i was really happy with the food, service and atmosphere.  while it is expensive for my budget, i think the prices are fine for the neighborhood and the great quality of the food and wine.  i felt every penny was well-spent.
