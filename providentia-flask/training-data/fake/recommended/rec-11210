I guess I had to give a star. The atmosphere isn't the bad part. It's got a great vibe for a place to stop for a cool happy hour. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and didn't decide to think twice about the grayish chicken in it. The next day all hell broke loose. I had a not so festive case of food poisoning. It could've been the friendly flies that were in and out of the restaurant since the door was open. Overall, worst experience for me, hope the next have a better time.
