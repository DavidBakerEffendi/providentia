Not worth your time waiting. Do yourself a favor and go to elsewhere that doesn't need to wait for an hour to two hours. I was disappointed with their brunch burger. The beef patty was tasteless. Their omelette was tasty though. I was also disappointed that the waiter didn't tell us whether the juice that comes with the $18 prix fixe is a small or a large glass. And the menu stated that "$18. Prix-fixe with an Apple Cider Mimosa, Pomegranate Bellini, Penny Beer Shandy OR penelope house blend coffee/tea and juice", so I would expect that I get coffee/tea and juice. But the waiter didn't offer us any coffee/tea.
