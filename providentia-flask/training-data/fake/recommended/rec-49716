Probably the best Sushi in downtown Hartford. Excellent Service.  A tad bit pricey but well worth it.  They also have a lot of M/P catch - Toro, Kampachi, Uni, etc The Toro was phenomenal. I gave it 4 stars as a piece of dried food showed up stuck on my plate :) They quickly replaced it once I pointed it out.  But otherwise, a fabulous joint.
