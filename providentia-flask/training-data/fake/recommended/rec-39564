What's better than Japanese desserts? Cute and extremely tasty Japanese desserts that melt in your mouth the moment you savor it. Being a female Asian, I love to take pictures of my food, especially cute looking desserts, but the last time we were at Cha-An, my bf couldn't wait for me to arrange our dessert plates to take a nice picture and instagram it before uploading to fb. We normally choose a chef's dessert assortment Â of 3-course dessert and pair it with the tea. Among the desserts we tried, I would recommend: - The black sesame creme brulee. I thought the combination was odd the first time I ordered it but it worked out very well. - The green tea cake - The green tea truffle - Vanilla (?) sweet tofu (it's not on the menu but once in awhile they will serve it if you order the chef's dessert assortment) Wasn't a fan of the ice cream, nothing extraordinary. Their cookies were a bit too dry for my liking. I like some of the tea I had, but I think "good tea" is more of a personal preference. :) I'd totally recommend this place. Bring cash tho.
