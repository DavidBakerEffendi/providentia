Is it wrong for me to be writing this review on Yom Kippur? Went on a Monday night or some such time when they had a certain menu that was more like tapas, so I can't speak to their normal menu. But the small appetizers were phenom. The seasonal vegetables fried in tempura were great, although it was at times hard to tell the different veggies apart. The sauce with it was amazing. I loved the crab legs stuffed with someone else not kosher. Maybe pork? Whatever. Delicious. Also of serious note were the drinks. My dinner date got the one that you are only allowed to order one of because it is about two feet tall and a delicious equivalent of a long island iced tea. Get that. I had a tequila drink that was sweet and delicious and lasted through the entire meal despite being very small and me being an... ahem... experienced drinker of tequila. The staff was also very friendly and helpful. The minus star was because it was super hot inside (open stove *in* the restaurant) and there was no seating in the garden. They did turn the A/C on for us which was nice, though why it wasn't on in the first place doesn't really make sense to me.
