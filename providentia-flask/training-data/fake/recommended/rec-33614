Corner Bistro is a New York staple. The key to enjoying it, however, is to Â either: a) arrive very drunk, late night, when your friends already have a table or b) arrive at 6pm on a freezing night when everyone else is still stuck in work. My first experience was the former and this week I got to enjoy the latter. If you hit Corner Bistro when its relatively empty on a cold night you are going to get to experience the warmth and charm of this very simple pub atomosphere on a random corner of the West Village while eating an undisputably good burger. The menu is limited (including beer selection, but they do have McSorley's on tap, which seems to be a selling point for many) so you better like burgers. As many people have mentioned, the burgers aren't mind blowing, but you can count on a tasty burger. I really love that the top bun is slightly grilled so there's a bit of crunch between the bread and that cheesy, juicy goodness. Served with onions, lettuce, and pickles on a small plastic plate, its a simple and reliable pleasure everyone should get to enjoy at least once. Just dont come in thinking you've found the holy grail of burgers and you'll have a great time :)
