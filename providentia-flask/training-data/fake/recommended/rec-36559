This is my go-to bar.  This is what a bar should be like.   I love the ambience, the prices are decent, and the bartenders are the best.  My nights to come are Sunday and Monday night.  Great selection of draft and bottled beers, and a full bar.  They have lovely thin crust pizza and if you get their early enough, they will bring out little snacks on the bar!  Ladies, there are hooks under the bar to hang your belongings (awesome), and the back room is great for large parties and big groups.  Plus, the back room has waiter service.  Bathrooms are always clean.  Great place to chill and hang out with friends.  I always meet the most interesting people here: beer promoters, firemen, insurance guys, etc.   This bar caters to mostly the older crowd, so don't expect house music or glow in the dark paint.  Expect good times, good conversations, and always drinking much more than expected.  :)
