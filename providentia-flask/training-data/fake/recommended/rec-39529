I have been here twice before last year. This place has gone way downhill. We ordered the pork tacos from the tapas menu. It tasted 1) like cheap beef that was 2) extremely overcooked and overseasoned. It was like chewing rubber. Now these are small tacos and I had finished 1, and my girlfriend finished half of hers. We told the waitress we wanted to send it back (something I've done maybe a handful of times in my life). She never apologized or even asked what was wrong with it. She immediately just told us that we would have to pay for the entire plate since 1.5 tacos were eaten. We said no. The manager came and said he would "split it with us". Looking back I don't really think that's fair considering how it tasted, and 3 dog food tacos cost $13 a plate. They brought us fish tacos which were OK, but were a lot better a year ago. We were then served a plate of paella we ordered. I don't know what type of clams those were but that is not how they should taste. Everything else was overcooked. Calamari, chicken and shrimp - all rubber. We got the heck out of there. I used to rave about this place. Never again.
