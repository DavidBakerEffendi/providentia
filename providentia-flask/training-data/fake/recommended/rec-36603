My gal pal, Jenna, sure knows how to pick 'em. Not only is this swanky spot beautifully decorated, but the food is delicious and the prices are shockingly low. We went for the lunch special and each paid under $10 for a full entre with free appetizers included! I mean, wha??? Go for the Pad Thai and dumplings. I'll definitely be headed back soon!
