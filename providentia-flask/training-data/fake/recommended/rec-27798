Just stopped by for a glass of wine...and what a treat that was!  The bartender (seems funny to call him that since he seems to know more about wines than many sommeliers I have met) was very helpful and knowledgeable. Wine list is very eclectic and shows great taste.  None of the big standard wines are here.  All carefully selected wines from dedicated producers. I asked for a couple of cheese and he skillfully matched two selections to my wines. Great experience. Nice and cozy atmosphere.  I will be back!
