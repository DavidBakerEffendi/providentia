Went to Beco with a very large group for a birthday dinner last night and everyone had an AMAZING experience. Aside from the awesome food & drinks, the service was fantastic (especially for such a large group in such a small place!). I definitely recommend this place whether it's for a small dinner or a larger celebration!
