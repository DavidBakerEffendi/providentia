Went with a friend on a Tuesday evening, all tapas 1/2 price!!! :). Â We ordered: Guacamole & chips, platano relleno, pulpo, empanada trio (the best of all) and arepas de carne!!! All the food was really good and great prices. We were soooo stuffed thou, maybe next time we wont order as much to eat. I tried a frozen margarita and a mojito which were average, i heard the sangria is better. Service was a bit slow but it was crowded so its understandable.
