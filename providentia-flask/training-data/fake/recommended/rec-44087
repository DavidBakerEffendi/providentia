i LOVED iMunch and can't wait to go back. I can testify that the following were absoloutly AMAZING: TKBLT Monty Chris Chicken Panini Egg and Cheese w/ Turkey Bacon can't wait to try EVERYTHING on the menu.  The difference at iMunch is that they make their foods with love.  Just fair warning, in case you don't want a lot of Mayo, just let them know.  Their love in the sandwiches does include Mayo and took my sister and I by surprise, but now we know next time to tell them light on the Mayo.  The TKBLT was REDICCC!!!!
