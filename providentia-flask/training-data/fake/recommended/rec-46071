We were looking for a Vietnamese restaurant near us without heading to New York City. We were happy to find this place a few weeks ago. The food was decent although the service was not so good. We returned 2 weeks later to find the food dropped in quantity and quality. The service got even worse. the waiter was rude and unfriendly. Needless to say, we will not return again.
