I went to both pats and genos and tried both Philly cheesesteaks with everything on it and I prefer pats over Gino's because their steak is less fatty and more meeting. if I had to compare the two it would be like going to Burger King or a NY burger joint for a cheeseburger, Ginos was very commercialized while pats felt like a home cooked Philly cheese steak.
