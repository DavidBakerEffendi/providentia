Finally got a chance to come here to try their noodles. Everytime I come to chinatown, they are always closed. I tried one of their hand pulled noodles with assorted meats. It was delicious! The broth wasn't too salty but lacked depth of flavor. The noodles weren't raw. A little al dente and the noodles didn't stick to each other. They give you tons of noodles. The price was very affordable. You can see/hear the guy in the back making the noodles. Almost sounds like someone's getting a good beating back there =P I do like how they have fresh cilantro at the table. I love cilantro so I put a lot of it into my soup. They also have other condiments such as sriracha, chili oil, and hoisin sauce. You can easily turn your noodles into tasting like pho =P Â The various meat pieces I had were okay. Not really flavorful, overcooked, and use poor quality pieces of meat. The service was excellent. The ladies were friendly and attentive to our requests. They definitely have better service than Great NY Noodle Town. In any case, I would still recommend this place because of the economical price, the amount they give you, and the tastiness of the noodles. This place is really a solid 3.5 stars because the broth and quality of meat is lacking, but I think the other factors justify me giving it 4 stars.
