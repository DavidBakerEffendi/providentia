I've been to this place several times with friends and always liked it, but I hadn't been for several years until my grandma just invited me out to dinner. We went on a Sunday night expecting it to be empty, but there was about a 30 minute wait. They were so kind though, and seated us right away because they realized my grandma couldn't stand for that long. Despite the crowd, they had great service. We had the most delicious watermelon mojitos, and the half pitcher was more than enough for the 2 of us. We got some empanadas and goat cheese fritters for our appetizers, both delicious although it took a while to get them. Then our main courses came shortly after, and were AMAZING. I got a whole fried red snapper, cooked and seasoned to perfection. Each came with hearty sides of rice, beans, plantains, and yucca. Needless to say, we were too full for dessert but wished we could try it, because I'm sure it would have been nothing short of excellent.
