Eddie and I walked in on a Sunday night and were seated pronto at the communal table thing. It's a cute place and very E. Village-y. We loved everything we ate- pork buns (not the normal giant dough things), seared squid, and ooooooh the hangar steak w/ romesco- sooo good. Our server was super mellow but attentive and we probably sat there for two and a half hours or so. Â Worth the hype!
