Sabrina's is my favorite place in Philly. I've eaten at every one - Italian Market, Fairmount and University City - and they're all absolutely delicious. Best brunch in the city - the wait is well worth it. Everything tastes so fresh, which makes a huge difference, and there's always a full page of brunch and dinner specials to choose from, as if the mainstays weren't delicious enough. I've brought friends and family from out-of-town here and they all ask to come back next time! You can't go wrong at Sabrina's.
