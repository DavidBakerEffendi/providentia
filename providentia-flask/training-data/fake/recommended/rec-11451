I recently hit up this chill little Aussie hangout for a smashing Saturday mid morning brunch, and I was definitely not disappointed.  They not only had a fine assortment of of hot beverages (I had some Apple Tea), but they also had a pretty slammin sounding brunch menu.  I was in the mood for something in the way of Eggs Benedict, but I saw the words Creme Brulee Batter French Toast.  And I never looked back.  My friend also ordered this...but I couldn't watch someone else eat that and then not eat that, right?  I mean that would be insane.  Hearing about how fluffy and delicious those thick slabs of French Toast were with there delicious Sour Cream Dipping sauce would have driven me mad.  Sooooooo I'll have to hit up some Eggs Benedict at my next brunch. We also had the ridiculously good potato chip fries (home made crunchy fries)...they also came with some classy ketchup in a metal container.  All in all a fine way to start the day.  Hit this place up.
