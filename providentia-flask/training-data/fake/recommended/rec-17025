Had the food before and after the renovation.  Hibachi, Chinese, Sushi and take-out. Hibachi is a great time and the food is phenomenal.  A bit expensive though.   Chinese food has the basics and some chef specialties.  I usually go for the Happy Nest.  It's a potato basket filled with mixed veggies along with chicken,pork,beef, and shrimp.  Absolutely amazing.    Either way it's the best I can find in the area.   Take out gives the bang for the buck and is just as delicious.   This is my go to place and I will never stop going here.  Sit down, take out, dinner party this is the place to go.  You will not be disappointed.
