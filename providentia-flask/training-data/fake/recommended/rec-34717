I can't say anything that hasn't already been said - The waits are long but I've never had a bad dish here, and there's a bar around the corner to get a beer while you wait. The pork buns are amazing, and in a different league than Momofuku's. The shisito peppers are tasty. The ramens are heavenly.  All of them.  With seasoned eggs and spicy paste and ... just heavenly.   Fun atmosphere.
