Came here for the first time tonight. Love the spot, though it was dead on a Sunday evening. Had cheeseburger special. Very basic burger but very tasty. Comes cooked Medium by default which is fine with me. Got fries too. Very good but over salted. Nice beer selection. Cool place with Ping pong and Jenga. I anticipate coming here a lot especially during warmer months. Curious what they'll do with open garden when Mr. Winter comes along
