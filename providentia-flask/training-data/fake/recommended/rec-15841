I was deceived by the good reviews by fellow yelpers. First off, you call this this a wine bar? I ordered a glass of Riesling at the bar and it tasted like crap, more like pinot nior than a sweet Riesling for $11. Waste of my money.  For dinner, I ordered my favorite dish, the eggplant parmigiana, which was soo salty I can barely tolerate it.  Did the chef literally pour the entire container of salt, because even the waiter apologized and acknowledged it was very salty.  The only redeeming quality of this place was that they comped us a chocolate mousse dessert that was quite good and took the eggplant off our bill.   Place is soo overrated. Not to mention the other pasta dish was not even worth mentioning.
