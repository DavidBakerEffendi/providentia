Rudeness.   I love it with a side of fried pork and chive dumplings.  The delicate tingling of a million judgemental pinpricks cascade down my shoulders as I am rushed through my order. The haphazard manner in which my styro-foam plate is assembled and thrust out to me across the linoleum counter is the perfect accompaniment to my hot plastic container of beef noodle soup.  I fumble with my money in a moment of self-aware panic, overcome by a wave of incompetence under the burning glare of grandma whatever. Cleanliness.   Sometimes a thing I long for, sometimes a thing I can live without, sometimes something I must pretend exists.  One sits and eats much like one rubs the lotion on its skin.  Yes, Precious? Directions. Do not ask the best way to cook the bag of 50 frozen dumplings you have just sheepishly purchased for $8.  To thaw first or not to thaw first, yay, that is the question.  Don't worry, you have 48 left to get it right. Prosperity. It is time.
