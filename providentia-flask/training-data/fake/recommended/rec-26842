Great dive bar with truly excellent burgers.  It is fun to watch the guys in the kitchen make the burgers because they go in to the "burger oven" like large patties and bulk up as they cook into what looks like a bun made of meat. The bistro burger is great, worth the extra 75 cents for the bacon.  The fries are thin and crunchy but I recommend you order the chili cheese fries.  It isn't on the menu but they will make it for you upon request.  As mentioned in so many other reviews, you cannot beat a $2.50 McSorely Ale to wash it all down. I would have given 5 stars but I was annoyed with the way you get a table.  It is first come first serve which is ok but you have to wait on a line to get a table.  It would be better if you got to put your name down, move to the bar while you wait, and get called when the table is ready. Other than that small gripe, Corner Bistro is an awesome place to hang out with friends, get a cheap beer, and a great burger.  What more could you possibly ask for?   Grade: B+
