Terrific food. I had the poletto (chicken with artichokes). Delicious. Far, far better than Laconda Verde. The chicken was tender and the sauce had tang and sweetness without being too strong. The whole dish was light and full of flavor. I expect to end up eating this about once a month. The service was very good. However, I really don't like the look of the place. It's like a TGIF. Â It has neither style nor atmosphere. But, then again, it looks like any generic Italian restaurant in Little Italy. So I guess it looks authentic. I tend to prefer very stylish restaurants that look like clubs or art galleries.
