As a native New Yorker, the amount of time I had to wait for the pizza was not attractive at all. There was no wait when I got there, but they made me outside for 45min before sitting anyone. It seemed like they wanted to create an unnecessary line. The pizza itself was very good, but unfortunately, I happened to sit right under the AC, which made my pizza really cold. I guess my experience was not the best one here...
