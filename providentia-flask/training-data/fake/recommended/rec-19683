Come when they first open (during the week) to steal a table faster. The best way to experience cha-an is probably to order their set dishes. The 15 grain porridge is okay- a tad on the sweet side but do-able. I had the chicken soboro-don and it was savory. Make sure you ask the waitress if the tea that you went for matches the meal.. sometimes you can pick the totally wrong tea (as my companion did) and the dishes are just thrown off. this is not the place to bring a grown man who is starving. the portions are small-- but you won't leave hungry. Try the desserts-- especially the black sesame creme brulee and chocolate souffle. it's heavenly.
