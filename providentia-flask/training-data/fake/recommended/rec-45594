I can definitely not fault them for the wait, how do people complain that a busy restaurant has a wait that is absurd. If you don't want to wait go to a place that is not popular. The food is fresh for the most part, and I like the combination of fresh unique entrees with a rustic greasy spoon diner decor. It immediately disarms and creates a friendly community type of atmosphere. Although it was challenging trying to eat steak and eggs because my wife had to forcibly hold the table down so it did not tip over from the cutting action. I get what they are doing there and the only problems I had was the prescrambled eggs which is one of my breakfast pet peeves and the steak I ordered rare came out with no hint of even pinkness what so ever. Overall a solid experience Â with some unique ideas but I would not wait 30 minutes for it again
