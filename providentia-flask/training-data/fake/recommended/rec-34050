Do or Dine is starting to make me feel like some kind of over-zealous groupie.  Seriously, every time I dine here I find myself raving about it for weeks to people who weren't even talking about food.  It's that good.  You walk away glowing and you want to share it with everyone you know. Favorites: Shishito peppers. Duck. Salmon! (Normally I think salmon is boring, but theirs is incredible.) Also, I think one of the things that makes this place great is personality.  These guys have a sense of humor, something seriously missing at a lot establishments these days.  And I adore them for it.  Why be pretentious when you can have a laugh instead? Go, eat, drink, and be silly.
