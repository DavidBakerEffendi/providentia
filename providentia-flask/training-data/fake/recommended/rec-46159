I just started working in Farmington, I went here last night. The food wasn't great but the servers were good and the bartenders were very nice. They were out of the beer I wanted but they told me with a smile so I wasn't too mad. Then half way threw my dinner, all these 20 year olds came in and started being very loud. And it was only 6pm. I over heard one saying "dude, you were right, they didn't even card me" implying that he was under age. I didn't like that at all. Over all, I didn't enjoy my night out.
