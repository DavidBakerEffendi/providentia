This was definitely a regular pizzeria for me growing up and it really doesn't get better than A&S. Sure, there are plenty of places to visit for a great slice of pizza but this place has got a very welcoming vibe and friendly staff. Prices are great, food is delicious, and it's a great place to grab a bite before catching the ferry.
