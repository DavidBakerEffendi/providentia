LOVE this place! Handy's is the quintessential breakfast experience. This is the type of place presidential candidates visit on the campaign trail. Definitely a highlight of our trip to Burlington. The owner Earl is a great American and likes to chat up the patrons. His mom bakes a mean chocolate chip cookie too.
