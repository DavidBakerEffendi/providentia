Really great food for a special occasion.  It's a bit harsh on the wallet, but worth it.  Each dish is delicately prepared and presented - all high-quality ingredients.  The ambience is a bit like "old ladies luncheon," so not exactly the place for a trendy night out, but if you need a classy place for a business meal (or to bring the folks), this is the place.
