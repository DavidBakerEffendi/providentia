Umami Burger is definitely worth the wait. I love truffles and I love meat. Their powers combine and create the truffle burger. The truffle cheese is delicious in combination with the beef but the cheese on the truffle fries aren't so wonderful. I liked the shoestring fries but I preferred them straight up dipped in the sauces. They provide four dipping sauces in the Asian spoon ladles which is a cute touch. Jalape√±o ranch, organic ketchup, Diablo sauce, and garlic aioli. I liked the two latter the best. My dinner partner had the truffle especial which has a fried egg and more of a 'truffle oil taste'. He seemed to like it and gobbled it up. The alternative burgers smelled good. I plan on coming back to try them although I don't know if I can give up the truffled burger. Delicious!
