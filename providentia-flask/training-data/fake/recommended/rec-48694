A dream come true. I come this place to have my tummy wishes fulfilled. Expect to see a line when lunchtime starts.  Unless you are ordering something a la carte like a frappe or a bowl of hot noodles, it is simply grab and go ordeal.   I love to get their bento boxes.  Feels like a kid with a healthy food and impeccable presentation to satiate my appetite. Plus, the menu changes everyday.  I never get bored trying out something different.   Their sushi is middle of the road.   More on the value side.  I guess I miss the freshness of sushi made from a restaurant.  When it sits in the fridge, it sometimes lose that appeal.  Don't get me wrong. I love a chirashi once in a while.   This place also sells sweets.  You gotta try the rolls and almond cookies.  Why not grab a loaf of English bread while you are at it?  Thirsty?  Order a red bean frappe.   Benton always hits the spot. Thank you for opening the store!
