My boyfriend and I went here after trying to find a good BYOB place.  The staff was very friendly and attentive, which was great.  Right when we walked in they saw that we had a bottle of wine and gave us 2 glasses and asked if we needed a wine key. LOVE that there isn't a corkage fee, major bonus! We ordered the mac and cheese, pulled pork sando and bacon cheese burger (med-rare) They were also playing the basketball game which was a big plus too. The mac and cheese was very bland. Even eating it the next day with lots of spices added from home there just wasn't much flavor. Lots of cheese, somehow no flavor.   The pulled pork was good, nothing to write home about but a solid sandwich. The sweet potato fries we got with it were under cooked, however my boyfriend didn't want to send them back so I can't comment on how they would have tasted had they been cooked properly. The burger was good, cooked well, very juicy, the bacon was delicious (when is it not?) and the bun was decent.  The spicy fries are by far the best!! I would highly recommend those above everything else. Overall a decent experience, I may go back simply for the BYOB option.
