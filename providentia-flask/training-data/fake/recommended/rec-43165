Ate here last night with friends and I'm pretty sure I just awoke from a dream about it! This is no nonsense polish food at a ridiculously cheap price! The pierogi's Â are cheap, plentiful and delicious. The kielbassa is easily the best I've ever had, crisp and savory. (we considered ordering another one for dessert) and the "Hungarian Pie" illicited a genuine verbal outburst upon meeting with my tongue. Potato pancake, meets beef goulash. Who knew this was the best thing ever?! The restaurant is the size of someone's living room and they're drink policy is BYOB. So grab some beer from next door and get the hell over there! Come hungry (Very hungry!) and leave happy! (SO happy!)
