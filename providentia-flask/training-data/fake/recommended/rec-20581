The only thing I like here are the fruit smoothies. Their desserts look delicious but I'm always too full by the time I get to that point. Other foods are kind of hit or miss. I haven't tried everything though since it's a diner and diner menus are extensive. I've come here quite a lot this year because I have some friends who live in the area. Came here after some long nights and then after a 5k and just randomly throughout the year. Service is inconsistent, depending on the waiter and time you go in. Obviously later times (like past midnight) mean less patient waiters. So...I didn't take a star off for that. The stars off are for the corned beef hash which could stand to be wayyy more delicious than it is and this one time I had a benny here and ended the rest of the day on the toilet. That said, it only happened the 2nd time I've been here and I've come here a bunch of times and am still alive and still eat their food and am usually full and satisfied with it which is all I expect from a diner so...not sure what that says about me, but ...yeah. Anyway, long story short, it's a Jersey diner. Pretty standard. Great smoothies.
