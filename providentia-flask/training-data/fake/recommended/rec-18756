I had the Kefi Salad, shared a Yiayia's Meatballs with friends, and the Swordfish. Everything was excellent. The meals took a really long time to come out ... not sure why. But the waiter took the initiative to tell one of the managers that it was taking a long time. The manager then came over to apologize and said that he was going into the kitchen to personally check on the meals. He came right back saying it would come out next. In spite of that, he surprised us by sending over a "Selection of Spreads" appetizer on the house. They really handled a mishap in the kitchen very professionally and I would recommend this place to anyone. I will say that it was extremely noisy on a Sat night and probably wouldn't be the best choice for a romantic date (lighting also doesn't lend itself). But to have a great Greek meal ... which is something really different for a change, I hightly recommend Kefi!
