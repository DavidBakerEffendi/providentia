I was there yesterday (on a Saturday night), and the food, atomosphere, service, drinks -- everything was absolutely wonderful.  The owner was actually cooking that night and the food was fantastic -- DELICIOUS!  My family and I go there quite often, but always on a weekday and we never have any complaints; but I have got to say that LAST NIGHT WAS THE BEST QUALITY OF FOOD AND SERVICE IN ALL OF THE TIMES THAT WE HAVE GONE THERE.  Total thumbs up to this place!  It has always been a crowd pleaser in my book!  I highly suggest the chilean seabass and champagne peach sangria!
