Fonda, my new love.  Words fail me when I try to write this review.  The guac was the most delicious thing I have ever tasted.  They were sooo amazing when I became a little needy and asked for veggies to dip instead of eating the chips (trying to locate my figure and all that).  Brought me a beautiful plate filled with sliced carrots, cucumbers, etc.  YUM!   We ordered the burger (with pico de gallo and avocado).  Soooo delicious.  We also ordered the fish tacos.  I could have ordered everything off the menu just to taste it all.  I will deinitely be back.  Again and again and again.  Watch out mexican food world, this one will knock you out of the water!
