It's on the second floor up an uninviting staircase.  The air conditioner was broken and it's BYOB so we had to run to across the street to a bodega to get drinks.  All that said the service, food and prices were all fantastic and we had a really good time.  It's $15 for an appetizer, entrée and dessert, and the food was delicious and the portions were generous.
