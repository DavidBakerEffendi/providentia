I enjoyed having brunch at Cafecito. One of the waiter was very friendly he was always making sure we was okay and enjoying ourselves. I wish I knew his name. I would recommend to try out the Cuban sandwich. This place make it the best Cuban sandwich. Also it best to get unlimited mimosa deal. Over all I would highly recommend this place.
