Having grown up in Vermont and spending a lot of time in Burlington you would think I would have found this place sooner. Unfortunately it wasn't until my last 2 or 3 years there that my wife and I found what has got to be the best sandwich place in all of Vermont. Homemade fresh bread generously cut, crisp and fresh veggies, plenty of meat. It can be an issue for some people (my wife included) to eat because it's so thick when they load everything up. The atmosphere is pretty nice too with seating inside or out on Church Street. A little crowded inside, but whether you take your food to go or eat there, the taste quickly makes you forget any shortcomings of the establishment (if there are any, I can't remember). Don't forget to get a cookie even if you don't have room. Those are fresh baked too and rival the sandwiches for tastiness. Next time we're back in Burlington you better believe we'll try to get away to lunch at the Onion.
