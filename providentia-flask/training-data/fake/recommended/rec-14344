I went by around 10pm and bought three slices of pizza and asked for a glass of water to go with it. Was very rudely told that I could only get water if I bought a 2 dollar bottle. I could clearly see a tap water as well as a fountain machine in which I could get a glass and politely asked for one again, explaining that I believed that the tendency to buy bottled water was bad for the environment and the idea of having to pay for water is unacceptable. I was then ignored.
