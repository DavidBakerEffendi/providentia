Had al fresco brunch here on a Sunday afternoon.  The staff is attentive and the outdoor seating was perfect for people watching.  I had the asparagus and spinach soup which was divine.  The french toast was good, but I didn't like the crust so I ate mostly the inside.  It's hard to judge a place by brunch, but if the food is similar to the soup I got from the lunch menu then it would be worth a visit.
