Good fast lunch in midtown. The line can be long, but moves quickly. Don't plan to sit, there's never room and the rolls travel well. Go eat in Bryant Park. The mixed veggie roll and chicken tikka are both really good. Good level of spice (for NYC, which I generally find a little bland). They'll make it spicier if you ask. Get two rolls (three if you're a big eater). I eat very small portions and usually want more than one roll to fill me up. It's about $5/roll.
