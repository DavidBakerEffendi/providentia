Excellent food! Friends and I visited here a few months ago and we were impressed. Having grown up eating Peruvian food, I was excited to give this place a shot. We did not leave disappointed. The food was delicious, the price was very reasonable, and the portions were very generous. We will definitely be back next time we're in Manhattan.
