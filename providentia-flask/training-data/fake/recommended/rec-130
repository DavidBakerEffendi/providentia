New york style Italian restaurant, good location, nice decor and pretty good staff. Started with Fried Calamari and it was good, nothing special as Calamari goes. For meal i had Veal Milanese. The Veal was tender and nice flavor served with arugula, red onions and balsamic vinaigrette. Portions were huge and price was reasonable! Â  Recommended
