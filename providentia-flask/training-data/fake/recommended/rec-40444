This place is amazing. I got a chicken cutlet club, while it took a while to come out (20 min or so), I found out it was because they fried my chicken cutlet fresh, on the spot. It taste like my mother in laws chicken cutlet. Absolutely fresh, delicious food. Super friendly dude at the counter. Prices are really fair. Can't recommend highly enough! Go. Eat. Blow your mind.
