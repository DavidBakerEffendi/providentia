The margaritas and guacamole are legendary at this establishment, and I can see why. They use a decent amount if excellent tequila in the margaritas so be careful while drinking. My table shared a guacamole sampler, and every single one was amazing. I had the bean enchilada which came in a delicious and savory red sauce. The nachos have tender, marinated beef on top, but beware the hot salsa that is drizzled on top. Our waiter was great- made suggestions, cautioned us about spice level, and was a lot of fun to interact with. The food came out quickly and was fresh and authentic. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone with a crazing for margaritas or Mexican food.
