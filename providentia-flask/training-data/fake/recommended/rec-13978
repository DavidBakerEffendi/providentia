Ha, I'm so behind on this review. This review comes nearly a year to the month I was here (which was last August). Some of the details have gotten muddled even lost through the lapse in time of this outing to present day of writing the review. However, we all have those experiences when you had such a great time, the fun memories remain. This was one of the most fun birthday celebratory experiences I've had in a long time. The best of the elements: sharing with my sister, bro-in law and nieces and nephew was the highlight. One of the best hibachi experiences ever!  The food was good, not great, but definitely fresh and worthy of 3 stars.  From the chicken, fish, steak, vegetables, rice, noodles all earnestly good in their preparation. The highlight however, was the master hibachi chef who brought energy, fun, creativity, artistry and humor to the show he put on for our table.  Great entertainer and sincere to boot.  He was wonderful with children. The kids loved it.  I have to say it again, just a really fun time. I can't remember the details of the designs of his creations using the food and ingredients, but the memory of huge belly laughs lingers. It wasn't just our guy. In observing some of the other parties at the other tables, howls of  hilarity echoed throughout Izumi. The owner stopped by to take a birthday picture of me wearing the purple, sparkly 2009 glasses he gave me. If you're looking to sit back, be entertained in comfortable open space and enjoy watching your meal prepared before your eyes, Izumi is the place.   4 stars for the fun time and experience. 3 stars for the food.  Ahhh, hibachi, you make me smile.  I want to zoom back to Izumi!
