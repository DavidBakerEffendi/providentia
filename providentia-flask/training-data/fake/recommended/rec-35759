Overall, this is a great restaurant.  The menu choices are really interesting and delicious, and the servers are attentive.  I have eaten here twice now, and both have been great dining experiences. The ONLY negative about this place are the two ridiculous greeters at the front door.  Even though I had scheduled an early dinner reservation and the restaurant was relatively empty, these two clowns made a point of making my guest and I wait in the bar area in the hopes that "we would order a drink."  I just hate restaurants that do this to their guests.  Do you really think that we are stupid and don't realize that you're simply trying to get us to spend more money?  And then, when I called them out on this, the two greeters copped all this attitude with me about how "they will seat me when they are ready." So, I did what any good New Yorker would do.  I grabbed two menus from the front desk and announced, "Thanks, we'll just go seat ourselves and you can send the manager over to speak with us."  And then my guest and I sat down. Then, a woman claiming to be the manager (I'm pretty sure that she wasn't the manager) came by our table and offered my guest and I a free drink.  She apologized to us for the poor treatment by the greeters. So 5 stars minus 2 stars for the nasty greeters at the front door.
