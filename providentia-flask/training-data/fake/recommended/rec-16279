Overall the food was good and the service as good. I'm giving it three stars because the service from the kitchen end was very slow. It took us over an hour and a half to get 4 orders of tapas. I don't know if they purposely did that so we can enjoy the food but the wait was unbearable. We went at 6pm too so it wasn't like prime dinner time or anything. We would wait a good 10-15 min for the next dish to arrive. The food itself was good, I'm not a huge fan of fusion but overall flavors were not bad. The bbq wraps was my favorite as they marinated the hanger steak perfectly. I would go back again but I would clear my schedule and allow 2+ hours for dinner.
