From the cheese and anntipasti platter to the roasted carrots, and duck breast, everything was to yummy. We were celebrating my sister's birthday and from the moment we told our waitress she was super attentive. I enjoyed everything I ate and happily told my coworker about it--she went and had an enjoyable experience too.
