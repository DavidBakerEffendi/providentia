I love you Izuuumi, oh yes I do I love you Izzzummi, and I'll be true When you're not near me, I'm blue Oh Izzuuummi, I love you. I feel like that's all she wrote, ladies and gents, a nice little mashup of my favourite sushi restaurant and my favourite musical. Unfortch for me, Izumi is far away. Well it's past Washington, past Broad, and those are usually my limits...Only because I like to walk everywhere and it's so cold these days... But once you are there, you are in heaven. They have real seaweed salad, which is amazing because nobody has it anymore. There is no comparison of the green stringy overdressed "seaweed salad" to this luscious taste of the ocean. My favourite is their rock shrimp tempura. Hands down one of my happiest foods in the city. I guess they fry it with a lining of wasabi and the shrimp is just so sweet and oh wow, I just love it. All of the maki is good. I love the remy roll, which is just like a burst of amazing in your mouth. I could probably order 6 orders and eat all of them. I suggest you try it out for yourself. It's a byo and the rush is pretty intense on the weekends and even some weeknights, so make a reservation, head on down past Washington and Broad, and maybe stop for a drink at The Dolphin when you are done.
