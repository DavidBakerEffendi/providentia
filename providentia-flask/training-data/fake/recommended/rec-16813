We went for a beer week event, which was awesome but, other than having beers that came from Alla Spina's taps, had nothing to do with their menu.  Because of the event, it was crowded, which made it noisy and the acoustics made it hard to hear my fellow diners. Food: Delicious.  Seriously.  Crunchy and crispy and savory in all the right ways.  I give three stars because while the mushrooms and zucchini were insanely flavorful (amazing what the final squeeze of lemon juice, pat of butter, and sprinkle of salt will do to a dish!), they were super oily.  Like, 1/4" of olive oil in the bottom of the dish oily.  Everyone loved everything they got, but I wasn't a huge fan of the pretzels--they didn't seem that special.   Beer list: awesome.  Very sexy tap set up in the middle of the bar, too.  Prices slightly higher than for the same beers at bars nearby, but not Rittenhouse Square higher.   The bar crowd was all ages--young uns' barely old enough to drink rubbing elbows with folks old enough to be their parents.  Saw a couple parents come in with teen children and sit in the restaurant.  It started to feel like a nightclub by the time we left around 9. Decor: industrial chic.  Graffiti on the walls, concrete and corrugated metal, but classy experience. Service: pretty attentive.  Our waiter forgot one dish but brought it right out when we reminded him.   Dessert:  no idea.  Too full to contemplate. Will definitely go back.
