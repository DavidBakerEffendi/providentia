My friend told me how great this place was after she came to pick up a panini for lunch. I had my hopes up high. The wait for a table on a Sunday morning was 30 minutes or so. Ordered our panini's and a appetizer and that took another 30 minutes. It was a really long wait that we all hated since we were starving and hungover! anyways I forgot what exactly what we ordered but I didn't see the hype about the food. the appetizer was definitely not touched after one bite. never coming back here again we were eating our lunch faster than it took to get our food!
