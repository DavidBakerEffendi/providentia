Absolutely great place and and fun to visit.  Had wanted to go here for a while and was finally able to to make it on a Saturday afternoon for drinks and pizza at the bar..  The bartender and the rest of the staff were very friendly and the prices were reasonable.  The much vaulted pizza was mediocre on the day I was there but I will definitely try it again as I plan on returning repeatedly.
