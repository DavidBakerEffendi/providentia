I recently visited Nan Zhou for the first time in a very long time. It had been months. Unfortunately, the shaven noodles and the broth were really disappointing. I don't know if it was just me, but the quality of the noodle soup had taken a nosedive. The broth was even more watered down than usual. The service was really slow. We ordered appetizer (shredded potatoes), which came out AFTER my friend and I finished our bowl of noodle soup. I'm really reluctant to come back here again. There are tons of new restaurants in Chinatown that I haven't explored, anyway.
