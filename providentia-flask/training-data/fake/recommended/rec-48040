I went here for maybe the fifth time since my inaugural visit.  The first time I went to Oasis I was so sold.  I thought their falafel was absolutely delicious - comparable to a favorite place of mine in my hometown - and I appreciated that they let me use a debit card for a $5 lunch.  I must have gone on an off day then, because it was a pleasant experience.   The people who work there are so rude.  SO rude! Once I went with my boyfriend and almost cried when we got our food.   He and I each ordered the same sandwich:  chicken shawarma with hummus and hot sauce.  While he got a hot, spicy, heaping pocket chock full of the toppings, I got this anemic looking crap sandwich with no hot sauce, barely any chicken and meager toppings.  It was basically all hummus and I could not believe they had the nerve to make both sandwiches in that fashion in that sequence.  I think they are highly sexist.  Probably racist too, but more sexist.  I asked my boyfriend to go to the counter to ask them to fix it, and they beefed it up to a slightly lesser level than his (ignoring the hot sauce again).   Usually I go alone and get the falafel, and while I've never had the problem again where my sandwich wasn't generous enough, I usually incite their hostility somehow and sheepishly eat my lunch feeling upset.  Go at your own risk.
