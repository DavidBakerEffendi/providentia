The food was just ok (especially for the price) but we did have excellent service on a very busy evening. Our server was very knowledgeable about the entire menu and very enthusiastic about the food. We ordered the sourdough, green beans, scallop, burrata, sole and potatoes and to me the highlight was the green beans. They were pickled and then fried which had a unique flavor when the two methods were put together. The burrata was also very good and is served over fried green tomatoes...maybe everything they serve should be fried...
