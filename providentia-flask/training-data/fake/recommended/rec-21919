The pizza at the New Park Tavern is that great thin crust type.  They have all the usual toppings available and make one pie that has just about everything...the Garbage Pie...which I would rename the New Park Special.   The pizza is highly recommended as is the combination salad.  A great meal which does not disappoint!
