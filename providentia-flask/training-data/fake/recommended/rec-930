This place is nothing more than a tourist trap. For starters it's overpriced, the cheesesteak is gonna cost you 9.50 and if you want fries and a drink that's an additional 7$. Next the cheesesteak itself is terrible, no matter which cheese I get all I can taste is the bread and the onions. The steak is comparable to a piece of plastic. Lastly this has nothing to do with the food itself but I really didn't like the speak english sign. Were supposed to accept and embrace everyone for who they are not be racist discriminating jerks towards people. If your looking to go for a real Philly cheesesteak try other places in the city such as Jim's or Tony Luke's that make better steaks than these tourist attraction sellouts. In summary, bad food, overpriced, discriminating jerks and a waste of time and money
