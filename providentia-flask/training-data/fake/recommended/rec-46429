This is the perfect place to have lunch. Tasty dishes, quick service, decent wines by the glass, and a really nice atmosphere with enormous windows. You may have to wait a while if there's a big rush, but it's worth it. For those times when you want to sit down and enjoy a glass of wine with your meal and savor terrific ingredients, this is a solid choice. And the soft shell crab sandwich was definitely worth the calories induced. It can be kind of loud and crowded, but for a table of 2, it's just fine.
