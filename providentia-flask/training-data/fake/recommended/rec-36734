Anytime I can eat in the village, I automatically give an extra star. We had a great dinner here on a Sunday night. The space is very nice and our entrees, the Sea bass and hangar steak were incredible. Most impressive for the night was the service. Every employee we encountered, the host, waiters, bartender... just had such great attitudes. It was a very pleasurable evening. Thanks Perrilla!
