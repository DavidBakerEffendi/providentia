Where do I begin. How dare they call themselves a "BBQ & Bar" and don't know how to make decent bbq? PLEASE!!! Don't order their smoked brisket and black bean empanada. Its terrible. Its dry and barely tasted the brisket. And their crab cakes... HORRIFIC!!! I've had better crab cakes from the frozen food section. The crab cakes were very bland, dry, and just didn't look appetizing. The baby back ribs were not that bad but I expected them to be tender. SuzyQue's gives you four sauces to eat with your ribs or chicken. The sauces were good. However, they only gave one ounce (of each sauce) for two people. Really? The mac & cheese was good, even though I had to add lots of salt and pepper for it to be edible. I really enjoyed the beer. It was my first time drinking Stella Artois and I'm a fan. Great beer. It was the best thing I had while dining at SuzyQue's. The upsetting thing is I went with a friend, and fellow Yelper Kay T. We both had a Groupon for this restaurant. We could only use one Groupon, so she used hers but I still have mine. I would hate to give this Groupon to my mom because she will disown me. I guess I will figure out how to use it. I don't want to waste it. Oh, and one more thing. Both Kay T. and I had food leftover to take home and the guy who packed our food gave us the wrong food. We didn't know until the next day.
