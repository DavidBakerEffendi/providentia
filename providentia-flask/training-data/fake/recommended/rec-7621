They sell sandwiches, soups, ice cream, frozen yogurt, coffee, pastries, and combinations of the above. The interior is spacious and there are even couches. They are one of the only places I have seen outside of New Mexico that serves Posole. The employees are particularly nice, and even let me receive a phone call on their phone. This establishment (as well as the other locations) are a gem in the Princeton area.
