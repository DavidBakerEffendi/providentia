Food: nothing to brag about. Especially, given the price range. The two types of salsa are mild (pico de gallo) and hot. Decent. The chips are fresh, but on the greasy side. I ordered the Chile Rellenos (beef & cheese). Again, decent. But, of all the Chile Rellenos I have had in my lifetime, this was one of the least memorable and most pricey.  My friend ordered the Sope de Tortilla and it was not good. The broth had a peculiarly unsavory smell and  taste. Drink: The bar was missing key ingredients for the first drink I ordered. So, I went with the "Premium Margarita" and it was a 8 out of 10. My friends were also happy with their drinks. Service: our server was friendly and attentive. Ambiance: chic, with dim lighting and tasteful decor. Also, loud and crowded. To be fair it was a Friday night. Overall, you are paying for ambiance and location, which are great. The food is not worth the price.
