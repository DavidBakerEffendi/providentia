I've found my new favorite burger in town! And man, their beef..is...amazing! They grind it fresh on site each day and you can taste the quality. So juicy, so flavorful, and extremely tender... AHHH. I ordered the Cali Burger, despite being afraid it would be too "plain." I was wrong! Those patties pack SO much flavor! I also appreciate that they don't pile the toppings too high on their burgers so you can really enjoy everything without having half your burger fall out. My gf ordered the original, which I didn't get to try because she scarfed it down faster than anything I've ever seen her eat. We also got regular fries, thin and crispy -- DELICIOUS , and cheesy tots (which is part of a secret menu?). The tots were like crispy fried rolls of mashed potato with gooey cheese in the middle. It is also amazing. Umami Burger also has a great selection of beer, both draught and bottled. Definitely going to keep coming back to try every other burger on the menu.
