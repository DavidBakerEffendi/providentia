Very legit tacos, especially for the UWS. My wife got these Korean tacos that were great, and I had a very reasonably-priced taco trio that came with rice and beans. Fresh ingredients, pretty quick service, casual interior. Definite repeat when I'm in that neighborhood again. (A taco here can also be a great appetizer for sushi across the street at Haru...)
