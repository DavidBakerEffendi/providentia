While the food here is probably great, the service is horrible. I went in last night with four other people and asked how long the wait was. We were snapped at by the hostess who seemed extremely frazzled by the question. I understand everyone has bad days, and she later apologized, so all was forgiven. We went and got drinks elsewhere, and we came back when we got the text that our table was ready. We chatted with the hostess and started following her back to the table. We were then snapped at by ANOTHER woman because they needed an extra minute to wipe down the table, and they wanted us to wait in the front area. If the hostess said this, we honestly did not hear it, and was that really worthy of being snapped at again?! We wound up leaving because after being snapped at by TWO separate people, we just did not feel right giving them our business. I was extremely disappointed, as we just moved to the area, and we planned on this being a regular spot. Everyone in this neighborhood has been friendly and wonderful, except for the people here. Probably will not give this place another try, but Prime Meats next door was excellent!
