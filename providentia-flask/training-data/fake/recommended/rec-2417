"OMG, you are going to Philly, you have to check out Pat's" I heard this from most people I spoke to before going.  The people from Philly I knew, the people who went to school in Philly, the people who have recently moved there.  The majority of people I asked said this was the better of the two. They were all correct.  Pat's puts the Wiz on top of the steaks, which makes it quite amazing.  I ordered "Wiz, Wit" and loved it.  Highly recommended. Before going, look up how to order...or read the instructions posted to the right of the window while you are in the line.  It's not as scary as some people make it out to be. There will always be a line, it does not matter what time of day you are there.
