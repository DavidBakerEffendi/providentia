Let me start out by saying that I LOVE China Pavilion's food. This is a review only of my most recent visit. We went on New Years day around 5:30. There were plenty of open tables and we were seated right away. Our service from that point on was awful. It was as if our waiter was on drugs or something. Painfully slow and just plain odd. The food took forever and that is pretty unusual. I think our waiter forgot we were there. I got the shrimp mei fun & my friend the chicken fried rice. Both were just lukewarm. Mine was super salty and just not good. I was so disappointed as we live pretty far and going here is a treat. Such a bummer.
