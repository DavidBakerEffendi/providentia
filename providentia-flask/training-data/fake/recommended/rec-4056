I'm going to go against the grain and say DON'T get the Calzone. It is just too dense to be considered good. I ate almost 5 hours ago and my stomach still feels like I ingested a lead brick. Pizza is the way to go. Also, we got there about 10 after 9 on a Monday night and were able to walk right in and get a table. Great spot, not sure I would hang out for an hour if the wait was super long though.
