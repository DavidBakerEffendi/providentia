This is for the spicy miso ramen ($11 for a large). Comparable to Santouka. Pork was very tender and flavorful. Both sized comes with half an egg, bamboo shoots, scallions, mushrooms, and beansprouts. Table condiments include ground sesame Seeds, chili oil and saut√©ed garlic. Add-ons, such as nori, pork, egg, etc are reasonable ($1-$2). This is also the only resto I have encountered that asks you how firm you want the noodles to be, which serious ramen connoisseurs will appreciate! Pork buns are decent. I have had better. Very casual, very clean ( the restrooms especially) and bright interior. Bar and table seating available. The place is on the small side but service is good and the waitresses are attentive. Will make this our staple whenever we visit Philly!
