guacamole and chips were great. the chips were salty, but i Â like them that way. they provided a smokey salsa - i asked for more and they gave me freshly chopped habaneros, a verde sauce, and pico de gallo. the corn bread appetizer was too sweet. it's like corn-based pancakes. it was good, just too sweet for being early in the meal. the margarita was decent. my girlfriend had the white sangria, which was good.
