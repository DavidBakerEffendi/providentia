Great tapas, very reasonably priced. The garlic shrimp & chorizo w onions was among the best I've ever had. Seafood paella was great too but a bit on the fishy side. The skirt steak could be sliced a bit thinner. Overall very pleased with the food and service. Red sangria tops off a great experience.
