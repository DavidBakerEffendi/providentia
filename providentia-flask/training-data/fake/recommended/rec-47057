We were so looking forward to a "girls night out" and wanted to try a new restaurant! As we entered Brigantessa we thought what a nice place! They seated the four of us upstairs, handed us menus and we ordered or drinks. We ordered 2 appetizers and a Marguerita pizza & a Special white pizza. When the appetizers arrived we were hysterical...the artichokes were the size of a quarter and there were 2 on the plate, the other was an order of long hots also only two. The pizzas are small, and the Marguerita pizza was undercooked. When the waiter asked how everything was I told him the portions are too small...he became very rude and said "I will leave the slicer and u can cut the last slice in four" and when serving coffee he said "oh three coffees, maybe you two can share this one". Â His name was Richard. He had no idea who we were, each one being in customer service at a high end retailers. We deal with customers everyday and would never display such disrespect. Not only was the food not good....Richard left a bad taste in our mouths!
