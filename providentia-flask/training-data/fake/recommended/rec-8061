I'd have to agree with other reviewers about the Arista. Probably the best sandwich in Philly at the moment. The flavor of the pork is absolutely wonderful. I hate to say but it probably beets out my long time favorite DeNic's. I've had it twice so far. Once with a minimal amount of rabe mixed in with the meat and the second time with a lot of rabe under the meat. Both were delectable. My only complaint is that I wish the cooks would wear gloves. I know it's a pain but...I'm a little freaked out by people (esp. men) not washing their hands properly...esp. because the cook was also handling the money. Gross.
