I had their belgian style meatballs and it was delicious!  I recommend that for the entree.  The sirloin stew in brown ale was not bad either with the tender texture but I prefer the flavor for the meatballs.  Must save room for their desserts.  When it comes to Belgian, you tend to think of chocolate...or beer, but chocolate will come to mind first in desserts.  The profiteroles were very good, wish there was a bit more chocolate sauce.  However, their molten chocolate cake is definitely one of my recommended choices.  How can one resist the gooy chocolate flowing out of the chocolate cake AND served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side.
