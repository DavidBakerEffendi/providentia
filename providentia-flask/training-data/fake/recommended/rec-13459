Is there anything more amazing than soft shell crab at Market Table? I don't think so. I made reservations for 8PM, and they sat us quickly. The place is so adorable, perfect for a nice dinner among friends. We had the steak and the pork tenderloin. Everything was lovely. The wine list is amazing, and the service great. I am not a huge fan of the West Village, but Market Table has changed my mind. The highlight of our dinner was the soft shell crab. It melted in my mouth. We also had the corn as a side order, so creamy, and so fresh. Make reservations, and remember it is not going to be cheap! My one regret: we decided to skip dessert. Well, next time!
