I had such a terrible experience here. I went with a friend for both of our birthdays, all of us Hispanic and familiar with Cuban cuisine. First, it was so crowded I couldn't move and was literally inches from the next party. Second, the food was horrible! Having lived in Miami for 4 years and eating in the homes of many Cuban friends I can say-- worst Cuban food ever! no flavor, not even close. We all got different plates and no one could eat more than a few bites of the bland flood. The most infuriating part was the drinks. Yes, places in NY overcharge for drinks, but this place took it to an extreme. They then overcharged us for our drinks, and when we talked to a manager he was completely rude to us, didn't even attempt to remedy the situation and walked off. Having worked in many a restaurants, when customers are completely overcharged and they have a large check you try to remedy the situation, not give them attitude and go as far to say, 'what am I supposed to do, give you free alcohol?". I never asked for anything free, just don't lie to me and give me attitude when I nicely ask regarding the bill. If you want to overpay for a small class of juice with barely any alcohol in a dingy little place with terrible food, go for it. But I WOULD WARN EVERYONE I KNOW IN NY TO NEVER, EVER GO TO THIS TERRIBLE PLACE!
