I had dinner here with four friends the other night. We waited about ten minutes to be seated. The blackened salmon came with two tender pieces of plantain and several stalks of crisp asparagus. The texture of the salmon, the seasoning, and the portion were all just right, and the meal went so well with a glass of ros√©. One of my friends really enjoyed the ravioli, and two friends loved the chicken and red velvet waffles. When one of us asked the waiter about the mini vegan slider, he replied (with a little snap of the neck), "It's a mini vegan slider." Well, she didn't say that she couldn't read the menu; clearly she wanted details about what was in the thing. She ended up ordering the sliders anyway, and she liked them. Besides that, the service was ok. The brownie sundae was delicious, from the thin, crispy wafer on top of the vanilla ice cream to the sweet, chewy brownie. The bread pudding got good reviews from our group, too.
