Wow, what to say...  Eating at Sabrina's is like treating yourself to a new fur coat...lol Warm and fuzzy is how I feel when I dive into one of her mouth-watering works of art!!  Breakfast at its best is what this place is all about people!!  Ha!!  The problem is that everything looks so damn good that it's difficult to decide what to order...lol  This place is awesome and you have to check it out!!  You will be thanking me with every mouthful of yumminess!! :-)
