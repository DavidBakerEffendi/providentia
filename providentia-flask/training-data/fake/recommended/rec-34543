When I tried to go inside the front man was blocking the door way to control traffic flow. The line inside wasn't that long but the guy still hesitated to let me in. I finally pulled the door open to ask him if they are still open or closed. He said no and he finally allowed me in. I went in about 7pm but I didn't get to leave until about 7:50pm. There were definitely lots of employees working but 3 out of 7 cash registers was the only one available. When I finally got to order my meal, I now understood why it was taking them a long time to turn the orders around. These employees are probably around 16 y/o if that and they were more concentrated in talking to each other than pay attention taking people's order. I ordered the Fiesta Noodles with 2 chickens and that came out to $9.39. I think the food is overpriced. The Fiesta Noodles is ok but not a fan. As for the chicken, it's bland without the gravy. As others mentioned before me here, the chicken is definitely GREASY! Way to greasy. I ended up not eating the second chicken and threw it out. I still think Popeye's is much better in regards to chicken. Yeah, I've experienced better and for now I will stick with my mom's Filipino home cook meal.
