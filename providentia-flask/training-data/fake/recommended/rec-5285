Service was great. Staff was helpful even before we arrived. We had to change our reservation like 3 times. We ended up being a party of 8 and they reserved us a great space. We ordered a ton of apps and everyone split. Tons of vegetarian options. French onion dumplings, Â Brussel sprouts, Quinoa salad & Chilean sea bass was insanely good. My wife loved their Martinis, cheese steak egg roll, quesadilla, & more. They brought us a tray full of deserts on them which was a pleasant surprise and was completely wiped out!
