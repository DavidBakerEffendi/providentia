The Princeton Pi is a good, convenient place in Princeton to grab lunch or dinner. The menu is expansive and stretches from pizza to sandwiches and everything in between. The building is not very large but does have a couple outside tables (Maybe ten booths inside). The food is competitively priced (for Princeton) and the staff was friendly. My Angry Bird sandwich was fantastic! Nothing beats hot sauce, chicken, a fried egg, and other goodies on a sandwich. The Jersey fries weren't anything outstanding but they were filling, especially with the cheese sauce. If you're looking for something just different enough to be interesting, check out Princeton Pi.
