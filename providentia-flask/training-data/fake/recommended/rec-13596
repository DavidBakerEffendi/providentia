I try to only write reviews for places I've been going for years, with menus off which I have tried a variety of items.  However, my dining experience at Riverpark for an early birthday meal with my dad and fiance was so special that it warranted a review here. I give 5 stars only because Yelp doesn't allow the half star- I think I would actually give it a 4.5.  For the most part, service was very friendly, though every time a drink or food was brought out they always seemed to mix up who ordered what- which isn't really that important but seemed surprising how together everything else was. It was a warm spring night, and we were given the option of sitting outside.  The terrace area has heat lamps, and the atmosphere is amazing.  I was hesitant when I saw that the FDR was right there, but honestly it wasn't very loud, didn't smell like fuel... there was just a nice soft roar of the city in the background.  The views of the East River, Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens were really cool.  There was a classy, intimate vibe, definitely an upscale restaurant ideal for special occasions. Everything on the menu sounded amazing- I got the squid ink chitarra to start, which was one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten; my dad and fiance both got the pork ravioli, which looked delicious and apparently was.  Fiance and I both got the diver scallops- with kale chutney, butternut squash, and hen of the woods; and my dad got duck breast, with pomegranate and a few other delicious items.  All of the food was very fresh, well prepared, and the flavor combinations were to die for.   Dessert might have been the highlight of this very good meal.  I got the beignets, which came with a vanilla creme and a marmalade dipping sauce; my dad got the apple crumble; and fiance got the chocolate souffle cake.  We left absolutely stuffed, and absolutely impressed.
