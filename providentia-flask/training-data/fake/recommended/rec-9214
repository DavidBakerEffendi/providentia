The first time I came here we were being wined & dined by consultants and to say they overordered is an understatement. I think that night was the most full I've ever been in life. I was already stuffed by the time I'd sampled all the cold mezze. It was followed by hot mezze, mains, and dessert! I couldn't resist trying most of every course that came out because everything tasted so amazing. Get a bunch of appetizers, they are the best! Great deal for restaurant week b/c you get to pick TWO appetizers! :) They have a tempting cocktail list too.
