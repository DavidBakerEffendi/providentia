What a find! Nestled on a little residential street, Rye has become one of my favorite Williamsburg spots after just one visit. My date and I couldn't get a seat at nearby Traif, so we walked a few blocks north to this spot and were seated immediately on a weekend at 8pm. Not bad. The decor is like a rustic/prohibition era bar; and the service is fantastic. Our waiter described the specials in amazing detail- and we ended up ordering most of them. His descriptions of the wines were incredible; I knew exactly what I was ordering and absolutely loved my selection. My date and I had the smoked ribs for an appetizer and they were fall-off-the-bone, melt-in-your-mouth good. We both got fish entrees and I would order mine every time I come back if I could: a bacon-wrapped sole filet with cauliflower puree & kale. It tasted decadent and hearty while being pretty darn healthy and light. The donut dessert was the only miss for me. It just tasted like deep fried pieces of regular cake... which just tasted dry and uninspired. The caramel dip was good but not worth ordering again. That being said, I'll definitely come here again if I'm looking for a place to eat in Williamsburg. Fantastic food, service, drinks, atmosphere, and company.
