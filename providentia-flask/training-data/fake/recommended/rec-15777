Love this place - by far my favorite Italian restaurant on the UES. The decor is rustic and romantic and the food is delicious. (My favorite is the red beet gorgonzola gnocchi). They also have an extensive wine selection by the glass and bottle. The staff is very attentive. However, in my experience there is always a wait and the bar area is small. They do not take reservations and usually there is about a 30 minute wait for dinner for 2 people (I usually go around 7/8 pm). I have waited over an hour once for a table of 4, but the manager graciously gave us a bottle of prosecco to apologize. It's not that bad in the summer becuase you can wait outside, but during the winter, the small bar area gets very cramped. We now know to come early to avoid the wait!
