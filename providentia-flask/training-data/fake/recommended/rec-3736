First, let me state for the record. I AM NOT A VEGETARIAN.  As a matter of fact, meat is my best friend. :) At the urging of my annoying, vegetarian friend, Vee, I decided to try this amazing "Mango chicken" she kept talking about. she insisted that I would "not be able to tell that its not meat." always eager to prove someone wrong, especially when it comes to my taste buds, I decided to accept the challenge. The next time I ate meat, it came in the form of CROW... The mango chicken was absolutely de-li-cious! It was so good that I ate it for one straight week!  Definitely a dish worth trying. I have had others but this one takes the cake! Definitely worth trying. Don't know much about the decor as I have always had my food delivered.
