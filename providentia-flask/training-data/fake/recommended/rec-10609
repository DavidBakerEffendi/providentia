I'm tempted to compare this to the ramen in Japan, but that's not what this is. It's a little different, a little more refined, perhaps to suit American/Montclair tastes. Judged on that basis it's great, yummy food. Hearty and delicious and comforting. I'm deducting one star because I do wish the ramen itself was a little less expensive; it's $12 here and rarely more than $10 in Tokyo, a more expensive city. I understand if they need to charge more for other dishes. If they had a special, like the vegetarian ramen for $8 or $9 I'd be here every week. At $12 it feels like a treat I'll have once in a while. A shame, 'cause I'd like to be a regular here. Otherwise the service and interior design is good. I dig their Bring Your Own Container policy for leftovers. No complaints.
