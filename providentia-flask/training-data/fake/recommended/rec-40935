Not even sure why this place has negative reviews.  $7 gets you a two-item combo; this being much like regular Panda Express pricing, but it is GREAT for an airport food court.  LAX Burger King combos start around that price. Did I mention you get a heaping portion?  And it's decent fast food?  Comparatively, lo mein noodles at Asian Chao were way better than the standard too-oily or too-burnt Panda Express noodles. I had the mushroom chicken and the "chef's" special -, which equated to teriyaki beef and potatoes.  Not too typically Asian, but whatever.  It was actually my favorite item. Staff consisted of a few giggly teenagers; though a little high-strung, were at least having a good time and were very nice. If I had to offer criticism, the sodium levels were up there.
