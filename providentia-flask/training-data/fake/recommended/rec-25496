My boyfriend and I always have a lovely time at Geronimo! We particularly like the patio... perfect for a relaxing meal, especially after a long day. And try the spicy blood orange margaritas!  The wait staff is also excellent - in particular, our favorite, Hugo!  This charming server goes out of his way to get you what you need to enjoy the evening. He takes pride in his work, and his efforts make all the difference!
