I have finally found a restaurant that I honestly CANNOT afford! Have enjoyed being a foodie all around the world and today I came across Talula's brunch menu & nearly had a heart attack! I will definitely pay $$$ for exceptional food. However, for $32 consisting of a frittata- a 1/4th of a frittata- the smallest frittata I have ever seen, a few potatoes and a plate overflowing with undressed greens to disguise the lack of food on the plate along with a brunch drink I was incredibly, extraordinary, sad to be eating here! If this was the best, or even a good frittata I would've walked out satisfied. It was not! I wish I could get both my Sunday brunch time and $ back from Talula's :-(((
