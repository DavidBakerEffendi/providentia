I heard so much about this place and decided to try it.  The pizza flavor was pretty good and it was definitely thin crust but I like it to be more bread than cracker style.  I prefer it to be thin and real crispy that you can pick up a slice without falling apart.  It's too bad because I was really looking forward to a good place.
