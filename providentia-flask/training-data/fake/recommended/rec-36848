Went to Balthazar this past Sunday for brunch.  Food was great, especially the pastry/bread basket.  No complaints about the food, but the service SUCKED.  My boyfriend's sister was slammed in the head by a busser's dish bin to the point of tears on her part and there was hardly an apology.   Every single member of the wait staff was slammed and definitely did not want to be there on a Sunday morning.  Dirty dishes sat on our table for way too long and our server was extremely inconvenienced by having to take our orders and respond to requests of things that we needed.  With so many great places to go in the city why would I go back? I won't.  These people need some staff meetings to learn about hospitality at the very least.
