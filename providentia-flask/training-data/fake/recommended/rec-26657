I went to Figs with 5 others for a birthday celebration. We had a reservation but were all running late and I was worried we were going to lose our table, so I was really relieved to find the owner so understanding and our table available. We ordered the smoked salmon flatbread, veggie flatbread, Figs sampler and baked Brie for our appetizers - all very good. I had the sesame salmon and it lived up to the other rave reviews; great flavor and the sides were yummy too. Thanks yelpers for the tip! You'd think we'd be full after all that but you'd be wrong because we ordered dessert as well - the double chocolate dessert (which was more like a mousse than a brownie) and the bread pudding, which was absolutely delicious. And then I went home and passed out on my couch in a very content food and red wine coma because I love BYOs. The end!
