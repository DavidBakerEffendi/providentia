The food is great all the way down to the simple chips and salsa.  The small portion is enough for two to share. The chips are lightly salted and crispy, while the salsa is very fresh and flavorful.  I also had the burrito white chorizo and no beans. Their chorizo is probably the best I can recall having ever, and I dabble in a lot of Latin fare from different cities. The prices are agreeable and maybe slightly cheap for New York City.  I'll definitely make this a stop-in whoever I'm in East Village.
