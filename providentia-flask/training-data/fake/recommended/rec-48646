I went for my birthday, and everyone enjoyed it! I have been to Los Cabolitos in South Philly, and this was my first time at Dos Segundos.  Everything went smoothly, and all 14 of us enjoyed our meals.  This place is great for groups and shareables.  I'm sure we all ate too many chips w/salsa while we waited, but it was delicious. My vegetarian/vegan friends were taken care of, and they seemed to have decent options.  I'm glad I went here for my birthday, it was a definite crowd pleaser.
