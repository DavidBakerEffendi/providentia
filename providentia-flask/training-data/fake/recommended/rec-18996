(3.5 stars) Warm, cozy spot for wine and small bites. Their happy hour (5-7pm) is fantastic. $5 prosecco and several wines by the glass on discount. The charcuterie platter is perfect for sharing. We also had the popeye quiche with spinach and cheese and the vegetable & goat cheese baguette, which both came with salad. Simple and tasty. The mac and cheese come in tiny bite size pastry cups and the mushroom risotto puffs were divine. The couches at the back are great for groups. Nice place for a laid-back, unhurried night with friends.
