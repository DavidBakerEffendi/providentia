stopped by for drinks the other night and really had never heard of the place before. surprised by a pretty solid beer and wine list and the menu looked delicious. we weren't there to eat but got the fried pickles for munching and they were tasty! the ambiance was chill, had an casual feel but not divey. my receipt had a coupon for discount on brunch but even without this perk i plan to go back.
