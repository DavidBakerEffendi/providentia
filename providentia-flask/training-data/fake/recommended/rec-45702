I love this place. Several months ago I happened to notice Nosh Borough walking home. I tried it on a whim, and I come back at least once a week. Johnny and Jin are incredibly warm, kind and welcoming, which really adds to the appeal for me. The food is delicious, the prices are fair. At this point, I've literally tried everything on the menu and yet to find anything I don't like. My favorites are; Vegetable tamales (with green sauce) Dirty Rice Chicken Wafco Corn Elotes BBQ Brisket Sandwich with fries Bahn Mi Burgers If you have been good and want to treat yourself, the beignets are amazing.
