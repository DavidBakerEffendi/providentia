I stopped by Steve's place while visiting a friend in Newington, CT as he stated it was one of his favorite places to grab a bite in the area.   All in all, the restaurant has a very nice and cozy feel to it.  It is located on one of the main streets in downtown Newington, and its outdoor seating offers a nice view of the adjoining storefronts.  The interior of the restaurant also gives off that welcoming feel with nice big booths and very friendly servers.  What is not all that welcome are the prices (as mentioned in prior reviews) as a sandwich and drink will almost certainly cost you upwards of double digits. Sadly the quality of the food does not match up to the corresponding charges, though this is not to say that the food is not good. It's just not very remarkable either.  I had an eggplant parmesean sandwich, and I'd have to say it ranked somewhere in the middle among all the eggplant parm I've consumed in my life. My compadres each got meatball parm subs, with one friend being pleased and the other being quite displeased. Bottom line is that Steve's gives off a great vibe and has decent fare, but the high prices make it difficult to justify earmarking it as your "go-to" neighborhood spot.
