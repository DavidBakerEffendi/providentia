This is the place for a BIG bowl of soup, that's about the full menu, but they do it proud.  I almost left before walking in the door but I'm glad I didn't.  It was busy, there was no place left to sit, and it looked like a locals regular lunch spot.  If it were not for reading the yelp reviews I wouldn't have decided to get it to go, and I wouldn't have noticed the couple of seats on the side of the counter, and wouldn't have found a new favorite place for lunch! Tip no need to order a drink, they provide you with a glass of water.
