Rude and lazy staff. We came fairly late in the evening but immediately felt unwelcome. I asked what was on tap and was asked "can you not read?" By a man who pointed to the menu. I had never tried a certain ale on tap and asked to try it, but was immediately shut down. Apparently he'd been working all night and could I please make my mind up so he could have a cigarette. I asked if they took card, they didn't. So afterwards, when I ordered, the man said, non ironically, "can you afford this? You didn't seem to have much cash before." Wow.
