This is a good date spot.  Very romantic Italian feel.   You'll be surprised by how far back the restaurant goes.  There's more seating than I thought!  I had the pasta special that people are mentioning in their reviews.  It was all-you-can-eat of three different pasta dishes for about $22.  The three when I went were: penne a la vodka, mushroom ravioli, and a pesto dish.  Everything at Becco is super rich.  The deserts I tried were fantastic.  Particularly the chocolatey ones.  This place isn't far from Times Square, but it feels like a nice little get away.
