Definitely the nicest ramen place ever i've been to--and that's about it. It did irked me that the hostess wouldn't sit 3 of us first til our 4th friend arrived from work; then again, it's a business so I can see them trying to squeeze sales from every available seat. Nice decors no question, like a drinking lounge.  In fact, their waiting area bar is to be commended, stylish. on to the ramen, Vancouverites know we have great ramen with all the paid extras i.e. seaweed, bamboo shoots, and still wouldn't touch $15 lol. mine was the Modern plus $4 bamboo, tasted good.  But seriously, it's the texture of the noodles that dropped the grade for me; just thin, no texture noodles. Another important element is the broth; yes, it's tasty but would i wait for 30-45min. like the hordes of ppl when we left to catch our Jersey Boys show? No way. Eye candy galore though ;)
