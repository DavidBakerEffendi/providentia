Will now be one of my go-to restaurants in the city! Been here a couple times, once for brunch and another time for dinner. Brunch was delicious...I had the burrito with a side of brussel sprouts. The breakfast burrito was so fresh and incredible tasting, almost had me convinced that I was eating something nice and light and healthy. Â (Let's be honest, at the end of the day I'm still eating a burrito.) When I went for dinner, I got the 4 market sides, trying to be healthy and all. Got the brussel sprouts (I love how the cook them in the dijon!), asparagus+parmesean, quinoa summer salad (fresh and sweet!), and sauteed kale. All fantastic. The burgers looked great too, so will have to try them next time. We ended our dinner with the pecan pie a la mode. How do I even explain how delicious it was? Perfect sweetness, didn't get stuck in my teeth, and warm too! Really cute place that I think would make a casual date spot. 2 thumbs up for great staff!
