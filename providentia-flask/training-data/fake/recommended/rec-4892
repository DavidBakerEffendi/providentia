Pleasantly surprised. I like. Bar was pretty empty on a Saturday night around 8pm. Wait staff was friendly. Beer selection was good. 14 or so on tap, another 30 or so in the fridge. $2 Kensingers while Phils games are on. Excellent. Food was on the limited side, but they offered enough delectable treats to make decisions easy. My wife got the cheese burger, I got the vegetable gnocchi. Mine was good. Plenty of mushrooms. My wife had an issue with her burger. She ordered medium well, and it came out medium rare. The bar tender and the server apologized for the error and the burger was promptly replaced. Â  Pricing was decent. And it definitely had an atmosphere that I could definitely get into. I will be there, again and again.
