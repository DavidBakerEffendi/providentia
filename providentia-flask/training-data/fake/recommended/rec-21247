Hands down, my favorite restaurant I have been to in any city I have traversed to (ie: New York, San Francisco). From the first time I tried it, I was hooked and became a "regular" there (sometimes going twice in one week). The beauty of this restaurant is not only the amazing food (you can't go wrong with any item but my personal favorites are the Greek Salad and Quail) but the hospitality from not only the Head Chef/Owner (who's there and greets every single table), but the whole waiting staff as well. Every single time I go, I always feel at home. I love this place and will always be the first place I go to when visiting Philadelphia. If you're here for a short time, let this be the first thing on your itinerary. Thank you for all the memories! You guys have done a magnificent job :)
