Tried it again for lunch.  Place still needs a remodel and better staff. The food was good but everything else sucks. Prices are high and we had to chase down the waitress every time for anything.  If they would clean it up and get a better staff the cook would shine.  I would takeout but prices are silly for what you get.  This is not downtown new haven.
