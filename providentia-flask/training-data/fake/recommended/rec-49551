Beyond Sushi is my favorite restaurant in NY. The servers are SO friendly, as is the owner, Chef Guy. I've never had anything I didn't like there. I went there at least 6 times a week this past semester, and now that I'm studying abroad, it's the main thing I miss!!! Too bad Beyond Sushi doesn't cater to Italy :( I'm taking a taxi right there from JFK in June! Thanks Beyond Sushi for the best vegan food ever and amazing memories! Also, if you have the chance to take Chef Guy's sushi making class. DO IT!!! So much fun.
