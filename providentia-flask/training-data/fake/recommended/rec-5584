Tapas in America. Table was a little small. Ordered chicken lettuce wraps, lobster mashed, buffalo soft shelled crab, edemome. Plenty of food.Service was good. Atmosphere was loud but trendy. Crab was deep fried and a little overcooked. 3 people with drinks and desserts for $83. That was a nice surprise.
