If you want authentic noodle soup this is the place to go. Its a small gritty place (I think they're remodeling their original store though so eventually they might move again) but it's the BEST. Try a few things off their menu, the Cha Sui Bao was amazing (that's bbq pork buns for the white people like me) and the noodle soup is so good its making me hungry just writing about it.
