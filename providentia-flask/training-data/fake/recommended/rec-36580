Balthazar....a great dining pleasure....I've been here a couple times.   I did, however, have the house Merlot which was HORRIBE (very bitter). I've had inexpensive wines which were really great in the past, but this was really bad...had to send it back and this time choose a Cabernet Sauvignon which was mediocre at best...... :( I gather unless you're a wine  Connoisseur you'll have better luck then I......next time I'll ask either the waiter/waitress or bar tender for suggestions.
