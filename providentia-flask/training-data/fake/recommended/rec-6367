Perfect tapas spot, really. Would go to Tia Pol again in a heartbeat and would recommend it to anyone. First of all, it's so rare to find a Spanish tapas restaurant with so many vegetarian options. The three vegetarians in our party were very happy and especially liked the Patatas Bravas and Tortilla Espa√±ola. I could not get enough of the special on Saturday night-a pasta dish baked in saffron served with cuttlefish. Absolutely delicious and surprisingly filling. The only area for improvement I can think of is in terms of the bread that they serve with many dishes. The bread wasn't particularly soft or easy to eat. Other important details: takes reservations, very reasonably priced, extremely fast service, and an attractive, helpful wait staff.
