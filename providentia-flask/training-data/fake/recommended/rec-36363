"Prosecco! I love Prosecco!", exclaimed Jasmine. Which she shortly followed with, "What's prosecco?" Those Australians, they are so cute. She might not have known what we were drinking but she certainly knew what crepes were. I ordered the mussels in cream sauce and the waitress came back to inform me that they were out of mussels and that they will be substituting scallops instead. I nearly died and went to heaven. When my crepe actually arrived and I took my first bite, followed by a sip of prosecco, I had a food orgasm. Four girls, three crepes, two bottles, one croque monsieur. Nothing left but empty plates and glasses when we were done.
