SO GOOD. Came here last winter (and it only took me, oh, seven months to post this review). The (somewhat) bad? Long wait. A little louder than deafening. And the space is pretty tight. But, you forget about that once you did into the first bite of macaroni or swill back a local beer. I've never felt completely and utterly full after leaving a restaurant until I came to this place. Will definitely come back.
