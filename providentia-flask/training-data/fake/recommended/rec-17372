Last time we were here for dinner it was prior to a concert. We were expecting a leisurely dinner with time left over for a drink before. What we got was some seriously aggressive wait staff. I lived in Miami for 5 years and while I can't speak a lot of Spanish I know what food I like and how to order it without sounding like a stupid American. So when I ordered our apps, the server repeated everything back to us in perfect Spanish. Our apps came out fast. Then almost immediately followed by our dinners. Our server came by and offered to put our dinners back in the kitchen so we could enjoy our apps. Under the heat lamp for 20 minutes- no thanks. We kept our app plates and our dinners. His parting comment "everything looks amazing and delicious enjoy" While we ate our dinner and apps a bus person came over at least 5 times to clear our plates. To which we asked "please leave the plate." Then our server came over, asked how amazing our food was and attempted to take our plates away, again. At one point a bus person came over and took our plates and we just gave up and let them go. This was all in a span of 15 minutes mind you. Ordered coffee after dinner, again had our pronunciation corrected and offered delicious pastries and desserts. I've worked in the restaurant industry. As a server I made suggestions too, but not nearly as aggressively as this server. Not everything is delicious and amazing and wonderful, let me decide. They are a busy restaurant and need to turn tables, I get that. But don't have apps an dinner out within 2 minutes of each other. Don't have such aggressive wait staff and bus staff that the customers are bothered 5 times in 15 minutes to clear a plate that's being used. The food is pretty good. Some of it can be greasy. Goes with the territory of fried food. It's bring your own but the sangria mixer they sell seems to be a bit over priced.
