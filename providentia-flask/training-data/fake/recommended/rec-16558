Wayyyy too overrated. Had just the burger with fries - the meat was fine, the bun was really tasty, but overall nothing special and pretty plain - no tomato, lettuce, anything... I personally did not like the fries att all. They are too thin and with no real french fries taste. It is supposedly their "thing". Not sure why. One more thing was the service - the host lady was really obnoxious, and felt like she did not want us to sit. The waiters had this attitude as if doing you a favor. Maybe cause it was just a busy lunch time... After all the stories (maybe because of them) I expected much more. I would honestly choose five napkins (3 stars) or shake shack (~4 stars) over this place. Doesnt worth coming back for sure.
