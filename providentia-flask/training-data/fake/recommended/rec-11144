I have ventured into Johnny Brenda's on many different occasions and I really like this place.  The vibe is nifty and the beer is great.  I will break down my feelings on JB's with a list of some positives and negatives.  (Negatives will come first to get them out of the way.  The positives outnumber them anyway.)   Negatives: 1. Service in the dining area has not been great.  I don't really care to eat here for that reason.  They do not seem well equipped to handle crowds.  One time I waited 20 minutes before I could even get someone's attention to put my name in for a table. 2. I was not thrilled with their handling of beer week.  They had too many firkins and by the time I got there, the beers were warm and under-carbonated.  I did not realize how long they had been out or I would have stayed away from them.  I guess for $3 I should not complain too much, but it was disappointing nonetheless. That's it for negative. Positives: 1.  This is a really cool music venue where they are always bringing in new and talented groups.  If I am in the mood for live music, I will always trust JB's to deliver a quality performance. 2. They get major kudos for their selection of locally brewed beers and not pandering to mass-produced drinking folk.  You cannot get miller lite here.  But you can always find the best of sly fox, dogfishhead, lancaster, troegs, and so forth.   3. The bartenders are very friendly and beer knowledgeable.  I particularly like going here when it is not crowded because I enjoy being able to chat about the beer and really make an informed decision.  JBs is enjoyable when it is crowded as well because it attracts a friendly, down-to-earth group of people.  (who like beer) 4. The pita and hummus is delicious. 5. The bar area has a local, everybody knows your name, relax and stay awhile feel to it.  I frequently run into people I know here.  For what every reason, it is just a "feel good" bar.
