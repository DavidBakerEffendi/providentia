Mostly giving this a 2 because I don't understand how it got such great reviews. I have no problem paying for a good meal, but this was VERY pricey and just ok -- both my friend and I agreed. We ordered the Orchette with Duck Confit and Scallops and Pork Belly -- they both tasted EXACTLY the same. When the duck came, we thought they brought the wrong order, we didn't say anything, then realized what it was when we saw it on the check. Usually if I'm going to a pricey restaurant, it better be exceptional, how did we order two drastically different plates and they tasted the same?? Unimpressed. Won't be back.
