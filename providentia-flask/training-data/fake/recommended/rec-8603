The food was great and is deserving of a 5 star rating, however the waiters were rude and stuck up. We made reservations and I dropped my girlfriend off to check in while I found parking. When I walked in the waiter looked me up and down and with the most stuck up tone of voice and a somewhat disgusted look said,"yes?". No "can I help you?" No "hello". Very unwelcoming. My girlfriend said she received the same type of treatment when she checked in. The waiter/host seemed surprised that she even had a reservation. The waiters seemed annoyed when we asked them about menu items and pretty much ignored us once the food was brought out. I ordered a soda to drink and once I finished it no one came by to ask if I'd like another or anything like that. I watched them go to other tables while completely ignoring us. The only person who paid us any mind was the girl who kept refilling water. She was nice. The food however was excellent and I would go back solely based on that. Wait staff needs to be schooled in how to treat your customers, especially if you're looking for a decent tip.
