Went to Mickey's for the first time for drinks and apps with some girlfriends.  Seated right away and the waitress was attentive to start.  She listed the specials mostly from memory and was very friendly.  But she disappeared for long stretches of time.  I think a half hour passed before we even ordered.  I had a white wine sangria that was just ok.  But the food (calamari and an antipasto platter) was very good.  The fresh bread and olive oil provided were also tasty and we asked for more which was brought no problem.  Again though, waitress disappeared for what I swear was an hour before we managed to get our bill.  Altogether we were there over 2 and a half hours just for two rounds of drinks and the apps.  I'm not saying I want to be rushed out but at least check in with us occasionally, dont assume we want to stay forever.  Since the food was very good though I would probably go back and give it another try - perhaps it was an off night on the service.
