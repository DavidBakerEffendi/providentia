I was searching for good Neapolitan pizza on YELP for my NY weekend trip and came across this place.  It got really high reviews and i was really excited to try it out. It's very unassuming from the street and I almost passed it when looking for it.  The hostess was dressed in some sort of pirate lady top (or maybe it's a traditional Italian thing...seemed more German?) which was funny.  We were sat in the back, near the coal ovens and it was very hot in there!  The chairs were really uncomfortable, too.  Over all I'd say the atmosphere was just OK. The pizza came out very fast.  The crust was really really good!  5 starts for the crust!  The pizza sauce was pretty good, not amazing, but good.  We got the spicy salami.  I probably should have gotten the prosciutto as I usually do when I get authentic Neapolitan pizza (otherwise I get peperoni).  The salami gave the pizza the strange taste of Cheetos.  CHEETOS!  Yuck, I don't want my pizza to taste like that. The pizza crust is so good here I would be willing to check it out again, but order a different kind of pizza.  Just steer clear of the spicy salami.
