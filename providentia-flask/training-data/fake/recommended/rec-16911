We will never return to this place. Horrible service and our food took 45 minutes!!! We saw three other parties get seated, treated 100 times better than us, get their food and eat and pay and leave all before we even got our food! We ordered an app and two entrees. The dumplings appetizer was gamey and the dumpling wrap was chewy (gross)! When our food finally came the dishes were overly salty and my husband's rice dish he ordered extra hot was so plain on heat our 5 year old could have eaten it. All the tap water came to the table without ice, the waitress said they didn't have any limes when my husband asked for limes to go with his Pellegrino. My iced green tea was bland and I had to ask twice for a refill. Service sucked, food sucked, atmosphere sucked! We will never ever go back!
