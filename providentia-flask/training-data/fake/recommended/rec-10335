Big Bear has only grown to expand what they offer, and none of it will disappoint! Soups, salads, and sandwiches now make this a local lunch time hotspot! I can only really blame myself - after all, my co-workers started inquiring about the avocado dream wraps I kept bringing back to enjoy, and now they are always asking me what my new favorite nom from Big Bear is. Most recently, they added baked goods - muffins and cookies boasting all organic ingredients they are a must-try! Surprisingly, the pumpkin cacao muffin really filled me up despite it's small size! They still have a counter of fresh produce, and a wall of refrigerated goods so you can get a cold drink (I highly recommend the KeVita Mojito - it tastes like an alcohol-free mojito, but is full of probiotics and fizzy to boot!) to wash your favorite fresh veggie-filled lunch down! Absolutely my favorite lunch spot - and they reward frequent buyers with a discount, so you can't go wrong!
