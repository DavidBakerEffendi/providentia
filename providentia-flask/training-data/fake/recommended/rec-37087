Been here a couple times because there arepas are really good! I was never a fan of arepas till I came here. I have tried La Surena and De Pabellon arepa both so good. The meat is juicy and tender and it's just a balance of amazing flavors. For appetizers I have tried the yo-yos and tostones mochimeros. Wasn't crazy about the yo-yos the plantain wasn't ripe enough. The tostones were delicious. Not crazy about the drinks at this place.
