This review is for the crazy absurd brunch enjoyed at Jacob's Pickles. First off: please, please, please do yourself a favor and order the Bloody BLT during brunch. Made with spicy vodka and garnished with a pickled egg and a crispy slice of bacon, you will have the worst drink envy if you don't order this. We ordered a quattro of pickled items: tomatoes, beets, spicy pickles, and dilly green beans. The green beans were my favorite, with a nice kick, and the beets were my least favorite, because they seemed slightly perfumey. I ordered the ham egg & cheese biscuit, and this breakfast sammy was a thing of beauty: it was so large it was acceptable to cut the breakfast sandwich into manageable portions to cram it into your mouth. The biscuits were perfection: buttery and a tiny bit crispy on the top and fluffy and carbalicious throughout. This meal was followed perfectly by a 3 hour nap in Sheep's Meadow.
