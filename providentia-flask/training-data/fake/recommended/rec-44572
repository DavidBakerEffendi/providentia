i've been here a handful of times and the food is pretty good.  the service is slightly mediocre to OK (i've never had fantastic service).  when i was there recently, the waitress asked me 4 times if i wanted something from the bar and i kept saying no.  she really wanted me to buy a drink??  anyway, my favorite is the chicken souvlaki because it comes with a salad on the plate, and i love their salad~!  i only wish more of their entrees came with the salad. to get an entree and buy a salad for an appetizer gets a little pricey for me (unless you're lucky enough to make it there before 6pm to get their prix fix).
