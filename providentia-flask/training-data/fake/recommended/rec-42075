Everything was simply amazing. The food is of high quality, but still very affordable. The service is very friendly and welcoming. Our waitress knew all about their dishes, the way it is made and the way it should be eaten. The berry sangria was very delicious and the tres leches cake was awesome. All in all it was a perfect dinner and we'll definitely come back!
