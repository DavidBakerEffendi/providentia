We (6 of us) went tonight to celebrate Mother's Day (we never go out on Mother's Day because usually the service or food or both are terrible).  We got there at 5:15 for a 5:30 Saturday night reservation. When we got there they did not have our reservation and the manager looked bothered. We were seated (the tables are very close together) and we ordered appetizers and drinks.   Everything was delicious and came out in a timely manner.  After we finished our appetizers, we ordered our dinners because the waiter told us "there's no rush".  My mother ordered the salmon and after a few minutes the waiter came out to tell us they were out of salmon.  How is a restaurant out of salmon 3 hours after they open for the day?  She changed her order and we waited, and we waited. When we got there, 4 tables were full, when our dinner came out half the place was full.   Two dinners came out and then 10 MINUTES later the other 3 came out and then 5 MINUTES later my mother's dinner came out.  That is just not acceptable. I understand a minute or two but not 10.  We complained to the waiter and he said it wasn't his fault, the kitchen was backed up. The food was very good, we did enjoy it.   Then we ordered coffee and dessert.  We got our coffee right away and then waited 20 MINUTES for dessert.  Most people like to drink their coffee WITH their dessert.  Completely unacceptable. The table next to us came in after us and they were finished with their desserts before ours even come out.  When I complained to the manager he acted again like it was such a bother and he couldn't wait to get away from our table. Not a good way to run a restaurant.  Good Luck tomorrow if you're going to Celebrate Mother's Day. Not sure if we will go back. There are so many restaurants near us, why go and be aggravated.
