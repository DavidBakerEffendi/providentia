The best Halal place in New York. Â under 10 dollars for an entire plate. When u get there, the first reaction is freaking awesome. More than 100 people are waiting on line for experiencing their foods. No Joke. I am very serious. What you need to do (if you visit New York for the first time in your life), you must go Halal Guys. Then we will tell you. Welcome to New York. Hell Ya!
