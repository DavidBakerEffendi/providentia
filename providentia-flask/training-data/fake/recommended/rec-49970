I have been wanting to try this place for the longest time and finally after 3 years the wait is over.... Great late night meal.  Tried the chicken rice for the first time and it was more than i expected!  The chicken was perfectly seasoned and not too dry and the rice was also cooked just the way it should be.  You must add the white sauce!!!   But beware the hot sauce will light you up and sober u up quicker than having your mom slap you in the face.  Don't say I didn't warn you.
