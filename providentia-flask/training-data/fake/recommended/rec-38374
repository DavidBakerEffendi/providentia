I like that lots of places in Burlington serve sweet potato fries - as if it's a normal thing that you should have available everywhere! I agree. They were great, by the way, especially with the mustard sauce. Service is also very good, and the whole place seemed very happenin'. Try the Magic Hat #9 beer, and the cheese tortellini with the inventive toppings of mushrooms, dried cranberries, and pinenuts. Made my belly oh so happy!
