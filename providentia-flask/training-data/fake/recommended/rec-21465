Good food, good beer and a good music venue. There's isn't much I can say about Johnny Brenda's that hasn't already been said.  It's unpretentious and cool place to hang out.  The downstairs looks like your average bar/restaurant scene.  The upstairs is a unique space to hang out, go dancing or see a show.  Unlike the nearby establishments like The M Room or The Barbary, the women's bathrooms are actually relatively clean with multiple stalls. The dinner experience is kinda like Standard Tap but with better food and less attitude.
