First, I'll start by saying that I've never actually eaten at Rex 1516. This review is about the two times we tried to eat here for brunch. The first time: we arrived around noon and were told that it would be a 20 minute wait because we didn't have a reservation, which was weird because only a couple of tables were actually occupied. We were told we could sit at the bar, but we looked down at the bar and saw a bartender and a waitress who both looked miserable. "No thanks," we said. The next time: this time we actually made a reservation and were seated promptly, although no one asked for our reservation, despite the fact that there were twice as many occupied tables. Then we waited literally twenty minutes before someone came around to ask if we wanted anything to drink. Mind you, there were only 4 other tables occupied, so it's not like they were slammed. When I asked for coffee, I was told they didn't have coffee that day. "What kind of brunch place doesn't have coffee," I thought to myself. We'd heard bad things about the extremely long wait time for food here, and we looked around and saw that none of the other 4 tables had been served yet. "I'm not going to wait an hour for my food," I thought, "if I can't even drink a cup of coffee while I wait," so we politely bolted.
