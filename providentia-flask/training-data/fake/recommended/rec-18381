I've eaten at bareburger before in NYC and I like them a lot. The food was as good as usual but we had subpar service at the Philadelphia location. It wasn't crowded but it took them a long time to get to us even though there were a lot of employees passing us and we put our menus aside. One guy also tried to clear our fries when we still had half of them left and were actively eating them.
