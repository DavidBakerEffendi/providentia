I was wandering around Spring Street trying to waste some time and stumbled across Ba'al. I'm not the biggest fan of Mediterranean food, namely because cheese isn't a big part of their cuisine and I'm really into cheese, but I was being a typical born-and-bread American and was craving one of the most generic Mediterranean foods: hummus. I waltzed into Ba'al and was greeted with a smile. Two women were waiting while I perused the menu signs above the counter (small place). For me, when people are in a food place, that's a good sign. I ordered falafel, couscous and hummus, a "combo of three" option, only $7.75. Add a water bottle to that for a grand total of $9.30 for a good portion of fresh food. The couscous was super. Amazing flavor. I couldn't tell you what's in it because I'm not well-versed in the vernacular of Mediterranean cuisine but there was some sort of seed (didn't eat), I think dried cranberries and other seasonings (that I don't know the names of). It was very good. The falafel (six included) was very good and super fresh. The outside was crispy and the inside had a little bit of a zing. I used the hummus like ketchup (probably not normal but what is normal anyway) and dipped the falafel in it. Very yummy combo! The hummus was SUPER smooth and creamy and tasted great with the olive oil and seasoned warm pita bread included in the combo platter. I had an overall great experience at Ba'al! Many people came in during my time sitting there; it's clearly a popular place. I sat by the window and people walked by would stop in their tracks to walk in. It's almost as if Ba'al has a supersonic radar that changes the signals of the brain to make you turn into the store. Regardless, it was a good eat.
