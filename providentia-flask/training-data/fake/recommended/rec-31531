NOTHING BETTER IN THIS WORLD!!  There is the best in the city...then there is the best in the country....then the best in the universe...Pat's is better than that.  It is the greatest place in the world, and should be visited  by every person who sets foot in Philly. I miss one thing about Philly...Pat's...not my family, not the Flyers, not South Street...but Pat's! Pat's rules!  Geno's is awful! LONG LIVE PAT'S STEAKS!
