I'm not sure if I can write an honest review of Sunny and Annie's because I've never been here when I wasn't completely hammered - but I'm going to try anyway... The pho #1 is the sandwich to get. I'm sure the others are good too, but none are this unique. It tastes just like a bowl of ph! OK, maybe not exactly, but it's damn close. It comes with a healthy amount of sriracha so if you're sensitive to heat make sure to ask them to take it easy with it. I love my spicy food and the standard amount is enough to melt my lips off, which I rather enjoy, but you might not.
