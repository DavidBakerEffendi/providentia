One of the island's best restaurants, hands down!  The food is spectacular and fingerlicking good!  The staff are always so friendly and keep you feeling attended to without breathing down your back. I have been here dozens of times and I am never let down.  The drinks, the food, the ambiance, it's all worth every last cent you spend here.  Definitely get the seafood jambalaya, delicious!  If you are there for a prix-fixe dinner, it's SO worth it!  Their red beans and rice is superb, the fried ice cream is like no other that I have ever had.   Go, you must go!  Go to Staten Island and check it out!  So worth the ferry ride and/or toll!  Do it!!
