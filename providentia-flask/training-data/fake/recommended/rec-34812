It was 4th of July and instead of lining up on a roof top we decided to go here.  All four of us anti social folks were in the mood to let someone else do the cooking after roasting in our apts all weekend.   This place was recommended by a friend and boy are we lucky we are her friend.  I can't wait to go back b/c there were 3 other options I was deciding on for my entree.  My dinner companions also had the same issue so we were all in agreement that Kefi is one of those neighborhood staples that you can take anyone.
