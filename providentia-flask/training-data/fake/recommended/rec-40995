I very rarely review on here, tending to use Yelp as a one-way tool, directly from my cell phone to my stomach. However, Silver Rice has inspired me. I went with my girlfriend tonight and we had the rice bowls. Holy cow. Friggin' delicious. Fresh fish, fresh rice, spicy, portable, and cheap. $6 for a filling portion. I will be back. Soon. And often.
