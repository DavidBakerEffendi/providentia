Little late in writing this review as I dined here in April. Wow! this place is every bit as good as I hoped it would be. Its a mark of a good meal when you are still speaking of it a couple of months after the fact. Service was very good- attentive with out being overbearing. Nice atmosphere. Got the crostini- standout was the smoked trout. The special that evening was the spring risotto- this may have been the best risotto I have every had- with asparagus and fava beans ( BF had the rabbit ravioli. My complaint with ravioli is it can be mushy or heavy . This was perfectly done. All in all worth a trip to lower Manhattan next time I am in town
