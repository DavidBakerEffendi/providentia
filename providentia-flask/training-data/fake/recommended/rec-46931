Came here for the first time for a romantic date night and was disappointed after such high expectations. Tried a few "so-so" cocktails & the "reserve" chef tasting for 2.   All items we sampled were from the "standard" tasting  even though the "reserve" tasting is presented as being standard menu items as well as "original off-menu interpretations crafted by the chef". We also were served only one type of dessert which was the "berry panna cotta". When we asked if this was the only dessert, we were given an odd look & told "um yeah"  as the person bringing the food walked away. We expected 2 types of dessert since we did order the tasting menu. I'm a huge dessert fan & always make sure I save room, so this was very disappointing. All items were too salty and for the expensive price we paid I felt cheated. I honestly did not sample one item that was satisfying & I did not find anything that would warrant a return visit. I did however enjoy the olive oil & balsamic sampling bar.. Even though a few I looked forward to trying were empty. Our waitress was pleasant as well.
