I love this place! Wonderful food, with an amazing selection of options. So much to choose from and I have never had a bad dish there. Yum! Yes, it gets crowded, but what do you expect? I love their system for seating people (at least during peak times) in which they have a "host" hold tables for custmers in line. Takes the stress out of searching for a table after you have ordered. Also allows for ample time to review their extensive menu. Other reviewers have commented on the noise level, but it seems fine to me, or at least similar to that of other small cafes. And the staff are wonderful. Very friendly and upbeat. This place is great and I wish they'd come to Brooklyn!
