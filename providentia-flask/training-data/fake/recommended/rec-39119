It was my partner's choice to celebrate "Our Valentine's Day" at Odeon. One of my partner's favorite restaurants. The host and the staffs were very polite, friendly, well spoken, and nice. I felt we were treated with a great service. I had a spicy chicken dumplings as my starter. Those were good. Good presentation. I had a roast chicken as my entree that I actually did not care too much for. The breast was a bit dry actually, but overall was ok. On the other hand, my partner had a goat cheese salad and Duck fillet for starter and entree. I had a taste of the duck, and it was delicious. Oh, I liked the their homemade breads. It was just the way I like it.
