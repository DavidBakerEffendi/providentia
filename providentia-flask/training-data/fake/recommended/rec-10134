I'd never had octopus balls before, and they were amazing (although a little bit burning your mouth hot when they initially came out). In addition, this was the best tonkatsu I've had outside of Japan. I wouldn't really recommend the wagyu beef; it was good, but given how much more expensive it is than the other dishes, I'd stick with the cheaper options that are still delicious. BYOB, so we brought a few bottles of sake and wine, which made for an amazingly affordable meal given the quality. The ambience leaves a little to be desired...particularly the floor, but the staff was all extremely friendly. This was Friday night, and it was almost completely empty while we were there, so hopefully this changes, because it's great food for reasonable prices.
