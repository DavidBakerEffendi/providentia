I was staying in the city for the weekend and arrived before my friends did, so I was looking for a place to have dinner alone.  Jadis was a perfect fit.   The food options were small but hearty; I had the ham, Tomme and caramelized onions sandwich (which wasn't the French-style panini that I had been hoping for, but was still delicious and heavy on the ham).  I also had a glass of wine, which was a heavy pour, from their list that includes wines by the glass, carafe (at least 3 hearty glasses and bottle).   I was disappointed to have missed out on $4 glasses of wine for happy hour (5-7 most days) but thoroughly enjoyed the contemporary French music being played.  It worked for my needs, but would have been even better on a romantic date...
