Returned after a year and that's too long of a wait. I went for my anniversary with my girlfriend. A note from chef Marc and free glasses of champagne to start - never hurt anyone with free champagne....Started with the Kampachi. This is my favorite dish - perfection. Next we had a meatball tortellini special. Very good. Can't leave without having the chicken - best chicken ever!! Ended with the milk and cookies. Can't wait to go back and try more.
