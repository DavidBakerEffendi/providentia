So I will open by saying I'd love to give Olea 4 1/2 stars, but I'm fine with 5 to balance the low ratings yelp reviewers are prone to in my opinion.  Olea is now my favorite spot in Brooklyn.  I have lived on Smith Street for over 7 years, but this place rates for consistency.  We waited about 20 minutes on a Friday evening around 9pm.  The french songs sung on Spanish night were terrific!!  Seriously, the music was perfect, the ambiance was perfect, but the place is a little tight.  As it gets more crowded, I imagine it can get quite uncomfortable.  Especially in winter when you'd have to wait outside! I have been here twice now, and everything I've eaten is at worst good, but mostly just wonderful!  The cheese croquets were delicious, the fried garbanzos fun, patatas bravas crisp but not oily, and the lentil salad was so fresh and reFRESHing.  The only exception was the chicken empanadillas (sp) which had a very strong chicken flavor if that makes sense.  I think they were a day away from turning.  :(  Fortunately they had been my second choice, so I still look forward to enjoying the lamb keftedes.  I will be going back for sure, and maybe I'll even try an entree!
