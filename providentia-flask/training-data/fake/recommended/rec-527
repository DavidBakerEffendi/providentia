Super cute, delicious, and a nice price.  Got here right at 11 for brunch and glad that we did.  By 12, every table was filled and people were braving the cold outside and waiting.  Savory crepes are definitely the way to go! We got a dessert one that didn't have much filling so it seemed kind of blah.  The space is a hodgepodge of pictures and trinkets. All of the seating is unique and cozy. Good coffee,  nice staff, yum food, and $20/person. I will not only be back, but I will also suggest it.
