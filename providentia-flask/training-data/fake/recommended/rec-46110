Tried this place out last week. Yelp led me here while I was looking for lunch in the Newington area.  I def was not disappointed. I ordered the Gold Burger with fries...start off with something as basic as a cheeseburger. I really enjoyed it because of how fresh and tasty it was. It comes down to the basics, fresh ingredient, and this place has it. I will certainly come back again and maybe try something else.  From the looks of a lot of the other reviews.  There are some good options to try.
