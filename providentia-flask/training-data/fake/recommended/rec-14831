I'm not into craft beer but they had a pretty monster selection.. That could be the reason why this place is so popular. Atmosphere wasn't bad. Lots of laid back heavyset dudes with beards sipping on dark-colored beers. Our server was fine, but there seemed to be problems in the back of the house.  Two of our four orders came out wrong and they took forever to correct... One of our corrected orders came out 45 minutes after everyone was done eating, causing us to stay there much longer than we had wanted to.  We didn't complain, but the server seemed sincerely apologetic and tried to remedy the situation by knocking a few dollars off our next round of drinks. I got to try a bit of everyone's food - The boudin balls and biscuit & gravy were mediocre (the "homemade pork fat" gravy, which probably wasn't meant to go on a biscuit, tasted like brown Heinz gravy from a jar), the tofu scramble was bad, and the crawfish etoufee was one of the worst seafood meals I'd ever tasted in my life. This has nothing to do with the 2-star rating and was totally my fault, the beer i (somewhat randomly) chose to drink tasted like a mixture of day-old coffee and dimetapp If you're not into craft beer, you should probably pass on the Khyber Pass
