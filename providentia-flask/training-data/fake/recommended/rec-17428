I've been coming here for the past 3 weeks at least twice a week ad I must say its definitely a hidden gem. As a Vietnamese chef I love to cook and eat Vietnamese food (that's what I grew up on). This place is your typical Vietnamese restaurant. They have pho, they have rice dishes, they have exotic shakes. But their menu is a little more extensive than your typical viet place. Whole fried fish, viet subs, and their desserts definitely surpass that of a typical viet menu. The food is consistent and good. It's a little different as far as flavor but still good nonetheless.
