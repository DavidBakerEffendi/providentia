I've sworn to myself for months now that I would start checking out Brooklyn and I can finally say I dedicated a full weekend to it!  First stop was Brooklyn Star for some DELICIOUS southern food.  We started it off with fried pig tails (yup just what you thought I said) which really looked and tasted like porky buffalo wings.  I was glad I tried them although not good enough for me to order again.  A little too tough. Next up was the Fried Green Tomatoes with Duck Confit, Frisee, Radish, Pickled Mustard Seeds and Smoked Molasses Vinaigrette which was the best dish of the meal.  God it was good. It was crunchy and meaty and tomato-y and oh yeah, good. We finished it off with the Molasses Brined Pork Chop with Braised Collards and Smoked Onion Rings.  It was super soft and not chewy at all due to being brined and the onion rings were crunchy yet sweet. Also as the resident NYC biscuit snob I must say I have found a tie with Zoe's biscuits.  These were DAMN good.  The cornbread in a skillet was also melty and incredible although we got it with bacon and jalapenos added which I didn't like as much.  I think I'd prefer plain. Overall this place was delicious and had the best sides of any restaurant I've been too so far.  It kind of reminded me of a Brooklyn version of the Redhead.  The service was impeccable as were the spicy margaritas.  It's fairly large and wasn't a long wait even at primetime on a Saturday so it could make a good date spot or large birthday party.
