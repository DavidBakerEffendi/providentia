Very cool "speakeasy" kinds of cocktails and drinks with authentic ingredients.   The roasted carrots were awesome; the tagliatelle was insanely delicious, the beets were terrific, and we shared so many other dishes (party of 6) and were happy with ALL of them.  It was crowded, as many of the reviews say, so if I could change anything it would be to give them more space.  When we arrived (the night of the big snow storm a few weeks ago), someone mentioned while leaving that it was an hour and 1/2 wait -- luckily, they do take reservations for parties of 6+.  Otherwise, you might end up waiting for a while.  Luckily, though, the bar will make it worth that while.
