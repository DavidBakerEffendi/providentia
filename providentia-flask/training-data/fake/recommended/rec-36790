I've been to Dos Toros twice. The first time I went was right when they opened and I was so completely underwhelmed. Really? A slice of cheese pressed onto the tortilla? Guac from a squeeze tube? For the same price as Chipotle, I was not impressed. But everyone ranted and raved about how good it was and I thought, maybe they just didn't get all the kinks worked out. So I stood on the line, out the door, and gave the basic burrito another shot. This time I was way impressed! Maybe not the best burrito I've ever had, but definitely tasty. I also very much appreciate their attempts at being earth-friendly - compostable utensils and greenware cups (I think that's what they are called)! But then today I read a terrible article - the rice is actually made with chicken stock! It's a vegetarian faux pas! And in the article, the owner is quoted as saying, "at least we tell people, some people don't" - but the menu (I double checked on their website) specifically says "no meat" next to the basic rice and beans option. So Dos Toros - you could have had the chance to become one of my favorite spots, but now I literally can't come back. Le sigh.
