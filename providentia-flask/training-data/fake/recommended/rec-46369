Visited last night for a meal, and man oh man will I be back! The service was impeccable -- our server, Brad, was very attentive and made excellent wine pairing recommendations. We started with the octopus and tuna; both were amazing but the preparation of the octopus was STELLAR. My party ordered the hangar steak, char, and halibut as entrees. All were fabulous, but the halibut really stole the show. It's been a while since I've visited a restaurant and loved everything we ordered. Five stars, hands down.
