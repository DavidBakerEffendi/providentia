We keep coming back to Fish for the Red, White and Blue deal: 6 oysters or 6 clams with house wine or a PBR for $8. You can't beat it. Sometimes we also order other menu items.. The New Orleans gumbo is good, as are the mussels. Â The fries are also delicious! We've had mixed experiences with the service, but it doesn't really matter. We'll definitely be back for Red, White and Blue again soon.
