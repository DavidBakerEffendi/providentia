Philadel-pho-licious. If you're looking for a super-clean, high-end, chic-decor haute cuisine restaurant, this ain't it. If, however, you are looking to escape some of the Rittenhouse snootery and get some damn good pho without crossing Broad street, this is the place. Walking in feels more like a visit to a family restaurant somewhere in Asia than South Philly. Service was fast, the bowl of Pho was big, steaming hot, with lots of noodles and a heaping side plate of prouts, lime and cilantro.  Sriracha's on the table, along with other various spicy-smelling concoctions that I was unfamiliar with.  Self-serve spoons and chopsticks on the table might weird some people out, but as I said, it ain't fancy. Good, fast, cheap, and a little bit of an adventure.
