This came highly recommended, but was just ok. The appetizers/salads were by far the highlight of the evening. I would go back for appetizers and dessert. We had: Lamb shoulder (good, not amazing as built up by the waiter) Salads, lavash & hummus (fabulous) Desserts (halava mousse blueberry parfait) - fabulous Coconut milk & peach, peach sorbet - ok
