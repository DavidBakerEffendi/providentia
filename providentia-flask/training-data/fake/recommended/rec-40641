Had brunch here with ten people and it was fabulous. The ambiance is super cozy and the food was exactly what we needed to cure our hangovers and start the Sunday Funday right. French toast was phenomenal! Can't wait to go back and try the mac and cheese. Service was great too, I love the managers Cameron and Yeager- I had met them when I ate at Pod and they now work at Jones. They always put a smile on my face and provide some great entertainment- make sure to say hi to them!
