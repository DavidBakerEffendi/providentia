I had the cheesy grits last weekend-They WERE NOT GRITS. I think someone made them with cornflour instead of grits. The texture was way off and they tasted chalky and terrible. Everything on the menu sounds tasty and well conceived,  but after eating there twice and trying 7 or 8 dishes, I'm sorry to say, the chef/cooks don't have the skill to execute.  The place is very nice and comfortable, and the service is friendly-Beer selection and prices are good as well, lets hope the food catches up to the rest of the place.
