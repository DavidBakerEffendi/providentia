I am very puzzled by these 5 star reviews. First off this is NOT a cevicheria , not at all.  They do not serve ceviche they serve raw fish more akin to sashimi.  For anyone that has had real ceviche you will be disappointed, for anyone who has ever been to Peru and had the real deal you will definitely think this place is bs.  God help you if you are from Peru and eat here you may run away. The tuna "ceviche" at near 20 dollars was a ridiculously small portion, not sure how we could share it.  But what more it was not ceviche it was basically the center of a spicy tuna roll in a mediocre sushi joint.  It was all mayo with barely any fish.  The other "ceviche"special  options were basically some sashimi i think he said it was yellowtail I don't know  with ponzi sauce that again was ridiculously overpriced. The oysters are nothing special just dollar oysters with some interesting sauces but I'd prefer just some horseradish. And then the drinks - ok but small of course.  And the Pisco Sour again if you are from Peru you will be disappointed - you could taste the egg - no please egg is just to give froth you should not taste it in the drink.  Also one or two Pisco drinks should knock you on your ass not happening here. Service was fine and friendly I liked the atmosphere but overall it's way overpriced and again NOT ceviche!
