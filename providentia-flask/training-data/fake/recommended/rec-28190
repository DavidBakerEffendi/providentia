Getting into Bubby's was a bit of an ordeal, but once my party was seated I was able to Â enjoy the charm of this place. It is really wonderful and unique. Once inside, I did not feel like I was in New York City. The food was okay, nothing to write home about. Service was just okay too. It's a bit crowded, and on Sunday morning there are TONS of families. I am going to say that the food is over-priced for what it is. And my lemonade was super pulpy-- not was I was looking forward to drinking. I think there is better brunch in Lower Manhattan than Bubby's but I still kind of want a t-shirt.
