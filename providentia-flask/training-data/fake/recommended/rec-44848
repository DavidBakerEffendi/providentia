Such a good brunch place! The wait was long but expected Friend and I split the Goat Cheese, Tomato, and Spinach Omelette and the Pumpkin Pancakes. Definitely would come back again for either entree! The potato salad and salad greens that came with the omelette were out-of-the-blue amazing. Pumpkin Pancakes were excellent.
