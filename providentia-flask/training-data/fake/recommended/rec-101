They deliver! And it doesn't take a million years! We found this place when searching for a place that delivers and have now ordered from them 5-6 times. We've kept things pretty simple (half pepperoni:half eggplant) with their spinach/Gorgonzola salad and have been consistently pleased with the quality of the food and the deliver experience!
