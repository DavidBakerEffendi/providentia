The best margherita pizza I have ever had.  Period.   If you like garlic, this pizza is for you, each slice had at least one large clove of fresh chopped garlic on it.  The pepperoni and sausage slice, while delicious, was really greasy, but their margherita pizza more than made up for it.  If you're in the theater district, do yourself a favor and stop in for a slice (or two).  This will be a MUST for me whenever I'm in the city from now on. A warning, there's very little seating/counter space, so be prepared to eat standing up and slightly squished or do carry out and take it with you, but don't let the lack of seating discourage you from giving this place a try.
