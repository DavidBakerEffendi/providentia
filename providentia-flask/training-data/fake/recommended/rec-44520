You will see Filipinos here: Meaning, if you can get Filipinos (who can easily cook their own food or get it from their Inay's place) to come out to a Filipino restaurant, this is a legit place. Pros: -workers who know how to correctly pronounce the Filipino dishes -big portions -non-threatening, yet appealing enough to get those who have not tasted Filipino food to diversify their palate -creative menu -Filipino drinks - Buko Pandan Rum, Calamansi drinks -the service was by far, excellent! The servers were attentive...we were sitting next the bachelor party group, and this one guy sitting next to us was being a bit too much. The workers had their eye on him and when he finally left they apologized even though I didn't mind too much. They served us free drinks and free dessert. They were just so nice to us on a busy Saturday night! Cons: -I wish this place was closer to my apartment!
