Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. We were told we'd be seated in 45 minutes, it took two hours.  We ordered food, two people who ordered appetizers as their main course got it way before the rest of us (honest confusion) - but were never brought silverware so it got cold.  And when our food did come, a burger was missing and had to be rushed by the kitchen. But you know what? The food was AWESOME.  My burger was perfectly cooked and flavorful, topped with well seasoned guac, cabot pepperjack and tangy pickled jalepenos.  Oh, and the sweet potato fries - believe the hype!  Everyone's food, in fact, was delicious (all the more so because we were hungry).  And the manager - he was excellent.  He apologized to us personally, comped the meal, and was honestly interested in hearing how they could improve. Everything but the food was a fluke of a fail, but unlike a lot of places, they went above and beyond in making it right.  Cheers.
