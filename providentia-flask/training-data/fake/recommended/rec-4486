AWESOME food and staff. Everyone here is so friendly and the bartender Johnny is funny. They have a very large variety of Beer! Must try Beef Brisket and Wings - I ordered them dry and it was amazing. I love how it looks inside - very spacious. I will be back to try everything on the menu. *The bathrooms here have so much space in each stall and extra hooks for bag and coat. I love this place already.
