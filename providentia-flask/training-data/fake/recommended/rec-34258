I love this place! This is a weekly stop for me whenever I need to feel a warm family atmosphere and get a truly great meal. I love their pizza and pasta dishes, probably the best buffalo chicken pizza in Mercer County. However the things you often don't think about are also delicious; they always have about three soups on and they are all homemade and yummy! You should also save room for their homemade tiramisu for dessert (made in small batches by one of the two 'Brothers' wives; truly authentic). This business is a true community spot and supports many school program and recreation athletic teams as is evidenced by their many certificates, plaques, and recognitions hung throughout the dining room. The decor is a little dated but the owners have been telling their patrons that a major renovation is in the works. Whether you are dining in or taking out for a family pizza night you won't find a better restaurant then Brothers Pizza on Rt. 33.
