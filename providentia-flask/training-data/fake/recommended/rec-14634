There are only 3 things I miss about NYC since moving back to Los Angeles 2 years ago: 1) My friends 2) The interesting people on the street 3) Dosa Man I think that about sums up how amazing he is. Especially the time when I ordered in 19 degree weather. He gave me an extra soup as I waited for the delicious he was about to impart on me. Well worth shivering in the snow. I miss you Dosa Man.
