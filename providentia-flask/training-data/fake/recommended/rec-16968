Came here for lunch on a weekday, but it was holiday, so it was super busy.  The ambiance was great, it felt like a little tropical escape... but that's where my compliments end. The servers were clearly very overwhelmed and short-staffed, so it took us forever to get a glass of water, let alone place our order.  When we finally did get our food (I had chicken with rice & beans) it was so incredibly underwhelming I had to slather it in hot sauce to make it worth eating.  My husband and I lived in Union City before and used to have amazing Latin cuisine at our disposal, but even so, this was food was super gringo-fied.  It's probably great to come and get tipsy with their drink mixers and your alcohol of choice, but don't come for the food, and don't expect to get it quickly.  We could barely flag down a server to get our check.
