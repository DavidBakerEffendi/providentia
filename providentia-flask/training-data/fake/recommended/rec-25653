Absolutely wonderful Lebanese-inspired mediterranean restaurant, with a  tremendous variety of mezzes to choose from. If you have the time and are looking for lunch that runs about $25 per person this is a place you won't want to pass over. This won't be a traditional or ethnic meal, but that's not really the point.  Note that I said Lebanese-inspired, not Lebanese! The plates have some modern touches when it comes to complimentary flavors (think whifs and zesty garnishing) but it all works very well. The wait staff at Ilili was incredibly helpful and attentive, and certainly charismatic. Our waitress was more than happy to "play trivia" with the items on the menu if we had any curiosities. Water glasses were always full, and empty plates were readily cleared. Excellent service all around. Seen on my table were (in english) Lamb Sausages, Falafel, Artichoke and Heart of Palm salad, Phoenician Fries (sage and garlic), and Duck Kebabs.  Dessert was a Lebanese Snowball, aka Halva with pistachio sauce. Everything was absolutely delightful. You'll love the food here too!
