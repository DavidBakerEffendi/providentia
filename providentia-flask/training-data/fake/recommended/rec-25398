What happened to Buona?? The pizza at this place is absolutely terrible! The woman behind the counter uses her bare hands to put the slices in the oven to reheat them after I'd just seen her handle money from someone else. That's a health violation! I used to work in the food industry and that's a big no no...and simple common sense to wash your hands after handling money. On top of that the slices looked like they had put extra cheese on them to make them look fresher, which they weren't! After taking a couple of bites I got up and threw the slices in the garbage. The slices must have been from the day before because there was no taste, they were soggy, and dripping with grease from the extra cheese they used to save money by not making a FRESH pie once in a while! Won't be back! Avoid!
