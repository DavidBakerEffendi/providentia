I had such high hopes!  The wait wasn't horrible (30 minutes for a table for 5 on a Thursday evening), but the bar area was so packed that it felt like waiting in a crowded elevator.  Once we were seated, I was happy that order was taken promptly and water was delivered quickly.  I ordered my burger medium and it was rare, just lightly seared on the outside, completely red on the inside and oozing juice as I picked it up.  The buns quickly disintegrated in the juice (sigh, hate it when that happens; I don't like to make a mess).  The burger was thick and the bacon crispy, but other than that, nothing to write home about.  Maybe a good pit stop after a drunken night?  Cash only.
