I will give Dinic's and the Roast pork with sharp provolone (I don't like broccoli rabe) 5 stars as it is an outstanding sandwich...but I will say that I don't think it is the best sandwich in America. It's awesome and everything...but the best?! I don't know about that one. Expect to wait a long time, but it will be worth it in the end. This is a massive sandwich so I can get over the roughly $10 price tag on it, too. There will be lots of juices from the pork so make sure it doesn't drip onto your clothes (all of mine landed on the table and floor like a puddle...yes it can be that messy!). This also means you should try to eat all of it even if you feel like you're going to die because the bread will be a little too soggy after if you don't finish it soon after.
