On Monday 16th January 2012...at 4.56  PM me and my other 3 friends went to Nomofuku !!!! The guy at the bar told us that they will be open for dinner at 5 pm!!!! We asked him if we can just sit down and wait till the service time !!!! He told us No!!!! I just feel like why that they didn't let the customer sit down and wait!!!! Me and my other friend are working at the restaurant I am a sous Chef at famous up scale restaurant  in midtown ..and my other friend works as the Head chef at the up scale restaurant at the High line park ...sometime the hostess seat my customer before the service time,, so they can enjoy  chatting and the server will start taking they order when we start the dinner service..in that day I was really disappointed..always wanted to try their food and we wanted specific that we wanna eat at Momofuku !!! So disappointed and sorry never ever again !! And will tell all my the peole who I know about it !!!!! Bad customer service !!!!
