Had a good-great meal at Highlands.  Some good which means it's decent but wouldn't order again and some great which means it's awesome and would order again.  The bacon wrapped dates and sticky toffee pudding were piping hot sweet savory gooey delicous!!  Lentil soup, chicken and pork were good but nothing exciting.
