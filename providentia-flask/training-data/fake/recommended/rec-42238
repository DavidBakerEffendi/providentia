We've always had a fine experience at Blue Ribbon, but last Friday night, we waited over an hour for our meals, and it seemed that the waiter completely forgot about us, and our order.  One of the folks with us just ordered a salad, dressing on the side...and that was LAST to get to us, and then was dressed. To top it off, we could never find the server, even when we wanted to pay.  Not going back anytime soon.
