The candles on the wall and chandeliers are a nice touch.    Even better:  they have sidewalk tables and a patio in the back perfect for a summer evening.   We started out with the cheese plate (goat, sheep, cow; i don't really remember) which was delicious and what do you know?   They have my favorite Sonoma County zinfandel on the  wine list at a fairly reasonable price.  ($39 for a bottle that retails around $24).   Not bad.   I had a gnocchi truffle creamy thing for a main, and it was delicious too.    Nice atmosphere (not too stuffy), good food, and price is reasonable.
