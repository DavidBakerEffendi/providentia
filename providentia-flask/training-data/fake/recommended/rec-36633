This would have received 5 stars apart from the service.  We got some major attitude from everyone, which was a shame.  This is a lovely spot otherwise.   We absolutely loved the red curry tofu.  It was the best dish I had and not what I would ordinarily order.  We also loved all the sides and we ordered all of them, especially the sweet potato hash and brussel sprouts. The sticky toffee pudding was also fantastic.  Food and wine are very good.  They just need a little less attitude.
