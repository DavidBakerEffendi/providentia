The food was excellent here. I will tell you why I only rated this just 3 stars. The service here was so-so. It took about 15 minutes to get our drinks to the table, no dishes passed out to split a appetizer, and the waiting staff looked lost. But, this doesn't stop me from going there because the food is very good. I will tell you my usual meal. I start off with the warm spinach dip, then end it with the wood grilled chicken sandwich with avacad0. I love it and on top of that the sandwich comes with a side of choice. I recommend the chicken tortilla soup( that's to die for)
