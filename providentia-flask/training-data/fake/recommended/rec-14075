This was a really up and down meal for me, ranging from 5+ stars to 3 and the dining experience rode that roller-coaster rating pretty much the whole way through the night. We were seated almost immediately, which on a Saturday night at 9 PM was pretty awesome (it was packed too, kind of weird). Ariel K. seems to think it was because she name-dropped, but I don't even think the hostess heard her. So, great start. I started with a Bulleit 90 on the rocks, which was 13 dollars. Overpriced, especially compared to the other bourbon on the drink list, but its my favorite and I couldn't resist. And then, it took about 15 minutes for the waiter to get it to me. Apparently, it takes a long time to pour 2 oz. of bourbon. So, they were starting to lose me a little bit. We ordered brussels sprouts and oysters for the table as an appetizer, and I ordered the flank steak while my two compatriots order the duck. Wait...wait...wait... About 25 minutes later the waiter comes over and asks if we need anything. I said yes and asked for the aforementioned apps. Wait wait wait. About 15 minutes later our main courses arrive. I once again ask for the apps, and about 5 minutes later they come out. I don't know how David Chang does it, but I'm just not into the appetizers coming out AFTER the main course. Especially when I asked for them to come out early. So yeah. That kind of sucked. I'm rereading this review and I'm realizing its pretty boring, an I think its because I'm trying to be mad about the service, which really sucked, the portions (small), and the price, ($150 for the three of us). But here's the bottom line. It was fucking delicious. The steak was perfectly rare, with an absolutely amazing romesco. The duck was downright succulent and the brussels sprouts was probably the best vegetable dish I had ever had. So yeah. Just go. Just don't expect to be treated well.
