I always come here when I want to pay a small amount for a whole lot of food! Especially when theres nothing for dinner and I still want to have left overs for lunch the next day! They always have different varieties of foods different meats and rices and they always serve people extremely well, whether you eat there or take out. (Which I always do) There really is no comparison to this place for the great taste of the food and the awesome price! P.S. If your ever there when they have the oxtail, don't leave without trying it! YUM!
