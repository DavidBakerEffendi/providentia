This is only worth it if you are really craving Chinese noodle soup but in my opinion the food is too greasy, oily and the right flavor is just not there. I usually only come here if I am desperate for a beef noodle soup or my friends want to come here. I usually don't even really enjoy it. I am always at a constant crave for good Chinese food but its rare to come by in Philadelphia but this is only because I grew up in Taiwan so my standards for beef noodles soup is extremely high.
