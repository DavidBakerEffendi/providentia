Finally an all-you-can-eat sushi place in Morris/Essex area.  No need to drive all the way to Sushi Palace in center Jersey anymore.   My wife and I came in around 6pm on Saturday and the place was almost empty, though it filled up pretty quickly afterward.  Good variety of food. Our food came very quickly after we placed our order.  We had seaweed salad, fried calamari (w/ mango sauce), BBQ squid, chicken katsu, and shrimp tempura as appetizers and we liked all of them.  We also ordered 7 special rolls and ~30 pcs of sashimi/sushi.  The rolls are pretty big and they tasted pretty good.  We liked the spider roll and butterfly roll in particular.  The sashimi are quite fresh but some of them are very small though, especially the white tuna.  Green tea and red bean ice-cream are good too.  For $23 ($21 for weekday) a person, I am satisfied and would definitely recommend this place.  They do not have a bar but you can BYOB.  And if you do not like all-you-can-eat, they still have a regular menu, though the prices are kind of high.
