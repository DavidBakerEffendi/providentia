Visited Employees Only on a return trip to the city.  Loved the decor, crowd and overall vibe.  Drank a Fraise Sauvage-- one of the best cocktails I've had in a while.  Highly recommend the drink menu.  Food was a mixed result-- 2 of my freinds ordered the pork chop with lentils.  It was a huge serving of tough/overcooked pork and a heap of bland lentils.  My pasta dish (with olive oil and sausage) was excellent though. In summary, try to get a good recommendation from your server on the food, but you can't go wrong with any of the drinks.
