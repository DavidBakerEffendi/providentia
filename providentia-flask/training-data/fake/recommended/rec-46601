I love my burgers, so Village Whiskey was on my radar for some time. Finally I made my eay over there for my birthday this year. Here's how it went: We arrive for dinner early and without reservation, so the estimated wait time is an hour. That's fine, we prepared for that. We figured we would grab some drinks close by while we waited. There is also a bar inside which probably had some room, but we wanted to hang out somewhere else anyways. No problem, you can leave the host/hostess your number and receive a text or call when your table is ready. Fantastic. Point is, be prepared to wait. The restaurant is small and popular. Tough combo. After about 30 minutes and a drink up the street, we receive our text and return to Village Whiskey to be seated outside. This was also our preference because it was a beautiful may evening and the inside seemed too dark and cramped for such a nice day. We were promptly served and I ordered a bourbon sampler because, well why not. I chose the trio featuring Blanton's because I'd been meaning to try it anyways. If you like bourbon, great. If not, don't bother. Obviously. For appetizers we had cheese puffs and pickled beets. The cheese puffs were OK but the beets were excellent, so fresh and satisfying with the creamy ricotta. I figured since it was my first time I had to order the Whiskey King as they recommend, with the Foie Gras. It is a damn good burger. Next time I'll probably make my own burger (love eggs on my burgers,) but I'm glad I tried their claim to fame. That said, $26 is too expensive for any burger. And that's the major impression I took away. It was my birthday, so being a special occasion we didn't mind splurging, but this is probably the most expensive bar/burger joint you'll eat at. And at the heart of it, that's still what it is, a bar and burger joint. And although it was a tasty, sort of gourmet experience that i would recommend at least once, I'm not impressed with the overall value.
