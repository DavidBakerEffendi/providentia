We would have enjoyed the restaurant except for the stereotypical French waitress who was slow, hard to find, and condescending in her demeanor.  With a 20% gratuity automatically added, perhaps she looked at it as an unnecessary inconvenience to care for her tables.  That being said, the food was quite good and the prices reasonable. The skate, the linguini and the banana ricotta tart were excellent. The octopus appetizer was okay.  Based on our service, I wouldn't recommend Balthazar.
