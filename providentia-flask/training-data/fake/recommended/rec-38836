The wait is agonizing but the reward for the wait is worth it. First time I ever got fried chicken and waffles was here, and I have to say, it's been pretty tough to beat. I've had it at Pies N Thighs, and while both are extremely sickeningly delicious, I thought this place's chicken had it down better. The gravy with the maple syrup - I have to stop, because I am about to drool. I've had the hangar steak and eggs here too. So so so good. Also the buttermilk pie. Service is friendly, obviously it can be slow because everyone and their mother comes here. It's become a well-known spot. Very hipster-y. Seriously though.... don't sleep on the chicken and waffles.
