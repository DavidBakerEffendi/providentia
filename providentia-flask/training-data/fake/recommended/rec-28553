I am so glad I had this experience the for was good the staff was friendly. Everyone was super helpful, especially because it took me awhile to figure out the flow of this restaurant. I had the chicken quinoa soup and sweet potatoes. The sweet potatoes are amazing, get those! I thought the alcohol was very over priced but, hey it's nyc. The dark chocolate almond butter chocolate bar, I should have bought 3, hopefully I can order one online, it was that good! Just go! It's paleo, it's different, it's a cool experience. Good food, no guilt!
