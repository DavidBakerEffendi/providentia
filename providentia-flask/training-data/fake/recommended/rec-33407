Its a great place to hang out.Its got a nice open neighborhood vibe. Â The owner has great taste in wine. If you bring your kid, they will give her a bucket of crayons to draw on the sidewalk while you eat your dinner. We had the chicken which is very tender and delicious. My friend had the burger which she shared with her daughter and they both loved it. The snap peas were a big hit.
