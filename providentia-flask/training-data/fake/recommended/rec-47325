Came here for lunch, the place is small and PACKED at lunch time. i Tried three empanada's (spicy chicken, beef, and cheesesteak) and they were all really good. My favorite was the cheesesteak. The dipping sauces were delicious and the side of rice was huge. Definitely coming back here but will order before I go pick up.
