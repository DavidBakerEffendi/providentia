5 stars for the best pizza in Philadelphia, hands down, and honestly one of about 5 things I miss about living in Philly (having lived around the corner). I won't bore you with a description - you owe it to yourself to get a pie sometime. The restaurant I found to be a little over-priced for the location and quality, but the food was consistantly very good and the opera is always a nice touch (if you're in to that sorta thing, of course).
