We went here to celebrate a friend's bachelorette party this past Saturday night. We called the restaurant the day before to confirm our reservation for 6 people for 10 PM. All of us arrived at 10 PM to discover that our name had somehow miraculously disappeared from the books. The hostess was sweet - totally clueless as to what happened - and also totally clueless how to fix something of this nature. The manager (I believe?) was UNBELIEVABLY obnoxious. He kept walking around the place like he was a celebrity and kept telling us "5 minutes". If he had told us an hour, we would have gladly left. During our HOUR long wait we watched at least groups walk in and get seated right away (clearly they had an "in"). The restaurant was extremely crowded and very loud and totally unaccomidating to those who have to wait. Once we finally got seated at 11 PM, we were okay. The food was good, but I am certain there are plenty of other restaurants in the city that would have been a much better choice. Truly disappointing.
