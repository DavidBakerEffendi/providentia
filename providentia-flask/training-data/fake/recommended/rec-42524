Disappointingly slow service, inattentive wait staff. Ended up being 20 minutes late to my next meeting after waiting nearly 45 minutes for my food and having dessert wrapped up. It also required asking 4 people to get our bill since it was so difficult to get our actual servers attention. Food is pricy for small portions and not very tasty vegetarian options (tried the mushroom dish as a main). I actually started feeling sick after eating here. If you're in the mood for a good lunch option on the block go to Ootoya across the street or Incognito.
