Fabulous burger.  Shared the portobello  and the blue cheese burger with a friend.  Both were excellent.  Cooked to perfection and fresh yummy roll.  Had to try the French fries because people were raving about them.  Now I know why.  Hand cut fresh daily and the bacon jam blew me away.  I highly recommend that you try this place.  I will visit again  not only to enjoy the food but the comfortable atmosphere.
