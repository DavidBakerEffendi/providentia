We went for Valentine's dinner.  The decor was very interesting and unique and the steak I had was pretty delicious, but other than that it was forgettable (and at their prices, that's unacceptable).  My boyfriend had the Max's "World Famous" Kansas City Strip Steak and it was overcooked and underseasoned.  I had the filet mignon and it was cooked to perfection, but had no seasoning.  Now I see why they give you so many dipping sauce options...   We had a nice little appetizer of some cheese ravioli nudi (pasta-less ravioli) with (sparse) pancetta in a yummy cream sauce. The sides we ordered were baked potatoes (dry, no butter, cheese/sour cream/bacon on the side were just okay) and the asparagus with hollandaise which was very tasty.  The asparagus was a little undercooked, but I still ate all of it.   We also indulged ourselves and ordered the chocolate chip ice cream cake for dessert which was a nice ending to the meal. The wine list was pretty extensive.   Our waiter was just okay.  He didn't do much to help us with the menu or explain the specials.  We had to ask many questions waiters usually offer up the answers to.   If Max Downtown keeps their prices the same, then they need to up their game.  More flavor!!  OR drop the prices way down.  I would have given a higher score, had the prices been appropriate. I have been to a couple of different Ruth's Chris steakhouses and they blew Max Downtown out of the water. Final note:  Just go to Ruth's Chris if you're planning on spending this kind of cash on a steak dinner.  You won't be disappointed or upset for paying top dollar.  Promise.
