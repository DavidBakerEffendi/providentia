Just went here for a Sunday brunch.  Bellinis and eggs Benedict were yummy!  I hated our table which was next to the bar in the middle of the room so were in a high traffic sport where there really should not be a table.  The service was very good and the staff were friendly and pleasant.  I love the decor of this place and the large windows that let in lots of light.
