This is one of my favorite brunch places in the slope, BUT I totally agree with what some other reviewers have noticed: they are moving in a snootier, off-putting direction. Food is great but portions are dwindling fast (a grand total of 5 potato cubes in my last order of the egg sandwich!!). Also, no more drip coffee. I like French press, but at $3 a cup I much prefer good old drip. At least give your customer a choice, no?
