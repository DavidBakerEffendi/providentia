Went for the first time recently. I had tried to go a few times before but it was so crowded there were no available seats. I thought, there must be a good reason for this! The place itself is elegant and comfortable, nice ambiance and lighting. We showed up around 9:30 excited to try the reputed drinks and some apps. There was live steel drum music which made conversation difficult, but it was nice. We did enjoy the drinks. In fact I had planned to try a few different ones but the cocktail I had was so delicious I ordered it twice! (I forget the name but it was a bright blue coconut flavored rum drink). The ceviche, however, was atrocious. I mean, it wasn't ceviche. It had zero citrus, I mean zero. It tasted like someone had thrown some soggy cocktail shrimps in a glass with a bunch of mush and decorated it with a slice of avocado. Exactly one slice of avocado. We tried another appetizer which was okay but nothing to write about. Our waitress was fine but was quick to inform us that the kitchen would be closing soon, and we got the distinct vibe that everyone wanted to go home. I mentioned that they advertised being open until midnight, and she said, "Yes if we are busy but if not, we close earlier." There were still several customers at the bar so she said if they stayed, they would stay open for a while. Needless to say, we got the message and left soon after. I would try it again and I would recommend their drinks, but overall, I was not impressed.
