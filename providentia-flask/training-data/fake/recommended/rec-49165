They get an A+ for decor and ambiance but the reason we are going is food, which just wasn't up to par. I am debating clarifying a 2.5 rating but the amazingly fair prices will keep it at a 3 star. A friend and I ordered the Green Dumplings for appetizer and the Pad Thai and the Basil Tofu for dinner. The last two are pretty standard so I figured it would be easy to rate the restaurant based on these dishes. The dumplings were far too soft to really enjoy. Granted they are steam dumplings, but they broke apart when trying to eat them and the ingredients inside were far too bland. I doused the dumplings in the dipping sauce and some extra soy sauce in order to finish them. The Pad Thai was a bit too dry to really enjoy the dish although the flavors were decent. The basil tofu was the only dish that did not disappoint with full flavor and a large quantity portion. As I mentioned earlier, the prices are surprisingly low from what I have encountered in NYC up to date so seeing the bill at the end of the night was a pleasant surprise. Overall, I think there are probably a lot of other hole-in-the-wall thai places on Thai Row that have better food even if their decor is not as great.
