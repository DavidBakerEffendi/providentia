I used to live in the area and had gotten it once few years ago and it was good. Had this twice in the oast few months neither one was good. Last time I got garlic knots, the Sicilian pie and a plain pie. My husband assigned I really had a pizza craving which was not satisfied. The Sicilian crust tasted like frozen pizza crust and the plain want good either. Garlic knots were fine. Would prefer dominos over this next time
