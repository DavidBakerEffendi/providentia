Been here a few times and I'm always loving it. It's as if you're wisked away at a little cafe in the French countryside. The staff is predominantly if not all French. The smells are wondrous! I've come here for brunch and dinner. The crepes are mmm mmm gooood. Brunch gets busy, but sitting outside in the summer sun is not so bad. Specially when the food is savory and just right. Dinner is more laid back, but just as good. Â Try any- ANY- of the crepes. Sweet or savory, you won't be disappointed. Just the right crisp on the crepe and the wondrous little package of goodness it carries. The portions are not disappointing nor overwhelming. Certainly worth a visit! A great little place to take a date.
