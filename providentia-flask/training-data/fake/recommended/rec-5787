Finally got to try Shake Shack during my recent visit to Philly. My friend and I split a double cheeseburger and an order of fries. I love the crinkle fries, and the burger was seasoned perfectly. We went around 9pm on a Wednesday, and it was busy, but we were able to find a seat. I love the interior too. Simple with a great city/neighborhood view. Till next time Shake Shack!
