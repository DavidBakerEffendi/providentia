Hmmm ive been here a few times in the past, usually a long wait esp popular with non-Chinese, Â would have given it 3 stars except my last experience was just not good... We ordered 2 steamed pork soup dumplings (one w. crabmeat).. very dry hot & sour soap.. too thick and barely warm rice cake.. GREASY service.. well first bowl was not clean.. second bowl was not clean...
