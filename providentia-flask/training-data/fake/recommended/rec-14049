BEST thai food i've ever had in NY! My friend is Thai and she only comes here for her comfort food. The 2 of us ordered 2 appetizers (BBQ pork and papaya salad), 2 main dishes (green curry noodles and pork noodle soup), sticky rice, thai iced tea AND 2 desserts --- we managed to finish everyhing!! it was SO delicious!!! warning: the papaya salad is very spicy. i normally eat very spicy food and my tongue and cheeks were burning up!! i will definitely go out of my way for this restaurant again.
