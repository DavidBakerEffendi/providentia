I have been to Izumi several times, most of which I'd say were decent because of the ambiance and the fact that it's the only sushi place in south Philadelphia. I had reservations for Friday night, unexpectedly we were seated at the sushi counter because they were full, not what I expected with a reservation. I was then given a dirty wine glass which was also disappointing. Finally we received a menu and then I remembered how small their menu is, a place like Doma or Sakura has a much more extensive menu. When the sushi actually arrived it was decent, not great, just decent. I really would like some competition in the area because Izumi is decent for passyunk but definitely not a great sushi restaurant as compared to most others in Philadelphia.
