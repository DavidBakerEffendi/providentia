Delicious Israeli brunch in a quaint atmosphere. I just took my whole family here when my parents were visiting this weekend.  I was so impressed.  First of all, even though the place was packed, it only took five minutes for party of seven of us to be seated.  More importantly, the food was delicious and unique. Definitely not the same old same old brunch food.  The burekas were definitely a standout.  Delicate and flaky on the outside and filled with the most savory feta cheese.  The Israeli salad on the side was diced to perfection and topped with a yummy lemony dressing. The vibe is intimate without being too small and the decor is quaint and rustic with lots o brick.  Can't wait to try dinner...
