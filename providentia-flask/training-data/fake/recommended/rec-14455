The review may have been colored by my hunger, but I'll let it slide.  I had a delicious omelet feast for lunch today--eggs with feta, spinach, dotted with kalamata olives, with a little salad, two full slices worth of rye toast, and some tasty hash browns--for just $8!  I washed it down with an apple flavored tea and enjoyed the decent amount of seating and nice lighting.  My friend was very satisfied with her dishes.   Unfortunately, service was a little intermittent, but generally friendly.  So probably not the place to go if you're in a rush, but I'll be back for another leisurely lunch.
