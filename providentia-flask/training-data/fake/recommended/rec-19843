Came here for brunch and the execution of the food is great without question, but we just weren't blown away. Maybe our expectations were too high? Both meals (salmon scramble and eggs Huntington) felt overly salty. The banana sticky bun was great and the coffee was good. The iced coffee tasted just like regular coffee with ice rather than proper iced coffee made from a higher concentrated brew. You should check this place out, a lot of people love it. We just left feeling very...meh. I feel like dinner would be much better here!
