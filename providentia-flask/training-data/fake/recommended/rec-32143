I am so surprised at the negative reviews for the Mustard Seed Cafe!!   I go to the Mustard Seed every couple of months and have never had a bad experience!  The food is so very fresh, which is what struck me the most on my first visit.   I don't usually care for sweet potato fries, but when dining with a friend, agreed to split an order.  I find sweet potato fries typically to be floppy with little flavor.  Not so at the Mustard Seed!!  The fries were very fresh, firm, crisp, and very flavorful!  I could only surmise that the potatoes had been cut fresh in the kitchen that day. My favorite sandwich is the Hartwell, but I've never had a bad sandwich - for breakfast or lunch.   The outdoor seating is always a nice option, too! I always suggest the Mustard Seed when asked to recommend a breakfast spot in Glastonbury.
