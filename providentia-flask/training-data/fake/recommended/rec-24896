Was in Philadelphia this week on business and thought what better time to try to follow up on GQ magazine's list of "the 20 hamburgers you must eat before you die".  Rouge has #4 on the list.  So like a woman on a mission- I sought out my prey. Rouge is charming.  A Parisian style bistro located right on the edge of Rittenhouse Square.  It was a beautiful spring day and the windows were open to the park and all the people hoping to see and be seen were at this place.  We wanted to sit outside but there were no tables large enough for our group of 5 so we ended up inside.  This was okay with us as the bar is unique with its scalloped edge and there are silk curtains hanging ceiling to floor adding to the overall ambiance of the place.  In two words- lovely and unexpected! But enough of the frivolities- back to the burger.  The Rouge Burger is $15 and comes simply with carmelized onions and cheese.   There is leaf lettuce and tomato on the side and the pommes frites that accompany it are also quite good.   Now this review is only based on half of the burger (I am assuming the other half was just as good!)  but this thing was HUGE!  It had to be at least a half a pound of beef!  Order it medium rare and you have a thing of beauty.  Mmmm, mmmm, It definitely belongs on this list! Oh, we also tried to balance out our meat fetish with some salad- the arugula lunch salad was good as was the salad nicoise.  A "heads up" on the nicoise "salad"  there is no lettuce- more like a piece of grilled tuna and sliced eggs, etc. The funniest part of the lunch was here were 5 women sitting around a table each with the biggest burger in the world in front of them and the men sitting around us in their fancy business suits were nibblin' on salads!  We got quite a chuckle from it. Rouge is definitely on my return list the next time I am in Philly.  Now, only 19 more burgers to go on the list!
