Was very excited when I found out that a Five Guys was opening in Hillsborough.  We have tried it 5 times.  Usually ordered it online and picked up.  The burgers were always a big mess when we got home (just 3 minutes or less drive) and the bread was soggy.  Today we decided to just go in, order and wait for them.  When we got home, it was the same thing.  It looks like when they are wrapping them they press the burgers down and they are a smashed mess when you get home and unwrap them.  I think I am done with Five Guys in Hillsborough.
