Yes the wait is long and the portions are small, but this cute French bistro is cooking up some hella good food! We started Saturday brunch with drinks. I ordered the mimosa because I am not a Blood Mary fan, but oh how I wished I did. That was the best spiciest Bloody Mary I've ever had! My tiny mimosa left me wanting more. Â Next came some delish croissants and butter/jam. I ordered the scrambled eggs with goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes, and those were by far the best scrambled eggs I've eaten. I finished my meal with a perfectly brewed cappuccino. Two thumbs up!
