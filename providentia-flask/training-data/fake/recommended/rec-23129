We went here on the second day of grand opening. Place is very nice and clean looking! They were only serving appetizers, soups and noodles for now but it was still quite a large selection. They weren't ready to serve the lunch and dinner entrees. We ordered the Braised Beef Noodle Soup. The noodles were udon and not freshly made like the one in Matawan. The braised beef was a little bit tough. We also ordered the Shanghai Rice Cake and loved it! Rice cake was nice and soft and there was just the right amount of chopped baby mustard greens in it. We also ordered scallion pancakes and loved it as well. It was nicely fried and the hot chili oil was a nice accompaniment with it. Finally, we ordered the soup buns. I think they forgot our order but it eventually came out and they apologized for it. The soup buns tasted great. The owner recognized me and said that she owns this place. Her younger brother owns the one in Matawan and her younger sister owns the one in Edison. A nice little family business. They also have this VIP card where you get 10% off if you can pay in cash. Just go and register with the cashier. I love this place! It's nice and clean and it's new!
