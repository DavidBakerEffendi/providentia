I haven't been to Sticky's in a while, since I a) moved out of the area, and b) became vegetarian.  If I were to start eating meat again, I would RUN to Sticky's.  The quality of the chicken is really good, everything is cooked fresh.  The guy who owns the store is really nice, and I've often received free sauces from them.  Yay Sticky's!
