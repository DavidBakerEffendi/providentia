Just moved into the neighborhood and I'm very happy to have this little cafe just a block away. The barista was friendly, the atmosphere quiet and relaxing and very inviting. The kitchen was closed tonight so I'll hold off that fifth star till I try the food, but this is definitely a spot you should visit. My cappuccino is delicious and artfully made.
