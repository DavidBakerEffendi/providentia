If you want to spend your entire paycheck for bad and pretentious indian food, go here.  Whoever thinks this is spectacular food must be friends of the owner and never have had any good indian food before. I am a first generation indian, a lover of indian food and also a lover of innovative restaurants.  There couldnt have been a bigger fan of the french indian fushion restaurant Bindi or the great spicy flare of Ekta.   Tashan is a bitter disappoint in many aspects.  Its flashy expensive decor is awe inspiring but once you sit down you realize that you are now paying for only that.  Tashan charges a ridiculous amount for average tasting poorly made indian food and fails on all claims to actually reinventing indian food.  Tashan claims to be Indian-french fusion but all it really serves is bad to okay indian dishes served in small quantities with fancy presentations. Our service was also poor.  Our party waited close to 30 min for the rest of our table's dishes to arrive after one guest had already received her appetizer and main dish at the same time.   We were also given misleading advice by our waiter to order ridiculous quantities of food, including 5 starters that cost between 15-28 dollars a dish and one main dish per person that would have left us with a ridiculous amount of wasted food and a bill we would have to pay off in installments if we had followed their recommendations. If anyone had ever visited Bindi before it closed, that was a clearly thoughtful fusion of flavors that was  a wonderful suprise to your senses and worth every cent (yet still amazingly more appropriately priced than tashan).  If for any reason you think you are going to get something different for the prices you are paying at Tashan, the only thing you will be impressed/repulsed with are the Ipads they use to show you the wine menu. Hope the prices decide to go down on this place because I can't imagine it staying open much longer.
