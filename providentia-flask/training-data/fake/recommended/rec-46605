A solid four-star lunch with excellent service. For better or worse, a lot of my judgment in a restaurant is reserved for the service. That being said, this place has an amazingly friendly and attentive staff. From the hostess who greeted my group, to our server who was simply a professional, to the manager who made sure we had a great time, service was stellar. Our food was not as memorable, but still great. A friend and I shared the Funghi pizza and the Spaniard sandwich. The pizza was excellent, rich, and full of flavor. The dough was probably the best part, and of course it was -- it's made with duck fat. The cheese was nice and pungent (in a good way), and the mushrooms and truffles were decent. The sandwich was fairly good, the highlight being the romesco aioli sauce that was smothered all over. I could dip just about anything in that aioli sauce. I paired the lunch with a Weihenstephan, a traditional and light German lager. A crisp beer and a great way to wash down a good lunch. My friend and I really enjoyed our time here, and we owe a lot of credit to the service. I will definitely come back for more lunches and dinner.
