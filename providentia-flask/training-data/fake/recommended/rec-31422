I don't know why others feel differently, but we came here after being dejected by the long waits at Bella's, and were glad for it! Â Our waiter Eric was great, the frittatas were great, and the price was great!! No wait, comfy ambience, not packed like sardines, and no rush out the door. We will surely be back.
