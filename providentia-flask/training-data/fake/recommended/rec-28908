Went for SIPS tonight with a friend and enjoyed my time. Noise level was loud but not loud to the point where I'd have to be sputtering saliva in someone's ear to get a message across. It's only my second time here but my overall impression puts it at above average. We started with the spinach and artichoke dip which was a great appetizer during conversation. Let's just hope the spinach wasn't there for that as well. I had the peach sangria and chocolate martini, which at $5/drink was pretty good! The idea of a chocolate martini didn't seem attractive to me at first, but with minutes left on the clock, the scarcity principle kicked in and I just had to order it! I was pleasantly surprised when the chocolate paired very well with what I presume was vodka. I tasted the alcohol going in and then a rich sweetness followed. We also ordered the mushroom and ricotta pizza and the bacon, avocado, lettuce, and tomato sandwich. The pizza was aromatic with a nice thin crust, but the BALT was just mediocre. Atmosphere is nice and trendy, tables are cramped even for two unless you're only ordering drinks. My friend and I found it strange that many of the tables around us were not cleared even though they had been empty for some time. Chocolate desserts may be great when they're in front of you, not so when they're half eaten and starting to settle.
