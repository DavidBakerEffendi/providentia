We went for Saturday brunch and though we did have to wait, it was only for about 15 minutes. I had the Eggs Benedict Philly Style with the home-fries. Â Loved the combination of pretzel bread, cream cheese and pork loin topped with the runny egg. The eggs were perfectly runny without being under-cooked. While it was enjoyable, I thought it could use a little bit more flavor. My wife had the Andouille Sausage Frittata. The zing of the Andouille gave the dish life. I think I like this dish more than my own, but I believe this was off their Specials Menu and not on their regular menu. We will definitely be returning when we have reason to be down in South Philly or even at their other location in Northern Liberties
