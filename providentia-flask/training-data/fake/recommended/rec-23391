Wow, Pat's is as bad as Geno's.   May all of the misguided tourists rot in some uncomfortable hell. Who the shit visits Philadelphia anyway?  I know, honey, let's go to the city with the highest crime rate in the country for our holiday. PS: ...sorry, I was off my medication.  Couldn't find a damn bottle opener.  Better now.  Really, I have nothing but fondness for you deer eyed blobs of mass gooing through my city.  ;)
