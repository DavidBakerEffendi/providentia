This is the definition of hole in the wall in NYC... not only do you have to weave through the craziness of the flower market to get to this building, but this deli is tucked away inside the apartment complex (look out for the HIT sign outside).  I bet the doorman here has learned more about Korean food than he ever wanted to know... In any case, first thing you have to know is there is only two tables inside.  One of them seats two and the other, four.  So deli is the right word, not restaurant.  The server is the same woman as the cashier, very friendly and chatty, and always willing to instruct you in the proper way to eat her food (my friend was tsk-ed last time for not mixing red sauce in her bibimbap).  If you are planning on enjoying the meal on premise, come before noon or else plan on hanging out a bit, probably with the doorman.  They also do take out, and it helps to call ahead. Food wise...It took me a few tries to find my favorites on the menu, and I do agree with the other reviewers that it can be a HIT :) or miss.  For me, the winners are definitely the stews, especially with the colder weather.  I usually go for the chicken or tofu.  The bibimbap is fresh and pretty decent, but I agree with some of the other reviewers here that I've had better.  The ramen is not worth getting, and the dumplings are mediocre.  Finally, they also have a great selection of bottled teas by the entrance!  Perfect for quenching the spicy heat.
