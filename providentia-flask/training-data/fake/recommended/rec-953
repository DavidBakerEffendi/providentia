My girlfriend and i went into the city to try Gigi's but they were closed. As we were walking away a nice lady asked us if we would like to give the place next door a try. She quickly but very politely seated us and went over her menu. It all sounded really good. We were treated like we were the only patrons in the place. (even though the place was pretty busy) Food was really good and the service was FANTASTIC... We will be back...
