I've stopped in for a breakfast sandwich and coffee on the go before (well sort of- everything takes a while here apparently) but today had my first dining-in experience for Sunday brunch. Where to begin... We ordered our coffee and beverages 3 times until someone finally brought them. Part of the problem here may be that they seem to be using the "team approach" where there are multiple servers helping each table. When the coffee did come it was so strong that we quickly emptied our cream pitcher and refilled it ourselves at the coffee take-out area in order to make it drinkable. Then our food started coming in spurts, first came the meats. I did not eat these, as I would consider myself a vegetarian, but others in my party found them to be very gamy and actually raw in the middle. Next came two main dishes (out of three). Omlette and potatoes were decent. French toast was ok, but the promised extra syrup never made it to the table and my side of eggs was unusually flavorful and salty- turns out that's how the gamy meat tasted- remember the vegetarian part- ew.  Then while we scarfed down our food, which took a very, very long time to come, our third entree was still coming, two servers checked on us and finally, as we finished our plates, the third entree arrived. Today I was very disappointed by both food and service and although I had previously enjoyed my egg sandwiches, I don't think I will be going back as I am now skeeved that they seem to cook everything in meat fat.  I was excited to have Gold Standard in the neighborhood and hopeful of more West Philly brunch options (will be sticking with Rx) but am quite disappointed.
