A fantastic Yelp find. We loved this little authentic Trattoria in a great West Village location. Our food was delicious true Italian cuisine, priced far below its worth. From the delicious opening bread, to the amazing gnocchi, to the wonderful homemade desserts, this place is extremely reminiscent of any first rate Trattoria in Italy. The wonderful Italian servers were delightful, always ready to please. Particularly enjoyable was dining outside for this early Spring lunch on the Christopher Street side. If you enjoy simple authentic Italian food, and like to people Â and dog watch, you'll really enjoy this spot and the parade of people and dogs that stroll by. Even if I'm staying in Midtown, I'll definitely head back here. It's well worth the trip and experience.
