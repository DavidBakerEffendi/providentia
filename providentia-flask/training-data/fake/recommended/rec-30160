We went to Cookshop on Labor Day with an 11:45 reservation.  We were seated immediately and the hostess was very friendly (-:  We started with an order of Beignets and some cocktails.  The beignets came 1st and were burned and delivered to us..cocktails came and the Watermelon Mojitos were AWFUL!  Both my daughter and I could not drink them...VERY strong and BAD rum.  Our waiter was great very apologetic and replaced both items.  New cocktails not much better and the next round of beignets came out raw in the middle.  We ordered lemon ricotta pancakes for the table and they were OK...could not taste the lemon at all.  The Cheddar scramble was also OK but the biscuit was a rock, I ordered the Frittata and it was good.  My husband ordered the Fried egg sandwich and it was also OK.  We were very excited to go to Cookshop because of the recommendation as one of the best brunches in New York.  OK is fine for a chain restaurant but I don't pay for an expensive breakfast and expect OK.  I would not waste your time going here when there are many other great restaurants in New York! Again service was GREAT and the owner did come over and apologize but i will not return.
