I've been going to Cheeky's whenever I'm in the neighborhood since it opened. I actually haven't tried most of their sandwiches, mostly because the chicken sandwich is just really really good, and I can't not order it. The owner who is awesome isn't around much anymore which is a drag, but the guys working there are always really nice. If you're not lucky enough to grab the table up front seating isn't the best. One of these days I'll remember which way to turn the sink faucet in order to not blast water everywhere. Is it healthy? Heck no. Is it delicious? Heck yes. Viva Cheeky's.
