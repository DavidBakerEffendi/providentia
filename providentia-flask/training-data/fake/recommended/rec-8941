Woorijip is a decent value for Korean food, and excitement runs through the place even at late hours. They have Korean goodies, but it's pretty much just a buffet/cafeteria thing when it comes to food, and the sketchiness of a buffet is there. Reasonable prices, but not memorable. On a good night, it's a great place to meet up with friends for Jinro soju, a distilled liquor. Or a few more. Suddenly, being open late is even better, and the later it gets there, the more packed and fun the energy is. Going with a group, staking out a table and holding court in the heart of the city doesn't get better. I miss K-Town often, and Woorijip is exactly why.
