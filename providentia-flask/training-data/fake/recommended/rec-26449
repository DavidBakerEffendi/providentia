I came to Flat Top with two other friends after work. I knew that it was going to be a bit pricey but I wanted to try it anyways. This place is adorable! I loved the mason jars, the wooden flooring, the whole atmosphere. It was a great place to just sit and talk to my friends and catch up. Thankfully we had a lot to talk about, because I found the service to be quite slow by New York standards. I didn't mind though because we were not super hungry. Food wise, we ordered the smoked salmon and asparagus (mine), the bone marrow (my friend's), and the poached egg caesar salad (my other friend's). For the record, these were all starters. We really weren't very hungry. My friend really enjoyed her bone marrow, which I didn't get to try. However, she has had it once before so I'll take her word for it. It's quite difficult to mess up a caesar salad. However, I was rather disappointed with my dish. I really love salmon, and thought that the dish would be something more than what appeared to be good quality packaged slices of salmon you can find in the grocery store tossed together with some asparagus. I believe in ordering things that you can't make at home, and I honestly think the salmon one I could have recreated. I'm giving the restaurant four stars because honestly it's adorable and I do want to try it again. There is an eclectic collection of foods and drinks on the menu that I am interested in sampling, and it is definitely decorated nicely. It's a bummer that the food worked out the way it did, but next time I think I'll order something like mussels instead.
