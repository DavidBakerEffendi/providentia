The special appetizer of 8 different roasted veggies was a hit. The pastas can be ordered half portion as an appetizer. The chicken liver rigatoni was extraordinary, no really extraordinary. The bread basket was one of the best since Rosemary on Duane St. in NYC. We ordered the much reviewed Lombardo and the Margharita pizzas as appetizer. The pizzas were good, just not special considering Food and Wine reviewed as one of the best. So much for F&W's pizza reviewer. Our waiter, Steve, described everything in great detail. Wine. Baked Halibut was delicious as were the roasted artichokes ala carte side . The cappucino was artfully done and the beignets were tasted and left on the table. Expensive and sort of worth it based on quality and preparation. Just hard to pay New York prices based on Philadelphia rents. We will return.
