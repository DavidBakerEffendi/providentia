The seating here is strange. The past few times I've been here there are empty tables and they ask us if we had a reservation. We say no and then they go away for a long time and tell us to go sit at the bar or in one of the middle table seats and explicitly tell us we can only sit there. Rubbed me the wrong way so we got up and left. Yes, i've had the hot pot before it's good. A bit salty for my taste and don't get the ramen noodles because they are overpriced for half a pack of the 99 cent kind of instant dried noodles. I believe they charge 2-3 dollars for it.
