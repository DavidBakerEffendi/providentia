The last of the destinations on a 4-stop bar hopping tour of the area. Comfortable sort of place, and the two serious beer snobs of our trio - me admittedly being one of them - enjoyed the seating and table layout of the place. Very solid craft beer selection for a place of its size, including some really good ones that a Baltimore boy like me rarely some across. Cigar City...oh yeah! Seated at a table, we received quality, efficient service from our well appointed barmaid. Definitely a place I'd like to transport down to charm city!
