We went into the restaurant after a Sat. movie.  The place was quite busy, and we felt lucky to get a seat at the bar.  The bartenders were attentive and courteous.  The food, on the other hand, was something else.  I ordered Fish & Chips.  They had to be the worst.  The fish was so overcooked, I could barely cut into it with a knife.  I ordered Onion Rings in place of the fries, and you could tell they were from frozen.  Additionally, we sat on the side of the bar where the servers collect dishes, etc.  The servers took no notice that the bar customers could hear every time they would pitch a dish or pan into a can.  It was extremely noisy, and I am hard of hearing!  I have no desire to return there.
