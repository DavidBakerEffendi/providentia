I ordered pho when I was here, and it was a mistake. You see, I also tasted the Chargrilled Pork and Broken Rice my friend ordered, and that was SO DAMN GOOD I immediately regretted my pho. I spent the rest of the meal sulkily slurping up pho while she ate the most divine little chunks of marinaded, grilled pork. My goodness. They were perfect. And the pho was actually pretty decent! They add the paper-thin raw beef round to the steamy broth immediately before they serve it, so it cooks while you watch, just as it should. The meat was fresh and not fatty. The condiment plate lacked cilantro for some reason but the basil, jalape√±o, and sprouts were perfectly fresh. I drank all the delicious broth but there were too many noodles for me to finish. I have no quarrel with the pho. I was just filled with pork-deficient regret. Next time, I will stick to the pork. And the avocado shake. And maybe a summer roll. And a Singha! (They have beer!) But definitely, definitely the chargrilled pork.
