For the longest time, I couldn't figure out what this place was, until I stepped inside. and boy was I glad I did.  This restaurant has an eclectic mix of art throughout.  The bathrooms are my favorite part!! :)  And the food is just as good.  Portions are filling, beers were good, and and the vegetarian burgers aren't your basic frozen veggie patty!  Overall, I love the decor, (especially the botanical plants in the glass containers), the environment, and the food.
