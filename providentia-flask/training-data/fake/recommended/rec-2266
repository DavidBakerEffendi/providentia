We've only been here once so far for the great all you can eat mussels deal for $20.  They have that on Mondays and Tuesdays. Place was totally NOT packed so we were quickly seated.  Oh ya, your order comes with 1 Stella and they make it correctly (or at least like the commercial on tv).  And they come with fries. We tried the Grand Mère (tasty but bacon flavor does not fully come through), the Thailandaise (we liked this one) and the Provençale (we liked this one second best).  Of course the fries are good and you get bread too for dipping into all the yummy goodness in the pots. Be sure to order your next pot as you're almost finished, don't wait otherwise you'll sit for a bit.  2 lbs is pretty filling but this is the first serving, the refills look like 1 lb.
