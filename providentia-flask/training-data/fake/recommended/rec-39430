This just became one of my favorite restaurants! Went yesterday for brunch and I loved it! We showed up at about 3:00pm thinking it would be super busy but it wasn't. The hostess quickly got us a table outside and a waitress came and took our orders right away. Though I wouldn't call this a "Boozy Brunch" spot because it's not AYCD, the brunch special is pretty good. $17.00 for an entr√©e and one drink; you had the options of picking a frozen margarita, mango screw, mimosa, orange juice, etc. My boyfriend and I opted for the margarita and we're really happy we did, it was really yummy and STRONG. As for our entrees, I had the Scrambled Burrito which had chorizo and a bit of Guacamole and Sour Cream on top and I was literally licking my fingers. My boyfriend had the churrasco and eggs and he loved it as well. I love that they put yams in the home fries, they were SO good. We also ordered a side of yucca fries that came with this sauce on top and it was "bomb" lol. I really have no complaints about the food or the service we received. After eating, we got a round of drinks. I got the Yuca Sunrise which was frozen margarita mixed with sangria, and my boyfriend had a caipirinha. We both enjoyed our drinks and got a good buzz off just two drinks. I will most def. be back here SOON to try their other specials!
