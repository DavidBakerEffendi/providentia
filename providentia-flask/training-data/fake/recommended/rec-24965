We had a wonderful time this weekend at Blue!  I had the clams, (yum) and hub's had the wings, (double yum - I stole a few), to start.  The shrimp and spinach special was really delicious with plenty of shrimp.  My husband is allergic to fish and still had plenty to choose from but went with a perfectly cooked steak that was really tasty and buttery soft, (I stole a few bites of that as well.) I tried the "Wildflower" mixed drink, which was unusual and good.  It had a tea taste, which I liked as it wasn't overwhelming with the taste of booze. For dessert we had the chocolate cake with coffee gelato and the banana cheesecake goodness.  We rolled out of there with panda bellies of happiness. The food was wonderful, the view was great, and though the place was tightly packed the staff moved around each other in a way you just knew they've been working together for a long time.  Our server was the best.  She managed to keep the glasses full, dishes cleared and stayed on top of what we needed without interrupting our meal.  She was really incredible.   What was surprising was how many people just started talking to each other.  Other guests were really friendly and we wound up chatting it up with different people.  We had a wonderful anniversary dinner.  Well done!
