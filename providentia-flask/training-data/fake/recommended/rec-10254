Small old school style Italian but with a very interesting & varied menu ( besides the usual also a lot of the unusual)  also an extremely well prepared and thought out menu too - Only have been there a couple of times,  BUT any time I am in that area of NYC I would definitely go back with out a doubt as they do things the right way there. I had a pork braciole there which is not that easy even find in most Italian restaurants anymore and when you do rarely made correctly or this good. At Antonioni's it was made correctly and that good, my parents are both from Italy so I know what real and good Italian home cooking is suppose to be like and from my one visit here they have nailed it unlike 95+% of most other so called Italian restaurants- Service at Antonioni's was warm friendly and attentive, the décor again also warm and homey, if you are looking for over the top fancy foo foo touristy food and service this is not the place for you but if you want the kind of place you might stumble across while taking the off the beaten track down a side street while on a walk through a small Village somewhere in Italy than this is the place for you, the place where all the locals would eat - 177 Chrystie St. New York, NY 10002. 646.998.3407 antonionis.com
