Amaze-balls service, drink and food!  I went here with my husband yesterday (Sunday) afternoon.  Really wanted to have some ceviche on a hot day.  We ordered one of the tuna ones, which I'm not sure totally qualified as traditional ceviche--it was more like a mash-up of awesome tartare/sashimi.  Whatever.  It was delicious as was my Prufrock & a Hard Place cocktail.   We were pleasantly surprised by the $1 oyster special (all day Monday and Sunday).  Great staff and free yummy truffle popcorn at the bar.  Spent about $55 for two beers, a cocktail, one ceviche dish, 6 oysters; which I'd braced myself for after reading the menu online, and I didn't expect to get full off a ceviche snack anyhow.  Seems like it'd be a very cool date spot. Will go back!!
