Okay, this place is great.  Quiet unassuming little sandwich and coffee shop.  The New Orleans ham sandwich is a killer.  I don't eat bread and they turned it into a salad that was excellent.  Coffee drinks were well done and service was much better than expected from a little sandwich place in Philly.  Will be a regular here.
