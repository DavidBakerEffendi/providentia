I went to ilili by the recommendation of a friend.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that all the meza dishes were favorable and created in a traditional manner.   The main courses were a whole other story, however.  My friend and I decided to try two specials, a lamb shank dish and a salted fish dish.  The lamb shank very very dry and the surrounding vegetables were undercooked.  And, the salted fish had a very fishy smell and lacked any flavor; I had to ask for lemon wedges just to make it edible.  While I would normally overlook the poor main courses  since the meza dishes were great, each main course was $40+ so I am extremely disappointed.  We spent on $80+ on poor dishes and for that reason, I am giving ilili two stars.  If you try this place, stick to the traditional items.
