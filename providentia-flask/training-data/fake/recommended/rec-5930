I have heard of the Lobster Pound before but never had the chance to go because it was so out of the way, but when I happened to be in the area I jumped at the chance. The place has two areas: the store front and a dining area. The store is simplistic and a little small so crowding can happen. Once you order they are quick to fill them so you can get in and get out to enjoy your fare. I of course got the lobster roll, maine style, and my sister got the conneticut style. The lobster roll is a bit smaller than others that I've had, but taking into consideration the format of their shop, its understandable. The buns are toasted so they are slightly crunchy. The lobster are whole pieces so you can see the claws as you eat it. The maine style is lighty mayoed so you taste a lot of the lobster. The conneticut style, with butter, is warmed and different than the traditional roll that I'm used to but still very good. The lobster rolls were so good we decided to try the shrimp roll. It wasn't quite as tasty as the lobster roll. Â Guess its lobster roll all the way for me. Maybe a little smaller than I'd prefer, but they were pretty good rolls. Will stop by again.
