Went here for dinner Saturday night. Great ambience. Love the decor and lighting. Service was great - food came out very fast. I had a spicy noodle dish and my husband had the green curry with rice. We both enjoyed our meals. The pricing is very affordable as well which is nice. Would definitely go back here again. Seems like it would be an ideal place for a group dinner before heading out for drinks or dancing :)
