AMAZING. Amazing service, clean diner, great food. We were here for breakfast on a Monday, and it was pretty quiet. I got the banana french toast (awesome) and my friend got the red velvet pancakes (AWESOMER). Coffee was really good, not just diner coffee. And, like I said, service was fantastic. That counts for a lot to me. There were people in this diner with laptops working, or having what appeared to be business meetings. If I lived near this diner as a student, I would have spent a LOT of time there. :)
