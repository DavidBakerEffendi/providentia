I was a big fan of the oyster house before the new chic renovations. After reading a few reviews on yelp, I decided it was time to take the plunge. I knew I would either love it or it would leave me wanting the old oyster house back. While I miss the old scene, the new setting is great. The decor is appealing in a very clean, bright, polished and fresh way. The lighting is sharp and reminds me a bit of being on a boat. I ate at the bar so I could take in the restaurant and check out what the clientele was like. I started out with the obvious, Oysters which were great and perfectly shucked. There must have been hundreds of Oyster being eaten at the same time throughout the place. Everywhere I looked there were oysters. I also had the mixed baby green salad, which had a nice mix of radish, tomato and cucumber with an awesome sherry vinaigrette. It had the perfect amount of spice with the radish and sweetness of the salad dressing. For my main course, I decided to stick with the basic crab cakes, they as well were very good. The cakes have nice lumps of jumbo crab meat and were nicely cooked. The green beans and potatoes were just average but overall the crab cakes was able to carry the plate. The lobster roll looked very good as well. The shoestring fries left something to be desired and just average when compared to the Midtown Continentals. With all that said, I would say this place is first rate and I am looking forward to a trip back to try some other menu items.
