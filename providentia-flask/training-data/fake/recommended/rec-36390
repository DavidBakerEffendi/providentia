----------LATE NIGHT ONLY--------- No wait at 11PM on a Thursday (but we did snag the last seats in the house). So much hype for this place which is definitely worth trying (I'm a fan) but I also don't know if I'd wait in the long lines that people keep saying this place has. Here's what we ordered: Steamed buns - pork belly, hoison, cucumbers, scallions: Yummy in my tummy BRT Bun - crispy pork belly, heirloom tomato, smoked mayo: delicious and one of the obvious ones to order. It was amazing but anyone who goes to any good Chinese restaurant can order the same thing. Chanterelies - pickled quail egg, bone marrow, green juniper: this was interesting to try--it wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either. I do like the experimentation on this menu Sweet potato icecream --This was an experimental dessert (the waiter came by to see how people were liking it). It was definitely interesting to try. The orange soda foam was pretty good and the icecream itself.....will either be a hit or miss with you. Overall, I like the menu and the different types of items that you can't really find on any menu. That alone would probably make me come back to try out other things. It's a great spot for a date or for a group with friends and I love the community-style seating of this joint. Well done.
