I took my mother here.  She spent years in Brazil in the Amazon rainforest and always loves to get Feijoada when we try Brazilian restaurants  This time, though, we ordered the heart of palm salad, the vegetarian plate as well as the special seafood in green sauce.  The side of rice and beans was perfect.  Everything was very tasty and fresh.  And, we had plenty leftover to have the next day.  The service was attentive and friendly and the décor was lovely.   This is a lovely restaurant!
