Been twice for dinner, both times the service was ok...hostess bubbly and friendly buy waiters are all bearded "Mumford and Sons" looking no personality types.  Both times my husband and I had fatty meat...the beef the first time and the pork chop the second time.  Oyster appetizer poor quality oysters overly breaded and fried served on top of a bed of overly mayonaissed slaw.  Atmosphere is the only plus...loud and lively if you are looking for action.  Many better restaurants in Chelsea...
