This restaurant is really cool, and the burger lives up to its reputation as one of the best in the country (from what I have experienced). The atmosphere is trendy and fun, and the service is great. However, the restaurant is tiny and crowded. When you are seated, you are on top of the party next to you, which I do not like. However, it is an experience, and a fun place to go. Something everybody must experience if they want a top-notch burger in Philly.
