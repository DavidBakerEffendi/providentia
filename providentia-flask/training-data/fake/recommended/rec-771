Overpriced and nothing special about it. Rather spend that type of money on a large Big Mac and still have money left over for some lotto tickets. Would not recommend anyone to this place. Racist a$$hoIe started the English only bull. Everyone should stop going there. Even the tourist. Cause people from Philly knows their cheesesteaks and know where to go get a good one and that place is not geno's or pat's.
