Angelo's is located in a part of Clifton that I rarely visit. This will change after I tried their Chicken Marsala and Buffalo Chicken pizzas! The Buffalo Chicken was excellent. The chicken was tender and the sauce had a nice amount of heat to it. Surprisingly the slice was not saggy and I was still able to eat it without making too much mess. The Chicken Marsala was a nice surprise. There was a lot of chicken and mushrooms and the crust was very crunchy and not saggy at all. It is going to be my new favorite. I will definitely visit Angelo's again in the near future to try some of their other pizzas! PS. The two slices were more than enough food for lunch.
