Husband was craving Spanish ham and got a half shaving of the Iberico ham. He was as happy as a clam. The tapas was all pretty good, although I think I have had better. The exception was the grilled octopus -- meaty and outstanding. When asked about the happy hour special, the server says there isn't any. I'm a bit confused as other Yelp reviews have mentioned a happy hour. Also, the tables are a little bit too close to each other. I can almost read the text message the girl 6 inches away from me was sending out. Overall, not bad, not spectacular.
