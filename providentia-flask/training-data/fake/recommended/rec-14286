I have heard a lot of raves about Corner Bistro's burger and so I dragged my huny here one day to put their burger to the test. It was a Saturday around lunch time and the Bistro was full from front to back. We were able to score a table for 2 as soon as we strolled in. There's nothing to mention about the decor because it's similar to a bar/pub. Personally, I am skeptical about eating at a bar because it just doesn't look or smell too sanitary to me. The menu options are pretty straight forward and so we quickly ordered and waited for our food. The burgers came out pretty quick along with some fries and let me tell you, it's a pretty big burger. The result of our taste test? Burger was 'meh' and a bit on the soggy side causing it to fall apart. It's a bit messy to eat and we are both baffled as to WHY people say it's "the BEST" or "one of the BEST" burgers in NYC?! The fries were super greasy AND soggy which was a total disappointment. The search for best burger continues....
