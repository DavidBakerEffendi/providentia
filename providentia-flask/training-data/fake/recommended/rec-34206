Really good food, excellent beer selection, cheap prices and sincere and friendly service.  This place is 3 blocks from my office and I will make it a regular stop.  Lamb lollipops were $8 for two frenched rib chops that were cooked perfectly.  Fish tacos were very good; I like more heat but they brought two good hot sauces immediately.  LIC has so many restaurants and so little quality; this is a keeper.  I will be back, so I will try to post a follow-up...
