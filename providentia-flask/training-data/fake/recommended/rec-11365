I liked literally everything about my experience here. I liked that it seemed like a mixture of a fancy place and a casual place, the quirky modern industrial decoration and the food. For some reason the servers t-shirts seemed a little dumpy but overall, a great new place. Next time I want to try the bacon sundae! The nutella chocolate dessert wasn't good but the pistachio one was!
