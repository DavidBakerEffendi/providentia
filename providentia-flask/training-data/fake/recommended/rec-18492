If your family including young children clean their plates empty, you have something special.  Ani Ramen in Montclair is the spot.  From the decor, the simple, but yet flavorful items, service and ambiance get my 5 star approval! Service was great, and it was nice to feel welcome even with my kids.  Similar to my experience at Landmarc in SoHo. Was greeted and seated as soon as we got in, and our server Tony was great and attentive the entire time without feeling smothered.   Now to the important part, the food.  We started our meal with the Pork Buns.  I must say these are probably the easiest, less messy of the buns I have tried and had the most components I felt.  Good depth of flavor with a good amount of belly.  Up there with Ippudo ' s, dare I say better than Chef Chang's?  My wife and I both enjoyed the #6 Ani Ramen which is the pork base broth and closest to the akamaru at ippudo.  Lots of roasted pork shoulder and belly in this bad boy along with the other fixins one would expect in a quality bowl of Ramen.  My kids had the Chasu Don which was roasted belly, soft egg, soy tare, and scallion over rice and at $4 a steal and I myself would order if I didn't want noodles.  All around worth every penny.  $47 without tip for me and the fam a good deal for quality Asian food in Montclair.   Overall a very positive experience and am definitely coming back again!  Probably the best spot in NJ right now.  Get here before the wait time is like ippudo.
