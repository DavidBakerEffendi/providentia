I only had a cappuccino here, but it was made deliciously by a sweet, cute French man. The service was amazing! He went out of his way to give us suggestions on what to do around the area. The decor was like sitting in a fabulous Pinterest ad. My only regret is that I did not get to try their food. Saving it for my next trip to New York!
