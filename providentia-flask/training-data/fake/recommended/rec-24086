I went here during the winter.  I assumed incorrectly that this was the favorite places to go for Pho from my Vietnamese coworker.  It was actually across the street.  I decided to go there right before it closed and was cultured shocked when everyone instantly looked at me when I walked in.  I think the owner figured I was lost and didn't want to eat.  I should walked out but decided what the hell and sat down. Normally, I get the best Pho at Pho 75 on Adams Avenue in the Northeast.  They are always fresh, fast, and actually has steak Pho unlike this place.  The owner was a bit aggressive in telling me that they were closing soon and noting that he doesn't get too many non-Vietnamese customers.  The owner also could not provide me with a menu and guess I had a crystal ball with me.  Thinking it was strange, I observed that they have just chicken Pho that was mediocre at best.  The owner looked at me like a hawk the entire time I was there.  A bit uncomfortable ehe?  Also, he only took cash. I don't recommend going to this establishment.  The neighborhood is bad enough to convince people to stay away, but the strange and aggressive behavior of the owner puts it over the top!
