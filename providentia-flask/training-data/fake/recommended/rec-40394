Hubby and I were searching for a BYO restaurant for date night and didn't want to go to our old favorites. I did a quick search for BYO and MEAL came up! I've driven past this place a million times and wondered if it was any good - the reviews were stellar so we gave it a shot. We didn't have a reservation on a Saturday night but it was no problem. The staff was beyond friendly, attentive and gave great recommendations for our meal. The music was relaxing and the atmosphere was romantic but chill. We started with the mac and cheese - a MUST try. Ham, peas, gruyere and smoked mozzarella - delicious and only $8 for a very generous portion (definitely enough for two). We each ordered steaks - My hubby had the NY Strip and I had the 8oz filet mignon. Stellar. Absolutely delicious. We finished the night with flourless chocolate cake and carrot cake and it was all mouth watering. I would definitely go back here. The owner, or the manager, frequented each table and was certainly happy to have customers here. A must try and we'll definitely be going back even though they're getting their liquor license at the end of January. Perfect for a date night or a night out with the guys / girls.
