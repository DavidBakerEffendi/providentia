A damn fine brewpub.   I was going to criticize the gal who wrote the first review for going to a brewpub and not commenting on the beer, and then I realized she's probably not old enough to comment.   The beer is great! Mixed drinks are actually pretty cheap too, but it took me years of beers before I noticed.   Yeah, the servers can be slackers, but the bartenders are usually superb.  The food is good if you like it fried, but what could be better with some of the finest house-brewed ales and lagers.   Recommendation:  take a risk on the cask conditioned ale, even if it's not exactly what you were in the mood for.
