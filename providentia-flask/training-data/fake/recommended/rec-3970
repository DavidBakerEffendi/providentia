As I was waiting outside in the rain, munching on complimentary chocolate chip cookies, lemony sausage, crispy french fries, and strawberries dipped in whipped cream, a customer exited the restaurant, rubbed her belly, and exclaimed, "Oh, Jesus. YES." That's when I knew it was well worth the wait. I was so stuffed by the time I got inside that I could barely hold all my lemon ricotta pancakes. The three butters (lemon, strawberry, and cinnamon) were really tasty, as was the chocolate egg cream. My boyfriend had the harvest pancakes, bacon, and the cherry lime ricky. Thumbs up for all three. Management is really attentive. They checked on us several times and we both got hugs as we left. It made me feel like I was eating at my grandparents' house, where I got hugs and they were always trying to stuff me full of food that I should not be eating. And the prices! It doesn't get any cheaper than this. I wobbled out of there like a Weeble, but I'd go there again in a heartbeat.
