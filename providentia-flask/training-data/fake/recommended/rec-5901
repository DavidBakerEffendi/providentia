My first visit to a Steven Starr establishment. Party of 7 on a busy graduation weekend? No reservations but no problem. We went around 5PM on Sunday. Everyone we came into contact with greeted us with smiles. We were made to feel welcome. That's a refreshing change.  The food was tapas style and we each ordered something different. I want to know how they make the French fries so very thin.  Had a great meal!
