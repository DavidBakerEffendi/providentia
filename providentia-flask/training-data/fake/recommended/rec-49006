You have to love a place that has been around 20 or so years with the same owner and a smiling server who has been there 11 of them. Make sure you say hello to Chris the waitress!! I had the Spanish Omelette. If you like veggies in your omelette this is definitely a good choice. I'm full! Also, the home fries were perfect. Other than the food the atmosphere was nice. The place is a little outdated but it adds to the charm. They decorate the place nicely and keep it clean. I recommend Miranda's!
