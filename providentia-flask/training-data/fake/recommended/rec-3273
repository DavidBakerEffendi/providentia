Went to dinner for Restaurant week. The food and drinks were really good - not great. However, the reason I'm rating it a 3 was due to the staff. Our waiter ran my card for more than my meal - either he's an idiot or pocketed at least $70 as a "tip" for the evening. Be careful and check your credit card after dining here - OR use cash. Go to Del Friscos down the block. Better food, ambiance and service.
