I've eaten here many times before and the food has been great. So naturally when my co-workers and I were in the mood for Brazilian food I said we should order from here and so we did. We got their BBQ special for "3 people". When we got our order in we had a mountain of yucca, fries and plantain. Where's the meat? We got 2 tiny, shriveled pathetic dried pieces of picanha. And all the other pieces of "meat" sausage, chicken were buried under the fries which they served so generously and were so cheap on the meats. The food was cold, tasteless, just plain bad. I've been coming here for years im so disappointed. I'm not returning for overpriced tasteless food which is a ripoff. Casa Nova is much cheaper, they serve the right amount and the meat is much juicer. Sorry Delicias de Mina it's the end of the road for us!
