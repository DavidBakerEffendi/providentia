For Long Island City, it doesn't get much better than this. My girlfriend and I thankfully stumbled upon this place while heading to the bank and it might just be our new favorite spot. After being disappointed so many times in our neighborhood (Blend, Skinnys Cantina, Shi, Masso, etc) we finally had a meal where everything we ordered was excellent. We'll need to come back a few times and explore the rest of the menu, but today we had the chips and salsa (a mix of standard chips, plantains and crispy eggplant slices with a sampling of salsa and hummus), a beet/aruglua/goat cheese salad, yuca gnocchi and a curried chicken pizza. Everything was absolutely delicious and much cheaper than we expected. We would have easily paid double in Manhattan without complaining a bit. Someone complained about the small size of the plates but I think they were nitpicking a bit. The gnocchi dish (our favorite) was on the smaller side but the chips/salsa plate was huge by comparison (we were almost full after eating just that) so I recommend asking your server about the size of each dish prior to ordering. The GM Josh was a super cool Aussie guy who makes you feel like you're the most important guests in the house. Since we visited on a Monday afternoon, I cant vouch for the service in the evening but we will definitely come back and find out for ourselves. However, we'll probably come back first for the amazing brunch specials we read about. So if you're looking for something new in LIC and you're sick of being disappointed then check out Open Door and for the love of God, please try the yuca gnocchi.
