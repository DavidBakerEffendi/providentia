I've been here many times and continue to go back.  First the bad, décor is very 80's, but almost fits for a seafood place.  Weekends can have long wait times but call ahead is available and saves some time - though not always that much.  Now the good; the seafood and sides are always fresh and top notch.  Portions are VERY good.  My favorites are the Stuffed shrimp casserole (different than the large stuffed shrimp - baked in buttery bread crumbs - yummy) and also their fried scallops and shrimp - both VERY lightly breaded and deep fried with humungous portions.
