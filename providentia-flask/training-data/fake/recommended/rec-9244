As far as Greek goes, having never been, I would say it seems pretty authentic upstairs: close, loud, and boisterous.   The food was really strong.  The octopus dish was fantastic.  The chicken slovaki sandwich was another winner.   In truth, everytime I have been there, I have had really great food.   The Greek beers aren't the worst thing I have ever had, but they seem to swing more towards people that like lagers and lighter beers.  When the weather is nice, the  upstairs is going to be pretty bright and a really good spot to have a nice lunch and watch the people pushing strollers on the sidewalk.
