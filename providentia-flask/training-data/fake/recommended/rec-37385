While scouting the campus, we heard several people speak highly of Molly's, so we gave it a shot. I think we would have done better at Dunkin' Donuts. I suppose the fact that we have lived in a major metropolitan area for most of our lives has raised our expectations beyond rural, but this was bad by any standard. The entire staff lacked any form of humility, bordering on surliness, all done with an air of superiority. I regret not saying, "You only work in a restaurant you know, you can drop the attitude!" ;-) The food was excruciatingly bad. I had a chicken dish that was supposed to have a garlic cream sauce with fresh basil and tomatoes. What I got was an overcooked chicken breast, some heated milk, a WHOLE CORN ON THE COB, and some DIRTY RICE. Now, what the hell does a WHOLE CORN ON THE COB and DIRTY RICE have to do with an italian/mediteranean dish???? Some have said that it is too expensive for what it is. The crap they served would have been overpriced if it were FREE. But, that's just my opinion. ;-)
