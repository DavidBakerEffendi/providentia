I ordered 3 tacos- the carnitas, al pastor, & chicken. Out of the 3, chicken came in first as it was moist, flavorful, and had crunchy bits on top! The carnitas was amazing as well. The amount of condiments were perfect! I will definitely be coming here more to get my mexi fix (as I am from CA)! It's hard to find a place that compares to home, but I think Diana's does it! Lovely hole in the wall to the east village!
