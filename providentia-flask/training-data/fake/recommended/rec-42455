I live in the neighborhood, so we frequent Uptown a lot. I can honestly say that it is one of my favorite restaurants! First of all, there food is amazing. I don't think I've ever had a meal there that I didn't love. I especially love their brussel sprouts and quinoa for the choice of sides. All of their protein choices are huge portions, even if you order shrimp! (Which is rare at some places) The pesto cream sauce is great, but my absolute favorite sauce choice for the entrees is the garlic wine sauce which they frequently have as a special. So good! Dessert is awesome as well. I recommend the cheesecake and chocolate lava cake. In terms of service, they have some of the nicest servers who work there too. Whenever we have guests visit, we always take them to Uptown and they rave about the food and service as well. Another added bonus is that it's BYOB. Cheers!
