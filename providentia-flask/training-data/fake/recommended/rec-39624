Dangerously good. Just go and ask for the mix. It's a platter of just.. Everything. And it's all about the white sauce (you can grab a handful to go too).. Just a couple tiny squirts of the hot sauce though! I have to pass this everyday and the smell of it just makes me want it.. Everyday. Super filling and good bang for your buck. Great drunk food. Once my friends and I had a cab driver take us there before he dropped us off at home. He waived the cab fee if we brought him back a platter!
