Claudia, you're a doll!! Came with a friend who is a regular... She insisted we try this place instead of another on my list. So glad we came here. The place is adorable, cozy and fun. Claudia made us all feel right at home. The corn is a MUST! I should have just had 4 orders of those... but, I also had a quesadilla and some tacos. All the food was good and there were other things on the menu that I am still interested in trying as well. If you like Cuban food, come here.
