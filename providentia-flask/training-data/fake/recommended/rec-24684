There is no other Spanish restaurant like Salinas in New York City.  Salinas goes above and beyond the typical tapas bar to master Spanish specialties with incredibly full flavor in every bite. Aside from the fact that I have yet to try a dish I do not love, whenever I go to Salinas I am always impressed by the talents of the mixologist and the vibrant environment of the restaurant.  It is almost as if I am transported from the Chelsea neighborhood to the Mediterranean coast.  The service is impeccable, but not to the point where it feels overly formal, and Chef Luis Bollo brings a passion to his food that you can feel the moment you step foot inside Salinas. Some of my favorite dishes include the braised short ribs (COSTILLA AL RIOJA), the PAELLA NEGRA (great for sharing with groups), and the suckling pig (PORCELLA).  Chef Luis Bollo is always adding new specials to the menu almost every day, so it's always exciting to see what new inspiration he's whipped up!
