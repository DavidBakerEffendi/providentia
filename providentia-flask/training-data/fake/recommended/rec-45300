We had about 30  minutes to get in and out and they have no problem graciously and  quietly moving the courses through the time we had. The pasta with shrimp, although small shrimp. had a delicious kick to it - the squash dish was perfect, adding green olives for a salty addition - the melon/proscuitto was very nice - bibb salad was fine - fried cauliflower with a hint of lemon was a scrumptious side!
