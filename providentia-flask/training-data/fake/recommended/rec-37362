I would be here every effing day if it wasn't 1.5 hours out of my way. But I wholeheartedly recommend this place. It is perfect. Their coffee is okay, but their snacks (I remember a honey and ricotta plate for about $4) are yums. Lavendar tea, yums. Good wifi, excellent study vibe. I'm deeply in love with the decor, and the windows. I've stayed here for 6 uninterrupted working hours before tearing myself away. I live for places like this. Shared a late breakfast with my mom here after she (SHE!! Her 60-year-old-asian-ass self) dragged me (ME!) to hot yoga. It was almost romantic. (The food wasn't mindblowing. I think I'm easily swayed by wooden floors and large windows.) It's a place for hard work and intimate moments, for sure.
