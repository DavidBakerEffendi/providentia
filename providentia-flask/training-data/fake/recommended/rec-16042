Ambiance very nice: just dark enough with great lighting to soften the warming colors of the walls. Service was solid- good to very good. Food was delicious all around, from starters to the entree to dessert.   Wine list was complete and allowed for choices within many budgets. Overall four stars for us.  We will return.
