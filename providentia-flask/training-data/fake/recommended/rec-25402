My wife and I were able to get in here for a Saturday night dinner.  We worked hard to get a reservation here, since you must book it 30 days in advance.  You are greeted at the front door by a red velvet curtain, when you walk in you are transported back to the 1940's.  Pictures on the wall date way back, and you get that "Rat Pack" feel from the place.  We were seated in the back room at what quite possibly could be the smallest table for two I have ever seen.  There was a lally column that ran strait down between my seat and the person to the left of me.  To the right of me was another couple and once I was locked in, I was unable to get up or leave my seat unless someone physically picked up the small table and moved it.  O'h yes, it was a wobbly table and had a stack of napkins under the leg to keep it steady. We ordered drinks, I had the most delicious gin and tonic every.  It was made with Brooklyn Gin and the waiter was very knowledgeable about the product.  My wife had a Chardonnay.  We ordered burgers, I had the Black Label and my wife ordered the Minetta Burger.  My burger was very good but not sure if it was $26 dollars good, I tasted my wife's Minetta Burger and it tasted just as good, for $10 less. All in all, we had a good experience.  This place has a lot of hype, you have to fight for reservations, sit in uncomfortable cramped quarters and overpay for drinks and food.  Welcome to New York!
