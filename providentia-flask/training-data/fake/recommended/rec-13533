After eating 53rd and 6th for a few years now, I still do not know what all the hype is all about. Their chicken is bland and there should be no reason why you have to drench your food with the white sauce for it to be "delicious". I would choose Sammy's Halal over 53rd & 6th any day. Sammy's originates from Queens but they recently opened up a new cart on W 4th & 6th Ave. Check that out if you haven't already.
