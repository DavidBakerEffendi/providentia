So the first time I came here it kinda sucked...the server was less than attentive and took forever to come over and seemed totally irritated when you asked her for anything. However, my bro is a big fan of this place so I gave it a 2nd shot and it was great! The owner was there the 2nd time. She had the best personality! The place is super cute inside and the food kicks ass...so as long as you dont mind tossing the coin to see if you get the awesome owner or her bad attitude server, I would def recommend going here.
