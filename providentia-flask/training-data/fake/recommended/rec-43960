Officially my favorite buffet place in New Haven. It combines Chinese and American food and meets all of your buffet cravings. But here's the thing about buffets-you go to them because you want to eat a lot of a lot of different varieties of foods. If you want one item really well done, then go to a real restaurant. Is everything here amazing? No, but did I get to eat french fries, sushi, steak, and macaroni for $10 on a Friday night? Yes.
