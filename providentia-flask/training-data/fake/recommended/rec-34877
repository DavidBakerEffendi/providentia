Look for the line.  If you aren't waiting for 10 minutes or more, you're not at the right cart.  Typically they're on the south side of 53rd Street across from the Hilton.  NEVER on 6th Avenue.  Sometimes another cart will try to squeeze in on 53rd so be careful. They're not always there, so you may need to come back another time.  Don't give up and go to one of the other carts; you will just be disappointed.
