The food is tasty, fresh and very authentic. Growing up Puerto Rican, I have an affinity for this type of food and I can be pretty critical if not done right, but no worries here. The staff is friendly, service is quick and attentive the only drawback is that it's tight quarters, but I guess some would say its intimate. Try the fried chicken chunks. And I can still taste the garlic a day later when you have the tostones.
