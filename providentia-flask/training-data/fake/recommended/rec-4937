One of my all time favs.  Awesome (but potentially dangerous to order price unseen) wine selection with your own somellier, cozy atmosphere & a menu that always makes you ask the server questions unless you're fluent in Italian.   I most recently tried the lobster antipasti (grapefruit, lobster & pasta - very fresh & tangy) and the monkfish (sans speck & lentils - I don't eat "meat") and a side of spinach & potato gratin.  The gratin could have been a meal all to itself.  Both a perfect warm meal in the winter weather. The butternut squash postage stamp ravioli were not on the menu this visit but, they have left a permanent mark in my memory and can still make my mouth water just thinking about them.  Buttery, melt in your mouth pasta deliciousness.
