Really creative uses of chocolate throughout the menu. The cocktail list highlights drinks that use chocolate or cocoa in some way in many cases and the hot chocolate menu is unique. The food was good and the restaurant very entertaining in decor. It's worth a visit to experience their take on chocolate as something other than dessert.
