You have to go for the experience, or you'll have regrets, like the time when you didn't mark that fabulous tree before your human yanked you away to continue "walking". - 100 yr old sideways gas fire grills - white sandwich bread to envelope the sweetly charred lump o' beef and sop up the lovely rare juices - NO KETCHUP! - cute pagoda building & ambiance up the woo-woo with the dark wood chairs carved up with generations of graffitti by someone who is probably managing your 401K assets. - the warm sense of community you'll get from packing yourself into line with 50 other carnivorous strangers. Fun, cheap date...especially if you're a dog.
