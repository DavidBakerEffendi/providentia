Second visit to Perry St, and it was proven to be far too long between trips. Great relaxed atmosphere, not too loud but not a silent library either, nice spacing between everyone and comfortable. The service was excellent, a notch up from my original visit which was no slouch in service itself. Evening started with an Amuse of Melon, Cucumber, Lime soup which all falvors popped out wondefully. went for the Calamari w/ Yuzu Dipping sauce and sesame. I've never had Calamari prepared so perfectly. Light, falavorful, excellent. The Pickled Peach, Feta, and candied wasabi salad that my friend ordered was spectacular as well. As in many other reviews the lamb was ordered in a decision between that and the Short Rib. Great selection as the lamb was top notch, just wanted more and more. One of my favorite meals and experiences from a restaurant IMO. They execute everything at such a fine level everything flows seemlesly.
