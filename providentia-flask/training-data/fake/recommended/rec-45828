Went in with high expectations. Supposedly, this is THE place to get a legit bagel in Burlington. The local hipster paper hath proclaim'd.  My sesame bagel was great. Chewy/crusty, slightly salty on the outside, chewy/soft on the inside. And then, there's the weirdly-sweet cream cheese. It tasted a little like that pineapple cheese sold in a juice glass your mom would schmear in a celery stalk.  Thing is, I ordered plain cream cheese.  it ruined the bagel. Sad face. If I was five, I might've thrown a small crying fit with some heaving sobs, just to fully demonstrate my disappointment.
