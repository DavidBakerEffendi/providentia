Ate here for the 4th of July absolutely delicious pasta and pizza! Heres the breakdown: Pros: *great bread and olive oil to start * outstanding selection of prime italian dishes * interesting drink choices (lotssss of wine) * the pizza * the pasta Cons: * server was kind of a smartass but he was still good (no negative points just a statement) * says its casual dining attire... Its not (I would say more on dressy side not business casual though) Recommendations: Polenta Gnocchetti with Chanterelle mushrooms, brown butter and parmigiano Lombarda le pizze tranizionali
