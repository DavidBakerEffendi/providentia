If you love Walter Foods, you'll love this place even more. Food and service are consistently exceptional. Menu changes frequently with a variety of seasonal specials. Everything I've ordered has been pretty amazing. There's also a small back porch. Worth the $$. Definitely one of the best places in Williamsburg.
