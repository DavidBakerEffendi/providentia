Has the makings of a neighborhood gem. The food is excellent & reasonably priced. I highly suggest the Short Rib Enchiladas. The venue itself is a sexy, dark narrow bar w/ seating behind it. I was there on a slow rainy night, but don't think a bar crowd would cramp the tables on a busy night. It's cool to see hands on co Owner / TV Personality Jim Cramer at the bar to greet guests. I was amazed at how involved he actually is w/ operations (which is a huge plus). The only issue, which I suspect will be fixed by the time most people read this review is the door. It has an issue fully closing. On a cold night it had the venue pretty cold. I wore my jacket. Cramer is fully aware of it & mentioned it will be fixed in short order.
