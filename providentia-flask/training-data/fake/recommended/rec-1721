ALL SHOW and no go.  What is all the hype about?  I've had better steak subs at Jerry's Subs in the DC area.  The meat on the sub almost seems like it was boiled.  It was grey with no evidence of being grilled at all.  It had no taste.  The bread was tough.  The onions were overcooked and soggy.  All two condiments you could get, you had to put on yourself...mayo from a packet and cherry peppers (whole, with stem)!  If there was cheese on the sub, I'd like to know where it was.  It was a joke of a sandwich.  No wonder South Philly is so tough, if this is what they have to eat.   Then, there were the people behind the counter.  They were like zombies.  The woman who took our order had zero personality and talked to us like she was a robot.  The guy next to her made our sub without ever looking down at what he was doing.  It was as though he was doing his best Stevie Wonder imitation.  I actually think the guy was blind. Considering the joint does a good deal of business with tourists, like me, you'd think they'd consider being a bit more friendly and welcoming. I would not have wasted my time leaving DC, if I knew this is what awaited me.  Add to that the cab fare to and from the place and I give Geno's Steak's sandwich 4 THUMBS DOWN!
