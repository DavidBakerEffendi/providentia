I love this little place. It always has the best food for a great price. I love the hot food and cold food buffet. I also love that they incorporate vegetarian food along with the mix of non vegetarian food. One can find a healthy dose of tofu and egg, and my personal favorite, garlic tofu. Their selections change daily, but they sell certain popular items every day, like honey chicken and spicy chicken and kimchi rice with egg. I love the fish cake soup and they have a mircowave if you want to heat your food. This place also sells pastries, which I have not yet tried, in the form of little cakes. There are places to sit, however this place can get very busy and jam packed some days. I like to come here after church on Sunday- there is usually more seating. This place takes card- 10.00 limit for credit and no limit for credit. Now they have a little frequent buyer card. Everytime you spend 5 dollars or more at each visit they stamp your card and you rack up points for items they have behind the register. I have not seen an item I would like yet, and the points one would have to rack up are pretty high for an item. I would probably have to spend a good amount before I could get an item of high points. That aside, pushing past the busy crowds is alright with me, as long as I can get to this place. I love the food and I seldom walk out without buying anything. Price ranges for some items are fair in my opinion. For the honey chicken and spicy chicken that is not on the buffet line, one can expect to spend about 5.00- 5.50. some food items are 3.00 bucks. One time I purchased a sweet potato for 1.00. I am still dreaming about it. It was that good. This is a great place to bring your friends or a casual date or to even come alone. And after you can go to the bakery across the street, which offers great pastries and bubble tea!
