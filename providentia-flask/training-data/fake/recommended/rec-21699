I ordered the crispy chicken thigh and leg over farro.  When my order came, the chicken was extremely salty!  My order was also missing the chicken leg (??) and it only came with a thin slice of not so crispy chicken.  My husband ordered the burger and thought it was very salty as well.  I tried one of his fries and that was very salty too.  I felt the entrees were over priced for what we got.  This place received great reviews and we were looking forward to this place being our new spot, but maybe the usual chef was off tonight?!?  I wouldn't eat here again.
