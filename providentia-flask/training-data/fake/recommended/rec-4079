I don't generally frequent Irish Pubs, but I did develop a fondness for Swift's Hibernian Lounge on East 4th Street when I played there with Reverend Vince Anderson every Sunday this past winter.  The back room is definitely a great place to hang out in the winter time; it's historic oak paneling and hearty pub food will warm the cockles of your heart.  Probably most people would like to have a Guiness, but I went for a Bailey's & coffee with whipped cream each week.  Reverend Vince Anderson liked it because there was a pulpit that he could climb up in to and deliver his sermon.
