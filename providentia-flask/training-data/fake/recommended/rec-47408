Amazing beet salad, quinoa hushpuppies which are to DIE for, and the cauliflower and was in heaven. Plenty of options for vegetarians. The service was fantastic and the setting ambient, warm and inviting. I LOVED the peach Manhattans.With the hushpuppies and the peach Manhattans OMG Market Table knows what's up. I will be back!
