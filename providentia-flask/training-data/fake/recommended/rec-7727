Dined here after a long day of walking both to and around the Met. It's conveniently located about 4 blocks north of the museum. Food was tasty, and service was fine - attentive, but not exactly warm and cuddly. I highly recommend the Elderflower sparkling water drink - it's light and refreshing and not overly sweet (Hollerblueten, $4). I had the smoked brats entree (Kasekrainer, $14) - they are stuffed with oozy cheese and served over a bed of sauerkraut alongside roasted potatoes and a dollop of dijon mustard. Really quite tasty. Hit the spot after all that walking, and I felt the amount was about right, neither too much nor too little. I've also never been the biggest sauerkraut fan, but I truly enjoyed this stuff. It was mild but provided just the right kick of flavor to compliment the sausage. I could have stopped there and been satisfied for the evening, but I feel dessert is a necessary extravagance when traveling, so I ordered the strawberry and elderflower mousse layered cake (Erdbeer Holler, $9). It was surprisingly light and fluffy. The mousse wasn't heavy at all, and there a small dollop of unsweetened whipped cream on the top that kept everything balanced. The lightness of the dessert was a nice finisher to the heavier entree. Oh, and the best feature of the restaurant is the lights over the booths. They are just plain awesome and unique. All in all, a satisfying experience. I would happily go back.
