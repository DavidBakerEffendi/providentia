You will walk in and the first thing you'll see are fresh vegetables laid out beautifully. Next is what looks like a traditional fisherman prepping the fresh catch of the day.  He's salting, he's cutting, he's picking up his chopsticks with grace and swag. Next is the friendly but confusing waiter trying to nicely point me all over the place on what I should order. Not until I saw the fisherman cook did I finally understand why he was pointing me towards the grill. Instead I got the disappointing salmon and salmon roe bowl. She had the sea urchin don thing which was delicious.  For an appetizer we can the moshi doshi boshi. If you can't find it on the menu it's because I made that up. It was an egg thing with mushroom, shrimp and mochi. For $6, you can't complain but it was just ok. If you come here, you have to eat from the grill. It's an experience. Make sure you sit by the fisherman too.
