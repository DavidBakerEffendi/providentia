We came here around 5pm on a Tuesday and were surprised to see that there were no lines. Â I had high expectations from Yelp reviews and have to say these were not met. Food was decent, definitely not bad but not that great either. I like the crust but thought seasoning was lacking and have had better brick oven pizza elsewhere. Was bland overall. Service was horrible. Even though it was not busy (there were empty tables, and we didn't wait to be seated) the servers hardly talked to us and when I asked for something did not even say yes or sure to acknowledge that he had heard me. Atmosphere was also not very great. It is a family restaurant style decor and the TV was on really loud. I guess it was the world cup so they wanted to watch it. I would skip Grimaldis on your visit to NYC.
