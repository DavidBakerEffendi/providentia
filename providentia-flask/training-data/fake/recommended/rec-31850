A perfect lunch.. Coconut curry beef banh mi sandwich, summer rolls and a Vietnamese iced coffee. Their traditional banh mi is also better than anywhere else you have tried. I walk 20 blocks and am never disappointed. Forget about any of the other banh mi places that pop up in your Google and yelp searches. Trust me, I've tried them all and the rest pales in comparison. The baguettes are always fresh and slightly baked so when you bite into your banh mi, the experience you will have is transporting. Awesome East Village location as well but, limited seating so don't plan on eating in w/ a group of more than 4-5ppl.
