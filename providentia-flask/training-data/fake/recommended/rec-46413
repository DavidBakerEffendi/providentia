Looking forward to this meal. The atmosphere is really dark and lit by candles which is intimate and very cozy. Chili lobsters IS A MUST!!!! Beet Ravioli was also very unique and delicious!!! Spicy bloody mary was also a nice thirst quencher. The chicken for two was absolutely hands down the BEST chicken I have had!!!! The pork chop is over rated! We had to return it twice. The cheesecake was a mint lemon with black berry and pistachio crumbles, very yummy! And the tables favorite is the oreo stuffed fresh raspberry! Wish the sold these to go boxes! Definitely will be back for more!
