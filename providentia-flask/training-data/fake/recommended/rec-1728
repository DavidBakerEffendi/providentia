Han Dynasty has just moved to this building in October 2013. It is a historic building that fits for a dynasty for sure. It feels like I am walking into the grand reception hall of the Han dynasty emperor. I would prefer that the staff dresses the part too. Â Well at least they should like clean and professional. I almost walked out at first because I saw several non-Asian wait staff in t-shirts and jeans. I didn't want another westernized Chinese foods like PF Chang or Pei Wei that I can find in any suburbia shopping plaza. After I walked past the kitchen, I saw a team of Chinese chefs. I told my friend to stay put. We will eat here. The owner is actually Taiwanese. This place is perfect for business meeting, big family, and romantic night out that will not cost you arms and legs. They serve lunch special for $8. Szechuan meal can be oily, so order some vegetable dishes too. The food is ok. Dan Dan noodle has too little ground pork. Pork belly hot sauce is good. I wish they use better quality of rice. After all this is Han Dynasty. Thy should serve Asian's Best quality jasmine rice suitable for emperors. They have an upstairs private event venue with curved staircase. I think it will be fantastic for wedding rehearsal or birthday party.
