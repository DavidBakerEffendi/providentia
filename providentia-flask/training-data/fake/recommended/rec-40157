One of best damn roast beef sandwiches that I have had in a long time, and at a good price. Located in the Reading Terminal, it can be found among some other good places to go, but if you in the mood for a sandwich then you should try to end up here. Mainly open for the lunch time rush, and closes sometime before 4. Next time I'm in the area I will happily return here. Oh yeah and I much thanks to Point for directing me to this place.
