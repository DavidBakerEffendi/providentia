Hands down my favorite tapas restaurant in the city. I tried multiple other places in the past (in NYC alone, Casa Mono, Nai, Las Ramblas, Buceo, Boqueria, Cata, etc.), but Tia Pol is the one place that I come back again and again. Prices are very reasonable for tapas restaurants. Its menu might not be as creative as Casa Mono, but it does the staple dishes so well. (It did miss once out of the dozens of times I was there - thankfully it was a one time thing!) They didn't take reservations in the past, but have changed the policy - so make sure you call ahead on weekends! I personally love patatas bravas and it is the yardstick for a great tapas restaurants for me. Tia Pol's patatas are crispy and full of flavor (spicy aioli does the magic). My other favorites are shishito peppers (pimientos), lamb skewers (pinchos morunos), and garlic shrimp (gambas al ajillo). Don't forget to get a pitcher of Sangria! It is one of the most delicious Sangria I have tasted in the city.
