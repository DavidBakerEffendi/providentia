The best bitter melon I have ever had.   The food really did taste homemade.  The pork perfectly seasoned,  veggies in the oxtail and the bitter melon dish cooked to perfection and mmmmm coconut rice.   Topped off the meal with flan.   If you truly enjoy great food come join the many Filipino regulars at Grill 21 for an authentic dining experience.
