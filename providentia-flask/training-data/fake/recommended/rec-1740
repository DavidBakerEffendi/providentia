To be blunt, I was hesitant to eat there the first time because I don't really trust reviews of Asian food by non-Asians. I was pleasantly surprised. The broth was really good - I didn't even have to add much to it (i.e. chili garlic sauce, etc...). The second time, however, was decent but definitely was not as good as the first time. I don't know if I would go again. But my boyfriend loves the place, so give it a try.
