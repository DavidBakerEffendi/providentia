Came here yesterday with my boyfriend at around 8:30 pm on a whim. The restaurant was super packed but we managed to get a table with no wait. Table was a little small but manageable for two people. The whole ambiance was nice and the glass window roof added a nice touch. The menu was a little small, very few options for regular entrees but their pizza menu seemed extensive. You get complimentary bread and olive oil at the beginning of your meal. Appetizer: Get the Fritto Misto, flash fried calamari, some shrimp and a few artichokes. Delicious!! Main Entrees: I ordered the Bucatini with cured guanciale (pork cheek), calamari, hot peppers and pecorino. I'm not sure if they were hot peppers or just cherry tomatoes. The pasta was a little too thick for my liking but the rest of the dish was delicious. My boyfriend got the special, which was a pork chop cooked with fingerling potatoes and vegetables. HANDS DOWN the best pork i've ever eaten. It was so juicy on the inside and it had a nice crust on the outside. So yummy. Overall: Good experience, wish I ordered a different dish but would come back again.
