You know that people who are dining here have not just happened to be walking by and stumbled upon palo santo. That's because you can't. The Â place, intentionally or not- lies in between a residential block with no other distractions nearby. This is a good thing. Either you have heard of the amazing food which is all made from scratch upon order or you live in the neighborhood. The food does take a while but it is worth every minute. The kitchen is open so you can take a peek if you get antsy. My suggestion is get some sangria and relax. No fast food here--double meaning intended ...
