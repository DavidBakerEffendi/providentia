This place is great!  I went there for the first time this past weekend.  I needed a good Italian restaurant in Phili to meet for a family dinner right before christmas.  Our timing put us on the edge of the lunch-dinner time frame and they very nicely allowed us to order off the lunch menu (less expensive for the family).  We had 9 people and it did take a bit to get all our food out, but they were good with keeping up with us and taking drink orders, bringing bread etc.  The waiter was friendly and the food was better than expected, large portions and fresh veggies!  Its hard to find a good italian place and I feel like we lucked out with finding this place. Thanks Phili yelpers!  I would recommend it for sure. They have a big nicely decorated restaurant good for groups and a large bar too.
