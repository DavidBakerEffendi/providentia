Went for Saturday brunch (more like late lunch) right before their kitchen closed.  They were nice enough to seat us and we promised to order quickly.  My friend had the omelet with pork and the most delicious grits and a biscuit on the side...I had the sourdough pancakes.  My friend's food was AMAZING and mine was totally yummy, but could have used a pinch of salt.  Despite that, the fact that they sat us moments before the kitchen closed, were super friendly, and were happy to let us hang while they prepared to close down for the afternoon before dinner, makes this place a 5-star winner.  I only wish I lived closer so I could try their dinner menu soon!
