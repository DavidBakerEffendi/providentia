Bar side food is much cheaper than the fine dining side. Happy hour eats are decent, not stellar. The (deconstructed) chocolate mud pie is so delicious and memorable - best restaurant dessert I've had in Hartford. Large bar area with a wraparound bar and plenty of seating. I'd go back for a meal, I'd choose somewhere else for happy hour.
