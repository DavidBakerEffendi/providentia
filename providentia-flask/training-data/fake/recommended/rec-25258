Found this place on yelp. The restaurant met up to its reviews. I had the tacos al pastor. They were delicious. The meat was cooked to perfection and the sauce they put on top of the meat was very flavorful. The place is very small and they do not serve alcohol but it's a great place to grab a quick bite.
