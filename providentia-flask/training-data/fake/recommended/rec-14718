One of my supervisors recommended this place to me. I walked passed the place twice (very unassuming, small door). Once inside, I was surprised to discover that the space underneath my bed was bigger than this establishment. Good thing I was just picking up my order. So I got the greek salad with the chicken bourlaki (doubt I spelled that correctly). Whoa, this stuff tastes great. Probably the best greek salad I've had to date. And the lamb sandwich is M-azing. Definitely a diamond in the ruff... Tip: If you must eat-in, ask someone if it's ok to sit on their lap. Otherwise, plan on eating on the benches outside.
