I agree with the other viewers - blink and you might miss it! It's definitely not the most eye-catching place from the outside, but once you cross the threshold, you will not regret it! It is a bit tight inside, but it feels like a place that can easily become your new spot - cozy and dive-y, but in all the right ways. The sushi is so fresh, and their rolls are so, so good! The service is awesome, and as mentioned before, the ice cream wraps up the meal perfectly. I love this place and recommend it as much as I can, whenever someone asks for a sushi joint. All this reminiscing has my mouth watering. Give Kim's Sushi a shot - you'll be hooked! :)
