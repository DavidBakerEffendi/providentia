And this is why the New York Magazine's guide to restaurants is amazingly helpful. What attracted me to this restaurant were the moderate prices, that it was a critic's pick, and its authentic Italian vibe. The food was delicious, service was great. I tried the squid-ink pasta with lobster and gnocchi. I loved them both. We got the grill-octopus appetizer. I would definitely recommend going here with friends, a date (though maybe not the first one because it gets loud), and a family dinner. In fact, it was so good that my friend and I decided to adopt this place as "our" meeting place.
