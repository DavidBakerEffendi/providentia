They actually are like a 10/5 stars! NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE!!! Let's just say that I used to be a vegetarian and was converted into a chicken&rice fiend!!! The yummiest, most amazing Chicken & Rice cart!!! The only one I eat from!!! So good that I can eat it breakfast, lunch & dinner (I actually have...lol)!!!! Â Best spot after a night of partying too! So sad I'm moving to the west coast....Seriously gonna Miss this Chicken & Rice cart. TO SUM-UP: AMAZING!!!! worth the long line, worth the money, worth a trip to midtown All this talk about chicken and rice is making me hungry....Going to go grab some now....BYE!
