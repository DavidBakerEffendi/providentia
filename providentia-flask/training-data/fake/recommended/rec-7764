After a year of salivating on newspaper and magazine articles about this food cart, I finally got to try it last night after nine hours of shopping with my mother (We all know how THAT goes, right?). Famished, tired, and near the area, I ordered a chicken over rice and a lamb over rice for the two of us and my sister, who met up with us afterwards. Was 53rd and 6th worth every hype? YES. Why? 1. The sheer volume of food. This is not your everyday Chinese food packaging they give out like other Halal food carts. They give you the circular pan kinds that can hold more food for a similar price: $6. Can you imagine how much money you save and how much your tummy will thank you if you buy that? 2. The simplicity and taste of the food. I've been to other food carts, ordered the same thing, but was left somewhat disappointed. The rice was too dry, or the chicken or the pita (or worst, all three). Plus, they tried to add in stuff like carrots and green peppers and onions. Big no-nos! A little bit of spice, a bit of cooking, some white sauce and red sauce and we're good to go! Which leads me to... 3. The speed of service. Very quick, and generally amiable-- a bit terse, but totally worth it. With lines that snake out like that, I would be like them, too. This is good (&cheap!) food, folks. Come and get it. Maybe not everyday. I don't know how it tastes while drunk, but it sure as hell tastes orgasmic while sober.
