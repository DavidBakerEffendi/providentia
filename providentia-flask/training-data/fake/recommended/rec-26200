Get in, Get out kind of spot. Figure out what you want before walking inside (daily menu is posted outside) or follow them on Facebook. They are great at handling long lines and will still accommodate a tasting of whatever soups you request. I like the new points card. The price went up a little bit but it's still a great deal. I've been coming here for about three years and I have yet to be disappointed in any of the soups. The complimentary apple, on the other hand... questionable. But still pretty cool.
