This is a Very Perfectly Pl., Italian restaurant in West Village is surrounded by windows which were open with fresh air and we ate alfresco! The Chianti is a must.  appetizers : fresh calamari and a mushroom dish were both delicious.  Spinach gnocchi, fish of the day, latte and espresso with tiramisu and creme brûlée all excellent!! Staff actually rearranged us to sit outside once there was more room- it is a busy place but very intimate at the same time.
