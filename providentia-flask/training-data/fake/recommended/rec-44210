My husband and I went here for lunch while in the area. I got an avocado sandwich and he got the special which was a vegetable tart. The sandwich was fine, nothing to write home about but the bread was quite good. His tart was very good we both loved it. I had also ordered a pot of tea and the waitress didn't bring it. So when we got our food I asked her again and she said "oh sure".....and didn't bring it still. I do want to add it was not busy at all. We were her only table until a group of girls came in who must have been her friends because she was talking to them for a while. Although the food was good it took forever to come out and after we were done we couldn't find our waitress and had to have someone get her for the bill....and then the tea was on the bill and she took 5 minutes to take it off. It was a little crazy considering like I said they really weren't busy. If they were I'd have been totally sympathetic. I'm not in Burlington much but I doubt I'll come back here when I am in the area. I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because I got the bread pudding in the way out and it was absolutely delicious. I really hate when bad customer service ruins what could have been a nice dining experience. It took up way too much of our time.
