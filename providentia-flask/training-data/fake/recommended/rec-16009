Went her with a girlfriend on a Thursday night around 8pm. Expected to be waiting awhile considering we didn't make a reservation, however, they promtly seated us in the back dining area of the restaurant. The decor wasn't all that special, but wow the food was! We started with a few glasses of wine the waiter recommended, he was so friendly and helpful! We then order 4 appitizers to share including, seared ahi tuna with eggplant, potatoe pierogi's, shrimp scampi and quick saute zuchinni. Everything was delicious, the prices were super reasonable and the ambiance was also very nice! I highly recommend this spot!!! Also, extremely friendly staff which is always a plus!
