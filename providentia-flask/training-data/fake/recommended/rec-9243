To me this is one of the best restaurants I've eaten at in NY, and certainly my favorite tapas place.  Yes, it's pricey, but wouldn't you pay good money for some of the best food around town? We literally had almost everything on the menu.  My favorite was the staple of tapas, cheese croquetas.  Whatever they do, this is the BEST thing ever:  bite into the crispy crust and melted cheese will ooze into your mouth.  I've had a lot of croquetas before, but this is by far the best one. I don't even know what to recommend because everything we had was top notch:   patatas bravas, chorizo, txipirones en su tinta, brandada, lamb skewers...try it all!
