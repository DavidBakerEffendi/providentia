Best sangria ever the food is amazing I love this place the service is great plan ahead and make reservations.  The flamenco show is awesome tho the guitarist is kind of freaky but he can play is A$$ off.  The food is amazing except the squid on its own ink that's just not for me but everything else is great.  GO!!!!!!
