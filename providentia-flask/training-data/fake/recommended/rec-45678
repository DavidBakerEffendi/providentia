Definetly my go to place for authentic Mexican food in the Hudson county area. They deliver, but I recommend eating in instead because the food gets a little soggy in the containers. I've pretty much had every taco here from the tripe, to the roast pork, but my favorite is the beef tongue taco. The meat is flavorful and melts in your mouth. The gorditas are also solid, and the tortas are huge and filling. For the price i definitely would recommend coming here, instead of going to the usual chains that are more tex-mex than authentic Mexican
