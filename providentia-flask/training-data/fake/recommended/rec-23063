Visited the Tick Tock Diner today and was greatly disappointed.  My family waited 30 min for 4 shakes and when they came they were as thin as juice.  Once the food arrived the disappointment continued.   Although my kids said nothing negative about their french toast and chicken fingers, my wife and I had nothing positive to say.  She ordered the falafel burger.  This dried out brick with Mediterranean flavor was only out dried by the bun it was on.  It was like a desert on a plate.  I ordered the diablo burger, it was supposed to have blackened spices and a fried egg on top.  I love burgers with eggs, especially when I bite into the yolk and it starts to run down my hand, delicious..... not in this case.  My eggs were fried to the point where the yolk was crumbly and their idea of blackened seasoning was some tabasco sauce on my bun.  Now the Disco fries, having many memories of these late night alcohol fueled snacks I can say these were horrible.  Mushy fries, partially congealed gravy, and cheese that was melted at one point but now in a solid mass. Overall our server was nice and attentive but that shouldn't be the highlight of a meal.  We can now say we went to the Tick Tock and we can also say we will not return.
