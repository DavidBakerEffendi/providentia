This place is a one-man operation from start to finish, but it's a great value for money and the sushi chef is so friendly and sincere. My husband and I swing by here whenever we are in town and I look forward to the clean and quiet atmosphere. We never feel rushed to leave and we often sit there to chat and sip our unlimited tea! :) The weekday lunch deal is amazing -- 3 rolls (18 pieces) + miso soup for $9.99. I only wished he delivered as well!
