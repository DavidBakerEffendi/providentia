This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the city - SO GOOD. I usually go for the standard Pad Thai or Pad Se-Ew w/ tofu, with the papaya salad to start (it's a little spicy). If you're looking for a soup, the Kwaytiew Neur is delicious. Always great service, and I haven't had trouble getting in, though it's a tiny place. They take reservations, so we usually call ahead just in case. I love the decor, pretty bowls cover one wall, and there are a few "nudies" around to keep in line with the theme. Can't wait for my next trip!
