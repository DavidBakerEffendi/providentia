We had A LOT of people tell us that we needed to try the Halal Cart.  And not just any halal cart mind you--as there are MANY sprinkled up and down Manhattan. But we needed to go to this very particular cart on the corner of 53rd Street and 6th Avenue. I walked up to the cart and asked the somewhat grumbling guy what he suggested for me to have. "You like lamb?" he asked. "YES!" I answered. "I make you lamb and chicken combo." he grumbled. After a series of a few more questions (sauce-no sauce, spicy--no spicy), he handed me over a surprisingly heavy plate in a bright yellow bag. I forked over my 6 bucks and we were on our way. It smelled divine. Back in the comforts of my brother's place, I ripped open the bagged and lifted the cover to discover the most amazing aromas and pile of goodness. Forget the forks we needed spoons to shovel in this goodness!!! Juicy and flavorful chopped lamb mixed with the wonderful sauces--what is that white sauce anyway?! Who cares, it was amazing! The hot sauce was SPICY but I loved it. The chicken was also VERY tasty but I was all about the lamb. All paired with seasoned rice and the softest pita I've ever had. HOLY MOLY--was this goodness really only $6!!! It was as heavy as a newborn baby! Easily a meal for 2. Delicious, cheap, filling--I'm ALL over it! Long lines at the Cart are supposedly quite the norm but lucky for us...we had none :) Believe the hype folks....it really is THAT good.  P.S. They're open until 4am...how amazing is that?!
