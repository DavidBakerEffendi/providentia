I came here at 6:30 on Friday night and we had to wait over an hour.  They let you put your name and number down and they call you when your table is ready.  We went and grabbed a drink at City Lobster across the street to kill the time. Once we finally were seated, and yes they squeezed 3 of us at a 2 top...we ordered up some food and sake.  The atmosphere is fun, it's bumping, lots of people in a small space, typical New York dining experience.   We ordered a bunch of stuff - here's what I found memorable: 1) Duck skewers (these were my favorite, they tasted like pork belly, maybe they were!) 2) Fried chicken - delicious, covered in scallions and onions so don't order if you're on a first date 3) Black sesame ice cream (this was different and I really enjoyed it the unique taste of sesame mixed with sweet ice cream The best part is for 3 people to generously eat and drink it was only $70.00! If you plan to go, the waiter did say that earlier in the week the wait is minimal.
