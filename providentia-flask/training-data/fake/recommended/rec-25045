There is NOT a single item on the menu that is NOT yummy, and FRESH!!!  Cafe La Maude, I crave, like get up in the middle of the night and wishing I had a Del Mason Salad, to take a spoonful of in the fridge,  this salad, omg! ever friggin bite is PERFECT!  and its always perfect, always!  There has never been a time that I thought, wow, its not as good as usual.  Each ingredient in the salad is perfect, the dressing is always perfect,  every time I get this salad it is always the same perfect bite.  OMG I want one now!  The only sad part about it is that when I call for a take-out even though I can never finish the entire salad at 1 sitting, and its way more then enough to fill me and another person,  I can NEVER just order the salad, I have to order that chickin Rosti sandwich too!!!  Im like  a crak-addict for cafe la maude, I can never ever get enough,  I love their food and I love love love love the cute little dogs too  =)  BTW it should get 100 stars!!!
