Pleasant experience Had a groupon, nice way to discover the place for the 1st time. Waiter was very nice, helpful, attentive. Food is good. Simple with a twist. We shared the fried calamari, the sauce is excellent, much better than a regular tomato sauce. Very flavorful. We tried the Steak frites - delicious. The fries are cooked in truffled oil. We also had linguini with duck. Very nice We shared one dessert. Chocolate cake. Nice too. Not necessarily a big fan of a marshmallow on top but we could survive! It may be better to make a reservation. We arrived at 6.30pm on a Friday (with reservation), and were seated right away, but the place filled within 30 mns.
