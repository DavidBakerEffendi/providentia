I went to Umami burger with a friend when they were offering $5 burgers for their 5th anniversary. The wait was about half an hour so not too terrible. The staff were very friendly and attentive the whole time. We started with some sweet potato fries which came out in under 10 minutes, possibly under 5. They were pretty good and I really enjoyed the 4 dipping sauces on them. I went with the original and it was delicious. I ordered it medium rare and it came cooked properly and dripping with juice as I bit in. Â I'm not a mushroom fan and luckily it only had one small mushroom which was nicely cooked. The burger was a bit on the small side and I could have probably eaten another. I didn't add anything to it and ate it the way it came, if it was a little larger or less expensive it would be one of my top choices. Beers are a little expensive as well at $8 for a pint. I'll definitely be back but not for a while, spending $12 on a burger that doesn't fill me up and felling bad about getting more than one beer at $8 will keep me away.
