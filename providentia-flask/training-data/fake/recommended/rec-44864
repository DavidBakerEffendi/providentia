Had the best time exploring and dining here. I forget which restaurant inside we went to but they had the golden ovens for the pizzas! We sat at the bar and the cooks and waiters were so engaging and complimentary. We even snapped photos with them before we left. The pizza and the pasta with lamb is what we got and LOVED IT!!! Then got fancy (and yes, expensive) ingredients on our way out to make at home on our way out which turned out delicious. Also got the gelato and an expresso to go with the liquor shot on the way out. Caramel gelato is the way to go! Enjoy!
