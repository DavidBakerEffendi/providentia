I am going to give this place 2 stars for the food however the atmosphere is definitely a 5 if you enjoy a romantic rustic type place. My boyfriend and I ate here for dinner and we weren't overly impressed with the food. It was good, but nothing spectacular and the prices for what you get are really high. We definitely won't be having dinner here again but would go here for drinks at the bar.
