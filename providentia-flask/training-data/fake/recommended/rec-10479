A bit disappointed....the waffles were pretty ordinary.  Not very light and actually kind of hard.  Not much to choose from for breakfast, just omelettes or waffles, no sides like bacon etc to accompany the waffle.  Was hoping they had a croque madame or monsieur for breakfast but apparently those are only on the lunch menu. Restaurant itself is very quaint and homey.
