Guacamole table side is a must. Awesome mojitos - although the glass size had gotten smaller the last time I went. Margaritas are made with fresh mix, very good. Their food is great - the lobster tostada is amazing, fish tacos are bangin, and enchalada plate is good. GET THE CHURROS for dessert. Â Just do it.
