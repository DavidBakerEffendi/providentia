Like many others have said, this is a great addition to Brooklyn BBQ scene.  Brisket was excellent.  I loved the baby back ribs, but I usually like them a bit more chewy. Others in my party thought they were a little dry.  Excellent cornbread, but other sides need work.  Beans were far too saucy, Mac n cheese was far too cheesy. Cole slaw was fair.  This will be my regular BBQ place, but next time I'll skip the sides and just get cornbread.  I look forward to trying other meats next time I go. Decor is great for BBQ joint.  Low key and simple. Not flashy like some places in Manhattan.
