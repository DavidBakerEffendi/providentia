After seeing the HUGE line in this cart for years and years, me and my friend decided to tough it up and see what all the fuzz is about. After meeting some nice people in the line and learning it has over 1500 reviews on Yelp, I couldn't wait to get my hands on the deliciousness that is this Halal cart. I tried both the gyro lamb sandwich (which is my favorite) and their claim to fame, the combo-rice plate, and my tummy was wildly satisfied. In conclusion, if you are going to eat off a cart, get the best.
