I live for this place, the pasta is always so damn good, the 2$ pizza is a ridiculously good deal- & somehow its my favorite pizza in brooklyn. The only thing is dislike about this place is the lack of shade on hot summer days & the over-use of chili pepper flakes or spicy-ness... and the sweet baked goods are kinda not amazing. Stick with the pasta, the kale salad, the flatbreads/pizza or the meatball sandwich and you're good.
