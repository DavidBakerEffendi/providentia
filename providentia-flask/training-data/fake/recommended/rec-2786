No sure why ppl gave this such a high review. They are decent but not great. Food is not bad, much less oily than Edison one. Also the service is much better, friendly. Noodle are just like the noodle you can buy in Chinese supermarket in plainsboro. The wonton is def good and so are the dumplings (both traditional and soup dumplings). Â All and all, they're ok. It will crunch your need for dumplings... Ohhh flushing why have you spoil me!!!!!!!!!!
