My wife and I saw a review shortly after The Gorbals opened. Bacon wrapped matzoh balls?! Whole pig's head!! We made the pilgrimage to Brooklyn. It was too cold to stay on the rooftop bar, looking forward to next time. The environment in the restaurant was inviting and comfortable. Our server, Dominic, was incredible, which turned out to be important since the menu was "unique". (Which was the reason we came) The drink menu needed to be explained/explored, everything sounded so good. The four of us all tried something different (x2). Great start to the evening. We then basically wanted everything on the menu (way too much but we couldn't decide). Dom helped us pare down our choices a little then offered smaller portions of a couple items. So we ended up with "nearly" everything instead. The bacon wrapped matzoh was excellent, as were the Shiite peppers. We all agreed that the flash fried broccoli was the best broccoli that we have ever had. We passed on the pig's head and had the braised lamb neck - just the sweetest meat that melted in your mouth. I usually pass on beef tongue, but I had to try it after everyone else rolled their eyes back after one bite, it was incredible. I won't try to be the foodie, describing and commenting on all the nuance of each dish. I will sum it up as a great meal! Fortunately, there were only four desserts to choose from, we ordered one each and passed them around. I can't imagine eating here frequently (we live in Ohio), but we will be returning next visit to NYC. Looking forward to a menu of new delights.
