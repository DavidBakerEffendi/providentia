My foodie date and I attended the Sunday Prix Fixe in mid January. I must tell you.. it was a fantastic evening that could not have been half as wonderful without this incredible experience!! We were treated to five memorable courses in the small but comfortable dining area lit for romance and conversation. We even had the opportunity to speak to a new chef on her first night.. she was clearly tired and they obviously worked her(in a good way!). Bring your wine and your appetite. We'd have paid twice as much as we did for this!
