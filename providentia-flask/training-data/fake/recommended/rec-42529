I celebrated my anniversary here on a Saturday afternoon and they couldn't have been more attentive! We were looking for dynamic food and an upbeat, stylish ambiance -- our expectations were totally surpassed. They opened our meal with complimentary tuna ceviche and a chile spiced margarita and closed the meal with a decadent pan dulce complete with sparkler (a la James Bond) to ring in our anniversary! The meal itself was no less fantastic, w/ savory twists on classics, fastidious service, and great ambiance; they even left the tables around us unseated as long as they could to give us a nook in which to have a romantic brunch. Great meal, even better than it's sister restaurant Yerba Buena Perry. We'll certainly be returning to this location soon :-) Extra note from the guys perspective - I wanted to do something fun and not too pricey for Brunch and this worked out perfectly. The sparkler desert felt reminisce of VIP bottle service and the help made me feel like I had previous existing connections. If you have a special occasion coming up, definitely call ahead and let them know.
