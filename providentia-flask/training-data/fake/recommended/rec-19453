I had lunch there with my mom and her friend yesterday, I am not a big fan of soup noodles (unless its pho) but her friend talked me into it saying that the noodles were different from the other noodle spots. I ordered the lamb noodle soup, which was delicious! My mom and her friend had some kind of shredded pork with the same noodles but w/o the soup. Theirs actually looked better than mines, whatever. While eating the noodles you can tell they are hand-drawn because they're not all even like regular noodles. The place is small, my mom told me because it is small in there and the spot is known for the hand-drawn noodles that it gets pretty busy as well. I did not get the pleasure of watching the chef draw the noodles at the end, but you can go to the back of the restaurant after ordering and watch him hand-draw your meal! I will definitely tell my friends about this place, and the fact that the noodles are hand-drawn makes it more of an excitement to experience the art of these dishes.
