I lived a couple blocks away from this food cart for 6 months and visited it many a time both after the bars close down and the next morning to combat the hangover. The white sauce is amazing, kind of like what I imagine doing crack or heroin to be like. While I haven't done either of those things, I have partaken in this savory white nectar, dousing it all over my combo platter. 1 spicy sauce packet will do, 2 is for the daring. This food does not always come back out with the same ease in which it enters you. If you know what I mean. I mean sometimes it gave me the shits. I usually get extra pita, for a dollar. Go big or go home I say.
