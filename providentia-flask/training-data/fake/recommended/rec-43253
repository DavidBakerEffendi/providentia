The line to order moved fairly quickly and     the person taking orders was attentive,helpful and friendly. We ordered the Barbacoa beef burrito and pork and chicken tortas they all had great flavor and we were very pleased. However portions are an average portion not to be compared to a like of a home wrecker burrito.
