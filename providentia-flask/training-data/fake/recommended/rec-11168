I was willing ot give Vietnam a try, but after seeing the few choices of vegetarian dishes on the menu, I wish I would have gone elsewhere... Nevertheless, what I got was delicious - Tofu Rolls appetizer, Tofu Vermicelli Bowl and Chinese Brocolli, and Coconut Ice Cream for dessert. The restaurant was clean, and the service was quick and efficient - although, I felt the prices were a bit expensive... My firends love this place, but I think I'd pass on it next time - Vietnam Palace across the street has more vegetarian options, I hear...
