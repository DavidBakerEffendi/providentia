I don't want you to know how great this spot is because I don't want to be on a waiting list to get in here... But I will put my name down if you make me. I think I have had everything on the menu and it's all tasty and amazing.  Like Short Rib?  Okay, it's the best in town.   ...also let me add, the music here... sound track to my life?  Hell Yes.
