Believe the hype!  Despite having to wait an hour for a table, this dinner was completely worth it.  (Admittedly, the wait for the table was tempered by the dessert goodness next door at Milk Bar.)   Despite the lack of vegetarian options, everything we had was bowl-licking goodness, and I will never look at brussel sprouts the same way again!
