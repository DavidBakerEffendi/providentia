Went here a couple of months ago on the whim since we were in Jersey and this place got some decent reviews on yelp. We had the Surf & Turf (lobster & Filet Mignon) on a hot stone and the grilled red snapper. Red snapper was ok... slightly overcooked but not bad. The surf and turf were both marinaded well. The biggest disappointment here was the service. We were running a bit short on time and we had to wait a few minutes for a table but there were plenty of open seating. The service up front while ordering was adequate, but we actually had to ask for help from a couple of local customers who were the ones that recommended the surf & turf and told us how to use the hot stone. The waiter seamed to have disappeared... We skipped dessert and asked for our check, 3 times. Not a great way to leave a lasting impression.
