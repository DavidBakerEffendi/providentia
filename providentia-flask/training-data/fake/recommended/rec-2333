This place offers up some amazing eats! My bf really wanted to try this place, I think because he saw it featured on Man vs. Food.  Went here on a Saturday so the line was long, about 25 minutes After a group of people left because they didn't want to wait and it was totally worth it. In fact, the couple behind me got into a huge blowout because all he wanted was a roast pork after being dragged around doing what she wanted all day. She was about to walk away but he didn't care, he wanted his roast pork.   Any sandwich which threatens a relationship must be a serious deal.   Ordered a roast pork sandwich with sharp provolone and roasted peppers.  The sandwich was nice and juicy, the peppers were amazing, they seemed to be seasoned and the cheese was a great touch. I would go there as early as you can, we got there around 2:15 and the owner came out to the line and told people he only had a little more meat to go and then he would be closing early.  That got a huge groan from the crowd.   I think this is going to be a special tradition for the future, go to the market and get a roast pork. OH, everything I read says they don't accept credit cards, but they do.  Discover, MC and Visa.
