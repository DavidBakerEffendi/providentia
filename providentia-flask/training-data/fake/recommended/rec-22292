The food is amazing. Cheese, wine list, and the most delicious cheeseburger I can remember! We had a wonderful time in an underground room next to the cheese cooler. It felt like a brewery restaurant in Prague. The server was intensely into the locavore nature of the restaurant and genuinely proud of the bake shop. We met another couple there and everyone enjoyed everything they ate and drank. The mushroom tart was beyond amazing. The only reason I am not giving them five stars is that the host (manager?) came up after we were done and informed us that they have a two hour and fifteen minute limit per table and we had exceeded that and the next reservation was waiting to be seated. Now I have no issue with a restaurant with a time limit. I don't love it, but I get it. But the time to tell the customer is either when you make the reservation, when you are seated or print it on the menu. Don't come up to us as we are winding down our meal and tell us we having overstayed our welcome in a tone that implies we should have known when to leave.
