I love Pates Et Traditions. I've come here twice & both times were quite pleasant. We ordered the Provencale Plate both times.  I love olives & the tapenade is delicious.  Everything on this plate is yummy.  I don't even need the toast it comes with because I like putting everything on the socca. The staff is awesome.  They are friendly, polite & they know their wine.  :)  We were a little full after Provencale Plate, so we asked if they could take their time with our entrees & the did.   I ordered the beef stew special with fettuccini & my boyfriend ordered the fettuccini Provencale.  The portions were pretty huge.  Both dishes were tasty.  I have no complaints.  I ordered the spinach ravioli the first time & it was a little over cooked. I loved the La Banane Flambee.
