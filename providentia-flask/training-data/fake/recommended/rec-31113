I am a huge fan of Fiorino.  Have been three times and each visit is 'the best'!  First, the food always is amazing.  I still remember the Branzino-deliciousness that I enjoyed on December 23rd!  Other entrees enjoyed have been the gorgonzola gnocchi (little fluffy pillows) and the spaghetti scoglio (amazing seafood medley with pasta!).  What is equally memorable of each visit is the warmth of the atmosphere.  This is a small neighborhood byob restaurant in East Falls but we might just as well be at some small corner trattoria, in some piazza, somewhere in Italy...Romagna perhaps??  Each of the three times, owner/chef Franco has come to our table to check on us and how is dinner and seemingly how everything is in general.  He is genuine and seems to have a passion for the food and the restaurant and for the customers.  The service was great.  I love the special touches... the delicious bruschetta on arrival... and the lemoncello that was delivered at the end of the meal.  I recommend this restaurant to others highly.
