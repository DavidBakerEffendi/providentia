I've been traveling to New York once a year and the first time I ventured out on my own, I was determined to try some authentic NYC pizza. I did my research and decided on Lombardis. It was walking distance from where I'd be and it's Americas first Pizzaria. Can't argue with that. I went in by myself and ordered the tomato and mozzarella with basil. Let me just say, it was everything I was hoping it would be. The crust was thin and super crispy. It had that slight oven char on the bottom, which I love. The cheese was delicious. Nice and stretchy. The tomatos were so fresh and they were still juicy even though they were just cooked in a very hot oven. The basil added that perfect bright herby flavor and complemented everything wonderfuly. The best thing about their pizza is their sauce. The tomato sauce was absolutley perfect. It was savory and acidic. Thats the way tomato sauce should always be. Some places like to put too much sugar in their tomato sauce and I hate that. Lombardis makes their sauce EXACTLY how I like it. The great thing about this place is that you really can taste the freshness of all their ingredients. It's like they get fresh batches of everything every day. I wouldn't be surprised if they do, I mean it's New York. Another great thing about their pizza is their super crispy crust. It provides a real variation of texture with the other soft ingredients. Lombardis Pizza is the best pizza I have had so far, but I'm always on the look out for something better. Oh, and if you come to visit Lombardis, don't forget cash, as it is a CASH ONLY establishment. They do have an ATM inside, but you'll be charged that annoying fee.
