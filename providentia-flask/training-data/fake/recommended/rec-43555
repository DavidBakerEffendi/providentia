First time dining this past wkd and easily a favorite spot to revisit soon. Service was excellent, waitstaff super friendly, quick and accommodating even with a large group in a crowded house. Food quality delicious, even got an extra fav dish of the night on the house after a lil greet from the manager. Highly recommend this spot.
