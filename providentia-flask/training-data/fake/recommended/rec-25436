We don't go out to breakfast as often as I'd like, but when we do, there's a pretty decent chance we'll visit one of the two OHP outposts in the area. While I prefer the more spacious (read "shorter wait") Whippany location, this review is of the West Caldwell location. So the wait for a table...ah yes, the wait. Unless you go at the crack of dawn (7-8 AM), you will wait and be herded like a zoo animal into the waiting area (there is coffee in the waiting area). Today, we waited 30 minutes at 11 AM. Then again, they told us 30 minutes and there was the promise of a delicious brunch. Food is consistently good. Highlights are the seasonal pancakes (blueberry, pumpkin, etc.), swedish pancakes, ginormous omlettes, and fresh-squeezed OJ. I'm not one for the "Dutch Baby," but many people like it. The giant apple pancake is a delicious gooey treat and a good dish to share. The bacon is thick-cut and amazing; ask for it crispy. You may want to do a double order. Did I mention that they have great bacon? Service is generally good and you aren't rushed out the door. Be prepared to wait, but know that a great breakfast is shortly to come you way...
