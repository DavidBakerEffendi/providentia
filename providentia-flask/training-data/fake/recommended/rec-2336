Shame on me for being sucked into this tourist trap, filled with right-wing paraphanilia no less.  I'd heard mixed reviews about this place, and this was our last stop before catching our flight home.  I decided to do whiz wit this time around after learning the hard way and ordering provolone at another cheesesteak joint. First off, CASH ONLY. Second, these things are a whopping $8 apiece. Whoa.  The bread was really hard, almost reminiscent of pretzel bread or sourdough. Not what I was expecting. Plus, the meat was different. Not chopped up steak, but I believe this was ribeye meat. Definitely a first for me on a cheesesteak.  The onions weren't cooked either, boo! All in all, not very satisfying nor did it come close to living up to the hype. I've had better tasting in Denver! Really!
