This gets 3 stars & I'll tell you why. This is a tourist trap which is good for business and they turn out plates like fast food. Being a local NY'er I appreciate good Italian and know good Italian and this is so/so, average at best. The only thing they're good at here is the pastas and the HUGE wine list which I'm a fan of. Pasta is above average but that's not going to get anymore stars from me. Besides the pasta & wine thats all they have. Side dishes are buffet style & uninspiring. Service is great though very attentive and friendly. But I like food and this place just doesn't have it for me. Would I return the answer is no. Its an okay place. If you're from out of town you might love it. If you're a local look elsewhere.
