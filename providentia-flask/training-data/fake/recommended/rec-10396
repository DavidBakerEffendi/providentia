I don't know if this 5 star review is entirely fair since I'm basing it on a strange circumstance. I started conversation with some people that turned out to be friends of the owner. We laughed our asses off and the owner gave me free guiness!!! Clearly an old school bar (apparently the second oldest bar in manhattan) and there's not a whole lot to do. The music was above average but most importantly the owner and the bartender were cool as hell.
