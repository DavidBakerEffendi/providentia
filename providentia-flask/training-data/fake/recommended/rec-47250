Went for lunch and truffle mac n cheese was undercooked and without flavor - took one bite and sent it back. the mushroom turkey burger as unimpressive - especially with the store bought english muffn they used as bread. the rave reviews are apparently by those who have no clue what good tasting and qualitative ingredients are.
