Two words- Happy Hour! I get this amazing steak sandwich and spicy fried lobster. Â Drinks are unique and delicious. All the specials are very reasonable in cost. Word of warning the bar does get packed. Either come early or late to get a good spot. I've never had dinner, but hope to someday for a special occasion.
