The pulled pork sandwich with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe! It was the only thing recommended to us and the only thing we tried. I was a little hesitant about getting pulled pork because I'm not into BBQ sauce, but then I saw someone else get the sandwich and it was just pure pulled pork with no sauce. The sharp provolone and rabe was a great accompaniment. My boyfriend thought the cheese should have been melted, but I didn't mind the sharpness of the cheese slices. I thought it cut the fatty flavor of the meat perfectly. If you had to pick between this and the cheesesteak, definitely go for this!
