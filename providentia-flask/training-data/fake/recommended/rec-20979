Brunch is the best value imaginable. $27 for all you can drink brunch for 1.5 hours. Top shelf cocktails menu with scrumptious appetizers. Staff was friendly and responsive. After going to Fonda in the East Village over the weekend and having a great time, I heard Fonda is opening a location in West Chelsea, closer to me. I can't wait! I'll be there all the time.
