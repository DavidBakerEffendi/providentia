This place runs like many a BBQ joint - pop in line (bring a fully charged phone or a friend for the wait), order your meat by the 1/2 pound or a sandwich, move on to the next gent for your sides and desserts, and head to the bar to get your drinks. Or vice versa, it's a good line for a beer. Or two. Holy cow (or in this case pig...) it was just yummy. I overheard someone who was already eating while I was in line and they said they loved their pulled pork so I went with it. Super tender and juicy, I didn't want to leave any of it behind. Â For sides I went for mac 'n cheese and the BBQ beans. Didn't care for the beans, but I LOVED the mac and would just do a larger side of that next time. I did get dessert - the banana pudding - which is the second best banana pudding I've had (next to mama's of course). I will absolutely be back here again.
