I went to Hapgood's for brunch with my boyfriend and we were not impressed which made it more disappointing after reading all the great reviews. The decor is awesome and the outdoor seating was great but in general we were not overly thrilled with the food or the service. We had the Kitchen Sink, chicken and waffles, and the confetti fries. The kitchen sink was really good but the rest was just average. We probably wouldn't get any of those three things a second time. Our waitress was awful. Rude, not attentive, or helpful at all. We asked her for a food recommendation and she wouldn't give us one. Who does that?! We're gonna try this place again purely because everyone else gave it such high reviews but our first impression was not good.
