Ohhh I can't say enough good things about this cute little brunch place!! The staff are adorable and friendly, the food is mouth-watering amazing, and the ambiance makes you feel as though you're dining at a friend's place. Who is french. And fashionable. I'll def be enjoying crepes both savory and sweet here all summer long.
