This place is great. Yes, it doesn't offer much of a dine-in experience seeing as how you order at the front, get your own drinks / silverware / chopsticks, but the food is AWESOME. And did I mention it's incredibly cheap and fresh for sushi in Vermont? I tried San Sai and Asiana but Sushido definitely topped them with quality of fish AND pricing. Seriously, I ate two nigiri style sushi (that would typically be ~3-4 dollars a piece anywhere else), one rainbow roll (which I was paying 13 dollars for at my usual sushi restaurant), and a spicy salmon avocado (paying 7 dollars at usual spot). Well my check only came out to be 18 dollars. I was amazed. I used to come here before I enjoyed sushi for their kitchen dishes, which are equally delicious. They also have a rack and fridge filled with Japanese brand snacks and drinks. Heaven for me! If you don't mind the lack of having a server, definitely give this place a try.
