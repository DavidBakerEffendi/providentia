We came here on a Saturday night for my dad's birthday dinner. The service was so impeccable that it was like you were afraid to drop a crumb! It has a very old school, classy feel which is rare to find in Iselin/Edison... especially since the dress code is casual. Good food (one of the better Italian places I've been to in the area) at really nice prices. My lobster ravioli was the table favorite, as I wound up only getting to taste a few pieces since everyone just HAD to try one... The recession special is wonderful. The children ordered "half portions" of pasta dishes, so the bill did not wind up being too high. Good dessert menu, even though we chose the cheesecake for my dad.
