Very impressed. I had a few hours to kill near the Trenton airport. Tried this place and dined solo in the formal dining part. Service was polite and prompt. They were just as courteous to a single gal as to a large party. I ordered a Veal dish served over gnocchi- amazing! The gnocchi are homemade and soft. The sauce had such good flavor. The veal was ok but the rest of the dish was so good I'd consider flying back to Trenton for it. It's. BYOB and there is conveniently a liquor store in the same complex.
