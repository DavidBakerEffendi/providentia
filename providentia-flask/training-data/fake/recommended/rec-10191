We were 6th in line. Yes! Lamb and rice with white sauce and a LITTLE bit of hot sauce, please. We sat down at the seats nearby and dug into our 'rice box'. Â No sharing here, baby! OMG! This hot sauce is HOT!!! Good thing, I ordered a soda with my order. Mmmmm...haven't had 'street meat' in a while. The lamb and rice really did hit the spot. Nice!
