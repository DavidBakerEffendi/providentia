Excellent seafood, simply prepared and cooked to perfection. Great selection of fresh oysters. Specials were delicious. They also take reservations now.  It is BYOB and during the warmer months you can sit outside near the sidewalk and get the flavor of Nassau Street on a busy night.  They are pretty kid friendly as well.
