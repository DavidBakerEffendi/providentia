This place was aight. Can't believe I'd yet to visit, but hey, Vichet's a busy man, no? I may be totally off, here, but I got the sense they were going for a biker bar feel, which is cool. Although, there were no bikers to be found. Not quite as cool. Either way, they had a DJ spinning actual vinyl. That gave the place points. The selection last night was all Victory beers, which I think may have had something to do with beer week. Other than that, you get quick friendly service, fun people having a good time while getting sloppy, and me and my friend discussing the various personality defects we've discovered about ourselves in the 6 years that we hadn't seen each other. I'll be back for food or a show, and then perhaps bump this place up to 4 stars. Check it out!
