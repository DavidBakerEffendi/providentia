I ate here a couple of times but mostly I order lunch, either way the service is always good. I've had the crazy tuna roll, spicy shrimp roll(my favorite), shrimp avocado roll, Boston roll, and a bunch of other ones I can't remember. Everything is always really fresh and awesome! I really hope one day they get a liqueur license though.
