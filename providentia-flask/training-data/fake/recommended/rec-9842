This restaurant NEVER fails me :). The best baked chicken you've ever ate! It's a must try and what I love about it, It's not expensive :). The meal can serve up to 3-4 people and if it's a date, you can take the rest home with you. The sangria, omg.. what can I say... With four glass of sangria I am tipsy. The sangria doesn't taste strong so it does fool you. Me and my husband love eating here and we go home with happy tummies :). Excellent for dates, birthdays or any occasion. Beautiful interior and excellent service.
