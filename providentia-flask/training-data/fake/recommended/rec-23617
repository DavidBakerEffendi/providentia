Had about 20 different people tell me to check this place out before I got to head there for a friends Birthday!  The place lived up to the hype.  Was there on a Saturday afternoon in the Summer.  Beautifiul weather helped with the open aired atmosphere.  The hostess/coordinator was extremely helpful and attentive when we got there.  Our first order of business was food.  At this place you order at the counter then they run the food out to you.  Always love that arrangement.  You can go to the bar and get drinks while this is going on.  Out of this world veggie burger.  Shaved lettuce, seeded bun similiar ro BK but soft, really good red sauce. Fries are some of the best and awesome serve yourself dipping sauces: curry ketchup, sweet dijion mustard and spicy mustard.  Great real authentic German beer in huge mugs for $15 or .5L for around $7.  They usually have a american german-style craft on tap too.  Finally go to love the ping pong table, and yes I was the annoying guy playing where the ball would hit your table every 2 minutes.
