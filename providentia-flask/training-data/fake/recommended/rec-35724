I won't drop the names of the tough to pronounce tapas (light meals) at this place, but I will say that it was nothing short of amazing. Myself and my two girlfriends went to this charming spot for restaurant week. I had to Google what Tapas were. I didn't recognize anything on the menu. But I went. Despite the fact that we had reservations, it did take a while to be seated. We finally got our table around 8:00, and our reservation was for 7:30. After ordering Chicken, Cheese, Asparagus, Seabass, and Banana Dessert (totally not the technical names for the dishes.... they were much more decadent.), we had a visit from whom I believe was the manager. He thanked us for our patience and comped our pitcher of Sangria. That eliminated the only negative thing I had to say about the place. The asparagus was a tad salty, but this may be because I traditionally do not add salt to my meals ever. The food was amazing. My tastebuds were doing tumbles, and my belly begged for more. The flourless chocolate cake was truly remarkable. Tinto, I'll be back.
