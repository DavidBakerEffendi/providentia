Just phenomenal!!!   I am a business traveler and I like to go to various Indian restaurants in various cities around the US.  This has to be the best tasting food all around.  I am of Indian origin so I know what the food is suppose to taste like from various parts of India.  I have had sambar and idli in Bangalore to saag paneer in Delhi.   Also, Indian restaurants are known to do one or two dishes well but this place just hit everything out of the park.   I went on a Tuesday night to get a quick bite so I can go back to the hotel and continue working.  To my surprise, it was Chat / Dosa night on Tuesday.  I started with the Idli sambar -- fantastic.  I then went to eat vada sambar - excellent (usually - I would stop here ... have a chai / coffee and leave).  I just couldn't resist that the way pav bhaji smelled...had it and it was great - right consistency.    Then I went to eat pani-puri...the water make the diff.... it was spot on.  Then the warm uttapam came...spot on once again.  The gulab jumun were just the right temp and taste. The filter coffee was excellent.   Needless to say,  I ate way too much and then went back to the hotel and took a nap.   If I am ever back in NJ again...I will go out of my way to eat at Woodlands... The guy (I assume the owner) that was there that night was very kind and good service.    Keep it up guys!
