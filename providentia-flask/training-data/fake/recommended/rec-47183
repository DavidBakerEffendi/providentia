This place is great for brunch. I came here for brunch and dinner. The staff was super friendly both times. The brunch menu was reasonable priced but dinner was kind of expensive. Dinner was quite packed with people standing at the bar waiting for tables. I recommend going early or making reservation. They accept walk-ins. Dinner had a more intimate feel than brunch.
