This is my go to spot. I love eating here. I mean it's good as long as they get your order right. Majority of the servers are kind and actually check up on you. Some are just eh. But overall I love this place. You can never go wrong with a side of pancakes and mozzarella cheese fries. I am a customer you see there often. I order the same thing all the time. I have tried their calamari which is alright, chicken Alfredo fettuccine which gets you so full you can't finish it and the chicken bacon panini. You can never go wrong with that or any panini. This place is a go to if you're ever in Bayonne. Especially if you're drunk or done bowling. Open 24 hours. Can never go wrong.
