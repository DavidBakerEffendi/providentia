The meal I had at Pates et Traditions last night could not have been much better.  The place has the warm feel of someone's country home in the south of France; simple and inviting.  The two people working that night were very friendly.  We ordered la socca as an appetizer; very tasty, nicely seasoned, and hot straight from the oven.  The house chablis was nice. The buckwheat crepes we ordered for our meal were delicious.  I was surprised at how satisfied I was just from a crepe with salad.  Of course, we also had crepes for dessert, and then just leaned back in our chairs with big smiles.  This place is a little gem.
