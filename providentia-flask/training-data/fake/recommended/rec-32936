During my meal I was really looking forward to reviewing this restaurant, I was even planning my next trip.  UNFORTUNATELY I will not be going back to this restaurant.  I got a Restaurant.com certificate and when I presented my phone app to the waitress she said that their policy is to only take the printed out certificate.  Well after contacting Restaurant.com I was told that the restaurants must take the phone app (hence the reason for having the app).  It appears that this restaurant uses Restaurant.com to get people to come in but they do not then accept the certificate.  The poor customer service at Saveur Creole left a bad taste in my mouth.
