Although I like that the sandwiches are bigger than your head and they are certainly delicious, I find this place gets slightly more esteem than it deserves.  It's certainly good but essentially a deli - no more magically than any other I've seen.   I will say I find the people that work there friendly and helpful.  Lunchtime brings a big crowd so be prepared to wait a bit.  The line moves fast and you'll be rewarded with a huge sandwich for a completely reasonable price.  I only wish there was a place to sit after purchasing - even if only a few more tables outside.
