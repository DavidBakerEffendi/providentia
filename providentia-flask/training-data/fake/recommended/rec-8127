I had not had food at Johnny Brenda's for a LONG time. Like, so long that there were fliers up in there for neighborhood meetings so that they could get the upstairs open. In the last month I went for both brunch and dinner and really was impressed. For brunch I had smoked salmon and a bagel, which is hard to mess up but is always one of my faves. I also had no less than 3 bloody marys, and it was a beautiful day and I was seated outside with one of my best girlfriends and they were kind enough to not make us feel rushed out of our seats. Since that experience was so good, I suggested it for a dinner date a few weeks later and was equally impressed. We shared a pear and fennel salad that was really fresh and yummy, then both ordered the trout - I hate ordering the same thing, I really like seeing and tasting multiple dishes, but I really wanted the trout. It was served over peas and potatoes and was all crispy and satisfying. It was also a huge portion - I think it was only $14 - if I wasn't heading somewhere afterward I would have taken it to go. So all of that being said about the food, this is also a great place for drinking. One of my favorite tricks is sneaking out of the Barbary and coming up here for a drink. The upstairs is beautiful and a great place to see a show.
