Came here while visiting Princeton from out of town. Two overworked bartenders for the entire place on a Friday night, while a hostess and a couple of servers milled about doing nothing at the hostess' table. They told us we couldn't sit at one of the dozens of empty tables, though. It took forever to get a drink, and pretty much every patron was rudely and irritatedly jockeying for space at the bar. No thanks. Next time I'm in town I'll go somewhere else.
