The chicken taco was fine, the actual tortilla chips quite good, but the nachos - was that Velveeta cheese!?! Some kind of canned, industrial cheese liquid, and same for the 'sour cream' squirted on. Eww. Added lettuce is always a sign a Mexican spot has no clue, and is too American. Mexicans would NEVER put lettuce on nachos. It was so lame. If you know what real Mexican should taste like at all.
