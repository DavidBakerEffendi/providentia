oh my god the mole.  i need to thank the girl below who said she'd make love to it, because she was my inspiration for ordering it.  and it was the best thing i've put in my mouth all year! we went on a sunday night at 5:30.  don't judge.  we didn't wait for a table but if we had gotten there 20 minutes later we would have. everything else we had was really good:  grapefruit margaritas, guacamole, something with shrimp and spiciness (eh sorry, too many margaritas).
