While you sit outside this cute little corner restaurant, you forget sometimes if you are still in New York or actually in Italy. The inside area is completely open and exposed to fresh air, and there is an overflow of tables and chairs for the perfect outdoor meal. Ah, such a romantic setting. The waiters...are very Italian. And by Italian I mean extremely sexy.  From the dashing hair to the incredibly sexy accent...I guess there's a reason I haven't even begun to mention the quality of the food. Nonetheless!! After asking the waiter a few questions about different items on the menu (not just to listen to his accent of course...) we decided to try the Penne All' Arrabbiata, Ravioli Al Formaggi, and the super recommended Spinach Gnocchi. The Penne was pretty good, traditional tomato sauce taste but nothing amazingly out of the ordinary. It was a nice dish to compliment the other creamier pastas we had ordered though. The Ravioli was my FAVORITE one! Creamy pink tomato sauce and soft cheesy ravioli...simple, but so yummy. I'm not a fan of gorgonzola cheese but the waiter insisted that the Spinach Gnocchi was his favorite dish, so we decided to give it a try. To my surprise, the gorgonzola flavor was not overwhelming like it usually is, and the gnocchi was very chewy. It was pretty good, but after 5 bites it got a little too heavy for me.   Every pasta was topped with my favorite garnish, fresh BASIL. Mmm. I usually rate solely based on taste, but I loved being at this restaurant so much, that I would definitely come back again just for the environment (and to try more items!) 3.5 for taste 4 stars for atmosphere
