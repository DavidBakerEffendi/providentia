What else is left to say? Damn good burger I'd say is a 7/10. Not crazy friendly on the bar front but the food is lightning fast. I liked watching the guy in the kitchen fling out an endless amount of burgers with a very aged and simple oven-like setup. The flavor here really comes from the high quality (bun included) rather than the cooking method. They also cook a perfect rare so points for that.
