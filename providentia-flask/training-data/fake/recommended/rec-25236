Been here twice and had two polarizing experiences. No complaints with food... all dishes were up to snuff and well-executed. Many complaints over the service during my second visit, which was questionable at best and arguably non-existent. Orders weren't all correct first time around, table requests were acknowledged, yet unfilled, and the process of getting our check/paying seemed to last longer than the embargo.
