I don't think some of the other reviewers understand what Portuguese BBQ is. Correction: It's not BBQ, its churrascaria. It's not a big juicy BBQ. It's cooked over very high heat on a wood burning rotisserie. I've been having Portuguese BBQ my whole life, and the Pit gets top marks for being one of the best. Don't expect BBQ sauce, or supermarket rotisserie chicken. It's good, grilled chicken and ribs with rice and fries for around $5 per huge serving. I don't know if any other place around here that serves good Portuguese BBQ. I'm a fan.
