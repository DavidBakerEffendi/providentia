When I want to treat myself to some seriously good food without the hassle of finding a new place, this is my go to spot. The ambiance is great, food is delicious and the service staff is friendly. This place is definitely on the pricier side but you get what you pay for. They have a huge variety of appetizers. So I'd recommend that you order those and share instead of ordering entrees. The service staff will also recommend that to you. 5-6 appetizers between two people should be more than enough. Definitely try their Brussels sprouts and lamb sausage. Took off a point for their cocktails 'cause they're just ok. But the food and dessert are best of the best. You'll certainly want to come back again.
