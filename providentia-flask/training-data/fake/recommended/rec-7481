This is one of my favorite places to go in the city.  Atmosphere is great to just grab a beer and some oysters or have a nice dinner.  Growing up on Cape Cod I can appreciate a quality oyster and Upstate always has a huge selection from places all over North America.  The scallops were cooked perfectly which is very important for all you scallop lovers out there. Chris behind the bar was fun and entertaining to hang out with and Upstate has now become out local hangout.  Have seen a few actors eating there when we go which always adds a little excitement.
