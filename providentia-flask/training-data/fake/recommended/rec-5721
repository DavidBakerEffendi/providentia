$2.50 classic margaritas (strawberry costs $3.50) during happy hour are the bomb dot com! Absolutely delicious and had me dancing in my seat :p Simply put, I'm just not a big fan of the food here. I came here for dinner with family and friends and everyone left food on their plates...not normally atypical but then again no to-go boxes were needed either :/ Meat was just not tender and food was somewhat bland. Service is also hit or miss and the place can get pretty raucous, which is cool for happy hour but not for a nice dinner with parents or a business dinner. This is a happy hour only spot for me.
