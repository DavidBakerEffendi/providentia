Nice, open layout.  Carpet was a bit odd, thought that went the way of the Dodo birds.  I think of carpet as dirty. Food was good, wine tasty and fair price (ha, fair). Server was a bit slow, seemed short staffed?  She had at least 5 tales that I could see, we had to wait for a great at first, but after that it went well until having to wait for deserts. Appetizer and dinner where very good.  Love the French Press coffee.  Deserts where underwhelming. Runner who brought out food was the biggest issue.  There were two of us and he would bring out our appetizer or dinner and "auction" it off.  Mean while, we had dirty plates in front of us and he would just stand there looking at us until we removed our dirty plates.  This should have been done at pre-bussing and they should use seat numbers for serving food instead of "who had the tenderloin!?" barked over the crowd. THE BATHROOM Men's bathroom had a urinal that was by a stall door.  You had to stand in front of the door to use the urinal.  The door would not stay shut!  So I had to keep it shut with my arm while using the urinal.  If someone had been using the stall and opened the door, he would have taken me out.  One more thing, I'm 6' and only had an inch or so to spare to use the urinal.  It would suck to be a short dude, and I'm not even tall...
