I love this place, the shabu shabu with the rib eye is one of those classic dishes that are just simple yet sooo good. Its pretty much a bowl of boiling water that comes with raw rib eye (thinly sliced) and a plate of veggies, noodles, etc. The order comes with 2 dipping sauses which make everything so much better. I think 4 people is the ideal number of people to go with because its a really good meal for conversation. Either way the place is great, they dont however take your res if you arent in person but all in all worth it.
