Coolest dining experience I've ever had!!! I have been telling everyone about this place since I got back home. Sadly, there is no place nearly as cool as this one in Miami (that I know off). Anyway, you walk into the restaurant in a back ally kind of way, it definitely doesn't look like a restaurant from the outside! It reminded me of a house and each room had tables. The tables were all like a couch with a round table in front of you. No utensils- you eat with your hands! Such a cool place for groups of friends or even an intimate date. You can take your own alcohol since they don't serve any there - also cool! They give you pita breads to eat with your food and towels as napkins. Each course comes looking cooler than the last! I absolutely loved my experience at Marrakesh!!
