As cute as this place is, I'm still not convinced it's worth the price. I ate here for the first time over a year ago for our staff Holiday Dinner and then returned last week while house-hunting in the area. the fried oysters were good enough and I had a yellowtail that was nicely grilled, but to shell out $100 in the end for no alcohol, two apps, two entrees and two meh desserts (something grainy in the rhubarb/strawberry tart and the crust was flavorless and weirdly textured) seemed a bit much. Is it cute? yes! Is the server nice? yes! (but did he need to go outside, smoke a cigarette, come back in, serve us our water with cigarette lingering smell on the glasses???). Perhaps pay more attention to reviews of folks who came on Friday nights, BYOBd and ate the right dishes - for now, I'm probably headed somewhere else.
