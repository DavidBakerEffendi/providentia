probably deserves another half star... Positives - overall food was good.   Didn't love my penne arrabiata.  But other 3 dishes were 4 star worthy.  Place is casual and cheap and cute in that crowded bistro sort of way. Negatives - cash only so be prepared, crowded, tight, loud, sucky bathroom, no bar to wait at.   Good for right occasion.
