I'm a huge fan of authentic italian style pizza, and Modern is one of my favorite pizzerias! Absolutely delicious! I like this pizzeria better than Pepe's and Sally's. I actually recommend the simpler Margherita pizza, it's what they are best at. If you find yourself in New Haven, this is a must have!
