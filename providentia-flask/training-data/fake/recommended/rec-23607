This was our first visit and definately not our last! This place is super cozy and romantic. The menu is focused on beef and there were a few specials. The shrimp caeser was perfect to split and the cheese plate had great variety. I had the duck and it was a little overcooked but delicious. My husband had the ny strip with mushroom sauce and bleu cheese. The owner was very nice and knew alot about wine and food pairings. This restaurant is a hidden gem and we are looking forward to hanging at the bar next time.
