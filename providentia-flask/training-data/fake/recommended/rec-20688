I visited New York for about a week in February. In a span of 4 days, I went here twice. Think if shabu and ramen made love and created a mega-awesome, and healthier, child. I got the dip both times, which means noodles served on the side and a thick dipping broth with some kind of fuel burning under it to keep it warm. Once you are out of noodles, they bring out a liquid to dilute the concentrated dipping sauce into a drinkable broth. You have the option to get it as a soup with noodles already in, or cold. I recommend the dip. Kimchee was amazing. The large is a good amount if you are ready to pig out, otherwise just go for the regular. We also got an appetizer of cucumbers in spicy sauce. Delicious. They bring you tea at the end to close out your, no doubt, wonderful experience. I want one in SF, please. Thanks.
