Terrible service. Food was OK at best. We were really hungry when we got here. We ordered the quickest to make appetizer along with 2 drinks. Were told IG would be ready in 5 min. Meanwhile 20 min later no appetizer and only 1 drink. After 2 reminders finally got the drink appetizer and 2 entrees all together. No plates or silverware.. Finally we get those ..and of course the anti climax. Food was average..best part was the drink!
