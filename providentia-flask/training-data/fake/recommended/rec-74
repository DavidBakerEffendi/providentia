My lovely mother came to visit me for my graduation, and one of the places I took her to was Reading Terminal Market. We were looking for something to eat and chose this place since there was a line. We reasoned a line must mean delicious food, right? We ordered a pulled pork sandwich with hot peppers and provolone. I love the how the strong cheese flavor and the hot peppers complimented the flavorful pork. My mom thought it was alright, nothing to write home about, hence averaging this review to four stars.
