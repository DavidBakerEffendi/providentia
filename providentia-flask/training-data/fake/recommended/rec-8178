It's a nice day outside and I want to eat good food, enjoy a beer and hang-out with my friend and his dog... outdoors. This is where we go! Brunch: Eggs Benedict is ehhhhh.... Eggs overcooked and would benefit from English muffins. Yogurt, granola and fresh fruit is yummy! Orange juice comes from a box, ew! Coffee is good! Food in general is very good. Fish tacos are delicious! Service is slow, but they'll bring out water for your dog. This is a high traffic location for dog walkers. In one meal you'll watch dozens walk by.
