Got there on a sunday when it opened at 9am. We still hadto wait for an hour.  I had the biscuit sandwhich, my brother got the chocolate pancakes and my parents had gotten the french toast and another set of pancakes with sides of cheese grits and a biscuit.  Honestly when it was all done, it was just like any other breakfast we could've gotten elsewhere with out the wait.  This place just wasn't as great as I expected. The place is clean but really small. Not worth the wait, I wouldn't come back unless I got seated right away.
