This has become my very favorite restaurant.  We tend to not bother looking at price when we pick a restaurant, we simply look for a finer-dining style with great reviews.  This farm to table concept is fantastic.  Chef Chris is incredible creative with his food parings and a tasting menu of 5 or 7 courses is well worth the price.  They also have a fantastic large wine list with many lower priced options.  It is rare to find a place this good that also has a great bar area where eating a meal like this doesn't seem very bar like.  Great ambiance too!  Highly recommended.
