I never write reviews, but my wife and I had such amazing food here I had to take the time to do so.  From our well crafted and unique cocktails and every beautiful plate that was brought out to us, each item wonderfully delicious.  We loved it so much that it was the first place we both thought of when we picked a place for a Valentine's day dinner.  I highly recommend The Pines for a date or dinner with friends or family.
