Frankly, I won't recommend this place to any of my friends. They don't make authentic hotpot.  I came here because I saw someone recommended this place.  But I was disappointed. First of all, the night we came here, they didn't have sesame sause. They have their own special dipping sause. It looks pretty but tastes wrong. Also, they didn't have any kind of tofu. Another thing unacceptable. The hotpot tasted really unauthentic. And the dishes were TINY. You have to order a lot to feed yourself.  I didn't feel happy about eating here.  But every time when I went to the Little Fat Sheep in Flushing, it was always flattered me. Anyhow, I gave this place two star because they have some interesting coupon on Yelp. Like $10 for $20, and if you checked in, you'll get a melon ice cream. Service was ok. That's it. I don't think I will visit here again unless I'm totally desperate.
