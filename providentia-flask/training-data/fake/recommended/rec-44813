3.5 but I couldn't give it 3 stars. My Parisenne crepe consisted of ham, cheese and a sunny side up egg. I like my eggs scrambled, but either way, I found the dish a bit salty. My date, however, ordered the curry shrimp crepe and in typical beast mode fashion, I invaded his plate. It was creamy, the curry was savory and the whole thing was really delicious (and a bit heavy due to the cream, but it's bearable). They're also flexible in customizing any crepe (I subsituted onions for spinach and how yummy was that decision). The staff was very attentive and the place, while a bit on the warm side, was cozy and comfortable. I didnt linger after eating but i get the impression that there's no rush to turn the table, which is refreshing in busy NYC. I want to come back for their desserts.
