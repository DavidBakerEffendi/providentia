lets get two things straight, first, this is not VETRI, second, it is not olive garden either. so if you expect the personal, singular treatment you get in a restaurant that barely seats forty, you've lost your mind and if you think theres going to be endless breadsticks and your meal is going to cost $29.99 think again. what you do get is a casual, bright and more available little brother of vetri. our first dish, pannocchia, i believe was the best slice of pizza i have ever had, fresh sweet corn with mozzarella di bufula. it came out fast, crispy and smelling of the wood fire over which it was cooked.my main dish was the brined, spit turned and grilled pork which i swear made me high, actually high! our service was excellent, alot of people come by the table but just to make sure you have room for whats coming next and that you have new silverware. osteria also just got taps and have two to three great beers on draught now. definately going back. i want that pork right now.
