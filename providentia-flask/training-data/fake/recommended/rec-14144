We waited an hour for a table for 5.  There are maybe 5 tables that can fit between 2-5 people.  There are 2 tables that sit 6-8 people and you can make reservations for those (I'd recommend that route).  During our hour wait, we went through a few pitchers of Sangria which was excellent.  We had the jamon which was good, the cheese which we didn't love, the chorizo con chocolate which we didn't love, the suckling pig special which was very good, the patas bravas which were excellent, and the deviled eggs which were a little spicy but ok.  Overall, a good experience... good friends, good sangria and good food.
