I am in love with Palma. It is that little NYC place that not everyone knows about so it's not super famous, but it's still well-known enough to get a crowd any night of the week. I have been here twice now and each time has been an amazing experience. I went this last time with my vegan Mom, so we knew that ordering may be a challenge. We started with the cauliflower, which you cannot miss! And then she got Â the linguine with mushrooms and truffle butter. She asked our server, who happened to be the manager as well, if she could please get it without the truffle butter. He was astounded that she did not want the truffle butter! We explained to him that she was vegan and then he understood. He brought her out the linguine with added vegetables and a non-butter sauce, she was very pleased and it was so nice that he went above and beyond. I, on the other hand, am a full-blown carnivore and got the wild boar parpadelle. It was beyond fantastic. So rich, succulent, perfection in a bowl. The interior of Palma is gorgeous. It is tucked into a inter-building courtyard on Cornelia Street and has some pretty cool history. Apparently the matron of an old Italian family served meals to guests out of her house and her cooking became so talked about that the guest count outgrew the family home and they decided to open up the restaurant that we visit today. The original house and garden terrace are still in the back of the restaurant, available for diners and special events. Some recipes, like the cauliflower, date back to the original family cooking. I love the history of this place, to me it makes the food taste that much better! Reservations are a must as the restaurant is small and gets full fast!
