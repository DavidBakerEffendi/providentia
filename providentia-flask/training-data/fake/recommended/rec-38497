Yet another reason to move to NYC. The hummus is amazing, as other reviewers have noted. Thick, fresh, and exceedingly tasty. However my real favorite is the sabich sandwich, the most incredible combo of fried eggplant, hard boiled organic egg, hummus, cabbage slaw, pickle, dressing--an amazing flavor combo of salty, sweet, fried, soft, spicy, and umami. Wow!!!!!!
