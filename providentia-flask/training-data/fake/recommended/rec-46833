I read the reviews n was a little hesitant considering its a new restaurant...and usually new restaurants are still working out the kinks....also some people complained about the portion size n price. Honestly I have no idea what they are talking about. The quality of the food is excellent.... I don't know what planet people are from but considering the quality of the food.... I thought the prices were reasonable....you get what you pay for. The Burrata Salad....Delicious Skirt Steak....Delicious Lobster Bolognese....Delicious Simple menu that isn't overwhelming. Attentive staff . I'll be back.... I've discovered my favorite dishes at Yellow Plum and I'm a creature of habit so I'll be back for what I ordered the last time!!!!!!!!
