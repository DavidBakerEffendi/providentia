I'm a sucker for small, cozy, romantic but yet not too overboard restaurants like this. My boyfriend brought me here for an early birthday dinner and I really enjoyed it. The waitress was very friendly. I love how she gave us enough privacy and didn't come over every 5 minutes. I also like how they were considerate as to when to clear the table. They waited to make sure we were really done with our foods before coming over to remove it. Now for the food, I was really impress. My steak was made just right - medium rare and I loved the peppercorn sauce that accompanied it. My boyfriend had the seared duck breast and he said that it's the second best duck breast he's had. We both really liked the potato gratin and the cherry reduction sauce that came with the dish. It was superb and complimented the dish very well. Overall, my experience at Chez Moi will have me coming back again whenever I'm in the area.
