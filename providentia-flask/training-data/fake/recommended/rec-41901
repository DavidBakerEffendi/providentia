Food: 3 Decor: 3 Service: 4 Came here for their Sunday $45 4-course prix fixe after snagging a reservation 3 weeks in advance. It's hard to find parking in the area, but I managed to finally find a spot in the parking lot next door after circling around for 15 min. 1. Consomme ~Pretty good. 2. Foie gras with grilled apricot ~Pretty good. Foie gras was tasty, although I was hoping it'd be smoother and more buttery. 3. Sea bass ~Delicious. Easily the best course of the night. Bass was cooked perfectly, and the broth was quite good. Side veggies were decent. 4. Frozen souffle ~Okay. More like frozen ice cream (can't remember the dessert I'm thinking of). 5. Macaroons and cookies ~Mediocre. A bit too sweet, and I only had a bite of each. Service was good, although it was odd when the server came back and told me there was only 1 bass left and asked me to switch to another fish. Luckily, another server came by and said that I could have the bass.
