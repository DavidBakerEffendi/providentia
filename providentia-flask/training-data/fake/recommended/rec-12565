I really adore this place. It's tiny (usually a wait) and can be a bit loud, but I love its black sesame creme brulee (beautiful richness, nutty fragrance) and zenzai. Zenzai is a can't-miss. The combination of matcha base, sake ice cream, chewy mochi balls, chestnuts and azuki bean jellies offers complexity in taste and texture.
