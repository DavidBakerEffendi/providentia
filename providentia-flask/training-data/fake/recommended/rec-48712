My partner and I paid a visit to Claire's Corner Copia yesterday evening while we were in New Haven for the day.  I had heard a lot about this place for some time, and we stumbled upon it while walking 'round in the rain post-concert and decided to give the place a spontaneous last-minute go instead of the more pricier options in the 'hood. The one thing I immediately noticed was, there were so many options to choose from; it was quite overwhelming admittedly! [but in a good way]  It should be noted that Claire's is a vegetarian place, but they can and will accommodate vegan substitutions, if you ask them. I wound up ordering the Enchiladas de la Casa [gluten-free] sans the organic fried egg as my main dish for dinner.  I found it quite appetizing and the serving was generous and ample. They supply you with complimentary bread with your meal, and it should be noted that the rolls are HUGE!  They gave us two, which was plenty for my partner's lentil soup and for my enchilada.  I also ordered a Kale-a-bunga smoothie and it was to my palate and liking; not too tart, not too sweet. Before leaving, we brown-bagged a slice of their Lithuanian coffee cake, which is one of their dessert specialities which was good, also. Last aside:  if you need to use the restroom, you will have to flag a waiter/waitress down so they can open it up for you because they keep the facilities under strict lock and key. The folks who worked behind the counter seemed to be warm, patient and helpful also. If and when I return to New Haven, I'll most certainly give Claire's another go!  Enjoy folks and happy eating! :]
