I only write reviews when something is really bad or really good. In this case Pepe Rosso Social was really bad Bland food all around, soggy pasta and less than pleasant service. Felt like I was a tourist in my own town. Started with $10 for a bad glass of wine in a dirty glass followed by $12 for soggy + bland rigotoni. My friend had salmon that was way undercooked (looked like sushi inside). When she said something there was nothing but attitude in return. So many better neighborhood spots to go to that get it. Frank, Sauce, even Bread. Though not a favorite, I'd say Lil' Frankies is better too. Can't understand how this could be the top rate italian place. Goes to show can't really trust Yelp anymore.
