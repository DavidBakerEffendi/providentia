The food was good, the service was crap.  just sayin... I recently attended a birthday dinner for a friend of mine at Silk City.  I can say that our waitress was pretty decent.  It was a very busy night, but she was pleasant, which is more than I can say for the manager that evening! We had a fairly large party and they agreed to take a reservation, which the manager implied they dont do.  Im not sure, Ive never been there.  Anywho, so, inevitably people were late.  That happens.  Because people were late, those of us who arrived on time were made to feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable...before I arrived (and I was just 15 minutes late because I was looking for a parking spot) this manager stopped by our table to tell my friends, essentially, order something or get out.  The language was much less blunt, but the sentiment was clear! Throughout the course of our waiting for others to arrive, several of the other servers rudely snatched menus off the table, took chairs and then eventually, the manager decided he was going to take one of our tables (they had pushed four together) and when asked what his plan was for when our other two guests arrived, we were told they would figure something out. Now, I understand it was a busy night.  But, they took the reservation!  They didnt have to take a reservation.  They didnt have to seat the party before most had arrived.  And they REALLY didnt have to harass us the entire time!  The food was decent and appropriately priced but their bad attitudes ruined the atmosphere of what should have been a fun night out for a friend's birthday. Silk City needs to do better.
