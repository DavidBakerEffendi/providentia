I don't know how I didn't write for this place before. My. FAVORITE. I'm gonna be short and sweet. Shrimp and grits.. Fuh yeah Cheesy grits, eggs, fried green tomatos (yeah I said it) Ham and bacon with maple syrup- you better ask somebody French toast- unh hot fresh coffee, chai latte's that taste like their supposed to- better believe it. I love here.
