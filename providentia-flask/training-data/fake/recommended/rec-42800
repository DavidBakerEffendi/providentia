Came here with two of my girlfriends on a Sat evening.  I highly recommend making reservations as it get extremely busy. We had a couple if cocktails as we waited for our table and they were delicious. We sat at an intimate corner table and order three starters and two entrees and a dessert to share for 3. You must try the following... - brussels sprouts - bacon wrapped lamp chops - gnocchi Great place for a romantic dinner or to catch up with a small group of friends.  The music was jamming and upbeat.  Server was very attentive. I will definitely come back once I'm in town again:)
