Stopped in for a burger and beer before the Cracker/Camper Van Beethoven show at World Cafe Live. It's an easy a 5 minute walk away. We were seated right away and the waiter was right there to take our order. They know how to pour a Guinness right and that's saying something. The burgers came out quickly and were quite good. My medium rare burger was actually medium rare. Only complaint is we had to ask for napkins. Prices were very reasonable for the quality and location. Will definitely make it our go-to site when we see shows at WCL.
