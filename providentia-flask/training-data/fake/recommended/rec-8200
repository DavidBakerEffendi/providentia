a fabulous start to my adventure back east... from the amuse bouche of cauliflour soup to the pumpkin brittle this little restaurant has mad flavor and warmth.  we shared the beet and artichoke salads to start and ate the pumpkin tortelli and braised pork for our main courses.  i had never seen pasta done in such a beautiful way - each tortelli looked like a little special chinese dumpling and the brown sugar emulsion was to die for... the pork was perfectly cooked and the miniature brussel sprouts with pomegranite seeds were delicious. all said and done this place has a great vibe and following - we were lucky to get a table on a friday night with no prior reservations.  if we had walked in just 5 minutes after we did we would have been looking at a 2 hour+ wait just for bar seating.  i am happy to have been given such a stellar recommendation from 'my' chef and my friends were thankful for the heads up as well...
