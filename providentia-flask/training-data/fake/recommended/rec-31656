I wanted to try something new other than eating Chinese food, so I decided to research an excellent Korean restaurant.  I have noticed this restaurant have many positive reviews, so I had to try them out. I am very glad I did, because everything taste wonderful. This place made me give up Chinese food for Korean food, that is a very big deal. Did I mentioned the food is cheap too? Yes it is!  I love this place.
