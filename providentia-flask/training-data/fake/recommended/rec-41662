It all started out well.  I love Uzbek food and am familiar with the cuisine.  All the food was prepared well and the service was good, all up until the very last dish - Tashkent Plov.  The lamb was spoiled - it was a Sunday evening but come on, you have to know when the meat has gone bad.  I am giving them 2 stars because everything else was good but you just can't serve spoiled meat...
