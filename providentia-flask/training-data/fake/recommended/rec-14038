This place is a super find in midtown. I've never eaten anything short of wonderful here. Excellent chicken fricassee that falls off the bone. The grilled salmon is good too. It comes in a sauce (sort of like a jus) with onions and red peppers. Also don't forget to order some tostones with garlic sauce. So so good. The sandwiches are excellent and some are as cheap as $4.00. The service here is great and everyone working behind the counter is sweet and attentive. They can make a good recommendation if you can't decide what to order. And after wards they always ask, "How was the food?" Astonishing coming from a place steps away from Times Square.
