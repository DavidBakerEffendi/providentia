This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Epic: beer battered string beans, mussels, mac n cheese, cheesy jalepeno grits, filet, chicken nd wafflezzzz There's a photo booth downstairs and don't forget to look in the little holes in the wall down there as well. They look unassuming but if you peer in you'll see 1920s porn. Awesome.
