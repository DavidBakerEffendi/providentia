Really enjoyed the experience here - nicely upscale shop, not a dive hole in the wall.  Authentic, fresh and flavorful food. Pho on par with the best I've had in Seattle, DC, Philly and NY.  Really excellent broth and fresh greens, noodles done perfectly.  I had #5 with eye round and tendon, and the latter was absolutely sublime - soft and chewy.. wow.. Two thumbs up enthusiastically!!
