Thank you Yelp for pointing me toward this wonderful little gem. This was super close to my hotel (Doubletree) but I probably wouldn't have found this without help from Yelp. My husband and I were seated immediately at the bar. I think we got lucky because this place is very small. We had a beet salad, cheese rolls, walnut zucchini pancakes, and lamb chops. I enjoyed everything but the pancakes (but my husband was happy to finish those off for us!). You won't regret going there!
