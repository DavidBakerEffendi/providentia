Woah. Make your own Bloody Mary bar on Sundays. Awesome. Just awesome. The service was WAY overworked on the day that we went, but they were both nice (2 servers for the whole place), didn't snap at us when my friend asked  'can i have some water?'   (That girl was busy... and who needs water when you have a bloody mary?!) The food was better than good, a little slow to come out, but I think we got there just before a MAD rush, and timing brunch for 5 people is tough. I would like to come and hang out at night some time, I hear it's cool.  Had a decent beer list, and the alcohol to match.   Will def go back when in Philadelphia next.
