This is a very, very conflicted review. I went here for a romantic dinner with the hubby-to-be, and the wait looked like it would pass. The hostess said that we could sit out back in the garden area and we'd go inside when a table opened up. The ambiance, gotta say, is just gorgeous. The radio even played our song. Before I go further--the Maitre 'D SAVED the meal for us. We ended up spending 4 hours waiting for our food. But, the gracious and hilarious guy would come out, crack a fatigued joke, bring us a complimentary carafe of wine, and apologize for the wait. Apparently they were trying out a new chef, and his frankness was extremely refreshing. After being to countless restaurants with servers that bullshit to cover their ass, this guy just stood there and said, "I'm not proud to come out here. I could punch the cook tonight. Here's more wine." ...all told, 3 carafes and a shot of sambuca later, (none of which showed up on our bill), we were shitfaced. The food was good, but after 3.5 hours I would have wanted bigger portions. That's just picky though. I would go back on a slow night in a heartbeat.
