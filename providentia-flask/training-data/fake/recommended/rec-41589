I went here with a group of about 10 people. One of my pals called and had a table reserved for us in the back. I didn't eat anything, and I only had a beer ($2 Kenzinger -- great deal.) A few of the people I was with ordered food, but I don't know if they liked it or not because...it was too loud in there! As the night wore on, it got louder. It was weird, because the stuff on the menu is kind of expensive ($9 grilled cheese, for example) but with the blaring music, this place was presenting itself as a cheap bar. The women's bathroom was weird too. It's big but only has one stall, and the door is short and doesn't offer much privacy. Someone was in there when i walked in, and I stood outside because it felt awkward. There were also magazines in the stall. Really? Who is going to read a magazine in a public bathroom? It was also filthy. The space is okay, if a little small, the location is great and the happy hour specials were good, but I don't see any reason to come back to the Wishing Well. There are too many better places nearby, like the New Wave.
