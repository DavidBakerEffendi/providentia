Though this place serves fairly good Katsu, but their service is the worse I have even had in my life. Waiters there asked for more tips face to face even though a fair amount of tips have been given.   They didn't let you out the door until more tips are paid. I just do not understand what kind of service is that, especially when we are in a tough economy situation where a lot of shops have been closed down in Manhattan. I am sorry but I highly recommend everyone not to visit this place anymore. I had dinner at their sister shop on 55th and it was good.  Maybe there is management issue in this shop with greedy waiters. Just this once and no more...
