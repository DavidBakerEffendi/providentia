The number of Italian restaurants I've gone to where the food tastes like my mother's, aunt's, or grandma's can only be counted on one hand, and this place is one of them. You'll need a reservation. Period. It doesn't matter if it's lunch or a Wednesday, people know about this place & they come often. You'll want to roll out the front door belly first after trying a staple Italian dish, like eggplant parm. Lunch dishes come with fabulous homemade soup, or a salad. And the prices? Amazing. A chain restaurant's lunch would probably cost more & you wouldn't go home with nearly as much food in a doggie bag as you will here. Unfortunately, the seating arrangement is very tight. I felt uncomfortable sitting so close to the others in my party & had to place the menu on my lap while we snacked on the complimentary bread & waited for the server to take our order. But the delicious food was worth it. Make sure to pop in the bakery right next door, not one Italian dessert I can think of is missing from their store. And I'm an Italian pastry professional, so bring home the cannolis. Do it.
