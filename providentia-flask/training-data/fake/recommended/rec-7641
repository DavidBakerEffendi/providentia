Really late..but this is the review for Restaurant Week 2014.. lol Reason I picked this restaurant to go to is cuz, it's right by the water, and I liked the interesting menu. Interior decor was really nice and modern. The dining room was large and airy and the seats were comfortable. There was also nice outdoor seating, which my friend and I chose. For drinks, we each had a glass of fresh, non-alcoholic Green Lemonade w/ crushed mint leaves. Nice and refreshing! For Apps, we both had their Oyster app. Fresh, clean oysters! For entrees, I remember having a braised rabbit and pasta dish, which was good. A tad bit salty, but it had good flavor. My friend had a Long Island Sea Bream, which was delicious. Riverpark is def on my list of new favorites. I would come back here again, with friends for a nice dinner with beautiful views. :D
