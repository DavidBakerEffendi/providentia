I've been here a few times for private events. The chips, salsa and guac are very good and fresh. I am a huge fan of the chicken quesadillas. Also their margaritas are good. Last time I dined in we ordered the beef enchilada which was enormous. It was way more than one person could eat. But the sides were very minimal for the amount of food the main portion was. I love the look of the restaurant and the staff is very nice. My only complaint is they were a little slow last time we were there. It was a Sunday afternoon and not busy at all. Our waiter was very attentive in the beginning, but once we put our order in we rarely seen him again. We received the wrong entree and had to send it back with another waitress. Also, when it was time to pay we waited about 20 minutes for our check and another 20 minutes to have it picked up. I'm still a fan based on the food but think the service could be a little better.
