I'm  no vegetarian, so clearly not an expert on the cuisine. But recently I've been trying to reduce my meat consumption mostly for health reasons. So when I discovered that there was a vegetarian Chinese  restaurant a few blocks from my apartment I jumped at the chance to try it asap. I believe it was last sunday, I was home alone doing some work and it hit that time of day where the rumbles started coming on. The fridge was bare, but I remembered seeing the menu for Zen somewhere online. Yelpers recommended the mango chicken, and I was excited to see it on the lunch menu. I ordered that with brown rice, a spring roll, and an order of steamed broccoli. The delivery was super quick, and I immediately dug in. My eyes brightened when I saw the gigantic pieces of mango hanging out with the fake chicken (is it tofu, soy protein, what is it??). I was weary of the chicken because I hate the texture of tofu, but when I took my first bite I was pleasantly surprised. It was chewy, and had a nice texture (not as nice as chicken, but I can survive). The steamed broc was delicious, as well as the spring roll. I really enjoyed my first officially vegetarian meal, and will definitely be hitting them up again soon o try something else. Maybe next time I'll take a stroll and stop in to check out the tiny headquarters.
