Very, very disappointing. We live in the neighborhood and have been to this restaurant on a half dozen occasions. We go back because the food has always been good- not mind blowing, but consistent. Unfortunately, the service has always been consistent- consistently bad. The people who work there (outside of a very nice guy behind the counter) seem to feel put upon while they are serving you. Today was the worst. We arrived at 3:30 and were told that they were no longer seating. They close at 4pm-not 3:30. If you arrive at 4:01pm you will not be seated. We were there at 3:30 and they would not seat us because they had something going on that evening. If they were flexible about their cut-off time when you arrive at 4:01, I could be flexible when they change the rules for a day. But they are completely inflexible and surprisingly rude about it. I have lived in the East village since 1985. it makes me sad to see places masquerading as "neighborhood" joints that don't know the first thing about being neighborly. There are plenty of good, less expensive restaurants where they are actually happy to have customers nearby. This place could be serving ambrosia, but their attitude makes it taste like crap.
