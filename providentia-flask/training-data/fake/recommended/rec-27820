Really 4.5 stars but let's round up. Food was great--- as good as the pictures. GET.THE.RIBS.... and WINGS. Prices were reasonable. Wine was 'meh but what was I thinking? Dine upstairs if you're on a date. Stand downstairs around a high table like a jabronie if its dude's night. Listen to live rock in the back if you're over 40. Â  It's a well-designed and pretty space. Been open 8mo only but if the food and service keeps up, it could become a Bleecker St. staple.
