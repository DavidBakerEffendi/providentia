First time and last! Went for lunch ordered 2 pizzas and 2 salads. Thankfully we brought wine the wait for food was long. There was one other table seated and they were complaining too. They kept making excuses and apologizing. Now it gets worse salads arrived not as ordered and mediocre at best. My son ordered a meatball pizza. The pizza my wife and I ordered was wrong too. They ended up taking one pizza off the bill not sure why told them we were never coming back. There are way to many good places in the area to give them a second chance. I recommend Dough - Caldwell or AhPizz - Montclair.
