Break out your skinny jeans!  El Camino is nestled in the bottom floor of a young development at the end of Northern Liberties (near Fishtown) where hipsters abound.  The atmosphere is a mix between dark (the lighting is low, there are spray painted skeletons on the windows and unusually creepy statues of mother Mary) and upbeat (loud, but not obnoxious) and funny murals with even funnier comments in the bathrooms (which are unisex so be warned).  The service at the bar is good.  The service in the rest of the restaurant is not (servers tend to be slow and almost annoyed that you are asking for things).   All of the food is solid (generous portions and interesting flavours), but here are some of my favourites: - Guacamole (a little pricey, but very good) - Fish burrito (lightly fried and delicious) - Pulled pork sandwich (nicely cooked... flakes off) and begs to be slathered in the BBQ sauce (hot/mild) sitting on your table - Blood orange mojitos (if your order with the simple syrup on the side... they are just perfect :) Happy eating!
