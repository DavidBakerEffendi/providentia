By far the best Chinese food in New York!  The food at Joe's Shanghai is nothing short of amazing.  The waits can be a little bit long and the ambiance...well it's Chinatown, but the food is very good.  Be prepared to share a table with complete strangers, don't expect 5 star service, but do expect great food.   The Pork Soup Dumplings are the best, be sure not to sacrifice any of the soup or you are committing a grave sin to humanity.  After carefully sucking out the soup add in a little bit of the provided vinegar, it really adds a nice taste to the dumpling.   I don't get too exotic with my selections sticking with Chicken Fried Rice, General Tso's Chicken, Orange Beef, Kung Pao Chicken, etc.  All of these items are great...you can get a lot more exotic if your palate so desires.  I will add one caveat, this isn't PF Chang's don't expect the food to come out tasting exactly the same each time...the food is being prepared in the kitchen from scratch and as a result sometimes things can be a bit off depending on the chef working that night or how much soy sauce he decided to add.   I've tried all three NYC locations.  The food at the Chinatown location is the best with a close second (if not tie) going to the Flushing location.  The Flushing location doesn't make you share a table and the wait is usually far less.  The midtown location is good, but a bit overpriced and the food slightly inferior to that of Chinatown or Flushing.
