This review is for brunch.  A group of my friends and I stopped by around 2pm on a Saturday.  While we were immediately seated, the process of getting drinks and food took awhile.  We had to get the servers' attention each time.  They were all very nice, but could have just been mannequins they kept walking by. We ordered the special $5 drinks.  I got a gintini(sp) with ginger, lemonade, and champagne.  Pretty good, but not to die for.  My friends that got the bloody mary's were told that the bloody mary's are hit or miss depending on how the prepared mix for the day is.  I guess it was a miss that day, since they both tasted cocktail sauce and and too much horseradish.   As far as meals, I got the Morrocan breakfast that had pita and eggs over easy in a tomato based sauce.  I thought it was going to be spicier but it wasn't.  It almost got a little too much like spaghetti sauce at points.  All in all okay. My friend that got the omelet didn't eat it.  I didn't even realize until she passed her full plate back at the end... and the eggs were running all over the plate.  She's much too nice to say anything or send plates back.  My other friend got the beef burger and requested medium.  When she says medium, she gets nervous about pink centers, but we reassured her a little pink was okay.  She took three bites... and was too squeamish so she sliced the burger horizontally to expose a nearly raw middle.  The burger wasn't even medium rare... it was definitely rare! When she told the server he actually looked disgusted and apologized and promptly removed it from our check.   Not sure if the dinner menu is much better, but as far as brunch, I won't be stopping by again.  Unfortunately,  I struck out with my out of town visitors, but it was a beautiful day in the West Village, and they enjoyed ambiance.
