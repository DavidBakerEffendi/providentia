The big tray of chicken with hand pulled noodles is flavorful (cumin, scallion, cilantro, peppers) and filling - more than enough for two people and under $15. Not too spicy - could use more heat in fact, although I have a pretty high spice tolerance. We even had a whole serving left over. The egg pancake is pretty unforgettable but I'd come back for noodles and chicken! My friend and I were seated right away at 7pm on a Monday but it took about 15-20 to get our food after we ordered, and there was a line for tables by the time we finished.
