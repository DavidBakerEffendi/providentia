The food was good...very good. The home fries are excellent, as many have stated already. We were able to sit at the front with the window open on a great day so that made our experience that much better. We had 2 very obnoxious guys sitting right next to us which took away from the experience. I am not blaming that on the restaurant but it does lead to the one thing I didn't like about the place......space. You sit VERY close to the next table so absolutely nothing is private. I am not saying it should have karaoke boxes but it is a bit TOO intimate. They should have you introduce yourself to all adjacent tables as a light-hearted way of acknowledging how close you will sit to each other.... Despite that, I will definitely go again. There are far too many things I want to try on that menu!
