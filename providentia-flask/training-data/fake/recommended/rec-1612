Recently went back to NYC again with friends.  There are six of us and we went to Sake Bar Hagi the night we landed in NYC, just couldn't wait.  For a table of six, I expect to wait for a while (place was packed).  I put down my name and one of the servers came out asking if we mind a smaller table since the larger tables will take longer.  For good food?  No problem.  We told him we don't mind and we were seated within 20 min.  Not bad. This is his first time to NYC for one of our party of six, and I was afraid he wouldn't be used to the cramped seating and the somewhat 'exotic' food offered at Sake Bar Hagi.  He LOVED it.  He tried so many dishes but especially loved the beef tongue and chicken gizzards.  We had such a blast that in our short 5 night trip, we were at Sake Bar Hagi no less than four times.... Still a must-visit for us when coming to NYC.
