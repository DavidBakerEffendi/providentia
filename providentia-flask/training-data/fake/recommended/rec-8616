This place is firmly within the rotation for good solid lunch places in Hartford. And for the most part, I think the good vibes at Sorella and energy have rubbed off on this place. At my latest lunch, they had a spicy Pad Thai with Ahi Tuna that was -- well, spicy! One of the spicier things I've had at a mainstream restaurant. And you know what? Loved it. Could've licked my plate on it. Service remains a little haphazard. They didn't bring a simple soda until my dining companion had already started her meal. And in the backroom, sometimes its tough to gain a server's eye. But overall, Dish is a winner.
