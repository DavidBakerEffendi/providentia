This place used to be cool back in 2006, but now it has lost its classy appeal. During a snow storm, they wouldn't serve me any drink made with liquor,only wine, because they told me I had been drinking since 4, when in reality, I had one drink at 4, left for five hours and came back when I realized there would be no work the next day. Unprofessional bar tenders told me he wasn't serving me "because he can." Impressive. Everyone had tattoos now and this place usually involves 40 some year olds falling off bar stools. Not the best scene if you are looking for some class. Also, the food sucks now and the cheese plate is one step above Cracker Barrel! Go elsewhere!
