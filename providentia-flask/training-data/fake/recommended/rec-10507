Fresh, simply prepared with seasonal ingredients seem to be the trend du jour in American cuisine. This is a trend that I can get on board, most definitely. Chef Mike Price (it feels forward to call him Mikey) presents a small, but well-executed menu of just that: Fresh, simple and absolutely delicious. Recommended by our resident New Yorker friends, this was our selected spot for our "Remember, you love NYC" visit of 2010. My date and I shared the summer strawberry salad. Presented on two plates and drizzled with the lightest vinegarette, the peppery fris√©e marched with soft cheese, pine nuts and strawberries straight into our bellies with ease. Paired with a bottle of the vinho verde, this was straight-up summer in front of us. For my entree, I went with the tuna steak special for the evening, cooked perfectly to my liking and bedded with chopped leeks and mushrooms, this dish made my entire body smile. Truly. A generous portion of skate atop shrimp and bacon "homefries" in a creamy, grainy mustard went down with ease and was shared across the table and the seared halibut and pan roasted chicken were enjoyed as well. No room at the inn for dessert, but I'm certain it would have been marvelous. Service was efficient, friendly and not intrusive, just the way I like it. As always, our friends picked a fantastic spot to dine.
