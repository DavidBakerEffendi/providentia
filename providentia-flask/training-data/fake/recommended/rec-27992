Upon entering, I loved the vibe of the whole place. The french toast and brunch burger was delicious, however, I can't say much for anything else. They really could use without the bitchy waitress (I don't quite remember her name but she was Asian, with glasses) who was constantly talking under her breath about the customers - "Oh my god", "Ugh", etc, etc, almost as if she was beneath us. Maybe you were the only server there, but at least fake it 'til you make it, you know?
