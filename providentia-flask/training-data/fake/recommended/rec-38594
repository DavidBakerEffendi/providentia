This is the first place I am reviewing on yelp.I am one of those who never writes a review only uses them to try out new places.But hands down this place did it for me.Its not about the Dosas.....its about the idea and the location.The prices are excellent....and the dosas are all vegetarian with a very interesting twist.If you are an Indian and your looking for authentic "Desi Dosa"....You probably wont find it.....but you will find something much better.We talked to the owner and he said hes gonna get Sambar (lentil spicy soup) on the menu very soon. I am just glad that I can walk from home to eat dosas!Those who have never eaten a dosa till date....trust me and try it out! It does "feed my soul"!
