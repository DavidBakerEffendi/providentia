As a huge fan of Jimmy's Diner, I knew I had to try Anella for brunch. And boy did it deliver.  I deem Anella the best brunch in Greenpoint/Williamsburg.  When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised that there was a brunch deal: $19 for  coffee, breakfast cocktail, and an entree.  The entrees were all about $12 each, which is totally reasonable. I had the vegetable hash and it was delicious.  Lots of fresh veggies,  hash browns topped with 2 poached eggs.  My friend got the special: eggs, pork belly and roasted cauliflower and broccoli. It looked amazing. They offer a pastry basket also - but it would have been too much for 2 people. I look forward to trying dinner here sometime soon.   They also have bacon jam for your burger...this is my kind of place.
