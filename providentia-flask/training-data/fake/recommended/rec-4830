A little gem of a restaurant on South Street (near Front).  Delicious food (probably my favorite Mexican in the city).  Competent, friendly staff. We've been here on quiet nights and busy weekend nights.  Each time service and food have been fantastic.  A wonderful discovery in Philly, even if it is small and the decor a bit kitschy!
