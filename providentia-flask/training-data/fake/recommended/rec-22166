On our way to dinner we were greeted by a courteous and friendly valet.  His outgoing personality gave you a false sense of thinking we were in for a customer service treat; rest assured, any courtesy and friendliness remained well outside the walls of Peppercorn's Grill.  We entered the restaurant and although we had a reservation, we had to wait & decided to get a drink at the bar.  The female bartender, although the bar was nearly empty, was clearly frazzled, perhaps from a busier early seating as it was now going on 8:00.  The bar was freezing & I believe it was the chill coming off the bartender. We were finally seated and were non-greeted by a steely blond waitress.  I kid you not, she did not smile once the entire evening.  The food was uneventful and coated in oil, perhaps in an attempt at flavor. When we paid the bill, the waitress never gave us our change, perhaps thinking it was her tip. And maybe it would have been had she smiled.  Once.  Instead, I had to wait for her to return to our table to request our change so that we could leave a more fitting tip. Will not return. Obviously.
