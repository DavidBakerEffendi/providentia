I ordered a veggie wrap and a medium smoothie and it came to $12.75. So right off the bat I was disappointed in the price. I mean, the wrap was a decent size, but that's just too much for what it was. I will say, however, that the food was pretty delicious. They grill the wraps and the ingredients are very fresh. Smoothie was creamy and delicious, and thick like a good smoothie should be. I'll come back, but not often.
