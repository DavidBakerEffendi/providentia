Used to come here when I was a kid BEFORE the Soprano's craze, and it's always been great. A little pricey when it comes to the entrees (4.25 for a previously frozen cheeseburger patty out of a box w/o fries is a little too much, sorry), but the ice cream and candy is great. Definitely try the brownie sundae, you won't be disappointed.
