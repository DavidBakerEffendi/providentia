Really REALLY good.  Ended up here recently and my husband and I were both quite impressed.  Although not really worth mentioning (the menu changes constantly), our favorites were the pork bun and the asparagus wrapped in local prosciutto topped with an egg (to DIE for).  My only qualms were it was REALLY hot inside (I noticed an AC running near the bathroom but you certainly didn't feel it in the front of the restaurant) and the food is pretty pricey for the serving sizes.  For two of us with no beverages it was about $55 total (with tip).  The waiter recommended 2 - 3 dishes per person and we opted for 2, judging by what the prices were.  It wasn't quite enough to fill us (we're "normal" people with "normal" appetites) but by the time we were done, we didn't want to order and wait for something else (too hot!).  We'd felt we'd spent enough for one evening.   But being that the food is really among the best I've had in the state and that I'd definitely save my pennies and go again, I still rate this a 5 star restaurant.
