I went out to Rocky Sullivan's in Red Hook last night where RHLP lobsters were the special.  All I can say is A-MAZING!  It is so easy to overcook a lobster, and this was boiled to perfection.  It wasn't tough, it had a bright red color, it tasted of the sea.  The owners, Ralph and Susan, drive to Maine every week for fresh crustaceans and you can tell.  These little guys have not been sitting in a tank for two months.  Corn and your choice of coleslaw or potato salad for $23!  Don't miss it, but be prepared to wait.  As a plea to the Rocky's staff, hire more people for Fridays.  You could sell so much more lobster!
