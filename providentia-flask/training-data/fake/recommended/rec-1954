Really, what the hell was I waiting for?   41 years of my life, and never having a DiNic's roast pork sandwich til now... I feel like I'm not a good Philadelphian because of that.   Well, I'm not going to tell you anything new that the other 600 Yelp reviewers haven't told you already.  I'm just going to describe my sandwich experience. Roast pork, broccoli rabe, and sharp provolone... while I've had some good ones in the city for sure, this one has achieved perfection.  A lot of places serve a sandwich where you either taste too much rabe, or too much provolone.  This sandwich, the meat somehow manages to be lean and juicy at the same time.  The rabe has just enough of the bitter taste to notice in your mouth and doesn't overwhelm it.  It has just enough garlic and oil in it to offset.  And, the provolone literally has just enough flavor to it to be interesting.  Somehow, they have figured out the perfect flavor ratio where it's all there, nothing overwhelms anything, and you get a great dose of the pork taste.   A while back, I called John's Roast Pork the best sandwich spot in the city.  I'm not changing that because they still have the best cheesesteak and they still make an incredible roast pork there too.  That combination along with the street corner atmosphere keeps it my favorite.   But if this makes sense, I will now call DiNic's roast pork the best individual sandwich in the city as the taste of this beats any cheesesteak I've ever had. I can think of no better place to give the honor of my 400th Yelp review to.
