For my second visit I had the Pork Belly Salad.  Now I don't normally eat salad, and by "don't normally" I mean never.   But this Salad had Pork Belly which is cheating.  It's a very basic salad.  The aformentioned Pork Belly, Baby Spinach and Grape Tomato Vinaigrette. I also had the Vegan Peanut Butter Chocolate Pie.  Again I am not a Vegan but this was good.  It was very rich, so much so that it would be tough to eat the whole thing if I didn't have a gnarly sweet tooth. But if someone gave it to you just saying in was a Peanut Butter Pie you would eat it and enjoy it.  That's the beauty of The Memphis Taproom. My review is the same, 4 stars and a definite must if your in Philly.
