We stopped in for Saturday brunch while walking by and I'm glad I did! They were out of the lamb burger so I opted for the short rib burger instead. AMAZING! They nailed medium-rare when 5-star restaurants don't get it right! The omelets are more like frittatas and can lean towards the over-cooked side. A $15 prix fix brunch comes with a "medicinal" cocktail , coffee and entree. The cocktails are HELLA GOOD and strong. The coffee is curiously delicious that reminded me of what I had in Paris. UPDATE- I've been here for lunch a few times and I have to remove a star for slow service. To their defense, there seems to be only one waitress for lunch service and she tends the bar too.
