This is by the BEST Greek food I've had in Connecticut! The staff was so nice and friendly from the second we got there, which made the experience even more pleasurable. Everything we ordered was fantastic - from the feta dip, to the "old-school" salad, to the shrimp special and the baklava. Fantastic. Can't wait to go back!
