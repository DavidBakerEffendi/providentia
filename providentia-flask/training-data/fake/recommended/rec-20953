I'm surprised no one has reviewed this place yet, it's probably your best option in the food court at Quakerbridge Mall apart from Cinnabon. The cheesesteaks are big, inexpensive, and delicious. They cook everything in front of you, ingredients are fresh, and almost all additional toppings are free of charge and you can ask for as much as you want. Staff is extremely friendly too. My current favorite combo is the Bacon 3 Cheese Steak (steak, bacon, Swiss, cheddar, provolone), with their Ultimate Fries (topped with cheddar, bacon, and ranch dressing). This all comes with a drink for a discount, something like $12 total and it's enough to feed two people. You also get quite the juxtaposition as the place is adjacent to a Subway, where one miserable looking employee stands staring at his feet while everyone is ordering subs at Charley's. It really puts things into perspective seeing them side by side. Subway has no grill, a toaster oven, and a microwave. The ingredients have been sitting in tubs all day. Charley's has a grill that is in constant use, no microwave, and the little tubs of ingredients are constantly being replaced with fresh ones.
