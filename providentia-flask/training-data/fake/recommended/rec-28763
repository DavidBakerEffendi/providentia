We came to celebrate my daughters 16th birthday. We gave her a choice of where to go and this was the place she chose. After reading some of the reviews we were not expecting good things but as soon as we walked in that all changed. I made a reservation the day before (Make sure you do so. It could be over an hour wait) and we were seated almost right away. The food was terrific, the service was great and we all really enjoyed ourselves. The desserts were what everybody at the table was talking about. They couldn't wait for dessert. Although a bit pricey it was all well worth it. The kids loved the fondue. It was a great experience and I would recommend it and go back again.
