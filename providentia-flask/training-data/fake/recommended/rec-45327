They were awesome in a couple ways and disappointing in others.  I'd give them a 3.5 if I could. Pros: Overall, their congee was stellar (i mean it) and the clay pot rice was pretty good too in terms of texture and flavour.   Cons: The chicken & veggies were really thin on the clay pot rice.  I was shocked to only find 3 pieces of vegetables in their Chinese Broccoli dish.  Not the greatest bang for the buck.  And they forgot to pack one of our dishes when we took out the order!  They were promising enough though that I'd give them another chance.
