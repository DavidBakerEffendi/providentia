My first time in Philly, I told myself that I had to try one of their famous cheesesteaks.  This was actually a number of years ago when I went and Yelp was not quite born yet.   So I had to rely on some other places to pick my Cheesesteak destination.  So I did my research and it came down to the 2 legends in the Philly area, Pat's and Geno's and what luck I had, they were across the street from each other.  So once I got to Philly, all I had to do was drive to the intersection and then I could decide then where to go.   I picked the wrong place!!!  Pat's was the dirty looking place WITH a line and Geno's was the cleaner looking place WITHOUT a line...  I'll try my best not to make that mistake again.   Well, next time I am in Philly, guess I'll still have to try Pat's even the reviews for Pat's is not all that either but damn, these 2 places are part of the Philly culture and 1 definitely did not hit the mark so I gotta take my chances with the other.....   But I do definitely think I better have a couple other choices I better plan on going to try some Philly Cheesesteak....   I don't have any plans in the near future to visit Philly so I do have some time......
