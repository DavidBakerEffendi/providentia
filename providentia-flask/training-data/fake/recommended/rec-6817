We went here for the second time (GroupOn) and I really do like this place. The atmosphere 'takes you back'... kinda old and rustic. The service was prompt and friendly. The food was very good too. The mussels with Italian sausage was particularly good. I could easily have had that as a meal and not just an appetizer. The stuffed veal chop that I had and the Chilean sea bass my wife had were excellent. Desert too was very good... too good actually. Will probably go back with or without a coupon.
