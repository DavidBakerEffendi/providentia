First off the outside decor is not appealing and you might pass this place and think if was another diner in NJ. Once you get iniside you see plenty of patrons and a warm and professional staff.  This place cooks with love for thier dishes and the price is just right. Start of with shrimp/crab in a sauce smothered over advocado. I had filet of sole and the wife had chicken franchase. Very simple dishes which I had many times before but this was prepared differently and an improvment over past dishes. We even had room for dessert which was roccotta cheescake. I plan on returning often even if it's quite a drive from me.  Like Sylcain P. wrote previously, Eccola truly is a jewel in Parsippany. See for yourself and take a drive and indulge yourself.
