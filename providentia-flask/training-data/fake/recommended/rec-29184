This place came highly recommended, so my husband, a friend and I headed over there to fill our Chinese food cravings.  We were not disappointed.  The food is great!  We were seated downstairs in the "communal" area, which gave it a really cute, cozy ambiance.  The Dan Dan noodles are a MUST here - they are so good.  We also had the hot sauce beef (very spicy, but flavorful) and the dry fry style chicken (I don't usually like fried, but the batter was excellent).  Overall, we were so satisfied with the meal, I wouldn't be surprised if we end up there again tomorrow. The food does come out as it's done in the kitchen, so if you want  your food to come out all at once, that may be a drawback for you.  We were so hungry, we really didn't mind.
