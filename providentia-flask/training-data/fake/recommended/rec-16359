After a long hiatus we returned for dinner.  As predicted, we stood outside for 35 minutes before being seated at a family-style long array of connected tables.  No privacy here, though it's really great to see what everyone's eating to help you decide what to order.  Service was borderline terrible, we waited so long just to get drinks and you can tell their staff is spread very thin (everyone is sweating and rushing and stressed out).  Beyond that, the food was amazing.  We had the disco tots, bacon mac and cheese, and chicken and waffles.  Worth every calorie.   I really wish management would hire more staff and expand their seating.  They should also get rid of the bar space - total waste of space in an already cramped area if you don't serve alcohol. Overall, Queens Comfort is worth the wait if you're okay with eating in an hour and don't mind getting very little service but really bangin food.
