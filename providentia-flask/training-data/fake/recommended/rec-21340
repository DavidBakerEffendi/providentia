cute little shop nestled between rosario's pizza and epsteins. the ambience is nice- large communal tables, dim lighting, romantic italian meets grundgy les. I tried the lamb meatballs with spicy tomato sauce. Tasted them but Â I wasn't so amused by The Meatball Shop until.....I tried the Walnut Meringue ice cream sandwich. Holy Schmoly was it gooood! The meringue sandwiches were perfect and airy, not too heavy like the way cookies can be. The meringues are a tastier AND healthier low carb option. Paired with espresso ice cream, it was well worth 4$ (which btw was a good kick of energy for the night)
