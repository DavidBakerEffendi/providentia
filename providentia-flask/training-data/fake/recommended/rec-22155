This is, so far, my favorite restaurant in Williamsburg. The Scotch eggs were one of those dishes that I can honestly say impacted my worldview. Incredible. Also shared the lamb shank (awesome) and had some sort of chocolate dessert that was transcendant. It was far from light fare, to be sure, but worth every calorie. Service was polite and informed - none of this too-cool-for-school crap that gives the w-burg restaurant scene a bad rap. My friend had what seemed to be a perfect whiskey drink. Rye's ambiance and decor are Prohibition-era, much like other restaurants of its ilk, but overall it was cozy without being pointedly romantic. The type of place fit for a date or a night out with parents. I think with reservations, even a larger-ish group could have a good time. Really, though, it's all about the food. And the food is very, very good.
