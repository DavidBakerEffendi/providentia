Best Sushi in Vermont! Fairly priced, great service, good size portions, clean and friendly atmosphere! The new menu is a hit! Lunch special is a great value! Cocktails are spectacular! Sushi is prepared fresh and is served after only a short wait! Definitely worth at least a second visit, you'll be full before you can try all the new menu items!
