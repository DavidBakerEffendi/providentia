Parker & Quinn is the Refinery hotels excellent if a bit hipster (newspaper boy get ups for the male waiters. Really?) Restaurant. The restaurant's website says it "features classic, New York City design touches that span from the 1900s to today. " My partner said it looked like a "high-end Fridays," and i does have that slightly cluttery feel, but with much nicer wall paper. But overall it was a comfortable place. The space has a DJ so it's got a buzzy, somewhat loud vibe, which is ok, but it's not by any means quiet. The drinks and food were very good. I had an appetizer of perfectly fried oysters with cocktail sauce (which was your standard sauce).  We also shared some marcona almonds, which were tasty. My entree was an heirloom pork chop- country apple sauce and it was very nicely turned out.   My only complaint was the server didn't give me a chance to taste the wine (a $30 sauvignon blanc from Pajot Winery in France), but just poured out two glasses and plunked the wine in the chiller. Kind of an amateur move, but no real problem - it it had been bad, i could have spoken up. Otherwise was friendly and attentive, but oh, those hipster plaid scaly caps and skinny braces.... If you can take the costumes and the decorations for the theater they are, the food is good, and the place is comfortable.
