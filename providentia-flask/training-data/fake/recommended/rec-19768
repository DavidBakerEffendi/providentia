My parents were visiting and my mother said she wanted to eat at an italian place in little italy.  Based on Zagat/Yelp reviews, I chose this place. The atmosphere was very nice, though a little dark.  Great place to take a date if you want to impress! The service was top notch, though our waiter had b.o. issues...eeww.  We were seated right away and all of our questions were answered without hesitation. My father ordered the porterhouse.  My god that steak was HUGE!!  I kept asking if he had taken a bite yet, and could barely tell because it was the size of the plate.  Tasty steak indeed. My mother ordered the lamb.  I've never been a fan of the stuff, but she thought it was delicious.  I ordered a seafood dish, of which I don't recall the name.  It was fabulous! I will definitely come back to this place to impress friends/family/dates, etc.
