Generously accommodated our 13-person birthday party (with 2 weeks notice) Flamenco show was entertaining beyond expectation Service stood out as authentic Spanish - friendly, quick, not intrusive We never felt rushed to leave or clear out I recommend getting a dessert from the italian bakery next door if celebrating a birthday (they will bring it out and serve it as if you bought it there) Coming here will become a tradition! Highlights from the menu: Spicy clams Fried goat cheese Patatas bravas Gabas in garlic sauce Pomegranate champagne sangria
