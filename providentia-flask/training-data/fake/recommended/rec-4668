i am new to meat and have been traveling around the city eating burgers like it is my job. (seriously, can i get paid for this?) this was where i had my first burger upon hearing it was home of the best burger in the city. and it is pretty good. cheap, fast, the fries are tasty. the bistro burger is the way to go: a thick patty with cheese and bacon. though, Â hate the wait. dislike the crumbly bun that disintegrates before i finish eating. i live around the corner, so it works for me in the afternoons when the place isn't packed or on those lazy sundays when i walk by and the smell of burger draws me in.
