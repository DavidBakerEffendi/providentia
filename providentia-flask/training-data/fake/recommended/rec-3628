Great Toms Diner! The food was good, the service was awesome, and the decor is so vintage and amazing. They had some really interesting and delicious flavored butters. Their pancakes were great. The presentation isn't mind-blowing, but I thought everything was pretty tasty! Majority of the people I went with thought the food was just average, but they aren't really a fan of diner food. If you like diner food, you'll love Toms! Parking was hard to find, and so was the diner at first. Seating/space is really limited; I would say, it is not a good place to bring kids who move around a lot. It's also not really a good place to go to if you have a large group... unless you don't mind being split up into different tables/sections of the diner.
