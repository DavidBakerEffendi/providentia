Pretty discrete place. No big sign, just a small one on the door. Kind of dark inside. Ordered half a dozen oysters which were pretty tasty. Ordered the whole flounder and the filet mignon which was the special they had that day. The flounder was yummy but it wasn't deboned which would have made it easier to eat and less messy. The filet mignon was cooked just right and the special potato pancakes that came with it was pretty darn good. Better that the usual mash potatoes one would expect to get at other steak houses. It was a welcomed surprise. I would suggest, which I did to the manager, that they lay off the sauce a little bit. I found it to be too much and therefore a little overpowering of the steak. It was actually drenched in sauce. The dining experience was good, but a little loud. It was a little difficult for me to converse with my friend bc the music was blasting. Good for friends avoid if on a first date bc you'll have trouble hearing what they're saying.
