I love Filipino food.  I love anything Asian actually, but Fil food is one of my favorites and Grill 21 does a dandy job.  They do a great brunch/breakfast kind of thing with egg, rice, and longsilog (it's like having a Hawaiian breakfast).  They have cool little lumpia poppers.  And the pork belly is not just a party in your mouth, but one order can feed like a family of 5 - no joke!  When you eat here, you must wash it all down with the Filipino malt liquor called Red Horse.  The place is tiny, but never a wait.
