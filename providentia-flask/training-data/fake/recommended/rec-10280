Dish is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in Hartford. It is a modern space with a solid menu and good service. I agree with the previous reviewer who described it as a cross between Max Downtown and Trumbull Kitchen. Â I like that most of the food is farm to table but they don't oversell it. The ingredients are high quality, fresh and well prepared. I usually have the Filet Mignon but recently tried the Maine Diver Scallops and was very pleased. Dish also offers an excellent selection of appetizers. The Long Island Duck Confit Nachos, Fried Calamari and Shrimp and Grits are some of my favorites. The menu also features a modest but excellent raw bar. There is usually some live entertainment in the bar area but I have only ever enjoyed it from a distance. Dish is a great addition to Hartford's downtown scene.
