My mom loved the burger she had here!...and she doesn't even eat burgers, or American fast food for that matter. The beef was fresh and lean, and complimented with simple ingredients--tomato and onion (or whichever you decide)--and sandwiched by two pieces of toast. The simplicity and pureness of the burger is present and that's what people love. I'm a vegg, so I went with the egg salad sandwich. The egg salad filling is not overly-loaded with mayo. It was light and went very well with the toast. Everything's made fresh-to-order; long lines and at least a 30-minute wait, but it's cool to be surrounded by hungry people who are patient and dedicated enough to watch each order be prepared.
