loved, loved, LOVED it here. I was able to get a vegan fried chicken po' boy with spicy collard greens while my boyfriend got shredded bbq pork. the beer selection (and their knowledge of everything they served, including the beer) was amazing. service was perfect - our server had the menu memorized, and when our candle went out at our table, someone literally showed up in like, 30 seconds to replace it. great atmosphere, good music being played in the background, excellent mix of eclectic people. wish i lived closer!
