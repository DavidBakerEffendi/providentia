There are a lot of restaurants in NYC but very few are memorable and worth going back to. Meme is definitely one of those go to spots that you get cravings for.  The food is consistent and surprisingly very good.  Can't wait to go back.     The restaurant itself is tiny, but charming.  They also have outdoor seating when the weather is warm.  Perfect place to meet for brunch or dinner.
