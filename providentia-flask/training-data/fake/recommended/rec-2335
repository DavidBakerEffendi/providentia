FYI: that should be 3 1/2 stars, but Yelp doesn't do things in half measures. In all honesty, this place was pretty all right.  Service was great, they poured me a pretty decent glass of scotch.   Dinner came with a nice warm loaf of fresh bread.  My wife had a very good sirloin and I had a decent slice of prime rib.  Both were cooked perfectly, both came with some quality sides too.  She had some tasty rice, I had a nice side of mashed sweet potato; and the prime rib came with a very nice horseradish sauce- spicier than most places do it. but that salad bar was lame.  Lame lame lame.  Six bucks for a couple piles of limp greens?  A watery rice salad?  Some really suspicious looking marinated mushrooms?  Tiny, overspiced peel and eat shrimps?   thats weak sauce.  but am I being too hard on the steak restaurants salad bar?  Considering this place prides itself on its salad bar and I've seen bigger salad bars in college cafeterias I don't think I am.  also: six bucks!   I will go back, but I'm skipping the salad bar entirely and saving room for dessert.
