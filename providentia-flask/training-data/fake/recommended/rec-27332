DEEEEELISH, best street meat I've had - I noticed the chicken gyro I got was mostly white meat too. WARNING Â *hot sauce is HOT* and there are impersonators on the next corner... if you're standing at the cart with the longest line, you got the right one baby... but don't worry the line moves quick and you get a ton of delicious food for around $5!
