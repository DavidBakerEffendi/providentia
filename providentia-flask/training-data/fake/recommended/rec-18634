Yelpers, my best friend proposed to his longtime girlfriend in the middle of our meal at this restaurant last night. At this BURGER restaurant. That is the kind of food they serve at Umami Burger. Crazy things do seem to happen when you step into this place. First, EVERY TIME I have come here they have said the wait will be "around 25 minutes" and then call me or my group in anywhere between 5 and 10 minutes. Never more. So that is awesome. Second, this doesn't feel like a burger place. My friend seriously proposed here on the fly last night because it was so chill and the food was so absurdly good (in case you are wondering he had the Original Umami Burger with a side of the truffle fries and his belle had the Truffle Burger). I think he had been saving the ring for X-mas but damn, Umami Ketchup, Umami powder and glaze, shiitaki mushrooms, and a salty-crackly parmesan crisp will make you do crazy things. Third, I do not eat red meat. The only places I make an exception for are Katz's and Umami Burger. That is it. Anyway, I just want to also say that the staff was super nice to us during this entire thing and gave us free ice cream sandwiches on the house when they saw what had happened. Awesome food, awesome vibe, oh and one more thing: A lot of people will say to come early if possible and that is true, but if you can get here anywhere from like 10 to midnight the place is awesome, fun, and has pretty much no wait. Happy eating.
