Great spot for hot dogs! they serve sabretts pushcart style..plenty of toppings to choose from as well as fries and a few other menu items..its basically a tiny hole in the wall that serves as a hot dog truck..theres limited seating due to it being very small in there but there is also outdoor seating..most of the hot dog trucks serving sabrett hot dogs have disappeared in this area and this tiny restaurant is keeping that legend going..prices are good..and people are friendly..their hours are limited and its more of a lunch place, i think they close around 5?..i havent been there in a few months but when i lived in lincoln park i frequented them often and they would close early especially in the winter..i was always a traditional kraut and mustard kind of guy..im not a fan of chili or cheese typically on dogs or even chili in general..well i once heard a guy order a dog with "mustard, cheese, and potato" i liked the combination of things just not sure if i would like them all together and especially on a hot dog..well guess what? it was awesome! i never stopped getting them! the only thing is make sure you get/ask for the fried potatoes because they have 2 kinds of potatoes and i once got the wrong ones and it wasnt nearly as good..the fried potatoes are like home fries almost..i know a dog with cheese, mustard and home fries sounds weird but believe me, i am picky as hell when it comes to food and its definitely an experience..ive turned some friends on to trying a dog that way and they loved it..a few friends also tried chili dogs and they said it was awesome! one of the few true push cart style spots around this area!
