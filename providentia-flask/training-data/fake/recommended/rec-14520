Wow I'm amazed that after 600+ reviews only ONE Yelper has tried the DEEP FRIED TEMPURA PIZZA... and I can't believe they didn't like it! I don't know how to best describe it other than to say it is AMAZING and makes me want to learn how to make a good tempura batter so I can deep fry slices of Ellio's frozen pizza at home - you know, the kind you get at the supermarket in a box that come in rectangular slices - perfectly shaped for heating up in a toaster oven.  I used to eat those everyday as an afternoon snack after elementary school.  Actually, I still do, LOL.  Don't ever grow up. The pizza itself is very similar in taste and consistency to an Ellio's slice, sweet sauce, pretty cheesy and the dough has a nice chewiness to it.  Once it's deep fried you get this delicious, light, crunchy, tempura crust around the entire slice and Sake Bar Hagi just took eating pizza to a whole new level.  Sure, it could use a little more tomato sauce but I'm not complaining at all. So order yourself the Deep Fried Tempura Pizza, wash it down with a ice cold Sapporo, laugh at the people next to you ordering such pedestrian items as edamame and just think to yourself, life is good...
