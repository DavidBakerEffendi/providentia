It's worth the wait. Trust me. I have been wanting to go here for ages, and finally got around to it. Despite the long wait, it really didn't FEEL that long, Maybe because I was drinking gin and ginger ale while I waited. ;) We started with the deviled eggs and the devils on horseback. Both were delicious and just enough to peak the appetite, but not ruin it. I was FINALLY able to have the burger I had dreamt about for months. Perfectly medium rare, bun toasted just enough, topped with Roquefort. I was in love at first bite. The fries were really, really good. Not too thin, like most shoestrings are. We also split a bottle of wine, which was great, but I was too busy swooning over my food. Oh, and I also got engaged right after this meal, so it will forever hold a special place in my foodie heart. :)
