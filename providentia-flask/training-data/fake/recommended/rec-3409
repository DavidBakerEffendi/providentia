First of all, you have to try their homemade butter! As good as it gets!! I tried the cinnamon and the pumpkin and both were absolutely to die for! I got the pancakes based off a former recommendation and I was definitely not let down (especially coupled with the homemade butter)! The bacon and eggs were great, too but after tasting all of them, I was especially impressed with the pancakes! Also, the coffee was delicious as well! The place is small and sort of crowded, but it fits the restaurant itself. There are so many things to look at on the walls and it got voted the greenest storefront in 2009 and 2004 (I think those were the years at least). I'm not from here so I loved watching all the people and the noise going through the restaurant! You will not be disappointed going to Tom's, promise!
