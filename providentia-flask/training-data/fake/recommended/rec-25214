This little place is just a window front. There's no seating, but the coffee is solid. I stopped by on a Saturday and asked what everything on the list was because I hadn't heard of a lot of the items. The cafecito is equivalent to a sweetened espresso the Colada is like three shots of espresso- not to be consumed by one person the cortadito is pretty much a sweet macchiato elsewhere the cafe con leche was equivalent to a latte I got the last one and it was surprisingly strong. Other Spanish speaking restaurants would simply serve a cafe con leche with coffee and milk, but Boca's espresso really cut through all that milk to give the beverage a pronounced and flavorful cup. It was very satisfying. I highly recommend this place and would return if I ever found myself in this area again.
