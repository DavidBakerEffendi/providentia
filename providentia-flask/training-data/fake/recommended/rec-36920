Oh how I love thee.  British gastric pub and good food?  Who would have ever thunk it.  The boyfriend and I were here for dinner and really enjoyed how lively the place was.  We dined upstairs and the place was actually beyond capacity.   The bf sat on the outside and had his chair bumped every 15 seconds!  There really wasn't any room to move at all. I'm sure that's the usual experience for any new yorker (umm...the subway during rush hour anyone?), but it was quite odd for us.  While we were reveling in it all, our beer and food came.  I can't even begin to describe how excited we were. We started off with the gnudi--deliciously tender potato dumplings in a rich cheese sauce.  Oh, its orgasmic.  Then came the roquefort burger and steak.  The steak was delicious, but the roquefort burger was out of this world!  Our only regret?  Not ordering the devils on horseback--another specialty of the house.  Next time :) Hey, we're from CA and truly enjoyed our New York dining experience.  Was Spotted Pig ridiculously crowded? Yes, but it really made our dinner more interesting.  Do you wait a tad long for food and is it a bit difficult getting your server's attention?  Yes, but once you get your food you won't care. I can't wait to go back.  Ooooooh gnudi.
