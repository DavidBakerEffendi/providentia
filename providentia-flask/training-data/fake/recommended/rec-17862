Check out this hidden spot that just opened up in Rutherford, NJ.   There are alot of burger places opening up but once you come here and try the burgers and food you will taste the freshness and difference.  They make their burgers and fries fresh!  Meats from local meat supplier that has great rep! I recently tried the fried chicken sandwich with truffle Aoli sauce, I added a beef pattie in my sandwich!   I luv the flexiblity you have to get your sandwich the way you want! Order lots of fries! tasty!  BYOB...can't beat that!
