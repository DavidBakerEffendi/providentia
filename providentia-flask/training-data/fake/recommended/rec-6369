I just read the infamous (and hilarious) lobster story on Eater (ny.eater.com/archives/20â€¦) and it reminded me that I need to post a review of this place. I had a really great experience here! There were no angry lobster confrontations, only great food, a nice, cozy atmosphere, and friendly service. Oh yeah, and it's BYOB, which is pretty fantastic icing on the cake. Tip: There's a tiny wine shop right around the corner which probably gets a good half of its business from diners at Petite Crevette. If you forget to bring wine with you (as I did. D'oh!), you can just pop on into that wine shop and let them hook you up.
