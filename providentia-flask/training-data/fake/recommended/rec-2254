Twice I've tried to eat at Village Whiskey on regular weeknights but had to retreat because the bar area was full.  Each time I noted how small it was and that the crowd was full of energy.  Last night, the bar area was still full but I did carve out a small section of their 'standing' bar/counter area in the back.  I waited a few minutes looking at the menu before being approached by an incredibly friendly waitress that was very attentive and thoughtful. As others have stated, the menu isn't huge, but it doesn't have to be either.  I was there for the burgers which I had heard were better than Rouge.  There are two options but honestly neither got me that excited because of what was on them.  I ended up getting their Village burger cooked medium without the thousand island dressing and adding avocado and white cheddar and also ordering the duck fat french fries.  It arrived, I sliced it open and it was cooked absolutely perfectly.  The bun was amazing, avocado fresh, and the meat wonderfully juicy.  It was incredible.  As for the duck fries--eh...I've had MUCH better fries cooked in duck fat that actually tasted like duck fat, but they were okay. As for the comparisons to Rouge...well, the burger IS BETTER and I will come back here again before I hit up Rouge though Rouge is a great option.  Rouge is just more pretentious and Village Whiskey more neighborhoody and I like that.
