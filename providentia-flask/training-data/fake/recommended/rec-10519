I love you, Jimmy's Diner. Seriously, I do. We are always searching for some comfort food in good ol' W'burg. Lazy Catfish is....not up to par. Union wasn't up to par but the prices were decent, then they disappeared. And now....I get a warm feeling in my gut when I think of Jimmy's. The brisket is as good as it gets for us East Coasters. The pulled pork is dreamy. The mashed potatoes...let's just say that good mashed potatoes is hard to find. MUST TRY THE MILKSHAKES. I kid you not. The mocha malted milkshake is to die for. Please Jimmy's, please don't ever go away. I'd be so lost without you. Greasy joints are good for the soul.
