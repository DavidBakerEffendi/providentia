Imperial's interior was just recently completely revamped and the results are beautiful! They now offer Hibachi which I haven't tried, but judging from the happy cries of delight I'd say people love it. I enjoy eating in the dining room from time to time, but primarily I stop by for take out. Everything they make is delicious and fresh. My staples include chicken with broccoli, sesame chicken, teriyaki beef, and crab rangoon all of which I would recommend to anyone in a heartbeat! They also have a wonderful sushi chef! My girlfriends favorite roll is the spicy tuna roll, and she claims it the best sushi in new jersey!
