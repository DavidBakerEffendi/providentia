Finally a good & affordable Mexican spot in Montclair. We hand enchiladas and chimichanga with nachos app.  All the food was fresh and tasty and the wait staff very good.  The place falls a little short on ambiance; it was was about half full when we were there last week. BYOB and have fun; seems like a good place for a group of friends to hang.  Will definitely return.
