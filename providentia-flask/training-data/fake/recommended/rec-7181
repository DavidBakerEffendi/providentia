The waitress was really nice and accommodating. My friends ordered the frittata and mac n cheese with green tea, while I got the mozzarella and cheddar on brioch and macchiato. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, but my friends did not like the green tea drink. They said it was gritty, foam kept separating, and was simply flavorless/watery. Nonetheless, there is an extensive list of beer/cider, which means Â I will be back!
