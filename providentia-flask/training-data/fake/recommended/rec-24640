I nearly walked past the door several times because it's doesn't have a large, obnoxious sign outside, and when I stepped inside I realized why! It's a hidden gem! Decorated very contemporary, you would think your meal was going to cost you a pretty Park Slope Penny, but the price points are ridiculously reasonable. This is probably why the place was packed Luckily for us, we were able to get a table fairly quickly. After we were seated, I looked up to see a line of at least 15 people waiting for tables to open up. The service was friendly, fast, and the food was delicious. I couldn't have been happier with my meal. They serve alcohol. That's always a plus. Honestly, the only drawbacks I could think of is that it's Cash Only. And the open kitchen does fill the restaurant with the pungent fragrances of the various meals they are preparing, and this will stick to your clothes and hair if you're in there long enough. Neither of these two reasons will keep me from eating here again, though.
