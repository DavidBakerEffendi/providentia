They say it's a full bar... It's not. Cocktails are "measured" and therefore are straight juice. There are no appetizers or bar food just main dishes that have no appeal. Pig knuckle had no flavor just drenched in sauce. Hot dogs aren't really hot dogs, they have no bread and are just sausage and sauerkraut. Pickles were really cucumbers. French fries are decent. 2 stars because the music wasn't terrible and I like the beer garden decor.
