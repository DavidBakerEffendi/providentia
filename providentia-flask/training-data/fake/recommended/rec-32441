I first came here to get some pho for my sick boyfriend, but they gave me free lemonade and cake as well! The second time around, I brought him with me and we both had the Banh Mi, sooo good and so cheap! No free lemonade this time, but still free cake. When the waitress handed it to us, she told us she made it herself. Definitely a very sweet family owned business and great service. Only qualm I had was the interior, not sure what was going on when they were decorating the place, also it was warm in the room since we went in the summer with just a few fans blowing around.
