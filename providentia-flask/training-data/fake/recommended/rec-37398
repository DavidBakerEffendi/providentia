I had dinner at the Pleasant Street Restaurant very recently on a quiet night. The casual dining room is fully carpeted with ample table seating and candlelight at each table. The menu offerings include steaks, seafood, chicken, pasta, prime rib, apps, salads, soups, and sandwiches. Prices for entrees $10.95-$18.95. Specials are also offered. A kids menu is available and most dinner entrees include starch and vegetable plus a salad and dinner rolls. On Friday and Saturday nights, they offer homemade popovers. I was promptly seated as I walked in. My waitress (an older lady) offered me a drink (I stuck with the house water) and highly recommended the Lasagna Special ($12.95), which I did order. I started out with a basic tossed salad (served in a bowl) which had fresh iceberg, tomato, carrot, cucumber, red onion, and carrot, dressing on the side. The dinner roll was soft and warm. The Lasagna was a pretty good sized piece, which had six layers including a thick cheese layer (with ricotta) and a thick ground beef layer, firm noodles, and topped with mozzarella cheese and a sweet tasting tomato sauce. I was provided with shredded parmesan cheese to top my dish. The lasagna was very hearty and filling to eat and had the good flavors of a homemade Italian lasagna-plenty of cheeses, meat, and tomato sauce. I had half the piece boxed to go and the check presented in timely fashion. The service was good and my waitress refilled my cold water glass a couple times. I do need to return here on a Fri or Sat night since I do love hot popovers (Yorkshire pudding), especially with surf & turf. NOTE: Do not park in the plaza across the street or you will be towed. There is free on-street parking in front of the restaurant. HOURS: Mon-Thur: 11AM-8:30PM; Fri: 11AM-9PM; Sat: 4PM-9PM; Sun: Closed
