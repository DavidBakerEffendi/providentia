Tried this place for the first time last night. I gotta say, it was impressive. We got there early, and it was empty at about 6:30. By the time we left an hour or so later, the place was mostly full. You can see what they're reaching for here with the Eleven Madison Park and el Bulli cookbooks on display. And for the price, location and casual nature of the place, they are achieving a lot. What we ate: BLT Buns, Korean BBQ Wraps, Scallops and Fried Chicken. It was just enough food for two people to try a bunch of different flavors and techniques. Everything was screaming for Siracha though. Order of deliciousness for me: Scallops, BLT, Fried Chicken and the BBQ Wraps. You can get better bbq wraps at much divier places. This is supposed to be elevated? All in all, with a $32 bottle of totally drinkable wine, and it was a nice dinner for two on a random Thursday night. I will definitely go back if/when I'm in the area.
