The "Meh. I've experienced better." that pops up when you select 2 stars as your rating completely and perfectly characterizes our visit here. Although it was still light outside, we walked in here and immediately felt like it was midnight.  It was so dark!  I'm not talking about mood lighting - I'm talking dark in a dingy, put-you-to-sleep kind of way.  The decor was weird and lacking in a unified theme.  On the walls behind the bar they had stapled up some dollar bills, foreign currency, some computer print-out photos of people (who? I donno), and some beer awards from the 90's. My boyfriend and I each wanted to get a little sampler of different pours.  The bartender, who barely mustered a greeting when we sat down, handed us two coasters and just had us write down our orders ourselves on the back of the coasters.  Yeah?  Okay.  Whatever.  By all means - I came here on vacation to do your job for you. Our beers were all warm.  All of them.  Why?  We finished our beers, were underwhelmed by them all, and got our check from another bartender (since our first one never came back over to us to check on us or see if we needed anything...). This was our least favorite place during our 4-day stay in Burlington.
