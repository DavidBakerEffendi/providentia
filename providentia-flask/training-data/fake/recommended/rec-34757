Beautiful sandwich.. I had the Roast Pork, Spinach and Provolone..so simple, so good. Its one of those sandwiches where you eat every bite to the last piece because the juices from spinach that run down to the roast pork on to the bread is magic. Â You savor every bite because it is that good. I am so sad that I live in NY and this sandwich is alll the way in Philly =/
