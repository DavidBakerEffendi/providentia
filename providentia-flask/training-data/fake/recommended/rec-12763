Came on the off hours which I recommend to anyone who wants to go! It's a small tiny place the food is super amazing!! The blueberry pancakes are AMAZING!! Probably the best pancakes I've ever had!! The eggs Benedict are really good also, and are put on a biscuit instead of a muffin...super good! If your in the area, come here!! It's good!
