Jane's brunch... I mean, what can you say? I came for the vanilla bean french toast, I ate the vanilla bean french toast & I was beyond satisfied. So much so that my dining companion was forced to eat one piece from my giant serving. Our server suggested a get a side of strawberries and bananas to go with my entree and it was a great idea, the fruit was fresh & delicious. We opted to come at the end of brunch as to avoid the crowds, and with a 3:15PM reservation we thought we would have missed the rush, but we were wrong! The place was still packed, with a line out the door, which bodes well for Jane! The food was quite good, the service average. It might have been because we were tucked into a corner, but it was hard to get & hold our server's attention.
