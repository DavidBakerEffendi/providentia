A buck or two more than breakfast usually costs but well worth it!  I'm in this area temporarily and I've become addicted.  First I had the bacon and blue cheese frittata. Next the barking chihuahua .  Then a couple omelets followed by the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had!  Excellent food!  High quality ingredients!  Good service!  Nice atmosphere!  And the fried potatoes are much better than you normally get at a breakfast joint!  I will miss this place!!!
