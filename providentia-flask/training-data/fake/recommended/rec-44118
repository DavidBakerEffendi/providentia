New Year's Day, walked in off the street, warmly greeted, we asked for the bar seating, very cosy, acceptable level of music, projections on the wall, low lighting but the servers had little keyring torches if you needed them (yay I love that). Â Excellent charred octopus followed by light fluffy pastry empanadas, and duck flatbread, washed down with a couple of pretty good strength mojitos, modern Cuban cooking, not cheap but well executed and a relaxing overall dining experience.
