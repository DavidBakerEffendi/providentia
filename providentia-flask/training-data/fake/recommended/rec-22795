Last time I has food here it was great. This time, not so much. Had a Reuben with French fries and cole slaw. The freshest thing on my plate was the ketchup. Additional salad was ok. The server was friendly, personalable, and nice. I just hope that football Sunday doesn't make them think they can slack on quality food
