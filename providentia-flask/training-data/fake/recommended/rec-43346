Worths special trip. Very high quality food. Don't be turned off by the location in the strip mall with Shoprite. The atmosphere is warm and pleasant and friendly. The food shows the loving care of the chef. I had Tortelli Monte Carlo which was one of the weekly lunch specials. Sauteed jumbo shrimp, mushrooms & asparagus with cheese filled tortellinis tossed in a pink rose sauce. $8.75. Excellent!
