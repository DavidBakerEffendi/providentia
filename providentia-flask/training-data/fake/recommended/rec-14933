Overall: Interesting spot, missable and off the path but worth checking for a great tap list and solid bar food. Service is tolerable.. order drinks until it reaches "good". _________________________________ Ambiance: 2/5. Dark bar gives way to a darker dining room, sunken, woody, and seating maybe 40. The dim lighting preserves some intimacy despute the blaring classic rock, and general bar atmosphere, though both bar and dining room vacant for 9 on Friday. _________________________________ Service: 2/5. Just once I'd like a check to be asked "split the check?" before it's brought over. Is this not standard enough yet in 2013? Service is impersonal and perfunctory, but otherwise timely and satisfactory in keeping libations and water filled. _________________________________ Drinks: 3/5. Solid beer selection.. but that's dime/dozen in Philly. Still, taps are full of choices, locals and styles. Bottle list shows care for quality and variety, Russian River included. Mixed drinks go unmentioned; my request for a pisco sour could not be satisfied. _______________________________ Food: 3/5. Fried green tomato BLT - The toast could use more flavor, but otherwise good. Bacon is well cooked and flavorful. The juicy fried green tomatoes burst. And there's just enough spice from the tobasco to make me miss it. Mac and Cheese - Equally impressive. The crust on top corrobates the "baked" claim. It also provides a great texture contrast: creamy interior house in the thick and cruncy surface. Flavor is standard.
