There are only two reasons not to go to Hell's Kitchen Lounge: - You're on a first date and you want to really impress your date - You're too uptight and stodgy Aside from that, Hell's Kitchen Lounge has more than average bar food. wait, that's not fair. Really it's restaurant quality wrapped in a bar. Now, it's not fancy restaurant food. It's still burgers, tacos, burritos, and salads but calling it bar food isn't accurate. Sure, they have loud music (really loud), a very casual vibe, burlesque (true story), and live music, oh, and I think they have karaoke too but they're good people. My recent trip uncovered an upcoming indoor/outdoor concert to benefit a local dog rescue. So give it a try... unless one of those two bullets apply to you.
