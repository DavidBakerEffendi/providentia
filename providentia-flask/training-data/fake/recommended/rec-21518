This place is great, lots ofnattitude in the food and elsewhere. One of the best brunch places i've been to and definitely the best in philly so far. Try the spicy bloody mary. Â I've never had the same thing twice and never had a bad food experience here. They add a twist onto all of the dishes they make. If you live in philly you shouldve been here and if you just moved you should go here immediately
