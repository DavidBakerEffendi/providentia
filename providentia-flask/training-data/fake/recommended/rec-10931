i've been here twice.once for a date and once for my birthday dinner. i think the fact that this is where i chose to go for my bday says a lot considering it still doesnt have a liquor license. what i love about this place is that it had no hype. i didnt read any reviews and i had no idea what i was going to get. i was pleasantly surprised both times. in my opinion, this place is better than totonno's, grimaldi's, roberta's, and paulie gee's. but definitely not better than difara's.  since this place is still so new (and totally uncrowded), the wait staff is especially attentive and aim to please.  i docked a star because it's pricey. i'm excited there's so much great food opening up in our hood.
