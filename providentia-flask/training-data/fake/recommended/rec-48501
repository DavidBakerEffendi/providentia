Bangers and Mash.  Quite the Brittish dish.  It was such a huge disappointment.  The menu described it as grilled Irish sausage with vegetables over a mushroom sauce.  What I received was 3 breakfast sausage links that were undercooked and were clearly prepared on a griddle.  The vegetables were abysmal and mashed potatoes were bland. The mushroom sauce was served in a small cream saucer and was also disappointing.  My coworkers meals were also not quite what they expected.  The beer and service were great but the food was just so poor.   I will not be coming back any time soon unless it's for drinks only.
