I friend of mine suggested this place because of the plentiful vegetarian options. It was okay. The General Tso's was like corndogs -- really thick breading. The peanut chicken dish was good. But look for something with veggies in the description if you want them, because it seems like the mock meat was the showstopper. I like a mix of both. Usually I lament living in the 'burbs and wish I had easier access to downtown dining. But Golden Empress was nothing compared to Montco's Wild Ginger.
