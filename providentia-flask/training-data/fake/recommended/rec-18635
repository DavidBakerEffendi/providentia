The Jolly Goat is the tiny little gem of an espresso joint you wished you had in YOUR neighborhood. Stumptown roasts, expertly poured espresso, lattes and Cortados, etc., and really nice people working there. Had a conversation with one of the baristas yesterday and we resumed our conversation just like I was a regular on this morning's visit. What's to not like? Nothing. Very highly recommended.
