They have some good items, particularly the Mexican falafel sandwich and the Baja Fresh salad. I'm removing one star because I think they are a bit pricey for their falafel sandwiches/salads. Unlike what some reviewers posted, I would not say the salad is big enough for two lunches...and I don't consider myself to have a particularly large appetite. I'm removing two stars because i have specifically gone here to try out their T-Rolls on 5 different occasions only to be told they are not available that day. The first time I was told they were not available yet (even though they spammed my email with advertisements about them). All of the following times I've gotten there and waited in the long line just to be informed that they're not available that day and that I should try the following day. I don't think the T-Rolls really exist...so why are they on the menu? I won't be making the effort to come here anymore...
