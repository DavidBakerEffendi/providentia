I went here thinking this place was really awesome from the reviews. Little did I know it was very over rated! While the food is adequate at best it was over spiced and nothing special to be honest. The venue is nice and the lounge area is prob your best bet. Our waitress was very pushy and kept pushing us to order more when we ended up ordering 6 dishes that neither one of us ended up eating, those fries that they rave about are also nothing special! This place is way more hype than actually good. I'd go there for a drink and a app or two but nothing more!
