So I really don't want to like this place, because upon coming here the service was very rude, waited for a table for an hour, people that  came after us were seated before us all because of  neglect. An hour passed which felt like 3, so finally we were seated waited another 30 min for them to bring us our food. Once it arrived... LET ME TELL YOU!! This is by far one of the best crepes i have had. Food was great, but staff was rude and not vey accommodating. The original 15 min wait turned into an Hour, if its an hour wait say  its an hour and let the people decide what they want to do, dont tell them 15 mins and then give them attitude when they ask about the status of their table 45 mins later. Due to that I cannot give them more then 2 Stars, they  had completely ruined my mood and my party's mood and made us feel like our business was unwanted there. Food is  good, but is it worth the wait and a rude staff? Hmmm  its not THAT good.
