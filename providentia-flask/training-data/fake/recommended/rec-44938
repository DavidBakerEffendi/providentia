I just hosted a work dinner downstairs in their private room. The bill came out to $100 per guest including a 4 course meal and wine. The staff was excellent, We had about 3 waiters for a group of 20 people. The food was outstanding. We offered braised short ribs, chicken or salmon with sides of mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and fried string beans. Tuna tartare and salads were good. I even had the bread pdding which was delicious as well. Yum all of it was delicious. Will definitely use this restaurant again for my next private work dinner!
