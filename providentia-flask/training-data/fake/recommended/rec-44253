So I've always been hesitant to go in to Kumo because of their 50% off sign.  'It can't be good quality sushi if it's 50% off right?' I'd tell myself.  But the other night, we walked over to Kumo to fill our sushi craving.   Let me tell you, it wasn't bad at all! We had nine different rolls.  The stand outs were their custom rolls - the Yummy roll and the Incredi-roll.  Another favorite was the Peanut and Avocado roll.  It was a great contrast of textures and flavors.  All the other rolls were solid as well.   The atmosphere was pretty chill.  There was a young couple on an awkward date, a large group of (presumably) grad students, etc.  Our service wasn't as terrible as other reviews had mentioned.   Really if you just want cheap(!), solid sushi in this area, I would recommend Kumo.  If you want to have your mind blown by your sushi, go to Japan. A good 4 stars, mostly based on price vs. quality.
