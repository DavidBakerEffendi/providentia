The Best Beer Selection you will ever find in a small town. If I did not participate in the MBA and PHD programs I would have never tried and loved so many new beers. The food is ok. I have not strayed far away from appetizers and burgers but, people I was with have raved about many menu items. If you are looking for a fun place to hang out or even enjoy an outdoor meal on the patio this place is great.
