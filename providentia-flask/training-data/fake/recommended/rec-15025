What a difference a year makes....we have been goint to Bishop's Collar for brunch the past few years following the JDRF walk in Philly.  The food and service has always been great and the beer list is nice. The place was always packed. This time our waitress was unfriendly before we even sat down. Our butts weren't even in our seats when she came over and abruptly asked "Do you know what you want?". She seemed annoyed with us from the moment we walked in. Anyway,out of six entrees we had one french toast that was completely raw and wet in the middle and an order of nachos that had some sort of sour smell emanating from it. We did not eat them, and when the waitress asked why, we told her they smelled funny.  She then replied  "Oh, you are the second person that has mentioned that today -- maybe the chili is bad..."  WHAT?!  She did take it off the bill though.  I think there might be a problem here because in retrospect we did notice the place was pretty empty.  Only two other tables were dining inside and no one was outside.  A year ago, this was a place where you would be lucky to get a table -- sad to see.
