I was recently here and ordered the Calamari special as an appetizer (balsamic vinegar, cherry peppers, and chorizo) and it is quite possibly my favorite calamari I've ever had. For dinner we ordered the Pesto pizza as well as the Pizze di Montclair and both were delicious. This place is a BYO with great food, good service, and inexpensive. I have recommended this place to friends and family since visiting and plan on going back in the near future.
