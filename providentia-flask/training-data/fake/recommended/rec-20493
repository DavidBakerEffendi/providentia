The people who opened this place are absolute geniuses!  Flights of Bacon?  Yes please!  I had the Bacon lobster roll and Bacon salt seasoned tater tots I will be dancing about it until the end of time.   The prices are great.  I was expecting our bill to be well over 200 but it was way under.  The service is amazing.  I will be a frequent customer here.
