This is place is, quite literally, dripping with awesome sauce. Possibly the best breakfast food you'll have in the city.  The Barking Chihuahua is pretty much the most hardcore (and biggest) breakfast burrito ever, and is also razy delicious. The pancakes and french toast are dense and sweet and chewy.  If only they'd serve up some real maple syrup, it'd be perrrrrfecto.
