We came to Salinas to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and really enjoyed our experience overall.  It is a beautifully designed restaurant.  The surrounding area is a bit dull but very misleading as others have pointed out, as once you're inside - you follow a dimly-lit pathway to a gorgeous back garden area filled with plush blue chairs & dark, sleek furniture.  There was a dull hum of music in the background that helped set the vibe but didn't overpower the room in any way. We both tried the signature drinks & were not disappointed.  The food was also very good - from the shishito peppers appetizer to the grilled chicken entree.  The patatas bravas were some of the best I've ever had! Our server was very sweet, but not the most attentive.  It was pretty clear that the entire staff was still finding their groove together.  They were moving around the dining room rather chaotically which was a bit distracting during our meal.  But this is something that will hopefully improve over time since the restaurant just opened a few weeks ago. I had also told them that it was my boyfriend's birthday when I made the reservation.  I had asked that they bring out a specific dessert to surprise him when our meal was finished vs. bringing us the dessert menu.  While that failed to happen, I was able to sneak away to the hostess who quickly remedied the problem.  After a short wait, our waitress came out with a yummy chocolate cake dish that had been personalized with my boyfriend's name & a happy birthday sign for the table.  That, along with the fact that they comped the dessert, were both thoughtful touches. While there are still some kinks to work out, I think Salinas would make a great date spot or place to meet up with some girlfriends and recommend giving them a try!
