I was stoked to come back after a long 3-year hiatus.  Last time, I was at the Sheraton around the corner from this place so I tried the cart during lunch and dinner time and I think they are both good even though they are different carts (the one at night has no tomatoes).  The price is still the same, $6!   We came here for dinner after going to the Moma on Friday (FREE from 4p-8p on Fridays - Thank you Target sponsor!).  There was a line but it went quickly.  We sat on that building thing next to the cart and there were a lot of people sitting there alone or with friends despite the light rain.  We ate our leftovers later that night at the hotel and it was still good!  Combination plate is the way to go!  If you can't stand spicy, only get a little bit of the hot sauce for taste.  If you have a sensitive stomach, use the white sauce sparingly.       YOU MUST TRY ONCE on your trip to NYC!  Even if you're not hungry, come and split the dish with someone for a snack!
