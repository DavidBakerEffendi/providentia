I read the reviews but, I like seafood and I was determined to try it and I loved this place. Yes there was a short wait, but it was a weeknight so I guess service was better. Yes, the staff is pretty busy, but they can and will most definitely tend to be more attentive to cool and friendly people like me & my guest :-) The crowd is very diverse, & I assume that the folks who had a bad time here were probably snobbish. This place is very relaxed so if you are uptight, don't go here.  We were seated on the mid level, lovely views of the waterfront. Our order came out right away, and we were very pleased with the service, even though our hostess took our food order on behalf of our waiter, but once he came, he was more than pleasant and very personable. Loved the pool table on the ground level also, got a couple of games in at the end. Overall the staff seemed pretty friendly, and down to earth. The shrimp, fries, and calamari were great. The mac and cheese could have been better. Didn't exactly like the shared tables, that they have, but after a drink I didn't even remember the other folks at the other end of the table. The Pina Colada was amazing.  ~ Enjoy
