Another "Steak On A Stone" fan here! I have to thank my girl (Hi May!) for telling me about this place because I would have never found out about it on my own. I've been to a few Portuguese restaurants but none of them have what Restaurant Valencia is best known for - its Filet Mignon on a Hot Stone (which you can see from 99.9% of the reviews). My bf and I came here with my best friend and her husband on an early Sunday afternoon. We had no issues finding street parking a block from the restaurant. We were seated right away with no wait. Between the 4 of us, we shared the Empanadas & Mussels for appetizers. I can't remember the prices but they were reasonable and the portions were more than enough, since we had some mussels left over. My bf and I decided to share the Filet Mignon on a hot stone since we were told that it was a lot of meat and it sure was. This also comes with a House Salad to start off with, Rice, & homemade Chips. When the meal arrives to the table, the large stone comes out super hot with a side of butter and you cook the meat yourself. [NOTE: You will def smell like food after this meal!] I was surprised at how long the stone stayed hot, but it managed to remain hot enough to cook all our meat. With all the hype, I still loved it! The steak was delicious and juicy and it was a cool experience of being able to cook it ourselves. We also ordered a Seafood Paella for the table to split and it was great! Came out in a large container with all the seafood spilling out. Delicious! In the end, it was sooo much food that we ended up doggy bagging a lot of it. The place was nice. Staff was friendly, but the service was slow. Towards the end of our meal, a band started playing while going from table to table . At one point it got so loud we weren't able to have a conversation. That was a little annoying. I'll still be returning though cause the food was great!
