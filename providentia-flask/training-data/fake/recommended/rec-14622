Look, it's a great lobster roll ... for New York. Admittedly I'm a snob seeing as I end up in Maine at least twice a year but what can I say, gotta call it like it is: Solid restaurant, nice choices (bisque, roll, mac & cheese, whole dinner, blt), fresh and good tasting lobster. I find lobster is hard to work with because it's a flavor that's so easy to smother... their lobster rolls have great subtle seasoning (whether it's straight up butter or their homemade mayo) that really enhances the dish. Biggest problem is getting all the way to Red Hook to have it... Holla to the technicolor lobster on the wall in the dining room and the bizarre pin up with a lobster molesting a chick by the counter.
