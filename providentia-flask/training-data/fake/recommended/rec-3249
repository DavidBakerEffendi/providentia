Started at the bar. Then went to table. Service was horrific. Do NOT waste your time or well hard earned money. The bartenders are so cocky except the female blonde. But the service bartender was such a douche he ruined our night. Â He was so disrespectful and unprofessional that he has no idea who he has been rude to.
