Mac n cheese and the beet salad were the top contenders!! The place is slightly dark but the decor is cute and industrial-like, very Wiliamsburg-ish.   The staff was excellent - the drinks selection were nice. It's not a huge place so if you are going to show up, avoid peak hours, unless you have to.  I also tried the country chicken steak and the fried chicken.  The grits were made slightly different... but it was still yummy. Very good place.  We're definitely coming back again!
