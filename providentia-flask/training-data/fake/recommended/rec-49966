yum yum yum yum yum $3?! yum yum yum yum yum However. I have to agree that the falafel sandwich isn't as good as it used to be. Even a year ago you count on heaps of fresh cabbage and lettuce, but I ate there twice last week and both times were slightly less than awesome. Still great for $3, but not as fresh as it used to be.
