Ive eaten at Malagueta on numerous occasions and have NEVER been disappointed with anything. The restaurant itself is beautifully furnished and maintained. The staff are incredibly nice and helpful (if you are having trouble deciding what to order) and the food is always amazing. Most recently i ordered the Picanha (a steak dish, with rice, black beans and yucca flour seasoned with bacon) which was cooked perfectly and seasoned so well. If you are in the mood for Brazilian or just great food then this is the place to be.
