It seems this spot is probably a better choice for dinner - my friend and I had brunch here and just thought it was ok and nothing that stood out as amazing. The brunch menu is rather limited, and what we did end up getting lacked taste. The enchiladas were bland, as was everything else. On a more positive note, the cocktails are very reasonably priced, and are by no means weak. The bloody mary was good, but could have used more heat.
