I consider myself a mac 'n cheese aficionado. As such, I only ask one thing of others in this life: Do not EVER f###ing test me with crap mac 'n cheese. In that respect, Suppa did right by me this evening. Though I adhere to the teachings of the Betty Crocker School of mac 'n cheese, and Suppa's mac 'n cheese was not that, I would still classify it as a class I drug according to D.E.A. guidelines (e.g., no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse).
