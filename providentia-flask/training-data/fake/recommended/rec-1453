Best burgers in all of Philadelphia. This place is great from the moment you walk in to the point you pay the check and head out. Great variety of seating. Don't want to sit at the bar but like sitting up high - they got you covered. Take a seat in one of their bar-height booths and chairs. Like a regular table and booths? Got them too. There a doorway that separates the bar area with a main dining room. It's barrier cuts out noise in the dining area if you are on a date and want some quiet privacy. Drinks selection is amazing. Great brews on tap; plus, you can't beat the two brews on their old fashioned hand-crank type taps. Delicious.  Great selection too. If you go in here and order a Miller Lite - I will personally end you. Food-----oh the food!!!  The menu changes regularly, but the one constant is their burgers. GET THE BURGER!  You will not be disappointed. I also recommend the smelts as an appetizer. Delicious, little, lightly-fried fishes. If you haven't made it to this NoLibs jewel yet, you're doing your life a severe disservice.
