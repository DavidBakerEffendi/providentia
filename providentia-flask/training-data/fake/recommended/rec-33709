I'm hesitant to write this review because somehow, this remarkable little restaurant on the corner of Hicks and Cranberry flies under the radar. It's right down the street from me, so my husband and I have eaten her innumerable times for dinner and for brunch. We have been really blown away by the quality of food that's served here. The dishes are complex, but not pretentious, and the quality is consistently high. On a recent autumn night, I had amazing meal of braised short ribs with brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes that was just superb. For an appetizer, we split the cabbage salad, which was terrific. I have to admit that It's taken this place a while to hit its stride service-wise, but the last few times I've been there, they've knocked it out of the park. Also, the brunch is fantastic. I always have trouble deciding between the oysters benedict, the pancakes and the smoked trout salad, but smoked trout usually wins out. It's such as unique and wonderful dish, a real treat that I never see on menus elsewhere. The bloody marys are excellent here too. Like everyone else, I give high marks to the bartender. The cocktail selection is really original, and very much reminiscent of Little Branch. We've thought about coming here for cocktails to close out the night - wish they stayed open later! 5 stars.
