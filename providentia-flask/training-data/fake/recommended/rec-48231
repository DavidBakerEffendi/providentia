So like everyone else's list when the visit Philly mine went something like this: See the birthplace of our Country: check See the Phillies play: check Have a real philly cheese steak: check x3 So everyone said that we had to visit Pats and Genos. I decided to add a dark horse into the debate Philips. Boy was I glad that I did. This was our first stop and the best stop!. Here is the lowdown: I had a plain jane cheese steak with (that's Philly talk for with onions) It was 100% AWESOME. The Perfect meat to bun ratio. Quality steak and full of flavor. So my answer to the great cheesesteak debate? Philips The only downside is its seems to be in a rough part of town. However on the flipside of that, there were no long ass lines full of tourists. Another quick tip the GPS lies when you are trying to drive from Philips to the other 2 cheese steak joints. Yes, they are on the same street but it was a little journey trying to get there.
