CHEAP beer and bang-for-your-buck burger with sub-par fries in an grimy, poor-service yet overcrowded bar... People who want to FEEL like they are "real, hardcore" new yorkers who are familiar with the "unique and hidden" places go here. I'm confident in my identity as a new yorker; I don't need to go to a cheap dive-bar to reconfirm my identity.
