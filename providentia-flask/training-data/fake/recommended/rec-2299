When visiting Philadelphia last week for a conference, some of my colleagues and I went to McGillin's.  I'm not a huge fan of beer, but I enjoyed the pinot noir I ordered.  This bar had a great atmosphere, and the general consensus at our table was that the people singing karaoke just HAD to be professionals.   The best part:  we got to see someone be physically thrown out of the bar.  He even gripped the door frame in an attempt to stay inside.  You don't have to worry about your safety at this place!
