hmm... so I have very mixed feelings about this place these days. I went in late January and it was pretty empty on a friday evening but the food was wonderful and cheap and we all had a great time. I came back, very excited, in May and the place was PACKED - swarming with college aged kids and large parties. Obviously the news is out that this joint makes a great BYO spot due to its enjoyable atmosphere and free margaritas (if you bring tequila). Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the staff can keep up with the restaurant's popularity these days. The service took a long time, the food took even longer, and unfortunately, the quality of the grub was stunningly bad compared to our first visit. I got the chimichanga, which was fine, but almost everything else that we ordered was subpar. With great power comes great responsibility! I'm not going to give up on this place just yet, but they need to hire some more staff or something, because they obviously can't handle the heat.
