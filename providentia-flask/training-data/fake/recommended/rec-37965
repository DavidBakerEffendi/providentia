If Joey is in, you're in for a treat. He makes truly amazing food. The other lady that cooks when he isn't there is the reason for all these negative reviews. I've eaten here over a dozen times, and the only time i've been unhappy with the food was when she was making it. This place is a fantastic choice for authentic thai food that is not expensive, but it is only worth it if Joey is in-house.
