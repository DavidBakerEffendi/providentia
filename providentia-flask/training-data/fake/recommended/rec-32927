This is a typical buffet with a large variety of food none of which is really that good.  It is mostly Chinese despite the Japanese name.  The food from the grill is average at best.  I would say the best part of the buffet is the duck although the one I got had a piece of duck that was mostly fat.   If you like buffets with a large number of items and value quantity over quantity then this would be satisfactory option.  If you value quality and would rather pay more for it then skip this place. Unfortunately I don't think this place will last any longer than the last Japanese buffet that was in its place.  If you want Japanese buffet then Minado's is probably still the best option.
