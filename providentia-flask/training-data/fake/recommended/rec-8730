The best paella I have had outside of Spain. Such a pleasant and professional staff, such a cozy and romantic dining room (really low light level, and you sit very close to other tables), and menu that I hear constantly changes. Â I will most definitely recommend to couples for a great meal at a fair price. I went for two reasons, it was walking distance from the Hampton Inn Soho, and my work friend (a fellow gourmand who lived in NYC for four years) recommended it.
