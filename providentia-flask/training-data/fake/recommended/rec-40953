Ok, Thai food in New Haven is the pits, but come on! Overchange? Whatever, that seems to be the norm. But if your'e going to skimp on portions and overcharge, don't stand over my table and stir through my dish, pointing out little bits of chicken and cry out--see there's some...here's some more...I don't play with my food, please don't play with mine.
