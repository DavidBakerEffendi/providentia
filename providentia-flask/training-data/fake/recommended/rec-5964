In summary, great.   Plenty of outdoor seating, which I love.   If for some reason you can't get a seat outdoors, there is open air seating in the main section of the bar.   The gastropub food has not disappointed but then again I've only tried the mussels (YUM!) and the chicken and brie sammie (lower case yum).  The $4.50 stoli drinks are what keep me coming back.  And heck the place is super convenient to moi.  Only downside,  smokers.  They don't smoke inside but the certainly smoke real close to the outdoor seats and I don't like my meals with a side of tobacco.
