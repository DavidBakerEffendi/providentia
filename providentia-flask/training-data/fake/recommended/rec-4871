This is definitely a small place, but with so much to offer!  Went there for a girls' night out dinner and it was delightful.  I don't know how I will ever have a margarita without chipotle ever again.  I started my meal with a lovely ceviche mixto, which I had my reservations about what with it being November and all.  However, it was delicious and came with some crackers, which I find lacking sometimes when ceviche is served at other restaurants.  For an entree I had the Mole Tradicional.  The mole was rich and flavorful, the portion size was hearty, and the chicken was cooked perfectly.  Not only that but it was served with plantains...yum.  No dessert for me that night but I wish I had room for it as it looked very appetizing!
