This used to be one of our favorite neighborhood restaurants. Not any more. The food is not at the level it used to be and the crowds are right out of fraternity row. There was a table of extremely loud women who continuously yelled and screamed. We couldn't hear ourselves think and even commiserated with the table next to us. The host Michael did nothing but encourage these women and after I very politely asked them if they could bring it down a notch, I saw him approach them and say "next time tell him to go f... himself." This is completely inappropriate etiquette for a host who obviously didn't care about anyone else's experience at the restaurant. I chose not to confront him and fall to his level. So sad, because the server was a very nice guy who gave us free shots obviously realizing how ridiculous the noise was and how we were affected. The next table left quickly, as we did, only to continue our dinner at a restaurant nearby. Never again Ofrenda. The choice of a host makes such a difference.
