I'm surprised with all these bad reviews. I have been ordering delivery from EBA's several times a week for YEARS and I have never really had a bad experience. The food is certainly not the best, but when you're ordering takeout at 1 AM, what do you expect? I think it's pretty good for what you pay for.
