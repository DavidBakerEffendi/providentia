Against my preconceived notions of French cuisine, this restaurant serves generous portions of wonderfully prepared food. I had the duck confit-duck cooked to perfection, served over a BIG helping of various wild mushrooms. The banana tart for dessert was great- not too sweet- topped with a layer of crystalized sugary glaze, sitting a top creamy ice cream and caramel sauce. Coffee was excellent. The setting is spacious, be it a bit noisy. Service is good. Most satisfying food coma in a long time.
