A couple of years ago and couldn't believe how good this pizza was.  This is the closest I have had in America to pizza from Italy.  On my recent trip to the east coast, one of the first places we needed to hit up was Lombardi's.  I kept talking about it to my husband so I wanted him to try it.  When we got here, the place was CRACKIN'.  Luckily, we were going to order to go so we didn't have to wait for a seat.  We went into the kitchen to place the order which was kinda cool.  The waiter/waitress that helped me were very nice.  I ordered one pie with meatballs and the other with pepperoni.  We had to wait about 30 minutes which was expected.  We went outside to wait and the waiter came after us because he forgot to get my name.  Being that the place was so busy, he didn't need to bother but he did :).  Anyways, I wasn't sure if it was going to be as good as it was before but DAMN... it was!!!  It was so good we ate the pizza in the car on the way home back into New Jersey!  This place is definitely one of my top spots to hit up when I visit NYC!!!
