MEAT MEAT MEAT!!! If you don't LOVE meat, this is not the place for you!  I just so happen to absolutely love meat and find myself in heaven any time I dine at Fogo de Chao.   For a place where costumers come to absolutely stuff their faces, Fogo has no problem still presenting a very classy setting.  The restaurant is super clean, the presentation of the food is top notch, and the staff are amazing. Yes, the price to have dinner at Fogo is steep, but unless you eat like a bird you will certainly get your money's worth in both quantity and quality.  Although you may not want to, you have to start with the salad bar because everything on there looks incredible.  I always make myself a small salad and grab some asparagus, fresh mozzarella, and these amazingly soft and warm cheese bread.   Once I finish that off and the side dishes (mashed potatoes, palenta, & caramelized bananas) have already arrived its time to flip that card over.  For the next hour or two you will pleasantly greeted by their gaucho chefs bringing fifteen different meats right to your table.  Beef, chicken, pork, and lamb.  You really can't go wrong.  Everything tastes incredible.  I usually don't turn a gaucho down until I've tried everything they have to offer.  Once I sample everything, if I have any room left, I then go back from seconds.   Be prepared to be in a food-coma for the next 36 hours. Because of the price, I've never had the budget to sample any of their drinks or desserts, but I imagine they'd be great if you have the money.  Dessert or no dessert, it's hard to beat Fogo de Chao.  The food, service and setting are as good as it gets.  Highly recommend Fogo. I will be back hopefully sooner rather than later.
