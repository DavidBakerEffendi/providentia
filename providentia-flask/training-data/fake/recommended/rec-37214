I love this place for their cheap and long list of Tequila's. The glasses are tall and cheap at $5 bucks. The service is good and fast. I always eat the same steak burrito so I can't really comment too much on the whole menu. The chicken quesadillas are pretty good too. Shout out to Jessy our waitress. She's awesome everytime me and my brothers visit Agave's.
