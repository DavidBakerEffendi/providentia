i've had this place on my "list" for some time,but took a while before I could get a rez. Restaurant is cozy and staff was really nice. I had a good salad and the tilefish, both of which I thought were tasty. Bread basket was ample,though that is an extra cost. 2 people at my table shared the special- a very expensive steak which they both sadly really disliked- bad cut of beef apparently. all in all experience was okay, though somewhat disappointing:(. Would not discourage a visit, but not sure I'd actually reocommend.
