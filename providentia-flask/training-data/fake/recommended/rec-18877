Red sauce pizzas have been okay but the chicken pesto pizza had to be one of the worst pizzas we have ever had. However, even worse than that pizza is the fact that management does not seem to care at all about their customers. There have been ingredients missing/replaced 4 out of the 6 times that we have been there.  When we finally mentioned this to the manager we were told that the menu is incorrect and that we were the first people in 6 months to complain -  no apology offered. We want to see local businesses succeed and very seldom complain, but with (no) customer service like this we will not be back.
