I loved this LES gem.  Step downstairs a few steps into this beautifully brick-walled french locale with a few tables for small groups in the front, a bar, and tons of additional seating in the back on couches and you will surely have a good time.   I split a few small plates with some friends and we shared bottles of wine ($25 for a wine split between 3 people - sounds reasonable to me).  The escargot? Well it was my first time eating this and I was pleasantly surprised.  The food here is excellent and I love how you can watch them make it behind the bar where you can get excited for your food by smelling what is coming your way in just a few moments.   The servers are very attentive and friendly, and will always come around to fill your glass and ask if you need anything additional to eat or drink.   You can come here with a group, order a few plates, share 2 bottles, and not empty your wallet completely.
