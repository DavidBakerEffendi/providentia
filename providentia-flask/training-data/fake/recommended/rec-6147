Worth.The.Wait. I am definitely one for making sweeping generalizations, so why wouldn't I here?  Best tapas restaurant I've ever been to.  Prepare for total culinalingus, complete foodatio, utter gastrogasm. Our meal, ranked in order of both taste and desire to have again: 6. Fried Goat Cheese with lavender infused honey 5. House-made Grilled Merguez toasted falafel, red wine pudding, lebne goat cheese sauce 4. P.E.I. Mussels harissa lobster broth, preserved lemon, cilantro t-2. Bacon Wrapped Dates & Olives stuffed with almonds t-2.Broccoli Rabe, Broccolini & Spring Garlic Fricasee spiced tomato coulis, Syrian string cheese 1.Seared Foie Gras pan toasted brioche, mango ginger chutney, Persian pistachios & bee pollen Yes, I copied that from the menu.  Add some of their "signature" sanrgia and that meal was off the chains. Me wanty again.
