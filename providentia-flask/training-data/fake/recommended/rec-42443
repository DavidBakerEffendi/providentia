The best. Amazing food, always yummy,i just wish those damned foodies would be quiet and let the regulars/ locals eat in peace. but with the exception of rude foodies, the place is great for a date or even some time alone to think. for those technically inclined, there isnt wifi for at least 4 blocks so leave the laptop and ipad at home. also this is a place were u have to tip!! the food is worth it and the 2 (yes 2) women that r taking ur order and 10 other people work hard, so dont be cheap, espcailly since ur check is only Â 10+ $. definatly the humble spot of philly, no specail lights aand displays just good food made right!!!
