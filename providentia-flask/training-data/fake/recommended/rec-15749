Bite by bite, the Gnocci unfolded something deep within myself, and my eyes teared up, it was overwhelmingly good.  The food itself showed love to me.  It was so good, I started to gently weep.  I had to stop eating for a bit, because it was overwhelmingly good.  I liked the atmosphere, I wished I had waited for a table instead of sitting at the bar.  People were friendly, didn't ask about my tears.
