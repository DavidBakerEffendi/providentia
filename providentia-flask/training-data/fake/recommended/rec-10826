The restaurant is gorgeous.  So much beautiful detail went into making this place look and feel authentic.  From the secret doors in the bookcases to the rusted light fixtures -  they went all out on the decor.  Atmosphere was fine - your typical Bushwick crowd. Service could be buttoned up.  Wait staff seemed like they were all over the place.  Our waitress didn't pay much attention to our two-top and was more interested in chatting with her friends.  It took about 15 minutes just to get salt and pepper on the table. The brunch menu is small and lacks a bit of creativity.  You can find these menu items elsewhere in Bushwick right now.  The brisket was dry and only came with one egg.  Very small dish that left a lot to be desired.  The baked eggs and grits were very good.  It came in a skillet with collard greens.  The banana griddle cake was great too. I'd like to get in there for dinner and give it another try.  Brunch didn't feel like their specialty but it was worth a try.
