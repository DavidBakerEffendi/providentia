I'm big on interior aesthetics of businesses, and this may be my favorite interior in all of Brooklyn. The "House" has an unassuming, almost unmarked exterior; but the second you walk in, you are taken in to a beautiful and welcoming interior. A tree grows in the center, and the ceiling is just smoked panels, allowing natural light to engulf the space. I felt like I took a step into a different world, away from the hustle and bustle of the city life. I took out my book, and lost track of time as I sipped on my espresso and enjoyed the rainy day hidden away in this gem.
