There's not much to say that hasn't already been said. The roast pork sandwich with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe with some hot peppers and horseradish on top was delightful and worth the wait in line. I definitely want to go back to try the brisket because it looked great in the basket of the person sitting next to me at the counter.
