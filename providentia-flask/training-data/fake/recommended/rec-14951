Alright, it was a good cheesesteak (I've been to 2 other places so far), but it would've been better if they'd remembered the CHEESE! We rushed in from the parking lot (which is fortunately available in this seedy neighborhood) after sunset. Waiting at the back of the line, we were asked whether we wanted a cheesesteak by the cooks, who seemed to have half-made one already...we answered yes...and then, "Ketchup? Mayo and onions?" We nodded quickly, feeling rushed and honestly uncomfortable. The lady at the register yelled to the cook, "Is this beef? Cuz sometimes it be chicken.." That worried me a bit Â -_- The sandwich was a pretty good size, feeding 3 people, but we were seriously sad to see that the cheese was nowhere to be found. Fortunately my sister had some shredded swiss in her fridge. It was almost the same. #firstworldproblems On an unrelated note, I can't believe Temple's med school, which is just across the street. It looks like a freaking hotel! And amusingly doesn't match the surroundings at all.
