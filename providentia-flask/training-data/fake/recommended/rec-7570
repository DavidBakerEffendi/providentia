Pros: -the steamed mussels appetizer was the highlight of the night 5/5 -the wasabi and soy-seared tuna was also very good; highly recommended! -entree: pan-seared salmon with lump crab 5/5 (the salmon was not better than at the Ferry House but the lump crab was fantastic) -entree: new zealand suzuki mulloway 5/5 and the potatoes were great as well -entree: grouper and scallops mixed saute 5/5 Cons: -the lobster cakes were too "bread-y", with too little lobster and natural lobster flavoring being retained overall. -the place is noisy and crowded, with tables packed tightly in a small space -the waitress was not very attentive to our table -no bar...
