I tried this place three times and had three different dishes..... And I have to say they have nothing good here.... The service is amazing but the food is awful then the kicker is they give you A LOT! So not only do you have the misfortune of eating you have a ton of it. I had the shrimp egg foo young the rice was so so the shrimp were dry and hard. I then tried the general tso chicken they use very little sauce and the chicken was dry and over cooked. The pork fried rice was good and fresh but that's it. I tried the egg foo young again and ended up throwing it in the trash never again.
