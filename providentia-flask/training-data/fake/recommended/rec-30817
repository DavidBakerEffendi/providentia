So very yummy!  I was hungry and passing through the neighborhood when I came across this place.  It's one of those tiny New York miracle places: open 24hrs., the food is dirt cheap, and so delicious you wonder if you wandered into a Harry Potter book, and the tiny eatery will disappear into the buildings next to it when you leave.   The staff was super friendly and helpful when I asked for help deciding, I ordered the Cuban (so juicy and tender), the spicy chicken (zesty and flavorful), the Carmel, cheese and fig (slightly disappointing- it was tasty, but the fig and cheese kind of melted into a corner of the empanada, and the caramel stuck to the sides, leaving kind if an empty bubble in the middle- it could have been a fluke), and the strawberry shake (sooo fresh and tasty). All in, I loved this place, and I'll make a beeline for it next time I'm in the area.....if for no other reason than to make sure it's real.
