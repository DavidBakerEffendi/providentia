I'm a sucker for baguette + meat. This place is pretty simple but with pungent flavors. Portions are large... but trust me, you won't have a problem licking everything off your dish. Order it right... Meal: Spicy Pork Meat Ball on White baguette + Provolone Drinks: Brooklyn Beer Sides: Risotto / Daily roast veg. Dessert: Half chocolate chip + Half oatmeal raisin + Vanilla
