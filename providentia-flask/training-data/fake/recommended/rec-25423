I'm typically a fan of dive bars, but I will only give this place two stars based on my experience here. Came here in a party of four for dinner. I was surprised that we were seated immediately on a Saturday night in New Haven. Our waitress was friendly, a little too friendly at times, but I'd rather have the service available than be completely ignored during my meal. As the other reviewers have mentioned this place is pretty well known for their frites which is accompanied by a menu of about 20 different dipping sauces. (mostly mayo based) Our table's order consisted of BBQ Pulled Pork Flatbread, Mac and Cheese with Buffalo Chicken, a side of frites, and two orders of the Roasted Half Chicken. I had the chance to sample the flatbread and mac and cheese. Flatbread was yummy, a lot of pork and not an overpowering amount of BBQ either. Mac and cheese was very very cheesy - the kind of dish to put you in a food coma upon completion. Now the reason for the two stars, both orders of the roasted half chicken were not cooked! As I cut through the skin, a ton of blood gushed out everywhere, needless to say not too appealing. Also, the veggies that were served with the chicken looked frozen and soggy. Our waitress graciously and very apologetically took the mishap off the bill. A little queasy from my first selection, I decided to go with the Shrimp and Belly Wraps. The wraps were tasty, enjoyed they had jalapenos as I always love a little kick. I would have preferred the pork belly was shredded or diced as the wraps were pretty hard to eat. All in all, despite the chicken issue, I wouldn't be opposed to coming back to try other menu items or just for drinks. Rudy's has a cute atmosphere and seems to be a crowd favorite.
