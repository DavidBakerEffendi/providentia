What I love about this place: quick and affordable Taiwanese beef/brisket noodles. The hand drawn noodles is what makes it so special. The broth is rich and addictive. The beef could be more tender especially the tendon. Bring cash and enjoy one of the few places that serves this type of beef noodles in Chinatown. Tip: if this place gets busy, you can expect to share a table.
