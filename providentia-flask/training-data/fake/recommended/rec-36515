$3.50 for a bowl of glass noodles? Um, don't mind if I do! Very casual and cheap. Perfect for those on a budget. Came here with my Godsister on a busy weeknight, and the line for the hot buffet area was pretty long so we skipped it and browsed the other areas for hot food. Woorijip has a great selection of foods that are $6 and under-- From freshly prepared boxed meals to bulgogi to noodles to soup to kimbap. And the best thing is, you don't have to spend more money like usual on a beverage/drink because they serve pitchers of water and water with lemon by the back area. Definitely come here if you need a quick bite of good food to grab. Depending on the time you visit, you may have to wait a while until a table opens up... but it shouldn't be long 'til someone leaves.
