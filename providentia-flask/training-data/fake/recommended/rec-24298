It is my experience that this is a place that you must have reservations to get in on the weekend.  I went with my husband and sister and we all loved everything.  Of course we shared everything too!  If you want fresh sushi you have to try Doma.  The restaurant is small but very hip.  Besides great sushi we had excellent service.  Our waiter was Alex, who only works the weekends.  DOMA IS A MUST!
