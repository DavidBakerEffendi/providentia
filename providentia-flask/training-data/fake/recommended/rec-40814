Terrific cajun food. I had the jambalaya and it was finger licking good. They give you the devils dust, which is their spice mix that can be sprinkled on your food and this was DA Bomb. Wife had the shrimp poboy and it was yummy. I took the muffuletta to go and for $5.75, the muffuletta is so huge that you can have it for 2 medium meals. Ohh and they have the best cajun fries ever ......
