This place is the isht!! Their pizza is amazing. New haven pizza is good in general, but this place was definitely my favorite. BBQ chicken and bacon, mmmm. That's all the food ive had there but thats all people really come for. On top of the pizza, this place brews its own beers. They serve about 5 or 6 different types of brews and for cheap prices. I remember getting a pint for under 4 bucks, which is extremely reasonable to me. The pale ale and the stout stood out to me. If you come at night you get your party on. Some nights, like hip-hop night, they have a bunch of douche bag guys and slutty chicks hit this place up. It gets way too rowdy and I often stepped on broken bottles on the floor, cutting my feet up. I always liked Tuesdays, which is gay night. Although Im not gay, these always ended up being the best nights. Not as many people and everyone was pretty chill. They play dance music and serve dollar bottles of beer. Cant beat that. 4.5 stars.
