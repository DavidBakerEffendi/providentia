Went here in January with a large group (10, maybe?) and although the place is small & crowded & a little on the loud side, they were incredibly accommodating... They put up with slightly staggered arrival times, indecision over food - and didn't get huffy when we didn't consume copious amounts of alcohol (which, given that we were taking up two tables on a Friday night and were there for a pretty long time I was impressed with). Food was very good, IMO - big salads, yummy quiches.  Certainly more than enough for dinner.  Can't report on the wine, really - we got two bottles of sparkler b/c we were celebrating, so I didn't focus too much on the other varietals and pricing. I would definitely go back again if I'm in the neighborhood, although probably wouldn't travel out of my way for it, given the abundance of good wine bars sprinkled throughout the city.
