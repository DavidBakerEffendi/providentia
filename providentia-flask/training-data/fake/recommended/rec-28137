My friends and I have eaten here a couple times and each time we were always thoroughly satisfied. We're all pretty adventurous when it comes to food, so coming here was a given when it first opened. The staff was so friendly and the chef even came out to great us. Couldn't ask for better service than that! If you have to try ONE thing here it should be the lamb lollies with the arugula salad and caramelized pumpkin. OMG, the caramelized pumpkin was like nothing I've ever tasted. Extremely delicious. I also HIGHLY recommend ordering yourself any of their crostinis (especially the Kensington Crostini with prosciutto, caprese salsa, kalamata tapenade and a balsamic glaze...SO GOOD) Also for those who live in the area, they are now on seamless...when we ordered it, it was just as delicious and they even threw in a piece of cake bc we ordered on the first day they were on it! (Just reiterating the fact of how awesome the staff are here!) This place is a MUST.
