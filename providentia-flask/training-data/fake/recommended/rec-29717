The music switched from majestic Spanish ballads, to Journey, to Mexican rockabilly, to Cake. Rocky with French subtitles played on the TVs. Oui, Adrian! Chuck Norris jokes and concert posters lined the walls. I got the pork and cactus tacos. The cactus was kind of like eggplant, but not really. Everything was so delicious, I'm hungry again just thinking about it. Altogether, 4 tacos + chips/guac + 1 quesadilla + soda + tax/tip = $31. Best deal on the Lower East Side!
