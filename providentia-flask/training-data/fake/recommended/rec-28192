Eh. It was okay. Having heard so much hype about this food, I decided to bypass the halal carts near me and make my way to midtown for the famous 53rd and 6th halal. I did my research ahead of time to make sure I got the right cart, and I decided to go to the daytime location on the SE side of the street. Despite the chicken looking kind of dry and bland, I ordered the chicken and rice platter. The guy put tons of white sauce and very little hot sauce, so I asked for extra hot sauce. He gave me a few containers of the white sauce and hot sauce. When I got home, I realized he had forgotten to put the bread in. I was a little disappoints but whatever. How can that matter when I was about to take a bite of heaven? So I took a big mouthful expecting to weep tears of joy. In fact, it was quite anti-climactic. The chicken was not dry, but it was not very flavorful. I had to add more hot sauce to make it somewhat interesting. I was also not excited by the boring pile of shredded lettuce that came with it. At least at other halal carts you can get some other veggies-- tomatoes, peppers, onions-- something to add character. Perhaps the cart did have them but it was another oversight by the guy helping me. Overall, I was not impressed. I prefer Rafiqui's. I am just going to assume that all the rave reviews were from people who went to the late night cart after hours of partying and who were to drunk to notice how unremarkable this cart's food is.
