Savin Rock Roasting Company is one of the best places i have ever eaten at. The food is amazing, i have been there a few times and i have tried a couple things on the menu and cant find anything i dont like. Between the staff and the food the atmosphere can't be any better. The staff is extremely friendly and will do anything to suit your needs. If you looking for good food and good times this is a place you must try at least one time
