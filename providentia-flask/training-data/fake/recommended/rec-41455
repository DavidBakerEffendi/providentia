I have been to the restaurant twice. I went there the first time after the rave review in NY Times just to be disappointed that their signature dish, Larb, was under-spiced and monotonous. I went back the second time simply because there were not many choices for sit-down lunch around there. Their lunch menu was reasonable with a choice of side dishes. I chose a small som tum and it was literally sliced papaya in lime juice. Ridiculous for a restaurant that was supposed to be specialized in Northeastern Thai food. The main dish, khao moo dang, was okay but tasted like some instant sauce. The staff accommodated my crispy pork add-in but water refill and bill came slowly. I may go back again if I am really hungry and stuck in the area.
