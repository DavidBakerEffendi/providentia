This is the first five star rating I've granted to an establishment.  We found this on Yelp and the ratings were good and menu interesting so we went.  When we arrived, without a reservation on a Monday evening, the restaurant was pretty packed.  We were warmly greeted even sans reservation, and were seated within about 15 minutes. I'll start by remarking that the service here was warm and attentive; the staff have great personalities.  Given the difficulty deciding what to order, my companion and I decided to split two salads as a starter.  The caprese was fresh and tasty - deliciious.  The other salad was greens with beets, candied walnuts, and goat cheese, and a most delicious dressing.  Both were incredible.  The two kinds of bread, served with butter, were delicious as well, particularly the sesame bread. We faced a similar situation with the entrees.  After cruising the menu before deciding to dine at the restaurant, we were both pretty well set on the salmon.  Then we saw a waitress take a pasta dish to a table as we waited for ours, and I asked what it was (it looked amazing).  As it turned out, the dish was the pasta of the day, a saffron pappardelle with shrimp and scallops in a cherry tomato and roasted garlic sauce.  The food took a while to arrive, but wow, was it worth waiting for.  The salmon was flavorful and was the most tender salmon I've ever eaten.  The accompanying vegetables were good.  The pasta...every bit as good as it looked and then some.  Absolutely delicious!   We didn't have room for dessert and left full and satisfied.  The overall experience, from the friendly staff to the attentive service to the delightful food, was one we definitely want to revisit on future trips to New York.  Do I recommend this establishment?  Absolutely and with enthusiasm!
