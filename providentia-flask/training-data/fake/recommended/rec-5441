Truffled cheesesteak empanadas were very good but you only get 4. Easily could each get an order to start your meal. I read great reviews about the burger an I am a burger guy so as usual, I went to check it out. Place was smaller then expected. We went for lunch so it was not too crowded. Like I said app was good. Then came the burger, which looked great and it was cooked as ordered. But after all the burger reviews I expected more. It didnt deliver in the way I had day dreamed it would earlier that day. Better burgers are around, I know there are, aka monks.
