Romantic ambiance with amazing food. It's the perfect date spot! Can get a little noisy but if you can land a table on the glassed in patio, it's one of the loveliest spots on the UES. The rustic Italian food is always consistent and the staff is helpful and courteous. The pasta dishes are amazing as well as the bruschetta and many other appetizers! A must try if you are on the UES.
