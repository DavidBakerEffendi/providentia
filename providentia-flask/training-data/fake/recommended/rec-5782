let it be known that i am obsessed with all things spain. i love the food, the wine, the beautiful men, the montanas, the playas, the architecture. i'm also slightly obsessed with mario batali after watching him eat his way thru spain with gwyneth paltrow and mark bitman. after that show i was dying to try one of batali's spanish restaurants. we grabbed two seats at the bar right in front of the kitchen, which is super entertaining as you get to watch the boys put it all together. so the food is solid, but not spectacular. we really enjoyed the jamon iberico, which hello. meat candy. also loved the mackeral with padron peppers. super yum. the lamb chops were well prepared and well seasoned, but the spicy chickpea sauce they come with was just ok. the bacalao croquetas again were ok, nothing special, but then, i think that's the point when it comes to croquetas? and the papa fritas, i wasn't a huge fan of. i though their sauce was too salty and i prefer them more traditional with a garlic aioli. overall, i think what we had relied a bit too heavily on salt, and could be a little more nuanced. and after eating at babbo and lupa, i have come to expect greatness from mario. he talked such a good spanish game on his show, now he needs to bring it to the table. it's not a very big space, and aside from where we sat, the lighting is very dim so it feels intimate, but casual, good for a third or fourth date, or catching up with a friend. the waiters are cool, but kind of impersonal, they're there to get their jobs done and you feel that. it's a good low-key dinner, and as long as you are in for that, you'll be fine.
