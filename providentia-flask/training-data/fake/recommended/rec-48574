Atmosphere: 90 Service: 90 Beer: 85 Food: 95 Value: 90 OVERALL:  90 (A-) OVERVIEW: Great atmosphere.  Great service.  Good beer.  Outstanding food.  Great value. ATMOSPHERE: On the bar itself there is no bar for your feet.  That drives me a little crazy, but other than that the place is fantastic.  The outdoor beer garden is an awesome spot. SERVICE: Bartenders are great.  Servers are nice.  Food comes out at a good pace. BEER: Not a lot of beers, but the ones they have are usually great.  Every once in a while they will have some of the top rated beers in the world. FOOD: The chef has some crazy culinary individuality.  Some things get pretty wild, but not the scary kind of wild you'd be afraid of trying.  For example, the Watermelon Salad has big chunks of slow cooked pork belly.  Two of my favorite foods in one dish? Yes, please!  Brownie points for having a bunch of dishes with beer in them.  Now I consider myself a carnivore, but even the veggie and vegan dishes are great.  I would order the Smoked Coconut Club Sandwich over tons of other places' house burger.  The menu also changes seasonally, adding new exciting dishes every couple of months. VALUE: No problems here. FINAL THOUGHT: One of my top 3 bars in Philly.  Always a great experience.
