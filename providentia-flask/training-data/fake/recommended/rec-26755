We love Santucci's! It's a great option when you want take out but don't want to feel entirely guilty about what you're eating. They cook with quality ingredients and aren't inclined to just immediately fry everything in site. The pizza is good - however, I'm really in love with their sandwiches. We got a chicken cheese steak and it was awesome. Not your traditional chopped, greasy steak but made with diced chicken on a bomb roll with your choice of toppings. And their fries are killer too! I also tried their chicken parm which I was less in love with ( I would next time order more sauce with it) but it was still pretty tasty. The last two times we've eaten here we've dined-in and it was weird - the food was luke warm! When we've gotten delivery or take out the pizza and food has literally been steaming hot and you'd think it would be the opposite. The first time my beau's pizza came out it was luke warm and disappointing and this past trip I ordered Mama's Meatballs and they were cold inside. Though tasty the kitchen crew should keep an eye on temp. control.
