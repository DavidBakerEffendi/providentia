Love love love this place.  Nothing pretentious, not much for decor, but delicious barbecue and, let's face it, that's what you go to a barbecue place for.  We have had the ribs, the pulled pork, and the brisket - all perfection.  The portions are generous so that when we do take out we usually have a dinner and a lunch from the meal portions.  On the sides front my husband loves their jalapeno mashed potatoes and we both love the Cole slaw.  I've had better collards though.
