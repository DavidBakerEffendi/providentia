What an amazing experience we had last night at Buttermilk Channel! The service was excellent, the ambience was just right, and the food was delicious. The house-made bread & butter pickles were addictive - I'm not usually a fan, but could have eaten a bowl myself. Not too sweet, the perfect mix of flavors. We shared three insane entrees. The warm lamb & romaine salad was absolutely perfect - salty, crunchy, creamy and meaty. It was definitely a dinner sized portion with lots of moist pulled leg of lamb over romaine and frisee. Certainly enough for one person if you're not into sharing. The duck meatloaf was nuts! From the giant onion ring on top to the jus at the bottom, this  made me close my eyes to appreciate the perfection. Because we were sharing, the rich, creamy flavors never overwhelmed, but I might not get this on my own. Then, of course, we had to sample the buttermilk fried chicken. Three large pieces of super juicy chicken perched on a not-too-large waffle. The syrup was not too sweet or mapley, which was perfect for dinner. Cole slaw went super light on the mayo and was a nice crunchy compliment to the other flavors and textures. I can see why this is a crowd favorite - it didn't disappoint. The chicken even held up as a 1:00 am snack - still crunchy!  It was hard to pick a favorite among these 3 gems, and I would recommend all three. For dessert we tried the pecan ice cream sundae and the chocolate & caramel tart. Both tasty but they didn't blow our minds. But the coffee was very good, hot, and strong, which is a big plus for me. (There's nothing worse than ending a meal with a weak cup of coffee...ugh) Thanks for a wonderful evening, Buttermilk Channel! We can't wait to come back and sample the rest of the menu.
