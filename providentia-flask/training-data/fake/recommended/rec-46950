Came here for Sushi...left extremely satisfied I found this place via yelp looking for the next best piece of Sushi. Living in South Jersey, i'm not afraid to make this commute to this place. Their rolls are some of the freshest i've had in my entire life and their list of rolls is definitely very accommodating for everyone im sure due to its vastness. The INFERNO roll (i think it was called) was and IS my favorite. I've eaten here i think 3 times so far and got that each time...gets better every time baby!
