The night started with a group of friends at one of the local bars. It was 10:30 already when we all decided to eat which meant: yelping time! I'm glad I bookmarked Frère de Lys "to try" as our dinner there was one of the best experience I had in the city. The décor is simple and cosy, the staff is warm and friendly and the food is like "le petit Jesus en culotte de velours" (I'm not making it up, it is a real french expression). I have to give a special shout out for the mushroom soup with truffle oil: Everything is that dish was perfect! And the addition of that magic hint of truffle oil was the cherry on top of the cake. I read a yelper comment saying the Steak tartare wasn't good. No offense, but that person could not be more wrong! It was a pure delight to taste. I could try and make a description of it but going over to Frère de Lys and trying it yourself is certainly going to surpass any words. Also, for those of you who are vegetarian/vegan, I would say just this: Paleo Zucchini Pasta! I'd like to wish good luck to the owners: They did an amazing job opening this wonderful french restaurant. Yet to my opinion, this place still has a lot more to offer, and I'll be going there as much as I can to witness how it went from excellent to phenomenal!
