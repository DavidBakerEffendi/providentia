Ventured in here with some friends, one of which literally shares a wall with the place (no lie - you can feel the heat from the kitchen radiate through his living room wall) and was thoroughly impressed.  We came in on a Saturday night with the intention of grabbing some drinks and ending up staying for 2 hours for some desert and more drinks.  To be honest, I did not particularly enjoy my cocktail, I started with the Antique Kir and while good, it just wasn't my favorite so I switched to beer.  Both my friends got Hudson Mules, which was I thought was overly sweet and but they both enjoyed.  We also got the Apple Tarte and Butternut Squash Cake, both were delicious , especially the cream on the tart. The bartenders were nice and attentive and our server was great (even brought my friend two samples of wine to choose between) until the end of the night when she seemed to forget about us.  She also forgot one drink but it's replacement was promptly comped once she realized her mistake. The dishes of the people eating dinner looked great and I look forward to going back for dinner when Im in town next. The layout was pretty cool as well, they have an open kitchen and a patio that I believe should be open now (and serving brunch) and a private room available for parties.  Also, they are pretty keen on keeping this place a semi secret (if thats even possible with the internet) so they dont have a sign, keep their curtains drawn and you have to enter through the courtyard, all of which keep random people walking by from seeing whats going on inside.  In fact, when I stopped by my friend's place earlier in the day (before I even knew about Hudson), it didnt even look like anything was in that space.
