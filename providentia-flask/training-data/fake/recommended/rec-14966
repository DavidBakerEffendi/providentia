I walked seven blocks in the pouring rain, dragging a suitcase behind me, balancing a purse, an umbrella, and a garment bag, just to get a meal here. If that doesn't tell you how good it is, then I don't know what will! Last time I came here, I got the beef tendon appetizer, which came in a huge portion. It wasn't until I came home with the leftovers that I found the pickled radish hiding under the mound of beef tendon. This is a good appetizer to share, especially with the beef and radish together, but I don't recommend it for a solo diner. I also got the ox tail noodle bowl, but was a little disappointed since I was really in the mood for pho that day. This time, I did it right and ordered the fish ball soup. The fish balls are incredibly delicious. I'm not sure how they are made, but they taste much better than the frozen kind I get from the store. There is a delicious pork surprise in the middle of every fishball, which made them that much better. The hand-pulled noodles are chewy and plentiful, for you noodle folks. If you're more of a broth person like me, you might want to request a half portion, since it will still be plenty of food for you, and you won't have to fight the noodles to get to the broth. What made the noodles even better was adding some vinegar to the broth, and there is this fishy hot sauce in the jar that added a delicious kick. Totally work the trudge in the rain and the sore arms!
