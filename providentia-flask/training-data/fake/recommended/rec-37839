Reasons to love JBs: 1. one of the only bars that still charges $3 for Kenzinger 2. the burger. BEST burger in Philly. OMG, that burger 3. great venue on the 2nd floor for live music I live really close so I come here pretty frequently. Great food, great beer... they also got paper menus pretty recently so you no longer have to strain your eyes looking at the chalkboard to see the menu. Really nothing to complain about.
