I've been meaning to come here for a while now and finally decided to come with a friend for their birthday.  Although the wait was long, they send a text message to your phone when they're almost ready for you, so you can go hang out nearby instead of waiting at the restaurant to be seated. My friend and I ordered the pork buns that everyone seems to rave about.  We both thought they were very good, just the right amount of sauce and spice.  We also ordered the Japanese style fried chicken.  We liked the fried chicken but thought the sauce, was lackluster and had something missing. I ordered the Akamaru Modern, which was very good, and added a poached egg and pork belly to it.  I would highly recommend adding the poached egg.  Additionally, the noodles reminded me of traditional Chinese-style wonton-noodles, which has the perfect texture in your mouth.   Lastly, the waiter was super helpful and attentive.  My friend must have drank 10 cups of water due to the heat outside and also just the natural saltiness of Ramen, but they never kept his glass empty for long. This is a must try, a little pricey but worth it.
