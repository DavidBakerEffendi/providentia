Since moving to Vermont from New Haven, Connecticut, the biggest disappointment that I have had about this great state is the abysmal state of her Italian food. From thick crust dough, sauce, and cheese masquerading as "thin crust" pizza to other disappointing pasta dishes at supposedly highly-thought-of institutions, I have been extremely underwhelmed by a state that has otherwise greatly exceeded my culinary expectations. As such, I was impressed to find out that Verità was making pies in the Neapolitan style that inspired New Haven style "apizza." Über thin crust baked in a wood fire at absurdly high temperatures? That's pizza. So, despite being slightly dismayed at the prices of personal size pizzas, Verità greatly exceeded my expectations. Not only is the service friendly and attentive, the wine list is extensive, Italian, and rather reasonably priced. Most importantly, the pies, although pricey, are amazing. They remind me of the finest New Haven pizzas I've ever had minus all the grease, and that's a good thing. The list of pizzas is creative and extensive, and there is a pie for everyone. And, although my inner miser still hated paying $16 for a personal pizza, I only ended up being able to finish 2 of the 4 slices, meaning leftovers and a much better value in the end. The dessert tiramisù is good, although small, as well. Highly recommended if you're looking for something more than a greasy slice of way too thick crust "pizza."
