Took a weekend trip to Philly for my birthday and did some research before we went. We were staying at the Courtyard by Marriott so the Reading Terminal Market was top on my list. I had it in my head that I NEEDED to try this roast pork with broccoli rabe and provolone. The line wasn't very long, so I was pumped. There was an Italian Festival going on in the Market so I think that kept people occupied, but I had my sights set on DiNic's. AMAZING. What more could you ask for on your birthday? I was completely satisfied and could not have asked for more. Everything in the sandwich complements each other. You can't say that it's the bread that makes it, or the provolone that makes it, or that the broccoli rabe makes it. Everything together makes this sandwich amazing. We almost got one for breakfast the next morning but decided against it. I cannot wait to go back and have another.
