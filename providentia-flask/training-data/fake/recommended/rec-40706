Yo quiero el feugo.  I went here for the first time tonight and I'll be going back.  I was always a fan of the Qdoba/Chipotle chains, so it's nice to have a local, non-chain, fat-burrito place within walking distance. The choices are nearly identical to those of the chain variants, and prices are right on the mark.  $6.95 for the burrito.  Throw in a big basket of chips n salsa for $2.25.  (I won't go through the whole menu, you can check their website for that.) Bonus: This place has a small bottled beer selection, Corona X and Light, Sol, Negra Modelo, Yuengling, Amstel...   Double Bonus: M-F Happy Hours from 4-7pm; beer is only $2.  That's actually a really good deal.  Won't find $2 Yuenglings everywhere. TIP: $10 minimum purchase on CCs.  (Luckily with my burrito, chips, and drink, I just hit the min.  Perfect meal.) The place was a little dark inside.  They had one TV going with ESPN on.  ...and some loud (borderline obnoxious) music blasting, which was a little weird since it's not a real bar or club.   I didn't have any problems with the staff as some people had, but I'll be keeping notice on that during my next visits.  So far, nothing I've experienced will keep me from going back.
