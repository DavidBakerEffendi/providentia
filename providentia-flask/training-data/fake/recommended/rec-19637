Went back with my family; my wife had not been there before.  I usually go here with my son when we go to Red Bulls games. Tonight, we all went and had an early dinner before the game.  Two had shrimp with garlic sauce and 2 has steak.  All if us thought it was great.  The food is delicious and fresh and prepared in a healthy way,  portions are good (you will not leave hungry), the sides are excellent and there are so many to choose from and the price is right.  The service is very good; the people who run the place and work here are nice people and do their best to accommodate.   I rarely go to Newark and now that the Red Bulls season is coming to an end, I'm going to have to find some time to get here.  I normally take the train and it's a quick walk from the station but I Wish it was easier to park in which case I would come here more.often.
