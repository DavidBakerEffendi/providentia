Food was ok, not excellent, but ok. Service is bad. And non-sense. I was there for brunch, everything went fine until the bill arrived. I paid it properly (plus tip), and added all the coins I had in my pocket (I'm a visitor and returning home today) from this trip extra to the bill+tip. Waitress told us that she usually did not accept the coins and went back inside. A couple of minutes later, a young lady (supposed manager) said that it was unacceptable and I could take the coins home, telling that actually that was insulting. I was simply astonished by such attitude. I won't be back, neither recommend anyone to go there. There are better options in the neighbourhood, such as Joseph Leonard - Cozy, nice people, amazing food!
