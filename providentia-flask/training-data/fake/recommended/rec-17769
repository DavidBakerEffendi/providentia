This used to be a go to place for lunch. Â They do charge extra for everything. The food is good but now overpriced as they have done away with their puch card and David Alan bucks which rewarded and encouraged repeat customers but allowing them to get up to 30% off by prepaying. For this price there are many other places in the area to discover.
