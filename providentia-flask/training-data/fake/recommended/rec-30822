When I went to high school at Brooklyn Tech, I always ran by "that restaurant with the truck outside" on my way to the track, but never got a chance to go there. It wasn't until I graduated that I finally tried Habana, and that was... 3 years ago. I am obsessed. I love this place with a mighty passion, the food is always delicious; I honestly get the same thing each and every time I go. Guac and queso sandwich? Heavenly. The corn? Amazing. Too bad its closed half of the year, as it is an outdoor restaurant. I love the theme/ambience of this place, I'm craving me some Habana right now :( too bad its December. I like this place approximately a hundred billion times more than the Habana in Soho. It's less crowded, the food tastes better, and there is way more space.
