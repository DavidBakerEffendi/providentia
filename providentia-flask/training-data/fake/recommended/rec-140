I visited Carmine's for a friend's birthday and was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant serves large portions of food family style that are delicious and filling. Our table ordered 6 entrees for 7 people and there was plenty of food with left overs for all of us. The wait staff was attentive and friendly and offered a gluten free and allergy conscious menu for a person in our party and was knowledgable about the food products and helpful. Great experience! A good place for a casual but special celebration. I would definitely go back.
