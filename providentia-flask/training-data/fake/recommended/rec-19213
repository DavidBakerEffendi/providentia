i had a good cuban sandwich here but their beer list is more than a little annoying. I have a problem with this ipa/hops trend, that causes places like this to have maybe 2 Â or 3 non hoppy beers out of over 10! Everything else: ipa ipa hops hops. Even the saison I got was lightly spiced and heavily hopped, should have known as it was a victory. Oh well, not a place I'm going to go to for beer but they have great shows and solid food.
