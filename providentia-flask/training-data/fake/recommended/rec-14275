empanada mama...the name just rolls off your tongue.  the instant i walked in here, i had a good feeling about it.  and the instant i tasted the guac, i knew my feeling was accurate.  and the instant i bit into my cubana arepa, and my vegetable empanada, and my reggaeton empanada.....i knew i'd be coming back over and over and over again. the food here is fantastic, fresh, and filling.   came here with my boyfriend, we each had a drink, split an appetizer, and shared an arepa and 3 empanadas, and our bill came to $30.   we were full, happy, and newly obsessed with this place upon our departure.  we then noticed that everywhere in the neighborhood for blocks to come had signs for empanada mama, perhaps catering to the bar-delivery scene.  two more points in my book for hells kitchen - i might need to move here to get my empanada fix. less one star for the somewhat curt service - he was probably just frazzled due to the business, but still.  indulge me a little.
