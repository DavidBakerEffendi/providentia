My only experience with the food here is through their outpost at the Brooklyn Flea. I knew not of their history on the Food Network, and if did I might have gone with the dumplings. But instead, I was excited to see New Orleans food at a stall and ordered an oyster po'boy. Now, this sandwich was not a po'boy. Po'boys are made on a particular type of French bread that you either have to make yourself or import from the two companies that make it in NOLA. This was on some sort of teensy, brioche-like roll. And while it was topped with pickled onions and remoulade, it was also not an oyster sandwich--it was catfish. By the time I figured it out, it was too late to return it and get the right order. Also, I saw this place making sandwiches with slices of packaged white bread. That is not okay. Seriously. For any reason. So, whatever you want to call that sandwich, it was good. The fish was juicy, the pickled onions nice, and the remoulade tasty. But it was not what I ordered, and it was smaller than my fist.
