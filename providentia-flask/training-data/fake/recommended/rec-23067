Had takeout once a few days after they first opened (banh mi and lemongrass pork where the flavor was too strong for me for such a thin piece of meat) to share with hubs. We were still hungry - both seemed light on amount. We decided to actually go in one evening to try the pho. The place is very neat, cozy, the people were extremely attentive, provided recommendations, but felt the broth in the pho was a bit lacking in flavor. The beef tasted ok. I tried the lemongrass pork again, and this time the flavor profile was more balanced. Still needs larger portions. Really want to make this my go-to Vietnamese restaurant since this is conveniently on my way home from work, but with limited portion sizes(people wouldn't mind paying a little extra for more food) and more flavorful pho.
