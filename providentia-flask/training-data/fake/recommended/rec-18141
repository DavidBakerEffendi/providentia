Beware the veggie wings. I'm not a vegetarian, but I get these over the real thing every time I visit. Staff and menu are tops. Get the half chicken and ask for a side of spinach and black beans to be healthy, or be bad and get the Nacho's and a double order of the Veggie wings. Oh, the dry rub on the ribs (pork or beef)... outstanding.
