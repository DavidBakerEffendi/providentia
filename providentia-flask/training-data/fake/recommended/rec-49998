So, my family and I really like visiting Oaktree Road in Edison when we are in NJ. We have been here numerous times, as we have family living in an neighnouring area. We were down during Easter weekend and thoroughly enjoyed our meals at Shalimar (one dine-in, and one take-out). Its not the least bit fancy or upscale, but they have this beautiful glass window in which you can see a chef prepare delicious chicken, kebabs, and naan out of the tandoor. Its a really unique twist on dining. Shalimar serves food cafeteria style. We go up to the counter, order, wait for the food to be warmed up, and eat. The main dishes are very delicious and flavourful, we especially enjoy the tandoor clay oven items (tandoori naan, tandoori chicken, chicken tikka, seekh kebabs, etc). My only complaint would be that the biryani dish we had is not what I consider biryani. The biryani we ordered was very heavy and overly spiced, which made it hard to eat. I am not used to Pakistani/North Indian styled biryanis so this may be the reason why - I like biryani's hyderabadi style - flavourful but light. Anyways, thats just my two cents. Another thing that kind of turned me off was that the curry dishes are kept cold in a display case and heated in a conventional microwave to order - which is fine, but the idea of nooked food kind of turns me off a bit. I think that may be the reason why we stick to the tandoor items. I would recommend this place if you really enjoy Pakistani/North Indian cusine. It is fast and affordable - if you are looking for a tasty meal in minutes.
