I ordered the pad see-ew with no meat to go and expecting just to get that I had came between there lunch hour times and I also got vegetable tempura with a side salad. So i was super excited about that little surprise. Everything was super delicious. The tempura was a little greasy but still edible. The to go portions were also reasonable, i would have liked a little more of the pad see-ew but I was also extremely hungry. I will defiantly be returning to try other menu items.
