I am going to throw this out there... I think Xochitl has some of the best guacamole in the city. We have dropped in here twice and gotten seats both times. I wouldn't expect this though, I think we were just lucky. Wait staff and hosts are so friendly and the food is good too! I have had the chicken and rice and the salmon. The salmon was wonderful! The margaritas are a little too stiff, but that's not a deal breaker and my husband had the michelada, which was really great and different.
