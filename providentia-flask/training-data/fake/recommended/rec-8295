Finally, a place in Prospect Park South/Flatbush that's an actual restaurant with waiters!  Wow, I thought the area did not have such a thing.  Anyway, here is my review. I commend this place for being brave enough to open in a neighborhood that's surrounded by other types of restaurants.  You don't associate Prospect Park South as being a place for South Asian restaurants to thrive, but this one sure does.  The food is as good as any Indian restaurant I've been to.  The best thing about this place is the ambiance. It's peaceful and clean.  Honestly, I'm only reviewing this place because it's a pleasant option to dine in for this type of neighborhood.
