Oh hell yeah.  This place is the SHIT.  Pricey yes, but worth it.  They serve a kick-ass breakfast.  Take a chance and try the Full English Breakfast -  its unlike anywhere else.  Ok, except maybe in England.  Service is IMPECCABLE.  Not in-your-face, nor lacking.  PERFECT.  Our waiter made great recommendations, treated us like royalty, and was way cool.  My hubby goes here every time he's in Soho on business, and raves about each time.  I've heard it gets busy here, but rightly so.  If you're in the Manhattan area, it's a must-try.
