Here's the deal.  Is it the best Philly cheese steak that I have ever had? Prolly not, but is it worth a visit and be part of the rivalry between Geno's and Pat's? Absolutely.   It's a good sandwich with lots of flavor and it packs a lot of history and tradition into their sandwich. I prolly wouldn't eat here everyday if I were a local but as a tourist, it was a novel experience to wait in line and experience what the fuss was all about. The hype was definitely part of the enjoyment. So if you're in town, go for it.  Yeah, you're gonna wait in a long line and pay $9 for a sandwich, but it'll be worth it. At the very least, it'll be a good Facebook check in.
