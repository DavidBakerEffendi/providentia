Salinas was where my boyfriend took me to celebrate our 6-month anniversary. This place is delightfully charming, romantic, and mysterious - perfect for an intimate date being surrounding by romance. Definitely a gem. The ambiance is perfect. As soon as you walk in, you face a very Parisian bar with plush tall chairs and a bevy of roses and flowers await you. The dining area is beautiful, although I wished they opened up the section of the restaurant that was closed for a private event. But nonetheless, it was a one of a kind experience. The paella with was the most delicious. :-) wine was yummy.
