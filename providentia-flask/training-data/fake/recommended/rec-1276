meh... what's all the hype about? this place is so gimmicky. you get a Californian transplant in ny, jack up the price and case hype... you get umami NYC. burger was decent. I got the Cali tasted good, but was missing tomatoes... what kind of Cali burger doesn't have tomatoes? my burger was also drenched in oil, and super soggy. service was also slow. not worth 12 bucks for a small burger IMO..
