We had a wonderful time at this restaurant. It is definitely low key and family run. The food is delicious and is served hot. We had the fried shrimp, jambalaya, and rib sandwich. All were amazing and we would get them all again. Everything is reasonably priced. They have a nice open garden area in the back. It's BYOB and CASH only.
