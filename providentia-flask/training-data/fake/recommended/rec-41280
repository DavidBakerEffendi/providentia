I love this place anytime of the day. Their coffee is the best in the burg, their pastries are fresh and often surprising, and their lunch/dinner menu and raw bar just keep me coming back. My current favorite is the Celery Root Salad with toasted hazelnuts, cherries and fresh parsley - everything harmonizes so nicely. Their pressed ham and cheese with pickled onions goes really well with it too.
