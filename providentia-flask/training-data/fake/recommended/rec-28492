Nice to have a new GastroPub pop up here in Astoria so close to my apartment! Great ambiance, and the two times I've been since have hosted a nice, mellow crowd. Service is relaxed and friendly, Â and I have to say, the food is awesome. Just what you want with the nice selection of draft beer...REALLY good burgers and Mac-N-Cheese, but, let me tell you, those Fried Pickles are my new french fry replacement. I even tried the Dirty Pickle Martini (I don't usually mess with the "dirty" in my Martini) and was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to swig it down and even ordered a 2nd. Though not a fan of McClures pickles out of the jar, something different happens to them when they are sliced and dropped into an icy-cold vodka martini or lightly-battered and quick fried! This combined with the great mix on the JukeBox got me to declare it my new regular spot the moment I walked in.
