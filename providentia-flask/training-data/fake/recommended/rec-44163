I really wanted to like this place because we like supporting local businesses.  However, we went there on a recent Sunday and were just so disappointed.  We had our kids with us and came in at about 1:15PM for lunch.  We were greeted and given menus and drinks promptly.  We placed out order and waited.  And waited.  Wan waited some more.  Asked the waitress to check on our stuff since people who came in AFTER us were served and actually finished before our food ever came out.  The kids were starving when the food FINALLY came out 45 minutes after ordering.  The fries were stone cold, the mac and cheese was cold and gloppy, the kids ordered wings and they were tough and flavorless.  My wife was OK with her sandwich and my burger was actually cooked properly and was decent, but nothing special.   The waitstaff was inattentive and really not happy when we asked where our food was.  They said the kitchen was making sure everything came out together.  Very unhappy.  We will not be back.
