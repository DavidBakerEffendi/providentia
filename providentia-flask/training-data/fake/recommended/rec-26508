You know that stupid show on The Food Network called "The Best Thing I Ever Ate," where those idiotic, narcissistic celebrity chefs gush about their favorite menu items? Well if I were an idiotic celebrity chef on that show, I'd be shitting my pants over the whiskey doughnuts at J.B.'s. They're only available during brunch on the weekends, but that shouldn't stop you from going to J.B.'s during the week. Their regular menu is awesome (the burger and fries are amongst the best in the city), and it's one of the best places in Philly to see a show. But the whiskey doughnuts ... holy shit.
