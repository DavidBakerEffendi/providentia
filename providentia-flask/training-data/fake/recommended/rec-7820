There is a little picture gallery on the wall with "prominent" people. After the owner found out that I am German, he showed me the picture of him with Germany's ex-secretary of state Joschka Fischer, who taught at Princeton after he retired and was his regular - that tells you that Germany obviously must have had terrible relations with Japan during his time or JF must have lost all his taste buds by licking all mailing envelopes that left his department by himself. Honestly, the sushi looked so lousy and humiliated on the plate, it's a shame. We had a bla sushi and sashimi selection of fish that had died from depression long time ago and an irregular pile of red stuff with some rice accumulation around it. The hot sauce on top of it distinguished it as a spicy tuna roll. Really??? Probably, every sushi chef in Japan who delivers this  presentation would be forced to commit ritual suicide by the mob.   Don't. Just don't. Even their soy sauce doesn't make proper stains, after rechecking my pants this morning, it's all gone. Fuba.
