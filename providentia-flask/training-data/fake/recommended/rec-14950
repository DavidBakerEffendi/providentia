The food and ambiance deserves a 5 star, our server deserved a 1.   Thats why I picked 3 stars.  Friends of ours flew in from London and and so we got the crew together and got a table in the greenhouse for 9.  The server seemed annoyed at us almost immediately.  Ording...She snapped at one of the ladies ordering and told her she would be back she had to get some other table some water.  Then when my wife asked for no mushrooms on her meal she got the " what do you mean you don't want mushrooms" and wasn't asked for any sort of substitute.  Then when my someone asked what is crudos, he was told to google it.  We then asked what the difference was between the 2 steaks, she told us to get the cheaper one it was a better value.  It was kind of like she thought we we didn't have enough money to be dining there , or that was the vibe she definitely put off.   All this didn't really bother me that much as the food when it came out it was just amazing.  We decided against her advise to get the dry rub steak for 2 which was banging.  When i got the most annoyed is at the end of our dinner.  My wife got the chicken with no mushrooms and asked for it to be wrapped up.  My friends wife also got the chicken but with mushrooms finished most of her meal but some scaps and specifically told them she was finished and didn't want it wrapped up.  10 mins later she comes out with a box with my wife's chicken in it, and the server explains they made a mistake and put my friends wifes scraps which she was done with, which had mushrooms all in it, in the same box as my wives chicken.  Thats just gross.  who does that?  Then she came out with the wrong ice cream.  Forgot the whip cream for someones coffee that they requested and to top it off top us.  After we paid well over a 1k in cash that we should come back and next time she will be "nice".  Just really unprofessional and not up to the same level as the food.  But the food was banging!!!!!
