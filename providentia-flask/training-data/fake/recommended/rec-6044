As a Greek person, I found the good here to be incredibly disappointing and inauthentic, and what made it worse were the absurd prices for dishes that seemed tasteless. I was so excited to get the food of my country but left with my tail between my legs. My non-Greek date even thought the food was less than average. That's saying something.
