Tried the pork soup dumplings and the crab/pork soup dumplings. Delicious but next time we will just order the pork soup dumplings. Not enough crab meat for the extra $1. Ordered the minced pork noodles; mistakenly thought it would be similar to the pork with sauce noodles but actually were more along the lines of meatballs. They were amazing; so tender and full of flavor. Will have to go back to try more noodle dishes. Maybe the ma pa tofu with pork on noodles.
