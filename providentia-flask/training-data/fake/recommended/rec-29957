Nice cozy place. I met with a friend for late brunch on a weekend. The place was not crowded, and we got a high table in the back. We didn't try any brunch menu, and had bunch of regular menu. Some were delicious, and some were tasy but not outstanding. My suggestions are: Salad with fried artichoke Onion croquette Tortilla. Lamb skewers and chorizo were not bad, but disappointing to me. I guess my expectation was too high. Sangria was a sweeter side. They have limited selection of wine by the glass. I think they had only 4 red. I tried 3 of them and liked only 1. Probably not the best place for wine lovers. The waitress was very nice, and she really knows their food and wine. Her suggestions never failed. We were eating very slowly, but she brought every food with perfect timing. I'm not sure if I'll go back because of the location, far west on 11th Ave, but I like their service and had a great time.
