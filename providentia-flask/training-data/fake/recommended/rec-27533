Being from Arizona, I always preface myself a Mexican-food snob.  The ability to get a fantastic and authentic meal in AZ on the cheap, is something that I am obviously without in NY.  That said, Barrio Chino is a good option for well priced Mexican food in NYC - if you can get a seat that is.   Absolutely slammed on weekend nights - but aren't most worthwhile places in the LES?   The food is very good, but very far from authentic Mexican.  More on the gourmand side - which is fine by me, except of course when in need of a greasy cure to a Sunday hangover.  Fish tacos are a must try, and the guacamole is outstanding.
