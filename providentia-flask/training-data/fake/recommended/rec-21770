You can't swing a dead cat without hitting a Lame Latin American restaurant in Park Slope. Palo Santo is an exception to the rule. What Chef Jacques is doing on Union street is a credit to the neighborhood. Everyone has sung high praises on the pork tacos, so I will speak about brunch. The brunch pre fixe is great value. Coffee, boozy drink and entree for $14. The papooses were the pick of the entrees, pretty authentic in composition and tasting delicious. Service is warm, dining room is decorated nicely. This restaurant is the place to be on Sunday afternoon!
