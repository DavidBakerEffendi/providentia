A solid, quaint Italian place with good food and good vibes. We were greeted with warmth and old fashioned Italian hospitality. The owner even came by to give us all his recommendations. He definitely added onto the experience in a very positive way. We started the meal with the burrata with arugula pesto and the cold pea soup. Both beautifully prepared. The burrata was fresh, creamy and simple. The cold pea soup was beyond what I imagined. There were multiple layers of flavors I couldn't actually distinguish. But it was really yummy. For the main course, Strisce alla Chiantigiana with guanciale, red wine reduction and large slices of pecorino. The pasta was freshly made and delicious. I found the red wine reduction to be particularly overpowering even with the guanciale and felt it needed to be cut with a little cream or something. However, the Pappardelle Verdi Con Salsiccia, Cavolo Rosso E Crema Di Gorgonzola was definitely a hit. I loved it, there was an even balance of flavors, light even though cream and the sausage was juicy and flavorful. The ambience was that of a small quaint European spot and it was dimly lit. I enjoyed the overall experience and would come back.
