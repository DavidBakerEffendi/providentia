this place has some cool yuppie loving decor.  However, the best thing about this place besides the decor was the watermelon juice.   i got the indian roti appetizer after living in st. croix for i was expecting something entirely different from what i got.  i wasn't really impressed with it was just some really thin bread with a soupy mixture with very little chicken in it on the side.  the side dish was really greasy. then i got the seafod cassarole in a clay pot... and it was so hot i could barely eat it.  my friend was done her meal and mine was still steaming.  i got rice on the side and that was good.  it was spicy, but mediocre at best.  it was really greasy though.  i should have tried the fish head instead. i thought the place was mediocre until i got home. i went next door to the bakery to get some bubble tea and i couldn't even finish it.  the food was so greasy  i still feel like crap for eating it.  my stomach feels heavy and full, i ate almost 5 hours ago.  but i still feel horrible.  i barely ate any of it because it was so hot and my eating companion had finished eating, and i think i'll not come back.
