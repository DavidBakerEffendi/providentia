** this visit happened approximately 2 years ago A friend has been telling me about this Lombardi's place for years now. And he was so in love with the baked clams. So, we headed there for lunch. Once we were there, we discovered the place had been renovated and there weren't any baked clams on the menu. I like a balanced meal so I ordered a salad which was huge since my friend refused to eat any of it. It didn't have enough dressing but the waitress was quick to give me more. We ordered the sausage and onion pizza. The cheese and sauce were really great. But the actual pizza was floppy and so burning hot that I couldn't fold it properly and ended up eating it with a knife and fork. We met another out-of-town couple at the place and they were doing the tourist thing of taking photos of everything and called out to us often to see if we liked the pizza. They also called people on their cell phone and exclaimed excitedly about their pie. They had heard about Lombardi's on the Food Network. It was pretty funny. If we were thinking properly, we should have asked to sit with them so we could try their pizza too. They ordered one half with plain cheese, a quarter with mushrooms and a quarter with pepperoni.
