Terrible service! We went there with my two small kids and they had us waiting for more than 40 minutes in the cold. All that time they had two empty tables that were meant for "4 adults or more". They could not possibly sit us there cause those were the rules... Absurd!!! We ended up leaving when after 40 minutes they gave one of the seats to people that just got in. So disappointing.
