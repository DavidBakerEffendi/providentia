This place is nothing short of amazing. First of all, Sandra is such a warm, sweet, welcoming woman. She made us feel right at home and walked us through the menu. I'd go back just because Sandra was so kind. But then there's the food...holy smokes. I know this was going to be a memorable trip when the cornbread came out. It was moist and buttery. Maybe the best I've ever had. I had the smothered pork chip and my buddy had the Cajun fried chicken. My pork chop was the real deal. Absolutely delicious -- tender and covered in some heavenly gravy. The mac and cheese side was heavenly too. Can't say enough good things about Sandra and her food. Unfortunately I don't live in New Haven -- I'd be there every day for lunch.
