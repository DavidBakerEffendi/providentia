This is the first time I have ever written a review.  My husband and I were celebrating our 42nd anniversary.  It was also The Taste of Hartford.  We were served our drinks and then proceeded to wait 35 minutes to be served our appetizer.  Which I had to ask for.  We also had to ask for our entree.  The service was terrible.  Everyone around us were served.  It was such a disappointment.  Our waitress also brought out the wrong dessert.
