Of course you go for the history and the location.  Trying to order like a local by doing your "wid" or "widout".  Standing around the crappy tables.  Watching the bus loads of tourists and locals show up.  Everyone having a good time just being there.  That is all part of the fun.  Not the world's greatest cheesesteak, but they are delicious!  Meat just needed a drop more salt to give it that flavor boost.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Have been here pretty much every time I visit Philadelphia.  If anything I liked it more recently.  I'm a provolone "wid" onion guy; can't handle eating Cheeze Whiz in any form.  Fries were also pretty good, too.  I'd give it 3-3.5 stars just for food, but clearly a 4 when you throw in the one-of-a-kind experience.
