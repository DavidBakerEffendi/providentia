(Visited on a Sunday) Halcyon has both a front and back entrance, both equally confusing. The front entrance brings you in near the bar and host stand (Which is facing the dining room). Entering from the back means you must walk through the entire restaurant to get up the the host stand. With that being said let's move on to the good stuff! The restaurant has dim lighting, with the obvious focal point being the bar that is back lit by glass engravings of ocean sea life. There is etched glass separating the bar from dining room, and strangely there are hummingbirds etched on the glass (mind you, Halcyon is a seafood restaurant). The service was fast and very friendly. I ordered the appetizer special which was a warm salad featuring a portabello mushroom stuffed with goat cheese, roasted peppers, vegetables, and swiss cheese, and then topped with a mesclun salad and creamy dill drizzle. It was absolutely amazing, and writing this review makes my mouth water. I then ordered the dinner special but was told a few minutes later that they were out of Chilean sea bass. :(. I ended up ordering the orange ginger salmon. The salmon itself was sweet from the glaze and was topped in sesame seeds, absolutely delicious. The forbidden black rice however looked really pretty but tasted very bland. Pros: Really great seafood, pretty bar & upstairs lounge Cons: Strange 90's style etched glass, bland rice I almost forgot! GET THE CREAMED SPINACH! It will rock your world :)
