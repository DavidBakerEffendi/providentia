I have only been to Johns a few times when I would work in the city, but man is it good. You drive up to Johns and it looks like a tiny building that can barely hold anyone in. You walk in and find out that's exactly what it is. There is the grill, a few workers, an ATM, 2 coolers full of drinks, and enough line room for maybe 15 people. Usually the lines are split up, one line getting stuff from the grill, and the other getting pork. I usually go with the large roast pork, sharp prov, and spinach. It is THE BEST pork you will find in Philadelphia. Taste, smell, size...everything about this sandwich is just incredible. The hours make it tough to get to Johns but any chance you can make sure you get there. If you get there too early and don't want pork I've heard the breakfast is really good as well.
