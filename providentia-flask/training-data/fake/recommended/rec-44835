A mixed experience last night.  The food was generally interestingly conceived and reasonably well executed although my hanger steak was tough.  The cauliflower agnolotti were outstanding, and the duck meatballs were very good although perhaps not as amazing as expected from the hype in the blogosphere.  My wife's branzino was very good. As for the service, I was very impressed with how much of an effort the host made to keep us informed of the status of our table, which took awhile to be ready.  And the bartender was very personable and attentive also.  But the waitress had a most indifferent manner, which is a subjective comment but objectively she took a long time with many requests and forgot one of them. As for that table that took awhile, I have one additional thought to explore, about restaurant policies in general.  We arrived exactly at the time of our reservation, but the table was not ready for a half-hour.  We had a perfectly pleasant time while we waited at the bar, but I couldn't help but remember the advisory phone calls and emails since making the reservation, warning me that if I didn't confirm by noon I would lose the reservation.  Seems to me that when restaurants take such a hard-nosed approach customers are also within rights to be hardnosed in expecting the reservations to be on time.
