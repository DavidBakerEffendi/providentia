I love their Pad Thai and Pad see ew. The pad see ew meal leaves a wonderful trace of smell while being served.. Making others curious of what kind of dish it is. The waitress are very friendly.. They definitely have rush hours gets really busy.. Overall just love this place! My friends and I go there all the time! Â I also spotted Guy Fieri enjoying his lunch there. =]
