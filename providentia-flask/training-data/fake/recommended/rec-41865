The food is super-excellent! Their chips are real fried tortilla chips (not the stuff you'll get in a bag) and the soft-shell tacos are all incredibly good. I love the margarita, which at $6 for a 12-oz freshly made drink is a steal (Try getting that price at a chain restaurant.) I also love that this place composts everything. They recycle the bottles and cans, and only foil and outside trash is actually thrown away (although they could do a better job of delineating the two, since I always see compostable materials in the trash.) It makes the slightly higher prices for some things more than acceptable. The only real problem I have is that, in many times that I've eaten there, my order gets messed up somehow. One time I ordered a grilled chicken taco, and was fried chicken was entered into the system. Another time I asked for it to go, and got served at the bar. Just now I asked for a quesadilla and was given a taco. Since the food is so fantastic, I let it slide, but I really hope that changes in the future.
