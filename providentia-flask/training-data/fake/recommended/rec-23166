Oh Americana...another recommended diner by yelp and another job well done. My wife and I stopped here for dinner during a little road trip. The parking lot was packed but they sat us right away. The wait staff was very good and both our chicken parms were good. A lot of menu options and the breakfast all day is always a nice touch.
