Should be 3.5 stars. Have been for dinner several times, and overall it's a solid restaurant in the neighborhood! Great food. Service is consistent. The Sangria Marinated Hanger Steak tapas dish is delicious, as are the patatas bravas, goat cheese croquettes, and Greek meatballs. BUT. The pita is the worst. Tastes like it was bought at a supermarket. Also, take out is great, but dining-in is much better. Note to owners: Get better pita.
