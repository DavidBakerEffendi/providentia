Went yesterday. My intent was to try to Poutine. I'm not sure if it's cause I was pretty buzzed by then but I didn't think it was as good as Canadian Poutine. But, it was good. I had a little of my friend's fries she got with just a sauce and I thought that was pretty great. So, I definitely will come back. Expect a line but quick, fresh service, and a great atmosphere.
