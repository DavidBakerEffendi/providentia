Came here with a small group based on the Yelp reviews and I was very happy. The place is small and quaint.  There is no bar -- and maybe 10-15 tables.  The service was excellent, as was the food.  I enjoyed the tomato and mozzarella salad and the lasagna bolognese.  They also have my favorite dessert -- Tartufo. The prices were reasonable for what you get and where you are -- about $70 per person, including tip, wine and dessert. We would definitely go back again.
