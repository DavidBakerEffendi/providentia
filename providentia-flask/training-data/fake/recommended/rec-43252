I had some friends in town from the west, and we all wanted a good burger. I had never been here before, but we were all pleasantly surprised. I ordered the truffle burger (as did a friend of mine), and it was really really good! Another friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which became too much food for her, especially including the fries that come with your order. The burgers might seem pricey, but they're pretty big and come with fries, so I would say it was a good value. Additionally, the place is BYOB and has a pretty relaxed vibe. We were able to get a table there on a Saturday night at ~8:00 with no problem. Definitely a good spot to check out!
