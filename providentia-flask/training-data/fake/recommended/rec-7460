Had a department lunch here and everyone seemed to enjoy the food here. Be warned this place can get a bit tight when it gets busy but the food is by far better than Patsy's (usually our office seems to go there as a go to but I find the food there tiring real fast). Though we usually have fried calamari, the ones here with the sauce were quite good. A lot of the food was praised as were the desserts. I can't say it will be the best you'll have, but if you're in this area and want something new, this place seems to be a pretty safe bet. It's likely that the next office lunch outing will be here.
