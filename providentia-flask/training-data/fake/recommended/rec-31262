OBAO would get 4.5 if I could give it to them.  This place far exceeded my expectations.  My two friends and I were walking in the area looking for a good place to eat. It came down to Southern or Thai food (next door to each other) and we chose this.   Service was very attentive, polite, and even though it was near closing time, they were very patient with us.   The mixed drinks and thai iced tea that we ordered were delicious. Food was great! The Spare Rib on Sugar Cane was our favorite appetizer and we ended up ordering a second round because of it.  The Curry's were very fresh & authentic, just enough heat and just enough spice, perfect blend of the two with a hint of thai basil at the very end.  Noodles were cooked perfectly and tasted like they could possibly be home-made. Either way, kudo's to the chef all around. Can't wait to be back in NYC so I can try out other items on the menu
