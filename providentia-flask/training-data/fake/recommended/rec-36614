This place is my new favorite spot. Went here with a coworker on a Saturday night after work. Even though it was busy, we were able to be sat almost immediately. The place is decorated in a very upscale ornate way - grey walls with accented molding, and chandeleirs everywhere. Has a great atmosphere. Though the decor is very upscale, the prices arent. Between the two of us, we spent maybe $30 for appetizers, entrees and desserts. The chicken pad thai is amazing, as well as the chicken and shrimp dumpling appetizers. The coconut calamari tempura is pretty average as far as calamari goes - nothing to write home (yelp?) about. What really kicked out bill up were the drinks, but they were definitely worth it. The pomegranite mojitos were delicious. I definitely reccomend this place to anyone who likes thai. Definitely a fun place to grab dinner with some friends. I also heard that their lunch specials are awesome and cheap too
