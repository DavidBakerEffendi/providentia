Service was great. Comfy seating. I ordered 2 east coast and 2 west coast oysters on the half shell, the mussels, and the seafood risotto. Oysters were so crisp and delicious. The seafood risotto was amazing. I'm not going to lie..when it first came out, I was like "HA! Look that this little plate of food. I'll have to order another". But half way through, it was really filling. One less star because the mussels were a bit bland and dry. Not enough broth. But they gave a huge bowl of them. I'd rather get less mussels and have them be flavorful and juicy, than dry and bland.
