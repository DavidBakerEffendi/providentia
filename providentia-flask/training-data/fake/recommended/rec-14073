The interior design of this restaurant is pretty and dramatic. Dark and very sexy. Pretty chandeliers, dark paint and girly banquets occupy the space. I wouldn't call the food authentic Thai food, but it's fun and interesting. It's a cute place to bring a date or to do a big group dinner even though the restaurant really isn't that big. Its long but more narrow. The music was loud and for the night we had a lot of fun here with my friends.
