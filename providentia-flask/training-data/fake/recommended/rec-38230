Went there looking at the reviews on Yelp, the food was horrible. The guy who takes the order doesn't know the difference between Idly and Mini Idly (which is mentioned available to be only on weekends, and I was there on a weekend), he wasn't even sure and did not even bother to check. The Sambar was bland, it is supposed to be a South and North Indian restaurant(as per their Menu) and I atleast expected the Chole Batura to be good as I saw it is being operated by Punjabi people, but NO, it tasted just like it was made with Instant (Parampara, note it) Masala. I didn't expect this at all
