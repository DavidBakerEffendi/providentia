*Love* this restaurant. They offer a decent happy hour menu with both drinks and discounted food and Tuesdays they run a tapas special that can't be beat. I love the live musician(s) that are typically playing in the dining room (at a very soft, unobtrusive volume, of course) and the decor is eclectic and very well done. I've always had great service and great wines paired with my meals. Also: their sangria is quite good. Not my favorite place for brunch, but very much a staple place to visit in Clinton Hill. Try the patatas bravas and the romesco dip with pita. *Gasp* It's so good.
