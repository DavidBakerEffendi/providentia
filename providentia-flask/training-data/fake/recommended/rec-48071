I was looking for a new brunch place, and the first thing that caught my attention about Yerba Buena is the unlimited Bloody Marys, Mimosas and Mojitos for $12. However, it turns out that's only for the first hour you're there, which they failed to mention on menu I downloaded from the Web site. Nonetheless, the BMs were delicious -- perfectly seasoned with a jalapeno kick -- and I was able to get three in before my hour was up. The staff was somewhat inattentive, especially since there were only three other tables filled at the peak of brunch (around 1 p.m.), but the waitress was friendly enough. I ordered the beef short ribs with fried eggs, which also came with black beans and rice and a side salad of mixed greens. It was delicious -- the beef was tender and tasty, the eggs were sunny side up (which I did not choose, but ended up liking), the beans and rice were yummy, and the salad had a light dressing of olive oil, salt and pepper. Oh -- I almost forgot about the buttery spread that came with the complimentary basket of bread. It's a blend of butter, olive oil and aji amarillo, a spicy yellow South American pepper = to die for. I've never had anything like that, and it's reason alone to go back. My husband had the tilapia tacos, which he said were great even though he usually doesn't like his fish breaded. And our friend had the Manchego cheese-filled French brioche toast, which he said was wonderful. All the portions were just right -- not too much, not too little. Also, a large group of people were there celebrating someone's birthday, and her dessert was brought out with flaming fireworks coming out the top -- quite a spectacle! If you're looking for something a little different for brunch (or a birthday celebration), this is definitely a spot to check out.
