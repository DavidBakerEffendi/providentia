Impressive atmosphere and a true Irish Pub at that! Extremely friendly service: very helpful and gave plenty of personable suggestions. Received complimentary soda bread for it being our first time - cool! Great beer/wine/drink selection. Large menu. My balsamic chicken and portobella wrap was alright, but the fries were yummy. Heard other food there is delicious. I would definitely go back. And I'd love to check out the late night scene.
