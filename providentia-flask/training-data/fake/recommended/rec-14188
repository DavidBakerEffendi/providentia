Really liked Nini's - here are some basics. Made reservations (as recommended) but we ended up being the only people in the restaurant. Pro - pretty romantic, Con - seemed a bit weird to be the ONLY people in the restaurant, and it was pretty quiet. However, we also made reservations for 6 pm (albeit on a Friday evening), so that we could make a jazz show at Firehouse at 8 pm, so it might have just been early. When we left at 7 pm, there were 3 other tables seated. Food - excellent. I had a chicken dish which I usually wouldn't get, but it was delicious. In a tomato-kalamata olive-feta sauce that was the perfect consistency, and came with a deliciously done risotta. Hubby got the veal and loved it - cooked exactly to the requested temperature. I tried the polenta it came with and it was also good, not soggy or to "corn-y". Â Oh yeah, it's prix-fixe menu only (3 or 4 courses, sometimes 2 courses allowed) but the prices are reasonable for a French restaurant - I think the 3 course, which we had, was about $30 a head. Finally, the dessert - the BEST apple tart I've ever had. I can't even describe it - it was amazing. I could eat that every night. Wine - the best part! Strictly BYOB, so we brought a nice bottle with us and paid a $2 corkage fee. Cannot beat that, especially in a French Restaurant where prices can soar. Service - we had one waitress helping us and she was very nice - not too obtrusive, but available when we needed her (which wasn't really that often!) Overall - I'd go again in a second. Good opportunities to go would be if you're catching a show nearby, like at Firehouse 12, or if you're on a date (perfect date restaurant!!), or if you're celebrating something (with a small group). Definitely a must in NH - probably one of the best!
