This is a great place for lunch as well. I stopped in yesterday, a hot and humid day, seeking something light and refreshing - I found it in their Avocado and Crab Meat Salad. Half an avocado is topped with crab and shrimp mixed in a remoulade, all served on a bed of greens. The mild tanginess of the remoulade was a perfect complement to the creaminess of the avocado. I look forward to having dinner here soon!
