MOUSE- in the restaurant, did I get your attention? I had dinner at Market Table last night with 5 friends. We had a 10 pm reservation. They don't have many big party tables so you should reserve a few days in advance for parties of 6 or more.   In a nutshell: - nice ambiance - olive oil for the bread was rancid - they didn't bring small plates out for the bread or shared appetizers - wine, appetizers and desserts were good - entrees are underwhelming - saw a mouse in the restaurant FOOD: Appetizers were the best part of the experience.  The beef carpaccio was excellent. Entrees weren't up to par, especially considering the price and lack of selection (vegetarians beware).  Desserts were good, we ordered the fruit crisp, the chocolate cake, and a bourbon sorbet to share; all were appetizing but not orgasmic. ATMOSPHERE: The space is tight but the big windows and high ceiling add an airy feeling. The crowd was attractive and well dressed. The noise level was suitable for conversation. The lighting is ambient, not too low to read the menu. Back to the MOUSE- we were finishing coffee and tea when we saw the mouse, luckily not while we were eating dinner. Best for: dinner with friends or low stress dates
