I like this place and it is one of the best Ramen Place I have tried so far, but there will be about 30 minutes wait if you come during dinner time.  The waiters and waitress are very friendly and they take care of us very well.  My favor is Pork Bone Ramen and shrimp buns.  The quality and service are great! And the portion seems bigger than most of other Ramen places out there ...
