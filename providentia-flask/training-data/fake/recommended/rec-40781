My buddy and I went for lunch (he's a Philly local; I'm an Auslander) and weren't disappointed.  Service was quite fast and the food great.  They serve the coffee in those ceramic off-white diner style mugs which I think always makes coffee taste better.   I love the 70s vibe of this place.  It has a nice cozy feel and the carpet makes one feel like they're walking into the Jungle Room. I would visit again when I'm back in Philly!
