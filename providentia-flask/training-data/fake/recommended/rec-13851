Went on a Wednesday for lunch--was told the wait would be 30 minutes, but that turned into 45 minutes.  Finally sat down and we both ordered the Farmer's plate.  Small portion and nothing imaginative or that different from any other brunch place.  Certainly not worth the long wait.  Service was just ok--waitress only came over once and seemed bothered whenever I asked for something.  I went in with high expectations and came out disappointed.  Oh and it's cash only which can be a hassle.  Is it really that time consuming to swipe a credit card?
