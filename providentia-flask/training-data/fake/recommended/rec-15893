I was heavily intoxicated when I came here so this review might not carry any weight. I do remember that I ordered the meatball smash (I think special meatball and special sauce) and I was in heaven. I can't give it 5 stars because well I can't remember everything 100% but they're open late and while the menu is slightly limited it's ok, I remember being really really satisfied. I loved those balls and I will definitely eat here again.
