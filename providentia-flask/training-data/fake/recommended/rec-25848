Love, love, LOVE this place! I've been eating here for well over 15 years and the food is always AMAZING! My favorites: Penne a la Vodka and Chicken Francese... but I have never had anything bad here. I also love the lemon sorbet - so refreshing after a heavy Italian meal. Their meatballs are MASSIVE - like softball size... and their serving of lasagna is almost enough to be called "family size". And the garlic bread, loaded with fresh garlic and herbs, is so yummy! The owner, Renato, is a great guy and remembers so many of his customers. He also loves kids (but I would refrain from bringing them here for dinner - it ruins the mood for everyone else). But, even if you are a regular, you need to make reservations. This place is always packed and it's hard, or almost impossible, to just get "fit-in"... The place is only open for dinner, so if you get there when they open (around 4/5pm) it should be easier to get a table if you don't have a reservation. The same staff has been working there forever and they are great!
