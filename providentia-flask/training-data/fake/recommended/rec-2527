Well the food network got me going here. We ordered two one with whiz and one with american. The whiz definately saved the meat... the sandwich with american was just poor, like the cafeteria food in highschool. Thank goodness for fries and coke. i was hoping for more and was sad that it was not.   I really do believe Pat's the king. But hey this is america and once someone sees and steals a great idea-you gotta work harder. Which is why Genos is so flashy. patskingofsteaks.com/Sit…
