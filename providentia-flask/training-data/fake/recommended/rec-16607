I've been here a few times on different occasions. I work in the area and I've had lunch here several times without complaint. Service during lunch time was good and food is what you'd expect. I've been out at the bar here and had a lot of fun. There was a live band and the place was exciting. Drinks were reasonable and there were a few pretty girls in the place, no complaints. I had dinner here recently with 3 friends from out of town and it was just a disaster. Our waitress just sucked! After being ID'd at the door she rather rudely insisted on ID'ing me again even though I showed her my wristband. She brought our apps without plates, napkins, or silverware and it just sat there for about 10 mins. We had to grab another waitress. We were short one drinking glass and it took her another 10 mins to bring that. The dining section was not very busy so we could not understand what the delay was about. She was generally unpleasant and did not seem like she wanted to be there. I'd give this place a solid 3 stars. It's a good local spot in NJ but service can be hit or miss.
