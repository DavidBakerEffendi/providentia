went back here 2 years later.   really enjoyed it.  i liked my sandwich and my beer, and we had a great server.  one complaint though, and i wouldnt be honest if i didnt complain a little...i had the roast pork sandwich.  pork was delish!  really tasty and moist. only problem...too soft of a roll.  i dont get it?  the meat is so juicy and the roll was so soft.  made into mush.  maybe try a stiffer roll?   just a suggestion.
