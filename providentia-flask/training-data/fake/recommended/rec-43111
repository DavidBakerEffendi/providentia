One of favorite brooklyn places! I come here to study as often as I can. Great food, great drinks, heavenly desserts. To top it off- its a HUGE space, with an awesome loft. I can't wait for the summer when the weather is nice enough to sit outside. Literally the BEST brooklyn cafe- and I have been to my share of brooklyn cafes.
