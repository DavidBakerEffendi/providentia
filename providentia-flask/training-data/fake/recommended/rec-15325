I recently went to Philadelphia and after my friends and I were thoroughly bored by the Liberty Bell we decided to ask someone where we could get a decent Philly Cheesesteak.  We were pointed in the direction of Sonny's.   OMG, that place is good.  I wish they would open up a sister store here in Denver!  We enjoyed it so much that we went two days in a row.  The first time I stuck with just Mushrooms and went with the Provolone because I haven't had cheese wiz since I was a kid and to be honest I was too scared to go with that even though it's supposedly THE way to go.   Next day, bf tried it with the Cheese whiz and I had a bite.  Day-um, who knew Cheese whiz would taste so good?  I was still eating it with the mushrooms and Provolone but this time went with the peppers too.  All around DELICIOUS!  Even the french fries were perfect.   Oh man...I'm having cravings now:(
