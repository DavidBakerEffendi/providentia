Made a reservation for 9 through Savored.com and saved 30% on the total bill, including alcohol!! The wait staff was very attentive, they came by the table regularly to check on us and pour wine. We tried almost all the appetizers, which were delicious. Pasta dishes are very moderately priced, and other entrees are in the $20 range. Would love to go back!
