Another local spot I love and always stop in on the weekends. Vegan / vegetarian friendly food and coffee makes this place super convenient and something I crave every week. The bagel sandwiches are SO good and my go-to smoothie (peanut butter banana with vegan yogurt) is amazing. Also, this place doesn't charge extra for soy drinks, which is cool. Coffee is eh (Old City Coffee) but for the great price, I can look past it. Staff is hit or miss. You'll either get one of the really friendly servers or one of the pretentious hipsters. Either way, I love this place for convenience and good brekky food. This place is also great to bring friends who are visiting the city--all of mine have loved it!
