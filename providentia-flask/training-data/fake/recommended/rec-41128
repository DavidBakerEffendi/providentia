This restaurant has, without a doubt, the best crepe I have ever had. I've gone back and had it again multiple times. This life-changing work of art is called Le Bergere. Le Bergere is simple. Goat cheese, honey, rosemary, caramelized onions, and figs in a square buckwheat crepe. But somehow, when combined, these ingredients form some kind of chemical reaction that, like heroin, slowly melt away at every bad feeling you've ever had. It's a massage for your digestive system. It's a hot tub in your mouth. It's a slowly bubbling crystalline glass of champagne on a brisk fall day in Paris. I really can't over-romanticize this beyond delicious, thoroughly sexual crepe. The coffee is also good.
