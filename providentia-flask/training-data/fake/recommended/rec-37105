Really cool place with awesome staff, great food and a real soul. Great and diverse music to top it off. Fat Buddha has a pretty open layout and is pretty spacious by NYC standards. There is a huge oval bar in the center so it's easy to get the attention of the bartenders. And did I mention the food :-) ... the salt and pepper squid and pork buns are amazing as are many other items on the menu.
