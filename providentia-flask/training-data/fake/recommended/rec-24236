Beer selection is ok, but the food.......OH MY LORD!!!.......the food is terribly overpriced and mediocre at best. I hear Green Eggs Cafe is opening up around the corner on 13th and Locust. Â Can't wait for that cause they have great food, great prices, and huge portions. Better get worried Hawthorne's. Your gonna be losing serious business real soon if something doesn't change QUICK!
