I went to thisJapanese delight about a week ago with my nephew. I loved it however, I must say it is surely not for everyone as it is "Authentic" Japanese cuisine. All meats are very fresh and grilled over a hearth which brings out the natural flavors of the meat. If your into plenty of seasoning and spices, this is not the place for you as the cusiine focuses on the natural elements of the meat. Also, portion size is also that of authentic Japanese cuisine, so if your a big eater chances are you won't be satisfied with the portions.The place itself has a very nice setting. The back dining area looks like a Japanese garden and the front dining area is the focus of the restaurant with counter style eating. Service was A-1 from the time we stepped into the restaurant greeted by the very polite hostesess in Japanese garb, we were seated promptly and our orders were taken within minutes. I must say sitting in the front dining area is pretty entertaining. The waiters take your order, SHOUT it out to the efficient cooks who in turn serve you on these wooden paddles. My only issue (which would not keep me from going back) was that we had to wait for our check for about 20 minutes. Also, the "no flashing" sign was not visible from where I was sitting, so the cook kinda yelled at me when i tried taking a picture. Just be very sneaky so he won't notice. All in all, it was a great experience and I will surely go back sometime in the near future.
