My second beer didn't taste quite right, maybe a skunked tap.  The first two bartenders insisted it was fine and tasted it and gave me back the drink.  Really?  I've never had a bartender do that anywhere.  I know bartenders and even if the customer is totally wrong, you don't do that.  The third bartender agreed the beer was fine but offered me a different beer.
