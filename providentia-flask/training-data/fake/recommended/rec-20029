I had to update this rating.  I've been thinking about this place for about 4 days, and I can't seem to get it out of my mind.  Any food place that does that to you has to be worthy of 4 stars.   why haven't I satisfied the craving?  Apparently, I'm 90 years old and have to eat dinner prior to 5:30pm.
