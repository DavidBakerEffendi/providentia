After hearing all the amazing things I'd figure its time to try it out. It's gooood. I ate the chicken and lamb combo over rice - $6. In terms of taste I prefer the lamb. The sauce is amazing and drizzle of hot sauce was just right.  It's just what I needed after walking and walking all day.  And to top it off there was no line! Sweet.
