When we arrived, I was totally blown away by the dining room and the beautiful river front (hence the name) patio on which we were seated. I myself am very laid back when it comes to dining out, but from experiences I've had in the past, I knew we were doomed from the beginning when there was a bit of a wait to place our drink order. As usual, my family and I split a giant tray of delicious oysters...east and west coast. For my appetizer I had the baby octopus which was much more flavorful than I had expected..I loved it! We should have stopped there...again there was a bit of a lag in between beverage service. The vibe of the wait staff was very rushed, stressed, and urgent which made the entire experience feel a bit uneasy. The sides we ordered didn't come out until we were almost done with our entrees. My leg of lamb dish was delicious though. Our french fries were served room temp. The waiter brought out a bunch of complimentary desserts which were all delicious, the beer ice cream sundae being my favorite.
