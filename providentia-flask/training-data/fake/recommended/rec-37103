I don't know why but apparently New York is known for yellow cabs, Times Square, no-shit-taking Italians and brunch. All you have to do is mention waffles and mimosas and you've got an instant 30 minute wait outside any restaurant from 9am-4pm the entire weekend. Penelope is no different, but while you twiddle your thumbs they at least have some free coffee (actually more like, pay-for-it-later coffee) to keep you going. The food is certainly worth the wait, the waffles were incredible with fresh nuts and berries and cinnamon butter and my mom had a tasty omelette and home fries. I don't know the name of it but suffice to say there wasn't much left to take home. I wasn't thrilled with the seasonal sangria, it almost tasted buttery, my palate might be a bit crude, but I wasn't a fan. However the season mimosas were right on time. Â And our server, who was mobbed with customers, was friendly, attentive and patient. I wish I'd remembered her name but she wore a curly black bun, bright red lipstick and was a brunch-force to be reckoned with!
