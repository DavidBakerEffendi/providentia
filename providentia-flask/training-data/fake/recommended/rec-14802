I live about 2-3 blocks away and have been coming here frequently since I moved in a year ago. The beer selection is phenomenal, the food is delicious, and the servers and bartenders are all very friendly. This place is the best in the winter time, they have a fireplace in the middle of the restaurant which makes for a cozy atmosphere. And they have BEERMOSAS for brunch ..nuff said, am I right?
