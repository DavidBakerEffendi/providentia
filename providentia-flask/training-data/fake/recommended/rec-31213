It was amazing! Food here was great! The people here were nice. The environment was beautiful. Yes, it's a bar but it's open to everyone and when I mean that I mean the restaurant. They gave my friend and I a table immediately. Also, during lunch hours 12-4pm you can order an appetizer and an entree for 8$!!! Really cheap!! The rest of the menu was priced cheap as well. The waiter was cool as well. I'm totally going here, again but this time with no costume.
