Habana Outpost is an ideal locale to enjoy a nice night out. There is lots of outdoor seating so people can bring large parties and conveniently sit together without needing to move chairs around from everywhere. Normal dinner platos are around 9 dollars while tap beer is 3.50 and margaritas are 8. Overall, this place is very informal and perfect for anyone looking to have some decent food, drink and laughs.
