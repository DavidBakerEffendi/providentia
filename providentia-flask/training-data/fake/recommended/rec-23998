My Ranty Favorite Meal by Ally G. 1) El Camino Real specializes in Northern Mexican food and Texas BBQ. Most of the menu items consist of meat. Even though their seitan dishes are quite satisfying, according to my carnivorous and vegetarian friends... The focus is mostly on the meat. It's all about da meat! But if something isn't perfectly catered to a vegetarian need, just chill... they try hard to meet your needs :D Try the interestingly cheesey side of corn! 2) For all you real foodies out there, you know and can appreciate ECR's fine choice in ingredients. Everything is either fresh or homemade! You won't find any of that nasty canned crap in the kitchen. So um... for those who say otherwise,shhhh, just chill... have another bite and savor it. Try the beautifuly smoked wagyu brisket. 3) The service might not be ECR's strong point. But cut them some slack... How many packed tables do you see? A LOT. All the folks there are way cool; trying their best to make everyones experience enjoyable! So call over your server, be patient, relax, just chill... enjoy good company! Try the Texas peach tea while your at it! 4) For all you Top Chef fans... Guess who's going to be in season 6! None other than ECR's lovely executive chef, Jen Zavala! (definitely the hottest contestant in Sin City). 5) Lastly... seasonal fruit cobbler... enough said.
