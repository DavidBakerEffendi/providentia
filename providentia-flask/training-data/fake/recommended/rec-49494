For starters, the place is clean and spacious. The few times I've been there, there were just a few people so it seemed like there is plenty of room. Most people in the summer probably choose to get their food to go and eat it at bryant park just down the street. I'm not super crazy about their hummus or their falafel (I'm not crazy about falafel in general). But the Godfather (portabello) burger is OUT OF THIS WORLD! I'm vegan so I asked for it without mozarella and aioli and it is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. It tastes really fresh. Each sandwich also comes with greasy, delicious waffle fries for $2 extra. The guys that work there are SUPER NICE. It is honestly a pleasure ordering there. And they get your order right when you tell them you don't want this or that. Everything a business should be. But NO BATHROOMS!
