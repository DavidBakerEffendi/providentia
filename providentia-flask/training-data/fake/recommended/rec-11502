This review is only for the D.O.C. Margherita pizza.  We made the trek to this restaurant from the Philly area to satisfy a craving for authentic Neapolitan wood-fired pizza.  Having been to Naples recently, we had pretty high expectations for the Margherita pizza and Massimo's did not disappoint.  The crust was exactly as it should be, thin, slightly chewy and blackened in spots.  The toppings were simple but quality and exactly how they should be for a real Naples pizza (olive oil, San Marzano tomato sauce and a sparse sprinkling of fresh mozzarella and basil).  My only complaint is the salad we ordered ahead of the pizza was mediocre (wilted greens and mealy tomatoes).  We topped the meal off with two espressos and left happy and full, reminiscing about our last trip to Italy.  Highly recommend!
