Went to Hat City Kitchen with a group of friends last night. We got there for a 7:15 reservation and were seated reasonably promptly. It took 20 minutes for our drink order to be taken. the word slow is too generous to describe what happened next. It took 30 minutes for some of the appetizers to come out--wings, crabcakes, fried zuchini, which were all good... it took another 10 minutes for the other half of our group to receive theirs. At 9:45, 3 plates finally came out of the kitchen--ribs, which were undercooked and needed to be sent back. We decided to pay for our drinks and appetizers and leave. Another group that was there for roughly the same time just walked out. There did not seem to be a manager at all. The waitress was very sweet, but needed to get approval about our bill, which took another 15 minutes. during this time, someone came out of the kitchen, looked at the group milling about and uttered the "F" word. I would never go back.
