One word (and I made it up): VOMITATIOUS. I had a $10 off coupon to this place, so I went with a group of friends, including my best friend visiting from out of town. We had lunch and NOTHING was good. The beet and goat cheese salad - HOW do you screw that up? The beets were canned, the lettuce was wilted. Overall disaster. They put muffins on the table - stale. I guess this is just beeter as a pub, not for a legit meal. The ambiance is admittedly cute, but the food is gross (and I don't use that term lightly). If you go, have a beer and call it a day.
