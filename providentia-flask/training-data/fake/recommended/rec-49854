I've never had Turkish food before in my life, but the Baba Ganoush made worlds collide for me! I couldn't fathom that such a good tasting thing could exist... Suffice it to say, my wife and I ate there about 2 weeks ago and now we're back in Miami and I have yet to find a Baba Ganoush that can even slightly compare... Also the Chicken Ke-babs were ridiculously good, and I'm not a big fan of fish but the fish my wife had was heavenly. The dinner special warrants a second visit and if I get into Yale, I know I will frequent this place on my off time lol. AMAZING FOOD!
