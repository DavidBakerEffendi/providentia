In an area with so much Thai food, OBAO holds its own. It has an eclectic menu that makes choosing exactly what you're craving that much easier, and their food is consistently spot on. The drinks are really overpriced - pricey beer, likely to encourage diners to purchase one of their only slightly pricier cocktails, which are pretty standard quality. The food is reasonably priced with solid portions. I've enjoyed the pho and curries here, but haven't heard of anything being poor quality. The downstairs has a really fun interior, while the upstairs feels a little strange. It is nice, though, that it has a lot of seating. Totally solid food - nothing that's going to knock your socks off, but the variety of the menu is definitely a plus.
