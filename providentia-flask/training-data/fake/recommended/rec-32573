I've been ordering pizza delivery from Lombardi's since it opened but, sadly, am looking for a new place in the area.  Any suggestions?  The reason:  in the past year or so the pizzas have arrived soggy, clearly pre-cooked, and skimpy on the toppings.   The only good thing is that, despite being told each time that it will be 45 minutes, the pizza arrived at my door within 10 minutes of the order...and I don't live that close!  Even on a hot July day the pizza needed reheating at  350 degrees for 10 minutes. I mourn the loss of Lombardi's-that-was.
