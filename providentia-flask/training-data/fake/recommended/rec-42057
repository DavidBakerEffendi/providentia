A review for Sophie's is like a review for Starbucks - everybody already knows what to expect. But I just wanted to boost my rating considering I come here at least once a week and I almost always receive great service and a stuffed container. Sure, there are more authentic and slightly cheaper places, but I don't know what I would do if I had to commute 30+ minutes to get good chicken, rice, and maduros. Thank you baby Jesus for this place off Chambers!!!
