So I had a craving for Butternut Squash Soup. As such, I took to the internet and googled best butternut squash soup in NYC. Accordingly, Soup Spot came up. Soup spot's website listed a ton of soups. However, they only have 18 to choose from per day. When I called the "Spot", the attendant took my fax number down and faxed me the soup list. Luckily, butternut squash soup was one of the eighteen. Verdict: Soup Spot's Butternut Squash and Apple Soup is so good! Perfectly light with just enough flavor. I will definitely go back and will bring recruits.
