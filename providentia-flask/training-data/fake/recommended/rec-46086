Ahhhh, It has been so long since i've been with internet or written a review. Â It's good to get back in the saddle...... Going to Malatesta was really a nice change of pace. It is a small cozy joint where you can't distinguish the patrons from the random waiters, in casual street clothing, coming to your table. We ordered a bottle of white based on the waiters suggestion. It was a nice refreshing summer wine. WE got an order of calamari and mussels which were delightful. the calamari is not hte usual breaded fried type. It was just straight squid. I got the penne with spicy tomato sauce. it was standard, nothing that blew my mind. My friend got the gnocci which was actually excellent. My other friend who got the chicken i thought it would be a bust since it's a pasta place. but it was actually really tasty. My bf got the flat noodles with some sort of meat that i can't recall. but that was also good. Overall it was nice and reminded me of Bianca's. But i would say the portions were small and you may want to go eat somewhere afterwards.
