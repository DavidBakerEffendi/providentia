This place rivals the place I frequent in Westmister, CA, except this place truly is a hole in the wall! I can't even remember how I found out about this place (way before yelp was around) but I dragged someone on the hunt to find it back in the mid-90's! DUMPLINGS: Every time I go back to NYC, I will go there just to have some great, cheap pan-fried dumplings from this place! Â I made the mistake of ordering 2 orders (don't know why I thought there were only 3 in an order -- there are 5) the last time I was there and sat in a nearby park with my friend to eat them. I couldn't finish all of them (only ate 3) so I *tried* to give them to people that were walking by but everyone looked at me like I was a freak. Yeah, I know, people don't offer other people good food like this in the parks of NYC, but hey...when I find something good, I'm willing to share!! :) I just couldn't bring myself to throw them away, so I left them on top of the trash can with an unused fork hoping some homeless person would at least take me up on the offer and know the pleasure of these dumplings!!!
