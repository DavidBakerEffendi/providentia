Dalessandro's, you are my god. Absolutely delicious. I'm a fan of the thinly sliced steak (and it's never dry). The provolone is always perfectly melted and they don't skimp on meat like other places. I've been going here for upwards of 15 years. I'm not a local resident anymore, but every time I've gotten off the plane to go visit my mom, the first thing I do is stop here. I've never had a lousy or disappointing steak here... Â I'd kill for someone to open one out in LA. I miss you. :(
