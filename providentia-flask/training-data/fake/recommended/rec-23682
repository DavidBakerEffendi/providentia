Three stars only because I have yet to branch out beyond the delicious hummus. This place is around the corner from my job and when I need a quick snack, I go right to Sahara for some hummus and pita. You can tell that it's freshly made and they always drizzle it with some olive oil before packing it up so I can take it back to the office. Â They're also very generous with giving me some extra pita slices.
