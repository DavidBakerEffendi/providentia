Red sangria gets a solid rating for not being sweet and having great happy hour pricing ($5 for a large glass and pitcher special too). Servers were very friendly. Place was packed on a Monday night - good sign. Food was disappointing. Chorizo was overcooked and the chicken and ham croquetas were average. Patatas bravas were soggy instead of crispy/crunchy and the sauce was so spicy it over powered any other flavors. Go here to relax with some friends over sangria and get good service but not a real food destination.
