Wanted to try the original cheesesteaks so I went to both Pat's and Geno's. The only difference was I got Whiz at Pat's and provolone at Geno's. Overall, they're both about the same though it seemed like the bread was better at Pat's. Overall I give the nod to Pat's but honestly, you can get better cheesesteak than you'll find at either one. It was amusing to hear the people who didn't know how to order getting scolded.
