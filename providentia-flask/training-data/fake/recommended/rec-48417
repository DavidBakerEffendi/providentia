The service couldn't be sweeter, and the pasta not more delicious! I was here for a celebration dinner with friends, and although the outdoor garden was full, we were more than comfortable at their long tables in the front of the restaurant. The prices were more than reasonable and the establishment had that cozy "family-run" feel. (Whether is is or not, I have no idea). Anyway, it was a nice dinner, portions were generous, wine was flowing, and the mood was enticing. Â The candlelit tables really helped- the only thing that could've been better would be: candles in old chianti bottles... with wax dripping down the sides. Maybe it's like that out in the garden ;)
