I was so impressed with this place that I broke down and signed up for Yelp. I don't head to Williamsburg often, but will be coming back here. This place was well-executed from the menu to the design. Open airy corner space w/tables on ground level and a spacious downstairs bar. Could be great for a large group or party. I spent a few hours downstairs on Thursday - all the cocktails that I tried were delicious and the bartender was very helpful attentive and friendly. He could tell what you liked and was able to improvise some off-the-menu cocktails. They also had a quality playlist going. Didn't really try the food except for the croutons (which were great), but will be back to get through the menu. I was surprised there weren't more people there on a Thursday night, but this place will become more popular through the summer as word gets out.
