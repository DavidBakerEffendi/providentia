With such a multitude of Italian restaurants in the neighborhood, Da Marcella definitely reigns supreme. I am a devoted patron, and the staff here are pretty much like family. The food here is 100% authentic, awesome, and reasonably priced. The space has a quaint, neighborhood feel, sort of like dining in a small cafe in Italy. The owner, Alessandro, is extremely hands-on, and it shows in the food, service, and overall presentation. Please, I beg you, try the Burrata. It's served over prosciutto, topped with truffle sauce (yes...believe it), atop a crostone...absolutely divine! I have at least 3 of these a week. The tagliatelle bolognese is also a favorite of mine - extremely flavorful and satisfying.
