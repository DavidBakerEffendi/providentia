I've had several different tacos and I've mostly enjoyed them. The al pastor could be less fatty. I had to spit out a few chunks of pork fat which was too bad because the flavor is good. I usually have no problem eating pork fat but this was the chewy kind that just isn't worth the extra fat and calories.
