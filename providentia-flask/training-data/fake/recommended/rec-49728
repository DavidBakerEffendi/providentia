Bustling, super busy restaurant! We went on a gorgeous night and they had all of the windows open and the energy was super lively. There was a group of 5 of us and we were seated fairly promptly, after about 15 minutes of waiting. We ordered mussels and polenta to share and each got our own entree and shared 2 bottles of wine. Per person it came out to $50 each with tip. Very reasonable. Food was very good and wine excellent too. The service is super fast and they're running around like crazy but it's part of the Italian charm of the place. Great vibe, nice service, and great food. Ordered the branzino and it came out completely deboned. Was super fresh and delicious!
