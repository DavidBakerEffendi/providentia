How can you not like anything about Reading Terminal Market? We really lucked out by staying at the Downtown Marriott, which sits diagonally to RTM. We woke up the morning after we arrived in Philadelphia and headed straight over to the Market. We walked into a din of activity that took more than several minutes for us to adjust. Afterward we circled the perimeter to get a feel for the market. Plenty of prepared foods of all kinds, lots of sweets, cured and fresh meats, dairy products, seafood and produce. A good deal of the food comes from farms and orchards in the surrounding counties, primarily Lancaster. We decided to eat at Hatsfield Deli and had very good lean corned beef sandwiches. We ate some local yogurt, and bought some smoked meat, bread, and fruit that I don't think was local; it was good nonetheless. Reading Terminal Market is a must stop for anyone visiting Philadelphia.
