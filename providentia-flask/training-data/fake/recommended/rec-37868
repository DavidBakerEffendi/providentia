This was a fun, delicious place to spend a couple hours at in a relaxed environment. I like the layout; they had an indoor seating but also a pseudo indoor where the wall retracts so it's like a deck. The food was very tasty, but it wasn't a true restaurant to me. They serve a lot of small plates, apps, and sandwiches, along with great cheeses. I was happy with that for dinner, but if you're looking for a plate or traditional dining this isn't it. We got 3 small plates, 2 bruschetta, 2 cheeses, and finally some delicious sandwiches because we weren't completely full. If that still sounds like a good meal (along with amazing beer), then this will be 5 stars.
