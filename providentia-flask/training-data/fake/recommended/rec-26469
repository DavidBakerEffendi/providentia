Wow, the Bronte Burger is amazing. So THICK and JUICY. My mouth is salivating just typing this review. On food alone, definitely 5/5! Downside: the place is tiny (very Nolita) so it can feel cramped and it's lighly staff (i.e. 1 cook and 2 waitresses). I think the place can fit 25 people max. Even with a party of two at 9pm on a Monday, we waited 10 mins for a seat and another 10 to place our order. I'd give a 4.5, but rounding up to a 5 because the burger was SO good. P.S. CASH ONLY!!!
