Gougeres?  Yes!  Bread basket with whipped ricotta and honey, or white bean with tapenade?  Double yes!  The food was divine, but the waitress needs to step up on the service. Four of us at dinner last night.  No indication what the restaurant is, not even a number on the door.  Thankfully, we were in the right place.  I'd like to start with if the summer squash starter is on the menu, GET IT!  I will be thinking about this dish for a long time.  My friend had the beef and turnip greens ravioli, and the ponzu fish (forgot what the fish was).  Everyone's plate was cleaned.  The bread basket and spreads were cleaned.  Those gouger amuses were outstanding.  Entrees were very good as well, but for those of us who had the Chatham Cod...while delicious, the portion was absurdly small..and I mean the entree portion. Our waitress was nowhere to be found on many occasions.  And yes, the plate size to the size of the food served is a little overwhelming.  However, the ambrosia panna cotta saved the day!  Will definitely come back, and probably sit on the patio, which was really spacious.
