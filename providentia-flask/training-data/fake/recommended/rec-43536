We're in NJ from CA and decided to try something different for dinner.  Found this little place on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  We walked in to an empty restaurant and were handed a postcard menu.  We were kind of dubious, but decided to stay.  I had the kabob platter (2 good sized steak and veggie skewers with rice and beans and a salad) while my hubby went with the chicken Caesar wrap.  Flavors were really good.  My mild kabobs had just enough heat but allowed you to still taste the seasonings on the steak.  The wrap was basic but good.  Side Caesar salad had way too much dressing.  I would have given them 4 stars but it took 30 minutes to get our food even though we were the only ones in the restaurant.
