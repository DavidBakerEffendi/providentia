Food is good but they could definitely give more more rice and larger portions. Rice is really cheap so I don't know why they always give me a scoop of it when I order three entrees to go. The staff is friendly and prompt. Ambience is mediocre at best. If I was them I would turn the place into a full Thai take out and expand the menu with larger portions.
