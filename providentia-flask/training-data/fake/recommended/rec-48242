Just left this place and I'm still hungry! Why you ask?I ordered the chicken Fiorentino when it came out my potatoes were ice cold and the chicken was so tough I could not even cut it with a knife! Not to mention it tastes like last week's chicken! My wife ordered the gnocchi it look like Â mini marshmallows! It had absolutely no taste! I didn't want to come here but my wife wanted to, once before I had an issue with dessert. I went there for some espresso and pastry they were stale as could be! I should have learned my lesson then I thought maybe it might be better well I was wrong. The best thing was nobody even came to apologize! The waiter was a total and complete dick! Sammy was his name. Way to run a business guys I can't wait to tell my friends not to go back to this place. And believe me I know lots of people including police officers and school teachers they will not come here a lot of people already think this place sucks! Jerks
