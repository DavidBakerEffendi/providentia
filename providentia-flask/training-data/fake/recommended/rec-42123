Oh, Dayton Street. I'm out here in SoCal now, frying in the Valley, but even here I can still summon up a memory of a bacon and onion pie, with just the right amount of that gorgeous Bobo's sauce and the crust... oh the crust! What I would give for a Dayton Street pie and a bottle of birch beer right now. It's California and they don't understand either concept. Heathens! Infidels! I grew up in Westville, so of course it was Ernie's for me growing up, with the occasional jaunt to Modern -- which in my opinion is the only place in town that can hold a candle to Dayton Street. When Dayton Street came to town, my whole family switched its allegiance. The fact they deliver just makes it even better. They even delivered the night of a hugeass blizzard, which touched my black, black soul. I'm back in New Haven in 3 weeks and I can't wait for a top-up. I'll be bringing back two pies wrapped in tin foil in my suitcase for the husband and me. Nom, indeed.
