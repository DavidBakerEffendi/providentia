The decor is kind of homey, nothing fancy, and upon first glance, the food on the menu appears homey, nothing fancy, too. But it's actually pretty durn good. Because we had been walking around the city all day and our kid was tired and we still had a whole evening ahead of us.... and also because the kid is the real boss.... I let her order what she wanted. So we got the manicotti. I expected plain jane whatevers pasta with marinara and some ricotta right? Wrong wrong wrong. Everything appeared to be homemade. From the thin sheet of pasta to the yummy ricotta filling flavored with garlic some other stuff (turkey? spinach? I can't remember the specifics but I remember the yumminess) to the marinara on top... it was quite delicious. Dare I say it was the best simple pasta dish I've ever had. An order of orange juice also brought out some delicious fresh squeezed pulpy juice. Of course the kid had downed a whole glass and ordered another before we figured out it was fresh squeezed (and therefore would cost an arm...) but it was yum. My husband got the Thai-style tilapia, and that was also very good with a strong kick of heat. We had ice cream and cookies for dessert as well even though we were stuffed because we had some time to kill. The ice cream is not homemade, but the cookies were awesomely delicious, chocolate chippy and nutty, also complying with the theme of simple but excellent. Joe Allen really made for a great pre-theater dinner... Plus, the individually roomed bathrooms are perfect for a pre-theater poop. Not that I would know about that or anything.
