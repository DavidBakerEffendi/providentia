I miss this place. Boston doesn't understand vegan food like Govinda's does. The chicken cheesesteak is unbelievable. As a meat eater turned vegetarian turned vegan turned meat eater, all incarnations of myself, carnivorous and otherwise, would gladly put a bullet in a man for just one single bite of a Govinda's chicken cheesesteak. That's a lie. I wouldn't kill anyone. But seriously.
