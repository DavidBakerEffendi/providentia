Me & a friend decided to eat at the Kabob house last Saturday night and it was nothing to complain about....just nothing to write home to mom about either. I had the shrimp kabob dish and although you dont actually eat the stick, I would of liked to at least experience the stick and the design used to create the Kabob, but whatever. It was seasoned well and came with rice. South Street was popping that night so it was nice to sit outside, eat and be in the loop. I dont know, maybe I will eat there again...like said, nothing to make a special trip for. oh yeah, shoutout to the chic who worked there. She turned to music to something good just as I was about to notice how lame it originally was.
