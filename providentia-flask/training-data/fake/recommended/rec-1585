The lunch specials are the bomb! A wide variety of entrees to choose from and they all include an appetizer as well.  I got the Pad Thai and the fried chicken and shrimp dumplings (less than $7.00).  I also mooched and tried the chicken satay and the panang curry.  Yum! Full of flavor and the perfect amount for lunch.  I polished them off and was stuffed. Tasty, plentiful and reasonably priced.  A true find in Hell's Kitchen.
