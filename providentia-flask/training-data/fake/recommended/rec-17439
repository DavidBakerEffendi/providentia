Pros: Great food, affordable Cons: Small space Went as a solo diner for dinner and loved every minute of it. The food: I ordered the carrot ginger soup and the stripped bass in tomato. The soup tasted homemade and was a great start to the meal. The portion was hefty, but Â not enough that I was so full I wouldn't want to eat my meal. As for the stripped bass, it was amazing. Perfectly cooked piece of fish in a tomato and pepper sauce that reminded me of a modified version of traditional Basque codfish stew. It was extremely comforting without the guilt of typical comfort food. All the ingredients were fresh and the portion was just right (I hate ending up with left over fish since it just never reheats the same). The prices were also really affordable. The Space: The space was small, but not uncomfortable. This definitely wouldn't be a good place for a group, but for 2-4 diners it would work. Just make sure to make a reservation. The Service: My waiter was very friendly and attentive. Everything was brought out in a timely manner. I gave it 4 stars vs 5 because it was only my first time visiting. But I would definitely go back for another round. Highly recommend it!
