This location is a rare thine.  An Italian place that has a bar.   Venere also has both good pizza AND good food.  A major RARITY. The motz sticks are good, we've had the mixed fry app...to go...(I know I know).  It has calamari, 2 fried shrimp, big ones, 2 motz stix, and 2 crispy wings.  After bringing it home, even the squid was crispy!  The disk is MOSTLY calamari tho, so if u dont like squid its not for you, we loved it, and it came w nice, sweet sauce. We have tried the chicken parm, which was not only really good......but portion was enough for 2 ppl to have lunch the next day.  VERY generous portion. opposingly, the framcaise was GREAT!!!  Great flavor! Not too buttery, not too thick.  Fresh! Lemony!  A very good take on it.   However for the same price as the chicken parm- the serving is half the size!    Get on this guys!  If the serving was the same, we would order both parm and francais weekly!!! The pizza is awesome! The other half saw sum1 with one in the hall, smelled good, asked to take a look, and the neighbor offered us a slice.   Bangin!!!   Pizza compared to abgelos in maywood! The pie special is tuesday, 8$ a pie, NOT BAD for such food pizza, in a land of pizza everywhere! Check this place out! ASAP
