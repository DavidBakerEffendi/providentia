This place has a very cozy romantic atmosphere with sweet attentive people from the servers to the locals. I have not had anything I do not like from their menu. For the non-meat eaters interested in the pasta, I recommend the rigatoni alla norma with the eggplant... omg... melts in your mouth. They use good mixed greens in their salads and a healthy portion, too. I always try to save room for their tiramisu. It is mouth watering. There's a decent selection of wine, but that's where it can get pricey. If I remember correctly, there's a decent bottle of red that falls around $30. I always waddle out of there because I overeat. I can't put the blame on Sud for my lack of self-control. It's just so tasty.
