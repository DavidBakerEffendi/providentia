Now I know that this place won the best sandwich in America, and I have to say, I wanted to love it, but the fact is, I just could not do so.   I think that the roast pork sandwich would have been much better without the broccoli rabe.  I know that I may not be in the norm, but my palate was just not a fan.   On a good note, they did a good job of keeping the line moving (they were swamped!).  Service was indeed fast and friendly.  They do not take American Express BTW... just a note for those business travelers.
