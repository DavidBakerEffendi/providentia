Why you need to go out of your way to come try Halal Cart: 1. Open LATE 2. Best meat ever 3. It's cheap 4. It's so good we took a cab here 5. Large portions 6. 3,800 reviews and counting in a city that doesn't take much time to write Yelp reviews. And it receives 4.5 stars!!!! Don't be confused by the imitations, look for the guy in the bright tshirt.
