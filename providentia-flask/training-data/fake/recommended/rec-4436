On a Sunday afternoon a couple of weeks ago my husband and I were venturing back from the Coventry Farmer's Market when I mentioned I had a hankering for oysters.  I had heard that Dish was one of the few places that had $1 oysters and shrimp during Happy Hour and that theirs was Sunday - Friday.  SCORE! We headed to Hartford and had no trouble finding a spot to park nor a spot at the bar.  It was around 4pm and there were a few patrons there watching the game. The bartender was very pleasant and promptly took our order.  While we were waiting I saw some large glass containers behind the bar and inquired what was in them.  One of them contained pineapple infused vodka - and since I am a sucker for infused anything I had to try some.  HOLY YUM - I have tried "infused" libations at other restaurants but what I tried at Dish was like nothing I ever tasted.  The vodka was smooth and had just the right amount of pineapple to it.  I added some cranberry juice and I was a happy girl. The oysters and shrimp came out on a chilled platter and were fresh and meaty.  They were so good that we ended up ordering another round - Hey at $1 a piece I was going to get my fill.   Along with the oysters we also ordered some of the DISH Bread - which was filled with just the right amount of garlic and boursin cheese.   A perfect complement to the oysters and shrimp. Bellies content we headed home but I will definitely return in the future if not for happy hour but to try some of the other dishes (especially the DISH mac and cheese) I keep reading rave reviews about.
