Just finished catching a show off Broadway and we were all beasting for calories. This was a few blocks from our hotel so we decided to give it a shot. Food was GREAT. Our server Jenny was meticulous and totally on it. We had a weird six-way split, and she itemized and numbered everything so we could pay nice and easy. Thanks guys! I'll hit them up again if we're ever in NYC again.
