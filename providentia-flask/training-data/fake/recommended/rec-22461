A trip to the big apple is not complete without diving into the craziness and chaos of Chinatown. It is crowded, it is loud, it is fun! There are several places to eat here, and for the most part, they are authentic Asian. Of course there are some who are geared more for the Americans and the tourists, but for the real deal of Asian meals, you have to go to the small and very sketchy looking places. However, it is very hard to fight our natural instinct to scurry away from the hole in the wall establishments and be cradled in a big windowed, more natural looking restaurants who are clean and comfortable, but they compromise their menu to appeal more towards tourists and the price can be as fancy as the meal... HK Wonton Garden is the perfect hole in the whole establishment that serves authentic Asian cuisines served with love and no fear of salmonella. This place still has the hole in the wall feel to it, but they do not have the intimidating whole fried ducks with their crisply  fried heads hanging on the windows. Most 'food places' in china town already has the food cooked and you come in and point out what you want... that is in essence, the more authentic Asian restaurants. But I do get weary of these places for sanitary reasons, and they can be scary to the poor people who are not use to such chaos.  This place is cook-to-order so there is no question of how long my meal has been on display. The portions are fare and the prices are Chinatown worthy. The meals are authentic and it truly feels home-made. They serve some meals that others may consider as 'rare' especially in restaurants such as pig's feet (which my hubby ordered) and a couple others I cannot remember. I definitely enjoyed my beef noodles which was simple, fresh, and delightfully delicious, and their prices are cheap. I highly recommend!
