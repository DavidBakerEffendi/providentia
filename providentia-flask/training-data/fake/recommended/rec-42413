This place was a diamond in the rough after running around town all morning. We were leaving to head back to Baltimore, and I wanted a fun cute place for brunch. We came across this place and everything was great as soon as we walked in the door. First of all, the smell was out of this world. Pumpkin, cozy, I just wanted to wrap up in a blanket and stay there all day. The hostess was friendly, and said it would only be a 5 minute wait. We sat in a half booth/table over towards the kitchen. The place was packed with lots of large groups. The cocktails looked awesome. I opted for a bloody mary, which was great! Just the right mix of spicy and kick. For breakfast, we ordered eggs benedict, and the sweet potato hash and salmon, which I LOVED. It was smoked salmon but heated up just the way I like it. Their usual sweet potato hash was tossed with carmelized onions and bacon pieces. It came with a sunny side egg on top which just tied the whole thing together. Everything we saw brought out looked great. The lunch menu looks more comfort food and I wish that was available also because I was not sure if I wanted breakfast when I walked in but I sure was glad I did. Loved the atmosphere.
