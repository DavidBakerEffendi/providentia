It's fun to sit outside on the deck, and have lots of greenery around, and then look up and realize you are smack dab in a city. Great beer list and happy hour specials. I snacked on the Abigail mussels, tons of mussels, great broth and giant delicious crostinis. The server was attentive and quick, Great spot to meet up with co-workers after a hectic day.
