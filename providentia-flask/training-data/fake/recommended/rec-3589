Ok, so this is great pizza, no arguments there, but every time I pass it and want it, the place is closed.  Also, I think it's about $5 for a slice.  I don't care how good your pizza is... $5 for a slice???    If you want to make the trip out there, make sure you find out their odd business hours 1st.
