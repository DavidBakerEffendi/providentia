The food was fun and delicious. The waitstaff was very congenial, helpful and friendly. We first ordered the appetizer platter and wanted to wait until we had eaten that to see if we wanted more food. They were totally good with that. Also, we had no reservation but they were able to seat us right away.  I would totally recommend  this restaurant. The only drawback Was the noise.
