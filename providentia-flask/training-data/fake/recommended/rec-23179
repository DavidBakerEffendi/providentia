I had the sea salt crusted rib eye and while it tasted ok I thought could have had a little more marbling.  I was also a little surprised  at how thinly it was sliced.  I like my steaks on the medium to rare side and with the steak sliced so thin I don't know how they couldn't have over cooked it.  Overall it was just and average meal with an above average price tag.
