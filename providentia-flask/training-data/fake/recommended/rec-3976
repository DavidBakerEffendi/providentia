My boyfriend and I try to make it to Tom's at least once a week.  Diner food is a class of food all in its own and at Tom's you get some of the best diner food.  I love their breakfasts, especially the banana walnut pancakes, and he loves their lunches, especially the chicken salad sandwich with bacon.  The best thing about Tom's, though, is the people who work there.  It seems like the long time owner, Gus, has retired but he has left the place in the friendly, competent and generous hands of a new batch of people you want to see every week.
