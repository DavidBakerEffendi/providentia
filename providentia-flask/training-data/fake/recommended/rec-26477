I came here with my friend for dinner a few nights ago. It was alright. With thai places everywhere, I have to say that I've had better. My spicy tuna salad was just mediocre...I expected mixed greens not just iceburg lettuce - does not go with the tuna at all! Our appetizer - mussels were again, mediocre at best. Our other entree - spicy basil friend rice was pretty good! But again...anything with spicy basil is delicious...The only thing that was pretty fantastic were the drinks -- fruity and strong, just the way I like it. There are probably better places to go, especially in Hell's Kitchen.
