Did New Year's Eve here. I can't say I support this idea of dual dinner serviced on New Year's: one for the early crowd and one for those ringing in the New Year there. We opted for the latter, and it took about an hour to be seated since the early birds were taking their sweet time to vacate (and maybe even dupe the staff by staying until midnight). Sat next to a party of four that hated one another and kooky elderly couple that were inappropriately touching each other for what seemed like an excessive period of time--neither bothered me. Somehow I ended up with Bulleit rye all over my sweater. It still sits in my hamper as a silent reminder of my struggles with adult responsibilities and how I often ruin nice things.
