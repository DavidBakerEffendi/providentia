I really can't think of any reason not to give this place less than five, sexy stars. I know that diner culture is totally an east coast thing.  I know that Tops is the schizz-nizzle in Jersey.  I was PUMPED that it was right down the street from my hotel. First, Tops is really clean.  Consider that a good thing. Second, Tops has an entire portion of the menu dedicated to French fries.  And boy, oh boy, do they do em right.  We went with the huge plate of crispy taters smothered with cheddar, sour cream and green onions.  HELL TO THE YES.  Crispy, crunchy, ooey, gooey, sinful and savory.  I can now die a happy woman. I ordered the classic tuna melt, which is an enormous portion.  It's served open face.  I'd be proud of anyone who would be able to tackle that entire beast.  I felt like I was going to die after eating half. Go there.  Eat naughy.  Wear your fat pants.
