My new favorite place...shrimp cooked in garlic sauce for an appetizer..so good and I'm not a big seafood person but the sauce oh boy so good I dip my bread in it. Filet mignon on a stone? Hell yes. They give you 2 hunks of filet my bf and I didn't even make it through one...this is random but my bf ordered chicken w penne and vodka sauce its slammin plus salad and bread included. Great sangrias and very attentive waiters. Now this was sso weird bc I hadn't seen this there before 3 guys came in singing and playing music and the one guy demanded money from us and other patrons wth! We didn't have cash and the guy was pissed plus he was interrupting everyones meals. Then he stood next to our table in the corner and shoved all the money he got in his vest. Weird...
