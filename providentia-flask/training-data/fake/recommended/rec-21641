I'm gonna keep this short and sweet.  I'm from San Francisco and it is impossible to find a good cheesesteak there.  Nothing compares to a wiz without, order of cheese fries and a pepsi.  It is heaven for me.  I don't know what it is and I know this is a hot topic, but I absolutely love their cheesesteaks and cheese fries.  I've never owned a can of cheese wiz, but I'm an absolute sucker for it.
