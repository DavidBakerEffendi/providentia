4.5 stars! This place is great. As an aside, I was born and raised in Queens and can honestly say I was not aware of how up and coming Astoria is- I was pleasantly surprised! But anyway, the restaurant itself is great- very roomy and not at all noisy. The service is unbelievably good, as the waiter is constantly checking to see if anything is missing or if you need anything. The food is delicious and they make it super easy for you to share everything by splitting it all for you. It was a bit on the pricey side but I'd agree it was worth it for the quality of service and food you get. I do intend to visit again!
