My friends just moved to this part of the East Village and they suggested Royale for a celebratory dinner/happy hour.  Several terrific things when I first enter the bar: - beers are half off for happy hour, and I am more than happy to pay $3 for a pint.   - they have Magic Hat.  I'm sold!   - the bartenders were cute and very nice.  this place definitely had that neighborhood feel and is the type of place you'll go to on an off night.   - there's an outdoor patio, perfect for summers then we get our burgers... WOW!!  We all got the bacon cheeseburgers and they were so juicy and filled with flavor.  Most places screw up the bacon and overcook it, but the bacon was perfect.  And the onion rings, I could have eaten 10 baskets of those!   The bill came, and we all had to pay less than $30.  Pretty amazing for a burger, onion rings, and 3 pints.  They don't take credit cards, but with such low prices it's not a big deal.  Thank you friends for moving!  I'll be sure to join you on all of your trips to Royale!
