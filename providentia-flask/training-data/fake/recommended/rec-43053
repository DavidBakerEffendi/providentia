Place is great for New York Mexican food - I'm giving it 5 stars b/c of the healthy options it provides (brown wrap, brown rice, low fat, etc.) and the a la carte ordering, makes it possible for health nuts to get their burrito fix without blowing the calorie bank. Haven't actually been to the restaurant itself, always order in :)
