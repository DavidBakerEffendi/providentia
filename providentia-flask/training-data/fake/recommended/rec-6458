Cutesy, New England-y brunch spot which is much needed in cookie cutter Murray Hill. Great selection of both sweet and savory breakfasts - I am particularly obsessed with the pumpkin waffles and penny breakfast sandwich! The couple of times I've tried the Nutella french toast have been a disappointment...and believe you me...I tried to love them. Both times the french toast was just too chewy and not enough fluffy. They need a lesson from Sarabeth's fluffy french toast.
