I really like the decor of this place but it's a bit too dark and a bit too cramped. They have coconut juice with coconut pieces which is a plus. The prices are also reasonable but the waiter took my plate when i wasn't finished. I had the lychee duck and it was actually really good. I was surprised how well the combination worked.
