This place is really casual and intimate with shared table seating. A bit cramped but it's really fine since the food is good. The menu has a long list of salads which I liked. I decided on a grilled chicken and squash salad and it was really very good. Perfectly grilled chicken (and I am picky about my chicken). Really good services and the prices are inexpensive! Will definitely visit again.
