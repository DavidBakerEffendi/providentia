Came here for happy hour with some girlfriends to chat like the fab four in sex and the city. Ordered $4 white wines all around - amazing deal (granted I'm from $12/glass New York). Got to choose from chardonnay, riesling, and moscato. The bartender was very friendly. Tried their signature garlic cheese bread when we got the munchies and we all devoured it like monsters because it was that good. Point being - ORDER THE GARLIC CHEESE BREAD - you will not be disappointed. I'm sure their 1/2 price starters are also delish but we were too caught up in the bread. I remember being a very happy camper afterwards.
