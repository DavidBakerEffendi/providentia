great, very attractive, kind of rustic-y place (as others have said). i stopped by on the way to the village vanguard for a late-ish dinner and sat at the bar for a few oysters, the broiled brook trout and a couple beers. oysters were better than average and the brook trout was fantastic. friendly folks behind the bar and chef de cuisine came by to see how i liked the trout - seemingly caring about my opinion. good vibe, good people, good restaurant (if a tad expensive, but it's NYC, after all). regarding the wait... well,the Â hostess told me 1/2 hour so i went to the wine bar across the street, grabbed a beer and listened to a cool jazz quartet. hostess called my phone after 10 minutes and told me i had 5 minutes to get over there or i'd lose my spot. haven't downed a beer that fast since high school...
