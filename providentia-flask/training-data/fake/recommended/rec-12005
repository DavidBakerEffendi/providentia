Why hasn't anyone done this before?  Northern Spy kinda cracked the code for me, the food is organic, local and great, but the prices aren't cringe-inducing.  The pork belly and lentils dish - tender, crispy, bad for me - was perfect and I could eat kale salad and the wheatberry side all day.  Warm atmosphere, good service, awesome prices and the dry goods are a great idea.
