Located in Center City, Banana Leaf boasts a wide variety of Malaysian food. I, for one, have made well over 8 trips to this restaurant, and the food has been consistently great! The service is extremely prompt! I don't go more then half way through my water without the waiter/waitress refilling my glass for me. I highly recommend trying the sliced chicken curry noodle soup for anybody who is desiring a moderate spicy kick in their food. They always wished me and whoever else was with me a goodbye, and always were quick when entering to be seated. In fact, I can't remember at all waiting to be seated for more then a second when entering the building. This is definitely a place to try out!
