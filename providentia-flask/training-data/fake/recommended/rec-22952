Yum yum yum yum yum! I really love going here.  Generally a 5-star review might lead one to believe that everything is perfect and beyond reproach and I don't think that any establishment can boast perfection.  But, they can come damn near close and they can push the boundaries in terms of atmosphere, offerings and quality and Misery Loves Co. does just that. I've had lunch there once and dinner twice.  I used to enjoy these chefs' foods when they worked for Bluebird Tavern.  It's so nice that they have their own place and they are making the food they love. I love their fried chicken with honey/butter side sauce.  You get to pick three sides.  It's perfect for two people or part of a bigger meal for three or above.  The fresh cheese with matzoh, berries and honey is delish.  My friend loves their pickle plate.  We had the raw halibut last time we were there and it was just ok.  It needs something to make the halibut pop.  Even a simple plate like salad greens explodes in your mouth with natural flavor.  Such a fun place to eat. The last time I was there I had a delicious chocolate pudding-type dessert that was a pure 5 stars.  We also ordered an almond cake.  When we bit into it it was pure lemon (which we weren't expecting) and we found that the lemon completely overpowered the almond, so what was the point of the almond at all?  It was ok, but not as delightful as almost everything else was. I look forward to going back a lot.  The very positive reviews you see on this site are there for a reason.  This is a foodie's paradise.  If you're into very traditional food you will still find things on the menu you enjoy.
