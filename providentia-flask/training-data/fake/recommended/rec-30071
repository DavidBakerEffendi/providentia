Went to Pacifico for girls night out and had an overall very pleasant experience.  The waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable if a bit too chatty for me.  Two of us showed up at the reservation time, the 3rd was about 20 min late but they seated us upstairs when we arrived anyway.  The environment and decor is very bright and convivial. My red sangria was fabulous, and my friend enjoyed her classic mojito.  The waiter insisted the mojito is the best in the area, he said people come for miles around for it. Our appetizers were the Gambas al ajillo (outstanding) and lobster quesadilla (good).  I had the tilapia entree and it was excellent, one friend had the special - salmon with carmelized onion - she really enjoyed it.  I guess it's a good sign that I don't even know what my other friend ordered - I was too absorbed in my own dish!!  She is a regular there and seemed very happy with her entree.  I just remember it had some sort of potato garnish which was toasted and looked like bacon. We ordered espresso and chocolate cake to share for dessert.  I wasn't wild about the chocolate cake, I found it on the dry side, but the accompanying sorbet was delicious - my friend said it was cabernet flavor, kind of tasted like raspberry to me. Overall I like this place and would definitely go back when I'm in town.  This is a great place to go with a group.
