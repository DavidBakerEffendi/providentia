Can I please be transported here every Sunday for breakfast? We were in town for a very brief visit and Magnolia made it harder to leave. I went for something light- yogurt and granola parfait and my S/O had the berry berry good frenchtoast.SOOOO good- the homemade granola sprinkled inbetween layers of maple syrup, yogurt and fresh fruit made me feel like a kid in a malt shop.It was sweet, light but very filling and hearty. Â I needed to lick the glass! The frenchtoast was incredible-the bites I COULD steal away that is. Don't discount sitting at the counter either- we had the best, silliest waiter and it felt a lot more personal than the tables. Get there earlier on a Sunday to avoid the intense rush. The wait staff works HARD so tip them well and treat them better. Is it time to go back yet?
