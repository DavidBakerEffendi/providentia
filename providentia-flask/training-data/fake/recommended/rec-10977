Yelp really needs a zero star option. Sadly this was a horrible experience.  We arrived at 6:45 to hear the wait was 2 1/2 hours.  The prices are ridiculous, the staff is horrible. Other than location this place fails in every way.  They should consider getting rid of table service by having people walk to the counter and order (like Shake Shack).  Also the prices are a joke.  I'd prefer to go buy the seafood at Fairway and do it myself.  Really wanted this to be a good thing but I'll stick with Clemente's.
