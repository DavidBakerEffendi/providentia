Line is amazing long at times and it's annoying waiting there because it's cramped and there isn't much room to actually stand and wait. The place is located in a basement which may turn some people off. We ordered quite a bit and everything was pretty good except for the short ribs which were dry and not very tasteful. I would definitely come back here for everything else though, especially the kawa (chicken skin, mmmmmmmmmm)!
