I found this place on Yelp because we needed a steaming bowl of soondubu after a long weekend of exploring New York! We were seated upstairs. The menu has soondubu, bbq meats, cold noodles and bibimbap. We ordered the LA Galbi and dumpling soondubu. Everything was amazing! I loved the selection of banchan also. The service was great and attentive! Next time I'm visiting New York, I'll make sure to stop by this place again!
