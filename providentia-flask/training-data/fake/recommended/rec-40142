Went here for a late night snack with an old friend. Really liked it. We were seated pretty quickly and all the waitstaff was really friendly. I ordered a glass of wine and my friend had the cocktail with honey in it (not for me, but he really liked it). For my snack, I ordered the "mac attack" sampler. So good! Such interesting flavors melded together and definitely freshly made. Delicious comfort food and actually paired nicely with a good glass of red wine. Next time in NYC, I will definitely go back and maybe for more than just a snack!
