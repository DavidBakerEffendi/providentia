YEAAAA!!! I DID IT, I GOT THE OX TAIL FINALLY!!! Must be my lucky day, the line was short when I got there!!  when it's my turn to order, I play dumb (my heart was pounding) and just casually asked "you guys got ox tail?"  and the guy casually said yea, BAM! and at that exact moment I did a jump, the one that Super Mario would have done in front of the cart (jk, I did that in my head tho) and I giggled like a kid. That ox tail was no joke, it was bursting with flavors!! super tender and the meat comes right off the bone. I killed my meal in less than 5 mins.. I tried to savor each bite but my mouth wouldn't let me.  My only complaint is the portion, I only got like 6 pieces total (they are not that big) but it's okay, that only forces me to suck on the bones! I feel like I accomplished something today so thank you Veronica for not running out of the so darn tasty ox tail!
