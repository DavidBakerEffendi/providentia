Absolutely, without a doubt my favorite neighborhood spot. Cozy, romantic, candlelit dinners in a classic trattoria atmosphere with local art, a breezy bay window, exposed brick walls and a lovely back garden. Great Italian wines (try the Montepulciano) paired with deliciously simple and fresh authentic southern Italian pastas, crostini, salads, meat and fish dishes. The squid ink calamari pasta and rich eggplant rigatoni a la Norma are to die for. They are also amazingly good for events--we had my bridal shower here on a sunny June Sunday in their back garden. It was absolutely perfect--Tonino and Pepe worked with us on a great menu, and our guests raved about the fresh antipasti, lovely pastas and tiramisu. Plus with unlimited wine, no one's glass was ever empty! Highly recommend!
