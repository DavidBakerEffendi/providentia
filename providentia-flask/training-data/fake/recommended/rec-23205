I went here on a lunch break with 6 other coworkers. We were able to get seated, eat our food, and enjoy each others company in an hour. I got the veggie pizza and it was tasty. It was a thin crust pizza with not too many veggies (I hate when a veggie pizza is bombarded with EVERY veggie known to man). Although I wasn't drinking I did take a peek and they have a great beer menu. The waitress was attentive and helpful when choosing what to eat. I enjoyed this place and it is just like it says - a pub. I will be visiting it again sometime soon!
