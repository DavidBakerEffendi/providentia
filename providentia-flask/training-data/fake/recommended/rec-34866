This is a great take out or for sit down with a couple of friends on the go. When you first walk in, couldn't but helped noticed their cute cartoon looking menu. If you want beef, there's a cow, etc. The rolls would be similar to an Indian taco, however for someone who is hungry I think 2 of the rolls would be satisfactory. I had the beef which had a nice smokiness and spice level to it (it's a little more spicy than my preferred level of Thai spice level of 3). My FI thought the spice level was mellow for him (he eats usually a Thai spice level around 8). There are plenty of drinks such as a variety of Snapple flavors or sodas to calm the spiciness for me. There is a credit card minimum of $20.
