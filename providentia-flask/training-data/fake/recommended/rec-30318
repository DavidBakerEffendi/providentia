seriously the best truffle burger I've ever eaten! Also the olive oil is delicious, served with warm mini baguettes.   It's a very comfortable, relaxed vibe - a place you can settle in to, have a lovely glass of red wine, no rush, and enjoy some good real food.  The beet goat cheese salad is delicious, the truffle fries are worth walking that extra mile for! Staff was very friendly, let us be -but always knew when to fill up our water. A beautifully designed bar, the kitchen reminds me of being in the Loire Valley.  Great art work on the walls; it's sort of a french country meets NYC chic atmosphere.  Just don't be in a rush if you're going there - it takes a bit of time for the food.  I will definitely go back to try the brunch menu.
