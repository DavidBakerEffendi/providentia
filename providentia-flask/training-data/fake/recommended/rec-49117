Let down.... Ive eaten here twice recently. The food and ambiance were very good both times. However, the second time I visited the service was quite unimpressive. Although our server was professional, he was unenthusiastic and "going through the motions". It was the enthusiastic service which I expect in NYC, esp. for such high prices. When the check came I found out why: the owners ask you not to tip, "in keeping with Japanese custom"! So our waiter now had little incentive to give good service other than a brow-beating, bossy manager. What a shame! As a business owner in the service industry, this frankly seems to me a very bad calculation by Yasuda's owners. I'll have to take my business lunches to Nobu or elsewhere, rather than endure apathetic European-style service at Yasuda. What a shame.
