We just ate off the bar menu and mmmm was it good. If I lived here I would come back. 2 of us shares honey chipotle wings, a burger and the cheese steak. I like that the burger & cheese steak were not huge. We left full but not overstuffed. Lorenzio was the owner was wonderful and helpful. We had chocolate mouse pie for dessert and it was heaven for any chocoholic .
