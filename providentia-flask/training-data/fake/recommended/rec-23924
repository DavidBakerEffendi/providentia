I promise you that a pork sandwich from this place with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe will be the BEST pork sandwich you will ever eat in your life. So maybe taste is entirely subjective and based on individual preference and perception, but I just don't see how a human being could not think these sandwiches are phenomenally delicious. It's like trying to imagine a lion turning down a wildebeest. It just doesn't happen. The meat is so flavorful and the sharp provolone is the icing on the cake. It's actually one of my favorite cheeses. The downside is that the line at this place during lunch time is pretty long. The other day, I was craving a Tommy Dinic's pork sandwich so badly that I gathered up some fellow co-workers and convinced them to speed walk 9 blocks to RTM just so we could get a sandwich. I was heartbroken upon arrival to see the line wrapping around the aisles. On a normal day I would have eagerly endured the wait, but I knew we didn't have enough time as our commute took up half our lunch break alone. I think it's funny how the Pat's and Geno's cheesesteak has become the sandwich icon of our city. Sorry if I offend anyone, but they both suck. They're just tourist traps. Here's some advice to all the tourists out there that want a good sandwich- Go to Reading Terminal Market and wait in Tommy Dinic's line. Even if it is long, I guarantee it will still be shorter than the line at Pat's or Geno's and the sandwich will be a thousand times better.
