The synopsis - Food is good, I will come here again. For appretizers, we got the mexican corn (elote). I'm used to getting it from a street vender and it seemed a little pricey (being about ~$3) but it was pretty good but a little small which is why I kind of have reservations about the price (kind of a cheap-o sometimes). I had a watermelon margarita on the rocks (manly I know) because they had a special on it and it was great. Not candy but not tossing back straight up tequila either. We ordered chimichangas and they were GREAT! Large, delicious, and oh so crispy on the outside. I got al pastor as my meat and it wasn't the best al pastor (not enough marination) I've had but everything else about the gigantic fried burrito was delectable. Damnit, my mouth is watering...
