I love Venturo, their food and drinks are great and they do a mean brunch. I come here a lot. But one thing that bothers me is the brunch service. I get the feeling that one server just doesn't like me, and he always seems a little sad. I wish I knew why you always walk by my table. Let's make it right, server! Next brunch, Bloody Mary on me!
