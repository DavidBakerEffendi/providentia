The Sicilian pizza alone is well worth the wait for some good post-bar munchies.  Add to that the inevitable hilarity of drunk people jostling for position and grub at 4am and you've got a great end to a great night.   Top it off with something sweet and fried from Zed Zeppole's a couple doors down and you're sure to sleep off any chance of hangover! I will be back to Artichoke's on my next trip to NYC.  Maybe I'll even make it there in the daylight!
