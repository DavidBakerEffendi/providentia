The ambiance and energy is great. Especially sitting outside in the summer. The staff is nice but they push the (high margin) drinks aggressively. Â There's a little attitude and the speed of the course services was spotty for us. We got the (tiny) app faster than a Chinatown dive and then waited at least 30 minutes for our (also tiny) entrees. Desert was perfect. I would say Marc Forge is a great place to go if you're not really hungry or on an expense account or both. Blue Ribbon Bakery is the perfect execution of the same concept, sans outdoor seating.
