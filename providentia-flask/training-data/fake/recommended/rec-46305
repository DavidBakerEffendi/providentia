Delicious.  That's my memory of this place.  I came on a stormy night, an hour late meeting my friends because my plane was so delayed and this place quickly made me forget it all.  The moment I sat down, the waitress came right over, took my drink order and even recommended some dishes.  I had the sheep milk ricotta ravioli and it was like butter in my mouth.  So creamy and good.  My only complaint was that I felt the portion was a little small, which is unusual for greek places.  But absolutely tasty.  Also the meatballs.  Perfection.  I was a little underwhelmed by the Sangria, but other than that no real complaints.
