BF has become the occasional go-to casual weeknight dinner place for 3 of us who are friends since it's equidistant from all our homes.  It fits our needs perfectly:  an extensive, fairly-priced menu with everything from light munchies to filling platters...and some nice fattening desserts worth sharing...with the majority of dishes being reasonable hits (with a few misses - pretty obvious to tell from the menu because they're the ones that are a little too overzealously creative), wide-ranging bar menu, nice low-key atmosphere.  And consistently fine service:  attentive, helpful and often funny (and we're not regulars, so it isn't a matter of knowing us) - never had anyone serving us who was indifferent.  I've also been there for Sunday brunch once and it was nice, not overrun with tourists.  If you're seeking a solid dependable meal with friends in a good setting that's professionally and smoothly run, this is it.
