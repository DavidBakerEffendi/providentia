I started going to this place when it first opened.  It looks nice.  The bartenders are pretty good guys.  The food is OK.  It's not the bomb.  If I wanted a burger in this neighborhood, I'd go to Bareburger or maybe three other places before I would even think about going to Afton.  Their burger is fine, but it's nothing special.  And the bun is usually slathered in oil.  Basically it's good when you're hammered and you need something to sop up the alcohol. Two big problems with this place... the reasons I no longer go here: (1) the nightmare hipster invasion that I had feared has converged on this establishment... every twenty-something yahoo in Astoria is now here on Friday and Saturday night, and the place is swamped.  If that's your bag, come and get 'em.  Good for the proprietors, they're reaping some success, but woe is me when I want a drink and a decent conversation. (2) the bouncers are bent on establishing a violent fascist authoritarian state.  Having worked as both a doorman and a bartender, I can say that these are the kind of guys that ruin a patron's first and last impressions of a place.  Attitude problems and intimidation galore... but then again, maybe it's justified with so many scary hipsters around.
