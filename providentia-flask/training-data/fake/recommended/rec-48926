Tried Ginza out with a LivingSocial coupon I had gotten.  We went for a late dinner (9:00 pm).  We were seated right away, there were a few other people in booths lining the wall.  As others have mentioned, the restaurant is pretty cozy.  Small, w/ nice decor.  I was suprised that there weren't Hibachi tables with grills, they explained that they cook their Hibachi in the back.  Fine with me, I've seen the show before and really just wanted the food!  I ordered Filet and Scallops, my boyfriend had some noodle dish.  The salad was great, love that ginger dressing.  Both the miso soup and the mushroom soup were good.  My meal was GIGANTIC!  Noodles, fried rice, veggies, shrimp, and lots of scallops and filet cooked perfectly (medium rare).  Our drinks were refilled as needed, definitely didn't feel like the waitstaff was staring us down at all as I've seen others mention.  I would go back for sure!  If you don't need the hibachi show and just want some delicious food try out Ginza's!  :)
