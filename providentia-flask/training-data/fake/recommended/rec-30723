I'm not as hot on this as Henry B., but this is definitely very good.  (That's what three stars is for me...four is excellent and five is spectacular).  I wouldn't call it amazing x 4, but rather very good. The rolls are extremely creative and unique.  You'll find variations you don't see everywhere else.  In the case of some of them though, there's just too much going on. The seared yellowtail platter is a delicious appetizer with ginger, garlic and a lemon/ponzu sauce.  Yummy. Also surprisingly good is the eel fried rice.   The fish, overall was extremely fresh.  If you are particular about the sushi rice, however, this was average in my opinion -- somewhat too overcooked (mushy rather than the optimum sticky but each grain still maintains its integrity) and it also was lacking the traditional rice wine vinegar, which is part of what I love about the plain sushi experience.   Tuna sashimi was excellent.   The environment is adorable, comfortable, social and modern. A great neighborhood place if you live nearby or find yourself in the area and craving sushi.  If you're going out in DUMBO, say, and you want sushi...go here.  Do NOT go to the Miso place in DUMBO...it's gross. So, my review amounts to: go here if you're in the area and want a great vibe, creative and unique rolls and fresh fish.  If you're looking for impeccable quality of ingredients and preparation other than the fish alone, you can do better in this sushi mecca that is NYC.
