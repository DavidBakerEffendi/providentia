I love this place! so cozy and right off the street from my place. I tried the Pear and Walnut salad which was pretty good (huge portion compared to other places). I also had the Bells Burger with cheese and it was yummy yummy. I hadn't read any of the other yelp reviews prior to going to this place so I might need to go back and try the Bronte Burger. Oh yea almost forgot CASH ONLY. I hate places that are cash only but this little restaurant is so good I'll def be coming back or getting take out :)
