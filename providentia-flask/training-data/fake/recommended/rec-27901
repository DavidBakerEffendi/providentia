My husband and I order from Cafecito weekly.  The cubano and vegetariano 'sandwiches' are great. The best cuban sandwich is from Cafe Habana (chipotle mayo, yum).  But for the East Village, it's the best I've had yet.  The entrees are great as well, but the Pollo Empanizado... not so good, bland.  Overall, I recommend this place for sure!
