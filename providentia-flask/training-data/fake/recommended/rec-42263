I'm there probably once a week and the food is awesome and great vibes inside.  First place I ever had a red velvet waffle and I wanted to hug it! If you want to try it - go monday thru thursday - less of a wait.  Friday and Saturday - get ready to wait a while if you don't have a RSVP and if you do you can only do it in 2 hour blocks.  Besides that I would recommend this place to anyone for someone good food and good times.
