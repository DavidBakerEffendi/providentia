I am sorry, but I don't get all the hype.     We ordered their #3 (sausage, broccoli rabe, ...).   It was fine, but it wasn't anything great.    We also had a spinach salad, which was also just fine fine; nothing special.  I liked the IPA they had on tap, but the pizza was just A-OK and the salad was a meh. Also, of disappointment was that we said we wanted to add mushrooms to the #3.   They said NO --- you can't add any toppings to our specialty pizzas.   This is ridiculous especially when they offer it as a topping on build your own pizzas..     Even more ridiculous is the following:  the table next to us was custom building a pizza (choosing all their own toppings), and she said they wanted spinach as a topping; the customers were told that they don't have a spinach topping, at which point the customer pointed to our table and said "they have a huge spinach salad in front of them; was that the last of the spinach?"  To which the waiter responded:  "All of the spinach we have is for salads only." These people are ridiculous.  They have mushrooms, but you can only put it on a pizza built from scratch; you can't add it to one of their specialty pizzas even if you are willing to pay for it.   They have spinach, but you can't get that on any pizza even if you are willing to pay for it.      After a 20-25 minute wait for us to be seated, and just A-OK pizza, this is dropping them from what would have been 3 stars to 2 stars due to the lack of flexibility by the restaurant with respect to toppings.
