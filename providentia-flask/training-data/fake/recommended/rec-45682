This hibachi place is 10 times better the benihana. We go here at least once a week. The food is good and the chefs are great and entertaining. Chef Abu is my favorite and he's a one man show!!! Management is great and always polite. Definitely worth the trip to Bayonne. Try the angry dragon roll!! Love it
