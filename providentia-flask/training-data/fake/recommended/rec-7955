This was another place in Philly that was recommended to me. I have to say, I loved what I ordered. Although it was a little pricey and the food portion were rather small, I actually was filled to the brim by the time we finished and all was said and done. I ordered the Gnocchi, which came out super fresh and home made. It was literally melt in your mouth type pasta where it literally melted in your mouth. The flavors were just great. I ordered a margarita, which was healthy and strong to taste. For desert, we got the warm blueberry tart, which was so soft and fresh. I loved the confusing layout of the restaurant because it felt like we were really eating at someone's dog decorated house. Make sure you go downstairs and use the bathrooms!
