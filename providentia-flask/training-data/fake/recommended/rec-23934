If I'm going to pay $9 for a burger, it better be good.  My last venture to 500 was a waste of my money.  I got the Turbo burger because I love spice and pickled jalapenos. The fries were great- crispy with the nice earthy tang of truffle- but the burger was seriously disappointing.  I ordered it medium rare and it came out well done and the cheese wasn't even melted. The person who rung me up was sullen and gruff. I had to ask twice to get my cup for water. Really the only good part was the fries. I won't be back.
