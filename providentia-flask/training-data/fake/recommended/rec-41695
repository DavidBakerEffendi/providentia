Good food, good specials. But location is usually crowded. When not getting their happy hour specials the prices are above par. The fare however is pretty authentic California-style Mexican. They do just use premium ingredients which sort of justifies the price, but the table service is sort of lacking as is their portion sizes. Expect long waits for a table and food as well. They also hustle your check service if you dawdle too long after your meal. I liked the service much better when they were a smaller restaurant at their Classon Ave location.
