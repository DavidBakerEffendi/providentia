Wow, I hadn't been back to the Ear Inn in years, but I stumbled upon it while walking around the neighborhood checking out Sandy damage. The Ear Inn used to be a gathering place for BMW motorcycle riders a few years ago (for post-ride relaxation, not pre-ride alcoholism). The food was always good, the atmosphere was relaxed, and the place oozed history. And it was very convenient to the tunnel and the parkway. Sadly, the riders have found new places to gather.
