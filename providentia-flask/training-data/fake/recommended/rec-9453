I came here for Saturday brunch with a friend and realized how packed it was.  It wasn't a long wait, but seeing how people were all trying to dine here got me enthused about this place.  Sure enough, I was not disappointed.   I got the middle eastern breakfast with a pomegranate sparkle which was a part of their brunch specials.  The cocktail was delicious!  It was tart, sweet and the perfect accompaniment to my breakfast.  My dish was a basic one, but none of it was lacking what so ever.  The pita bread that came with my eggs was SUPER warm, soft and fluffy.  It was so satisfying to rip apart the bread as you watch the steam escape.  It was perfect when dipped with the Labne cheese and topped off with the Israeli salad (cucumbers, tomatoes and onion tossed with lime or lemon juice).  I've had mediterranean food before, but this place has the best pita bread
