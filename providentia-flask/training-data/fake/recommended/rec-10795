I hate giving subpar reviews, but... 2 stars go to the view and the potential. The service was completely lacking. When I ask a question about your menu, and your answer is "it's my first day", that is a failure or management or ownerships part for putting you on the floor too soon. But when I have to get up from my table, walk to the bar, and ask what beers you have, because the server never returned to the table, that just means you shouldn't be working in the hospitality industry. And then to the food... Ordered the peel and eat shrimp. Not bad, actually kinda tasty, but back to that service thing, if we ask for no Old Bay seasoning, it probably means we'd prefer if our shrimp doesn't arrive with an ample dusting of Old Bay seasoning... Ordered the Northwest bucket. King crab shell was soft and rubbery, snow crab was lackluster, and the shrimp were overcooked. But the 2 small red potatoes were good... Now I get it, I do. You have to know what you're getting when you eat at a spot like this. I'm originally from the Gulf Coast of Florida and places like this are a dime a dozen down there. But the food and service need to be as good as the view.
