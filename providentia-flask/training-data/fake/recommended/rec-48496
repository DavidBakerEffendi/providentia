We got there early at 11:50 to beat the lunch crowd and scored the quietest table in the back corner. Â At 1:00 when we left the place was packed and there was a line out the door. Regular pub food and a list of Irish specialties. My friend had a burger which she said was delicious (9 bucks). Came with a pile of handcut fries. Other friend had a bowl of baked potato soup (4.50). The soup of the day was chicken noodle. Not a lot of healthy options, but on a cold winter day it did just the trick.
