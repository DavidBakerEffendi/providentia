Keeping this one simple. Hands down the most authenitic and delicious Spanish food in the city. The tapas are great. The best thing here is a pork special that is unbelievable, it comes with a frisee salad and a really good green sauce. Â Yum. No reservations so you may have to wait and the bar is small, but definitely worth the wait.
