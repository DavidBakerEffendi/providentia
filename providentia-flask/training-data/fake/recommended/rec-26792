The food is decent but the service is not good, and after eating here more than a couple of times I am pretty certain it is that if you are non Asian, they treat you like crap. If you do Dim Sum, they are slow to bring around the cart, and often it seems like they bring it around after the variety is limited. I have been to a lot of Chinese restaurants, in NYC in Chinatown and Flushing, I have been to restaurants with Chinese only menus, and I have never been treated like we have been here. Reading the reviews, it sounds like others have run into this. It is a shame, because the food is good, but I won't eat in a place that wants to take my money but treat me like crap, and I also don't tolerate discrimination of any kind. Someone I know went here who was a lawyer, and he spoke of filing a complaint with the state of NJ for violating anti discrimination laws.
