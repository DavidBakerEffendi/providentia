Heard a lot abt the place, finally decided to look for it when I was in NYC last time. It is a cozy place, but the wait line outside can easily tell you how busy the place is. Unless you get there first thing in the morning, otherwise you are expecting abt 2-hr wait. If you don't like the wait, you can always take for to-go...doesn't affect the quality at all. French toast is really good, so are the muffins...pancake is never a disappointment :)
