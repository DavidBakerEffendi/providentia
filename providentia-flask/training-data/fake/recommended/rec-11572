This place wasn't bad. I came here on a Wednesday night, it was packed but we were able to get a table by the window. We ordered the risotto and the grilled calamari. Both were good tasting, the risotto was a bit salty but had good flavor. What I didn't like about this place was the fact that they are cash only and didn't have a sign stating that anywhere. Also the hostess was rather rude to us. The food was good but nothing to write home about.
