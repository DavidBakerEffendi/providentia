I love this place! I've finally been here for 'regular' dinner as well as during Restaurant Week and I think this place is amazing regardless of when you go. Regular dinner: We celebrated my friend's promotion and raise here and the meal was divine. Everyone at the table loved their food and the bubbly. Everything was perfect, great food great company great atmosphere. Restaurant Week: I expected this experience to be less than stellar compared to the full fledged dinner I had here but I was impressed! You get to choose 2 appetizers, 1 main entree and 1 dessert. Everyone at the table must order from the RW menu if you choose to participate. It is A LOT of food so don't worry about leaving hungry. Order anything, everything!
