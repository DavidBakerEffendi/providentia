To simply put it; I was hungry so I yelped.  This place came up on the list and I remember passing by the place before.  We sat as soon as we came in and ordered right away.  The food was I needed.  The empanadas (beef, chicken, cheese) were crispy and the filling for each was delicious.   I ordered the pernil which comes with yuca and sautéed red onions.  I also asked for a side avocado because I love the combination of pernil and avocado.  The whole thing just tasted great and I got a chance to sample the carne guisada.   I have to say I was not disappointed,  neither was my family.  The wait staff was friendly and the atmosphere was pleasant.  Even the bathroom was clean and that always adds a star.  They are cash only and I didn't know until after my meal ended, but there is an ATM on the next block. I highly recommend going.
