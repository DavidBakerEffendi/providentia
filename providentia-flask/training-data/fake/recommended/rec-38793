Wonderful find near NYU Poly. Came here for dinner on Saturday with a group of 6. Had no problem making a reservation the night before, and were able to get seated with just 3 of us at first, with the stragglers trickling in. Atmosphere was cute, dim, but enough to see by. Service was prompt and attentive, but we were slightly disappointed that there were no drink specials, especially considering so many other places along Smith Street had prominently advertised happy hour-ish deals. Ended up getting a 5 citrus mescal margarita, which was certainly citrusy, and fairly strong. We split an order of the gonzaga guacamole, which was extremely fresh, though a tiny bit lacking in heat. Still quite delicious. We also split the merguez lamb tacos, which were very well spiced and perfectly cooked. Having read reviews before coming, I ordered the king crab chilaquiles, never having had that type of dish before. Smart choice on my part, as the crab was sweet and tender, the tomatillo salsa was flavorful without being overwhelmingly spicy, and the garnishes added a nice texture contrast to the dish. Overall, a terrific, reasonably priced dinner, and a place I will definitely return to.
