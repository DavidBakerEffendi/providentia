it was a blistery winters night. I was tired from a long days work and seconds from stepping underground to catch my train home. my foodie friend texts me. "53rd and 6th. 30 minutes. bring your belly." he knows i'm far too weak to ignore any message pertaining to food. we met up and walked down to 53rd and 6th. i scanned the area for the secluded gastropub... ... ..."hold up, wait, i KNOW you didnt drag me out here for this fucking halal cart." "i knew there wouldn't be a line right now dude!! beware the devil sauce man." grumbling, i ordered the lamb and rice. we ate outside in the cold. i can do heat and i was cold, so i did not beware the devil sauce... mistake, BEWARE THE DEVIL SAUCE. that said, what an awesome meal! cheap. tasty. causes cravings. what more could you ask for. give them a try.
