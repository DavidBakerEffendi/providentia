Customer service here is beyond horrendous! The women behind the counter with the same color shirts also have the same attitude to match. It's like pulling teeth to actually get someone's attention & when you finally do it's like they don't want to be bothered! The food is not good to top it off! The owner owns most of the Dominican restaurants in the area & this one by far is the worse!
