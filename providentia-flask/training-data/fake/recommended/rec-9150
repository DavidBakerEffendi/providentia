This was a great random place to grab brunch.  I didn't have any plans on stopping here but sure am glad I did!  While looking through the menu, I realized they were an old-fashion Hungarian restaurant.  You would never know it by the name of the place.  I love me some eastern European food and this place would definitely fit the bill. They have a pretty big brunch menu that made everything sound delicious.  I ordered the creole poached eggs and my friend ordered the ham and cheese omelette (which was seriously PACKED full of meat and cheese).  Good lord are the portions huge!!  Everything was absolutely delicious but do you know what was the lasting impression?  Those unbelievably fantastic home fries!  They weren't the typical fried ones, but the perfectly baked wedges of seasoned potatoes.  Mmmm.  Just awesome. Service was flawless.  Our waitress never let our coffee run low and the food came out very quick.  She was the only waitress serving 4 tables and we never had to wait for anything.  She did lack personality but her efficiency overshadowed the witty banter that could have happened. I would come back here for sure just to try their Hungarian menu.  Chicken paprikash? Gulyas? Porkolt?  If it's Hungarian, consider me there!
