We arrived this evening from California excited to try out Caseus after a long flight. We made a reservation to ensure we received a table and the service was kind. Unfortunately, the food wasn't as good as we had hoped. We tried the 'steak and fries', onion soup, and 'sea bass fish and rice special'. The steak was chewy (medium-cooked) and tasteless. You get like 6 small strips drenched in sauce. The fries that it came with were good though. The soup was up to par and served with a giant piece of bread. The sea bass special was kinda funky as it was served on top of a mixed rice 'special' that was cold/warm with gooey eggplant that wasn't too appetizing. The sea bass was ok. The bread and butter appetizer however was interesting with flavorful, rich butter. Overall we expected more from a restaurant owned by a highly reknowned cheese master in the country. Perhaps, we will give this restaurant another chance in the future when we are back in the area and craving for something cheesy.
