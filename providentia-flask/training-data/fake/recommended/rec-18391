My first time at bareburger- I got the el matador with black bean burger and special sauce added. It was very good. Our server Ron was also very friendly and helpful. They repeated our order a few times to make sure they had everything right since the orders were pretty complicated; everything came out perfectly and we left with happy bellies.
