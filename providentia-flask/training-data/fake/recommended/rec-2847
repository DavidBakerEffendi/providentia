I have to taste ALL the vegan cheese steaks! The cheese steak was fantastic, so was the smoothie...and the spirulina popcorn. nice people great food.Great texture to the seitan and it was very flavorful. Hibiscus has definitely earned that spot for their vegan cheese steak. Â Theirs no where else a person with soy/gluten allergies, or someone who is strict about clean eating would be more at home.Plenty of variety on the menu and the staff are patient and very polite. Amazing smoothies and lots of vegan baked goods.I highly recommend & I expect Hibiscus will be my go-to every time I'm in West Philly.
