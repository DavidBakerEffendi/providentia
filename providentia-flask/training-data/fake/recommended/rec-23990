I usually go for the counter area where you get hoagies, desserts, drinks and etc. I've been going there since I was a teenager and I've only dinned in once. They have the best Vietnamese hoagies and Taro bubble! I love how they make it on the spot when you order it. I've been to some other places, where things are all pre- made and it's not as fresh. If you're in the mood for a good bubble drink, hoagies and desserts then this is the place for you. I'm not a fan with their dinning area because I believe there are better places for it.
