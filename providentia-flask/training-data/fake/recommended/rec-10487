Okay, so first you have to ask yourself: Self, What kind of brunch do I want today? If your answer is boozy latin sangria brunch, without much concern for classic brunch food or other drink options, then this is the place for you. Here's the deal: you order something on their brunch menu (prices range from $12-$18) and you get free unlimited access to their EXTENSIVE selection of Sangria. Pretty fantastic. The brunch menu isn't very extensive (mostly just classic Latin dishes with scrambled eggs thrown in for brunchy-ness), but the burrito I had was pretty good. The sangria selection, on the other hand, is much more exciting. Basically there's a table with six or seven different kinds of sangria for you to choose from and you can pour yourself as many different glasses as you'd like. The venue is also really nice. Very high ceilings, lots of space, and there are booths and tables available. There's a lounge and bar in the front and then a large dining room in the back. Make reservations if possible though, as it's apparently gotten more popular recently. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that the sangria isn't delicious. It's okay, but it's definitely not the best. Mine was kind of watery and flavor-less. That said, it's practically FREE so...yeah, I'm not complaining.
