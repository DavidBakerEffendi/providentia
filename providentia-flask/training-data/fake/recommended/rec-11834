Completely disappointed, specially after all the reviews and the average score here. The food wasn't good and the prices were high, not compatible with the quality. I would not go back. When me & wife got there, we were a little scared by the prices. Average pasta price ~$20, meats ~$35, chicken ~$25 and sea food ~$40. We went for the pastas, assuming that's the best way to measure an Italian restaurant. I went for a "Ragiatelli on Vodka" (a penne with pink vodka sauce, small pieces of mushroom, bacon and Italian sausage) and my wife went with the Gnocci (with tomato sauce and pieces of cheese) - both plates were bad, verging on terrible. The Ragiatelli's sauce was so strong and the meat taste was so overpower that I was a little nauseous and couldn't finish it. The Gnocci was way overcooked, it was almost mashed potatoes with tomato sauce (the small mozzarella pieces were very good, though). The service was somewhat decent: there were a lot of waiters, but we never saw a wine list and they never asked us if we wanted anything to drink! It's one of those restaurants were the waiter is so polite and so all over you that it gets a little discomforting after a while. I also don't like places where the waiter throws the napkin on your lap :) Bad Italian food, very high prices, not so good service.
