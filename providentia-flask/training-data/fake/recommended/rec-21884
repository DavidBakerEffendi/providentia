I had an absolutely lovely double date here yesterday. One member of our group was gluten free. This was the perfect place to come! My gluten free friend received special gluten free bread at the start of our meal and was blown away by all of the gluten free pasta options. She decided on the spinach and ricotta ravioli with pink sauce and raved about the dish the whole evening! We all enjoyed a pitcher of sangria and the non gluten free food was great too! The service was helpful and attentive and the atmosphere exceeded my expectations after reading yelp reviews!
