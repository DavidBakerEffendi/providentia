This place doesn't belong here. I mean that in a good way. The decor: bamboo walls, florescent backdrops and enough room in your booth for a good conversation. There is even a little table for you to watch them making sushi. The food is good, not great. The explanations in the menu are on point. No matter who you are with they will have something to make them happy. And the wait staff is very nice and talkative. The only negative is the wait, it took us about 15 mins on a recent Saturday to get a table. (they lost my reservation) But we just stood around and talked. and as soon as the next table became available, they sat us, not like some places that always cater to the regulars
