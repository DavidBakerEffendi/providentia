I came here for the lunch special at around 2:00 on a Friday. There were two people waiting for takeout and two people eating-in. There are only about five chairs to sit, so large parties are not the best for this place. I had the lunch special that included the side-car sandwich, lychee green ice tea and a bag of pretzels. This was all for a little under $9 (which included tax). The sandwich was delicious (the bread was perfectly crispy). The tea was my definitely my favorite though. They make their tea fresh with real fruit; it was also the perfect amount of sweetness. My only complaint about the sandwich is that I asked for spicy and I barely tasted it. I highly recommend this place. The owner was really friendly as well.
