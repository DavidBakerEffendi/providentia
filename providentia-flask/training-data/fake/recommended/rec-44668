The perfect neighborhood restaurant. Damn, but it's not in my neighborhood. The charming owner and obliging staff set the tone, so genuinely welcoming that you really feel taken care of. The cozy interior is like a little jewel box. It's crowded, but in the way Thanksgiving is crowded, with happy people enjoying their chow. It was mostly groups, but a casual date here would be sweet. The pizzette app was the only disappointment. It was tasty enough, but not special in any way and rather small. If you can't do pizza well, it's probably not worth doing. Maybe it's on the menu to placate picky kids who won't eat anything else? Salads are surprisingly yummy and sometimes inventive: Our group of 6 made quick work of a nicely dressed Caesar, and the Bistango salad (doubled), somehow makes apples, goat cheese, and pine nuts seem inevitable. The perfectly cooked pastas are definitely sharable, the gnocchi sauced in a nicely meaty way. The meat options are also tasty but less interesting. Wine is reasonably priced; we were recommended a Merlot that everyone loved. Desserts are fine, but the homemade gelato is a standout. So creamy--and the black raspberry brilliantly flavorful. Everything can be made gluten-free, but that's only the beginning of Bistango's flexibility. Want ingredients left out, swapped out, or doubled? Ask away! Want something bigger, smaller, spicier, plain? Sure! After some liqueur, gratis, for the grown-ups (and some thoughtfully provided OJ for the kids so they won't feel left out), and one last hug from the owner, you'll be wishing Bistango was your neighborhood joint too.
