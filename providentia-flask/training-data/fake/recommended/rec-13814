The line was pretty long. It was a good late night snack(?) after a Broadway show. It was my first time trying lamb and rice, and it was pretty good. The food comes in a huge portion, but if you're tipsy and the weather is cold, you can finish it all while sitting on the sidewalk in front of the skyscrapers like bums. The food overall was good, but nothing spectacular to be honest. There are just so many of these carts in the city that I would just go somewhere else to avoid the wait.
