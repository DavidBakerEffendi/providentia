This is my favorite Tapas place in the city. My best friend and I love going to Tapas bars and we come here at least twice a month. I have yet to had a tapa that wasn't good and they sangria is amazing. They have so many different flavors. My favorites are the red sangria and the blueberry/pomegranate/champagne sangria. And on Thursdays and Saturdays, they have flamenco dancers. I have yet to go then, because I never plan enough in advance, but I'm hoping to go soon. I highly recommend checking this place out. You won't be disappointed.
