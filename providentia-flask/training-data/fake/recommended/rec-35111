I used my Groupon at Cornerstone and boy did I get a good deal- 2 entrees, 2 drinks, and 2 desserts!!  It's an Italian homestyle restaurant.  I had the eggplant parmigiana with spaghetti and it was very good. My mom had the flounder with mashed potatoes & spinach and she said was good. We both had the apple pie which was perfect, not too sweet!  The ambiance was very laid back. I would definitely go back & would try their cheap brunch menu!!
