So, I love Westville. I love the formula, I love the food - it works for me. No wonder I was soooper psyched to see that it was opening a new location right near my house. It looks great from the inside - it's spacious, airy, light, and a nice, clean design with a bar. Love the bar. And there's a (very small) outdoor seating possibility. They had to build a kitchen in this space, so it took them a loooong time to open. Unfortunately, it still seems to have some kitchen issues. The first time I went, I ordered take-out, and took a seat at the bar. 40 (!!!) minutes later, I finally got my food. They kept on saying "it was coming", but really, a turkey burger shouldn't need to take 40 minutes. Also, it seemed like diners were getting their food before me. The second time I came with a group and we were seated quickly and service was much better. The food took a little while to come, but definitely not 40 minutes. I'll keep on dining here, just because I love Westville and its veggies... but I hope they sort out their issues soon. Three stars for now, but I might give more stars at a later time. Some favorites: Market Veggie plate (try the brussel sprouts... seriously, so damn good, even though I used to hate brussel sprouts!) The sandwiches on special - last time I had a fishcake, mmm! Salmon over baby spinach with lemon-dill vinaigrette (don't know what they put in that but it's dee-lish!). Anyway, just go, and try it out. You won't be disappointed.
