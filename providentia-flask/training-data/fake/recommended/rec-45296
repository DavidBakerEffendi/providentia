This is my favorite restaurant in New York, and I bring all my out of town guests here for the great atmosphere and delicious food. In particular, the French ravioli is memorable to the point if friends bringing it up later - "Remember that French restaurant with that ravioli? I dream about it years later!" But the Mexican food is just as good, and I definitely always get the fresh guacamole made at the table. So good! Remember, cash or AMEX only though - be prepared because it's totally worth it.
