Great profiteroles, wonderful friendly service, just went there after the Flynn. Have had lunch there and that was great to. Beautiful in the evening. Had dinner there on Saturday, very good food, service was good too, everything served very nicely, great presentation. We had the dinning room to ourselves, it was a beautiful day and everyone wants to sit out. The food is a little expensive but the quality justifies it.
