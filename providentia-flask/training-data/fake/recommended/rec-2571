Slightly better than Geno's across the street. Meat seems to be of marginally better quality here and sliced in longer thinner strips which I prefer. Everything else I found to be nearly identical to Geno's. Also, the staff was a lot nicer than at Geno's. Those guys at Geno's are hardcore dickheads. Yeah I said it, dickheads. You got a problem with that? Finally, there is a scene in Rocky where Sylvester Stallone is chilling here. In fact, there is a engraving in the cement block signifying the exact spot he stood at in the movie! I rented Rocky just to see this scene. And it was well worth it! Take that Geno's! BOO-YA!
