We came for a late brunch here on Saturday and LOVED it. I had griddle cakes with berries, and homemade chicken apple sausage - both were RIDICULOUSly delicious. My boyf had sausage egg and cheese on a biscuit and swore it was the best biscuit he's ever eaten. It was comfortable, cool and cozy. We were there at a weird time so it wasn't crazy busy, and we had a great time chatting with the hostess and servers. Donna, the owner, even came over to make we were happy. One thing: Google will tell you that it's on Fred Doug Blvd but it's NOT, it's on Amsterdam. Luckily it was totally worth the hike!
