OK, so I thought this place would be a lot like Marea in terms of excellent food and its not at all; not to say that its bad, but just not spectacular for what you're paying. I would stick to the pasta dishes as everyone in my group liked their pasta dish but the main entrees were a miss. I'd rather save some dough and go to Frank Restaurant in the EV instead
