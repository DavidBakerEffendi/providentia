I absolutely love this restaurant. My friend was visiting from Albany and told me he'd never had Peruvian food. Obviously, that needed to be remedied. The menu prices scared us a little, but they have a great lunch special: $10 for quarter chicken, salad, choice of side and soda. Yes, soda is included. I thought that didn't exist anymore. The chicken was cooked perfectly with no dryness to be found, only plump, tender, juicy heaven. I tried the green sauce, and my mouth was on fire for a few minutes. I'm really not into spicy food. If you are, definitely try the sauce. We chose to sit outside, and it was fun getting envious looks from all the people passing by. On my second Pio Pio excursion, a friend and I shared the sea bass and a tamal. THe sweet sauce accompanying the sea bass was amazing. The fish itself was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, which we weren't expecting. It was a nice surprise. I had assumed chicken was their specialty, but it seems like they do everything as well as the chicken. I'm already thinking about what to have next time.
