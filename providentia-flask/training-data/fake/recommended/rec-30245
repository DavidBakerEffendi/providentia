Was a little nervous walking it at 9 pm on a Saturday. Was really dead, but it was January and like 5 degrees out. Table of three was seated promptly. Only small complaint was fish heavy appetizer list. So I went with the pulled pork croquettes.  Insanely good. Never had caviar before so I was nervous about the deviled eggs with troat roe. These were incredible. I will be making my own version of these on Easter. For entrée I got the Tuna steak. I hate cauliflower and they let me switch it out with squash. Everything was very good. Waitress was not 100% attentive but service was still solid.
