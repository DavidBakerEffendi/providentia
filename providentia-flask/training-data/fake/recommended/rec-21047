I lived across the street from this place for 4 years, and my best friend still does. This was a near every other day place for me to go to and grab drinks, tapas, etc. WAS. The food is quite delicious, amazing variety, and their cocktails are GREAT -- their barkeeps definitely take pride in their work! But ugh, I know this is somewhat par for the course in NYC, but I can't deal with it.... so many times I have been there and members of the rodentia family have frolicked and scampered across the floor. For a while now, all I can do is manage a drink there, but food - no way. Can't make myself do it...
