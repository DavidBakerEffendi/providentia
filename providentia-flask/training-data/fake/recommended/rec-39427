I found these guys on accident when walking back to the Manhattan Club. I am usually leery of street meat as I have had 1 too many bad apples but it just smelled so good and I was so drunk and hankering for some grease and man this was love at first bite. They truly live up to their hype. These guys get you in and out (sometimes have to wait because there are that many people) and in and out again because you want to go back and try something else. I cant even begin with the sauces... They know they are masters with the sauce so they give you plenty knowing you will ask for more. The chicken is cooked so perfectly and the rice and ALL OF THE WHITE SAUCE is out of this world. I wish I was close enough to hit their carts up more but I try to make it a priority of hitting them up after a night of drinking.
