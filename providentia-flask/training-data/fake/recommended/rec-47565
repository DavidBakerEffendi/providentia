This place isn't really Mexican or Tex-Mex. But, it is damn good. They do everything right. Their margaritas are all tasty and fairly strong. The appetizers I have tried have all been good. Nothing amazing but none bad. The Cajun Popcorn shrimp is always tasty.  All the dinners are good. The Chimichurri steak, tacos, burritos, fajitas and Chile relleno are all good choices. The place is huge but on Fridays and Saturday's does fill up. So try and go before 6 if you can. Lots of parking.  A little tip on getting in there easy if you come from the north. Take 1 & 9 and when they split take 9. Then make the very first right on a tiny side street called Queen. This crosses green street and runs right into their parking lot. Enjoy!
