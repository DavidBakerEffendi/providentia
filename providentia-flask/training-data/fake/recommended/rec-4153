Came at the recommendation of my friend in Hell's Kitchen--so this is a true local hangout.  INCREDIBLY CHEAP for lunch specials: $6.50!  I never thought you could even get a drink in Manhattan for that much.  Ample food that was just right for a late breakfast/lunch (my friend didn't believe in brunch but he convinced me....and this was just fine without the usual sugar burst).   Creative decorations with mirrors and chandeliers which I noticed a lot in the small NYC diners.   Not crowded for lunch on a Sunday.  Chicken cashew and cucumber salad were fresh and light for a semi-breakfast
