Maybe I just went on a off day, but the food was a little lackluster for me. Went here with a group of friends for Sunday brunch. We ordered different dishes, but three of our dishes looked the same. I don't know about you, but I like a little bit more originality. I wish they would've specified that the entrees were all omlette style. They didn't even mention eggs as one of their ingredients. I was just very confused when we got our dishes. Am I missing something here? People seemed to give it good reviews.
