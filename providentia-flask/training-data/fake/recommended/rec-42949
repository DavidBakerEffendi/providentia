After a ridiculous night in the East Village, every hungry hipster ends up in a line outside of a window at Pommes Frites. And now, I know why. After dancing my booty down at Lit, I was hungry for some dirty hipster food. Maybe it was all the strange 90's music, or the basement dance party...but I wanted some fried food at 4am, and man oh man, did Pommes Frites deliver. I walked upon Pommes Frites and saw a huge line. I also saw a sign that said they were closing at 3:30am. They stayed open until 4am for us! So friendly! The employees were hilarious and really nice for being so busy! Before I ordered, I read the reviews about the mango chutney mayo so I surrendered and got it (against my black truffle mayo will). It was so freaking good I licked the container clean! The fries themselves, were thick and crunchy. Very fun dipping shape and really fresh and hot! Yum! The best part was that my friend who was asleep when I came home at 4am, woke up and helped me finish off my huge bag of frites and mayo. She thought they were awesome too. Ah...So love the village. I will be back soon.
