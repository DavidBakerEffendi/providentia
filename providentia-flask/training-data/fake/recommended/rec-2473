So yeah - if you don't live in philly - you're probably going to say Craps (pats) and Beno's (geno's) are the places to go for steaks.  Let me be clear, if you are one of those people: please do us all a favor and jump from the ledge next time you get a chance.  It's bad enough living in the ATL and having to listen to everyone talk about how great these two disasters are. I may have only eaten at these places a combined 5 or 6 times but i know a tourist trap when i see one.  Two reasons to go to either pat's or geno's: A) You're a tourist and your tour guide is one of the cruelest SOBs on the face of the earth or B) You're smashed and riding shotgun in your buddies pickup truck while driving through philly singing "I'm a Little Teapot" Okay, so yes I say Craps scores slightly better than that junk across the street... but again - the bar is pretty freakin low here. As i said in my review of Geno's: Either shoot yourself in the face many times over - or go to one of the 300 other spots in the city to get a cheesesteak.  Delessandro's, Tony Lucas, and Steve's come to mind - but there are a slew of others.  And please - this is not about the frekain WIZ.  If you like it with cheese wiz - i won't stand in your way (i've had a few tasty cheeze wiz steaks in my time)... but that does not make Pat's good.
