Went here with a group of friends to kick off a girl's night out in the city. Service was fast and friendly! Our top requirement in choosing a dinner location was that it be BYOB and accepting of many, many bottles of wine and champagne. Melograno was just that -- along with really great food! Everyone in my party was happy with what they ordered. We started with mussels and the meat, cheese and vegetable plate. All very good. Warm bread was brought to the table and was perfect for sopping up the rest of the broth from the mussels. I had the Pappardelle Tartufate which came highly recommended by Yelpers. Very good -- and unlike nothing I've ever had. While it was delicious, I'd probably not get it a second time. There's a lot of other yummy options to try ... which brings me to the Cotoletta alla Senese that my friend ordered and I tried. Very, very good. I highly recommend this dish. The chicken cutlet was fresh, perfectly seasoned and finished off with lemon. Topped with priscuitto, argula, cheese and tomato. Yum! I also tried a bite of the Risotto ai Gamberoni with fennel and goat cheese. Very good, too. It was a bit loud (as noted in other reviews), but we didn't mind it one bit. For that reason, I'd recommend this place for groups rather than an intimate date. Enjoy!
