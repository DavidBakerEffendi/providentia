My friend and I really enjoyed our meal and entire experience. Ambiance was casual and host and servers were very friendly and attentive. We ordered a lovely bottle of Pinot Grigio and the servers continued to fill our glasses when needed. We ordered 3 appetizers: 1. Mussles with andoulie sausage - Pretty good, nice size mussles.  a generous portion for an appetizer, my friend and I did not even finish it because we did not want to get too full before our entrée..AND we also had 2 other appetizers 2. Tuna Tartare, another winner! Again good portion for Tuna Tartare, nice that teeny tiny portions that some restaurants give. 3.Squash dumplings - OMG these were one of the most amazing dumplings I have ever tasted. You HAVE to Try this! Entrée: Since my friend and I already ordered 3 appetizers, we decided to split the Hanger steak. Not a huge piece, it's sliced into about 8 pieces. Each piece about bite sized. We ordered fries with it. Steak was perfectly seasoned and cook just right. We were stuffed but enjoyed every bite we had. This is definitely on my bookmark list!
