Great food at a reasonable price! We found this restaurant at its old location and fell in love - but now the convenient Morrisville, PA location means even more visits to this awesome food oasis! We've had kofta and gyro and samosas and kabobs - it was all good. Â Even the chickpeas are amazing. The gentleman who waited on me, whom I assume to be the proprietor, is very gracious and kind. Please do yourself a huge favor and try Jahan Kabob & Grill. The new location is very clean and inviting Next time, I plan to try the curry. Yum!
