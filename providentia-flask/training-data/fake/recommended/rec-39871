It's open 24 hours on weekends...super convenient. They have a pretty good breakfast/brunch and dinner menu. Dessert is good too. The prices are reasonable and the staff is very friendly and never rush you out though the place can get pretty busy at times. My personal favorite is the shrimp pasta dish. Brunch on weekend can get crazy but the food is worth it. Anything with eggs is tasty. Overall a laid-back, casual place to get an affordable meal.
