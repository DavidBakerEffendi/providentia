I went to the old Rudy's only once, late into the night, after I had already done my fair share of partying. All I remember from that visit was walking into what seemed to be a biker bar and getting led from room to room until we reached the pool table and met up with some long lost friends. I recently ventured into the new Rudy's and found it to be vastly different. A dive bar no more. It is sleek and chic. It was a hot night and they had the windows next to the almost empty bar open, but it was a Tuesday night so I guess some people have to work the next morning or something. My friends and I sat at a table and put in an order for some drinks and an order of frites with mango sauce at the bar. The frites and the sauce were delicious. I washed it down with a glass of Petrus as the jukebox picks made by my friends filled up the room and I thought to myself, "I like this Rudy's."
