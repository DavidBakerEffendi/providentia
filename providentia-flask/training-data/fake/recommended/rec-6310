I had takeout from here once, it was okay but the sushi was not noticeably fresh or flavorful. If I were to eat here again I would probably go for the wings or whatever else the reviewers seem to like. Came here again with my dad for a beer before dinner (I noticed that they had an interesting selection of Japanese liquor and thought the same might be true for beer). We ordered from an older white guy who seemed a bit irked that we weren't ordering food (maybe we should have sat at bar and not the patio?). We ended up ordering and waiting over 10 minutes for the beers while the waiter walked around aimlessly. Finally, a nice woman notified us (after I flagged her down) that the bartender was out of the beer we wanted and that they were "going to" tell us. Seemed as though they didn't particularly want our business. But this place shouldn't pick and choose, it didn't seem that popular on a Friday night.
