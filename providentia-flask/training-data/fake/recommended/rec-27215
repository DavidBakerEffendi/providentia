I came here on Sunday with two friends- there was only 4 other tables taken and we experienced the slowest service ever. It took about 25 minutes to get our drinks and an hour and fifteen minutes to get our food. Let me point out that we ordered scrambled eggs and a burger. The table next to use that had gotten there after us had already eaten and paid before we had even gotten our food. We had pointed out to our server that we had been waiting an hour and he didn't even act like it was strange that we were waiting over an hour for scrambled eggs. Maybe they went to the farm to pick the eggs, who knows. When the food finally came it was cold. Will not be going back
