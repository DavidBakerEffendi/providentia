I have such a love/hate relationship with The Fine Grind. To be fair, I have dreams about their Froho--yeah, that good.  The service is great, and the whole places has a cozy vibe. I seem to have odd dramatic encounters every time I go there. Like I had a man in a hospital gown--still with an IV bag, ask me for a ride to West Orange in the parking lot.  Or another time, there was a crazy guy came in screaming and yelling. I don't go that often, but this seems to consistently happen--I like having a chill night out for coffee, but not with the extra weird events.
