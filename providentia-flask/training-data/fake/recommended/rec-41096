We went on Saturday Dec 21st. I think it was the 2nd weekend it was open. Fantastic and friendly service, everything was delicious, including the cocktails, nice ambiance. We ate downstairs as it was more lively at the time but afterwards peeked in their upper level - which was beautifully done too. Â Will definitely be back.
