Ahhhh Uva! We have eaten here three times and the ambiance, the wine bar, the excellent food- this place has Â it all! Being an Italian foodie- and in the food business for over 20 years - I am soooo happy to find a place in the UES to be our go-to! We have tried several restaurants in this area and none can even come close to Uva. We have a large family, 4 kids (11-24 years) and there are always friends, boyfriends, girlfriends etc eating out with us so my husband typically drops quite a bit on dinner- he doesn't mind as long as it is worth it- and here it definitely is! Family friendly, the greenhouse in the back has an awesome, cozy feel, as does the brick interior to the restaurant. We love the "create your own antipasta" type menu- with LOTS of cheeses and meats to go with the wide selection of wines. We are seriously in love with this place- and when we go we don't want to leave ;)
