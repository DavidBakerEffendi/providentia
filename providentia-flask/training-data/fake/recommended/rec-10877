Fort Defiance is a really great place if you are looking for a relazed midday munch. I've not yet tried their dinner menu but their afternoon snackeries are so delumptious it's ridiculous. I'd never before tried deviled eggs but I just about scarfed down 4 of those they were so delicious and well-made. Same goes for their pressed sandwiches: the bread is great, the cheese, the everything! Fort Defiance is the place to go if you are looking for good food accompanied by a laid-back, friendly, easy going vibe.
