Came here with a group of friends for a night out on a Wednesday night.  This place was super busy!  We had no problem getting a reservation for 6:30pm though and were seated in the lower level. The servers were attentive and the ambiance and decor were very nice.   The food: I had the lamb burger, and was pleasantly surprised.  It didn't have a lot of sauces on but it had a bit of a kick and was a nice detour from the normal beef burger.  It comes with this wonderful greek salad that I gobbled up first before even starting on the burger.  The side of chips were perfectly addicting as well. For dessert, my friends and I shared the chocolate mousse and it was extremely thick and chocolatey, and better than expected. I would definitely recommend this place for a romantic night or with a group of friends.  I have actually been here a few years ago for a larger group for a birthday, and I remember it being fun as well.  Just try to get a reservation because it does get very busy!
