Best BBQ I've had in New York. The brisket is super moist, which is my personal preference. It has a tasty rub. I've had better brisket only once, in Austin... The beef rib is pretty much my favorite rendition of the beef short rib. It's awesome, and worth the asking price. It's pretty fatty and delicious, so it might best be gotten as part of a group order and divided among two people. Or not. The chicken wings are delicious as well with a bright-hot-sweet-tangy sauce. The pork is also pretty good. 3 bean salad and baked beans are both very good. A winner. And the price is right, too!
