Stopped by El Vez last night after running errands in CC with my boyfriend. For a rainy Monday, It was pretty packed, there were even people sitting outside drinking their margarita's in the rainy mist. I came to get some drinks and I was really craving their Carne Asada, which I have had on several occasions before. We put our name in at around 8, drank a pitcher of (strong!) Pink Cadillac's at the bar and by the time we were finishing up, our table was ready. From the MOMENT we sat down, to the moment we got up to leave, our server was on point. We always had a full drink, both alcoholic and water. We got the bazooka limon guac and the blue corn bread as appetizers. We were hungry, and slightly intoxicated, so we may have over ordered for just the two of us, but it was worth it. We had ample time to eat our appetizers before our steaks came out. They were accurately cooked (YES!) and our server was always around to make sure we were okay (YES!) and to fill our glasses from our Frozen Blood Orange pitcher (yum yum). We left drunk, bursting at the seams from stuffing ourselves with so much food, and not totally broke. The only bummer is that they changed the Carne Asada dish and I didn't look at the menu to realize it. My fault. It used to come with a fresh mushroom salad and now it comes with some weird chips covered in what tasted to me like BBQ sauce. Whatever, the steak was bangin.. No, El Vez is not completely authentic, but that's not why you should go there. It's pretty and interestingly decorated, there's always an eclectic mix of people from young professionals to UArts kids and everything in between. It's fun. The drinks are sweet, the food is satisfying, the service is pretty great and it's not that damn expensive.
