Two words. Cheese steak!! Owner Sal has been in neighborhood for over ten years. Used to be Dnetto's bagels before. Also has another owner Omar who is a culinary trained chef and has designed the menu. Â Now it's smaller deli and more sit down. You can also take out and they have a coffee window for those on the go. Bagels have come back. Food is better than before. They even have dessert. Made by the chef as well. This place is no joke. Check the pics of the food. That's what you're going to get. Thanks for coming back and feeding us. RIP Theresa never will be forgotten and watch over this restaurant.
