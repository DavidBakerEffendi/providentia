Where do I begin? Restaurant: cozy yet vibrant environment. It can get quite busy at times, but that just adds to the experience of eating street food. Table space is limited, but this food is well worth the trip. Food: They have a HUGE selection of Indian sweets...my favorite mithais are the paan mithai, Kashmiri peda, etc. while you're there, you have to try their savory street foods. Top at my list are the puri chole and papdi chaat. Don't be fooled by the "Kwality Sweets" that opened next door, go to THE "Quality Sweets."
