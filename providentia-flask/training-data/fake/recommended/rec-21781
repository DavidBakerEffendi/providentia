I love this place! I've passed it by so many times that I couldn't believe it had been flying under my radar for so long.  A friend of mine got a Groupon, rounded up a bunch of friends and we went.  I love French food and so does my sister, and so we were excited for a different French palate.  (We are the type of to throw Provencal herbs into anything to see what comes out). I had lamb, lamb, lamb and some mussels.  My sister had chicken, and she loved her plate also.  The food was incredible.  The best part, though?  The service!  We had an incredibly sweet waitress, and got to meet the chef.  This is the perfect place for friends that enjoy the simple pleasures in life, good food, family and good friends.  What a memorable night!
