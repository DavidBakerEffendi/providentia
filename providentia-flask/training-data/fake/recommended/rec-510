I went there last night with my boyfriend. After getting out of the movie theater which is pretty much right next door, we walk past the restaurant and i was like wait $10 dinner special what?? yup, 2 appetizers and 1 entree for $10 (only on mondays and tuesdays i believe). So we gave it a shot. It's very comfortable, the decor is beautiful, the atmosphere feels perfect for a cozy chic eastern themed restaurant. The restroom is big and clean and very pretty! By the bar there is a nook and a bench so you have more room to put your things down, which is perfect if you want a secluded spot to dine with your hunnie. My boyfriend got a glass of house merlot and it was just ok, bland. I wish I could say more about the food. I order calamari, black out noodle, and shrimp pad see ew. The calamari was pretty good, the noodle i loved, but the entree was meh. The shrimp tasted a bit rubbery. My bf got the thai salad, the chicken satay, and the beef in garlic sauce, and he said he enjoyed his food (i only tried a bit of his entree, it was ok/ good. i thought it would come with jasmine rice but mb he had to order that specifically). All in all, perfect except the food. From the reviews I've read, sounds like it's hit or miss. But i would say defintiely check it out cuz it is a deal oh and keep in mind they don't take amex
