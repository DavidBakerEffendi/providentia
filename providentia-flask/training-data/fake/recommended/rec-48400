deeeelish.  hard to choose anything that's not great, and it's the kinda menu where you want to get everything.  big portions, hearty and filling meals, great ambiance.  everyone i take here loves this place. mushroom dumplings are a fave. there is a great waitstaff, except for the ponytailed dude behind the bar, who is a total douche, and gets in your face about it too.  but whatevs, just avoid him and you're all good.
