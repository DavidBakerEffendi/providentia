This is my favorite spot to stop in Soho.  I love the atmosphere and decor.  I have only ever had breakfast at Balthazar, but I enjoy the thought that I can sit with my cup of coffee and people watch for as long as I'd like.  Plus, breakfast is my favorite meal to eat out!  I use Balthazar as my benchmark for other French Bistro style restaurants.  Few compare to it!
