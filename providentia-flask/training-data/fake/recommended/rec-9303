This place reminds me of a thai restaurant on 42nd street. I love the chandelier right in the middle of the room as a showcase and they had mirrors all over the wall even on the ceiling. This place was very dark. I love how the waitress and waiters were dressed up in the 50s style (I think it's the 50s). (****) I ordered the Spicy Thai Basil Dish and asked for Mild since I can't eat too spicy. It came with rice and you're going to need it because it was super salty. The flavor was very bold, but it was really good despite the salt. (***) Service was good. They refilled my water and asked how we were doing with our meal. Even though they cleared out plates, they didn't kick us out right away which is good. (***)
