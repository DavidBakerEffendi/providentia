What a great find! Came here last Friday with my BU Crew. It was a must needed night of great food, excellent sangria and lots of catching up. We were also celebrating the recent engagement of 2 of our crew - congrats again Megan & Jon! Anytime you're rolling with a crew tapas is a great way to go. Everyone gets to try out a bunch of things and usually everyone in the group finds something they like (or you all argue over who gets the last bites of the one thing everyone loves). The food at Tia Pol is great, there wasn't a single dish we tried that I didn't like. Also, the sangria is some of the best I've had in the city... we went through several pitchers... so tasty! The vibe here is cozy and low key. The space is smaller than some of the other tapas joints I've been to, but the layout is unique with tables in various nooks and crannies of the restaurant and larger spots in the back. If you're there with a crew you can feel free to be loud and festive without disturbing couples on dates in the front of the restaurant, which is pretty smart on their part. Our crew's favorites were the patatas bravas with spicy aioli (nom, nom, nom!), fried chickpeas, fried artichoke and asparagus salad, the lamb skewers, and the squid in ink. Service was excellent and prices are reasonable for New York. I'd suggest Tia Pol for anyone looking for a good group spot, for date night, and to host any type of celebration. However, I'd also suggest grabbing a resie ahead of time. Hopefully I'll be heading back again myself sometime soon!
