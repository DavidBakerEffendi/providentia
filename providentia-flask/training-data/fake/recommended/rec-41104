I have been eating here occasionally for years. The food is almost always good and generally never disappoints (save for the occasional leftover dry rice). The portions are healthy and the meat always tender. Dev's is great. I won't give it an additional star because the one thing that is consistent - the service is slow as molasses regardless of whether you call it in or order at the counter. I enjoy their food, so I endure. Their carrot cake is great, too. I usually get the jerk pork/curry goat with rice and peas and steamed cabbage. My daughter loves their roti and plaintains. Unfortunately, I just don't get there often these days and miss it!
