Nan Zhou is a keeper. They serve an excellent broth, almost reminiscent of a dark pho. We tried the sliced pork, lamb, and oxtail and, without exception, all were very good. The noodles, especially the shaved noodles, are heavy and toothsome, pairing nicely with the biting preserved greens and abundant fresh cilantro. The meat is pretty scant but is still flavorful. The steamed dumplings were good and juicy but the dipping sauce was too scarce and thin to really make an impression on them.  Not exactly a big problem.  The avocado smoothie wasn't one of the best, but you can never go wrong with an avocado smoothie. The waitstaff was prompt and the price-point was absurdly cheap for the high quality of food.
