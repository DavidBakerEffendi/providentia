Really yummy hotdogs here! They're all different but delicious. I had "the Michigan" which is chilli, onion, cheese and mustard and it was amazing. The fries are great and they have different sauces. I had the "serracha" the lady said itd be spicy, but it was wasn't and was still good. My friend had "pero caliente" with chipotle mayo and she enjoyed it as well.
