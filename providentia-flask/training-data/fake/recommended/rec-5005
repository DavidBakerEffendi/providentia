I don't understand how anyone could give this place less than 5 stars! This place is the most exceptional food establishment I have ever been to. The service is Â outstanding with attentive, informative, friendly staff. Although the space is small, the staff makes you feel comfortable and welcomed immediately. All of the food is extremely fresh, and absolutely delicious. A fantastic addition to the neighborhood!
