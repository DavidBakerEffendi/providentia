My wife and I came to Clinton St. Baking Company back in October. The place has great reviews on Yelp and I have to say I had a mixed experience. I am still giving it 4 stars because the blueberry pancakes were absolutely delicious. The other thing we tried were the eggs benedict which was not as good. It could just be personal preference but the poached egg on top was overcooked - not runny which is kind of the point of a poached egg and a major selling point of eggs benedict. This was basically a differently shaped hard boiled egg. Maybe the cook was having a bad day but I feel like a breakfast place (which is what Clinton St. is most well-known for) should be able to poach an egg properly. Overall, still a good experience.
