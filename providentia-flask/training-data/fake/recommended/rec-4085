I just went to this place for the first time, and the taco I had was absolutely delicious. I ordered two but could only eat one, it was so satisfying and I wanted to savor the flavor. Make no mistake, this is definitely nothing more than a slightly upscale fast-food place, similar to a deli style with a more diverse menu, but the food is really good-- especially if you compare it to other restaurants in its caliber.
