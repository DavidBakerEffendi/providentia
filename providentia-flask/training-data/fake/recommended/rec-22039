Good food, location and atmosphere. Their vegetarian and vegan offerings are amazing and they use locally sourced food where possible. The service can be a little slow and a little wrong sometimes but they eventually get it right and it is worth it. If you are the type to expect every little thing to be brought to you, this is not the place for you. You will have to get your own salt, etc. -- it is part of the charm (and helps you work off the calories for all of the crepe goodness you are about to eat).
