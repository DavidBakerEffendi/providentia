To quote the legendary ad - "I can't believe I ate the whole thing." Following Nadia Z's glowing review, my newly-designated fiancée and I (we got engaged NYE, forgive me if I mention her a little too often this time) came in here for brunch. We were particular about our selection - it needed mimosas, and it needed smoked salmon benedict. Anella absolutely delivered! First of all, the place is absolutely charming. The decor is run-down-on-purpose, giving it a cozy, relaxed feeling. Everyone we encountered was very polite, no complaints there! Their brunch menu is a perfect size - enough options to stay interesting for a few more trips, but not so large as to be dizzying. For my part, I tried the blueberry brioche french toast, and the fiancée had the smoked salmon benedict - we also ordered the mysterious pastry basket, which came first. The contents apparently rotate by the day, but the warm donut holes are not to be missed! That said, it's definitely to be split, because the basket + an entree would probably make any single diner explode. The portions are generous. Which is a gentle way of saying that they're ridiculously large, but my french toast was so tasty it was well worth the ensuing stomachache I got from stuffing my face. It's a very sweet french toast, so it suits me fine, but might not be to everyone's taste. Make sure to spread the cream around - it's absolutely vital to the dish! The candied pecans were also a nice touch, even though I'm not really a pecan man. The smoked salmon benedict got two thumbs up, and my girl knows her brunch salmons. She said it was fresh and tasty, though far too much to finish - I helped her on the home fries that came with it, which were also very good. Mind, you get what you pay for. While not exorbitant, it's easy to order more than you can manage, and you may end up with a check to match. Expect large portions though, and you'll do just fine.
