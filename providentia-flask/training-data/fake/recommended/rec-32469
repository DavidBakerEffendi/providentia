Years back this was my go to place, Great food, great service and a busy and fun place - even at lunch. So I was very disappointed when I had a chance to go back and have lunch. Not that it was bad - it was just average. The sole was done well and the service was attentive. the bread was standard fare but we were pleased the staff was happy to offer salad/double vegetable for the meals. I plan to go back as there was me interesting items on the menu to try - but its a bit out of my may and well max and Trumbull Kitchen really pop when you visit - Peppercorns needs to make me want to come back.
