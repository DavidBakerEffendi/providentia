4.5 stars for sure. The owner and staff are very friendly and even offered if we didn't like the pizza we don't pay. Spinach chicken pizza, vodka sauce pizza, and Philly cheesesteak pizza were deeelicious! Â  Price was incredibly awesome. The only reason for 4.5 instead of 5 is because the pepperoni, most standard pizza, was not delicious. Overall loved this spot!
