I am not a big fan of tofu. Tofu isn't something I enjoy because its so bland. However, the tofu bowls here are a highly recommended item for me. Its a bowl of spicy soup with tofu and whatever meat you order, beef, pork, or seafood. They provide a lot of side dish as most Korean cuisines do. I really do enjoy eating here because it tastes so good. If you are a big fan of spicy food, you really should come try this! Their seafood pancake is really yummy too! This is one of those places I won't mind coming here everyday.
