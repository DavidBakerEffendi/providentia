Barbuto just has that feel to it.  The space is a converted garage, its paneled doors now replaced with windows to let the ambient nightlife stream in.  The space is quite small and cozy, a little on the loud side and I would always expect with conversation, laughter and the bustle of a good crowd.  It's cool, casual and I'd love to return on a warm summer evening to sit outside.  Another fine dining find placed in a chill scene. I've been here once, they state the menu changes daily (propio come Chez Panisse?) and the food is awesome.  Their portions are decent sized, appetizers and sides a must to share.  For a party of five on a Saturday evening, three appetizers two sides entrees and one shared dessert are more than enough.  The constant is great flavor.  There's an awesome olive oil flavor throughout, the proteins are cooked to perfection, the JW chicken is really good, with some nice touch surprises like garbanzos with the calamari and cooked hazelnuts amongst the brussel sprouts.   They have a really good value list of old and new world wines, a bar that serves up some signature cocktails and I believe beers on tap.  Service is efficient given the activity and helpful around the menu. Grazie per i ricordi
