This was a random find but a great one. My girlfriend and I decided to meet at the Union Sq stop and get dinner close by. After yelping this place look interesting. We were both very happy with our choice of coming here once we left. We got there and there was a happy hour going on so we decided to sit at the bar. The bar was spacious not crammed at all. We ordered cocktails my girlfriend got a special one which was good and I ask the bartender if he could make something with gin and cucumbers, he did a spot on job of making it refreshing and not to sweet. We ordered some oysters which were fantastic (on the happy hour menu) potato churros, heirloom salad, and the mussels. We spit everything and we were happy we did. Everything was delicious and came out in rounds, not everything at once. I would recommend this spot and will be returning.
