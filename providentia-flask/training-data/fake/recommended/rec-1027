Great beer selection of course. It doesn't get any better than the beer bible that they present to you. Its like Disney World for the beer lover. Food.....its good. I mean.....its great. But......isnt Â there anything else from Belgium that can be represented other than the one or two authentic Belgian items? I mean, the other Belgian place in Philly (Monk's) is the same way, so I dont have much to compare it to. I've never been to Belgium so its not really my realm. The food is great, and theres a beer style for everyone, with literally hundreds of haunting flavors throughout that brew menu for you to explore. But Im seriously looking for the Anthony Bourdain experience here. Weird me out, PLEASE! I want something new and different, instead of seeing mussels and burgers as the poplular fare.
