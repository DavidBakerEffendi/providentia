Fantastic, simple italian food. I got the gnocchi in red sauce and they were the perfect texture and density. We got to Malatesta early (around 4:45), so there was no wait, but when we walked by later that night, it was packed. So.. get there early if you don't want to wait. Most of the tables are VERY close together. Not a bad thing, just a heads up if you're trying to go there and have deep, personal conversations. Others will definitely overhear you ; )
