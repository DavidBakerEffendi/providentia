Adorable neighborhood gem in a quiet part of west village. The restaurant literally seats about 25 people or so and has an open kitchen which makes you feel like you're eating in someone's home. Absolutely get the meatball sliders, which are served warm from the oven and the bun comes with a hint of cheese, which adds the extra flavor to the sliders. We also ordered the roasted halibut to share which was perfectly cooked on top of a bed of mashed potatoes with chives - scrumptious! Reservations are hard to make given the small space and popularity of the restaurant, so I would recommend coming later on a weeknight.
