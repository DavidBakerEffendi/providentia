Since I've never been to the one in Los Angeles, there's no way I can compare this place to its counterparts. What I can say is, with the extremely long wait time, to get seated and for the food to actually come, I was quite disappointed. The truffle fries which my party and I were so excited about were a bit soggy and a bit too salty. For the price of those fries, I was expecting higher quality and larger portions. The burger was pretty good though. It didn't blow my mind or anything, it was just "pretty good." In my opinion, for the price and time you're spending here, there might be other joints in the city that might hit the spot much better than this place.
