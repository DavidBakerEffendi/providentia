Ok, what the hell, Room Service. The decor is abysmal. I feel like I'm at a dated Meatpacking club and the fist pumping B&T crowd is about to start pouring in. Our waitress was wearing a sequined mini dress and a sparkly fascinator, which didn't help much. Also, the huge mirror in the bathroom so I can watch the look on my face as I pee? Nice touch. But the food? The food is awesome. I tried the thai herb mussels, galangal coconut milk soup, green curry and the Room Service pad thai. Everything was delicious - the mussels were particularly memorable. Blinding sequins aside, our waitress was lovely and service was pretty fast. But please redecorate, for the love of all that is holy.
