This is a great restaurant for reliably good pasta and other Italian dishes.  I find it difficult to find a good bowl of pasta in this city, so when I'm in the mood I generally head to Malatesta.  While I've had several good bottles of wine at this restaurant, I've also had a couple that have been a little disappointing, so choose carefully.  Also, they do not take credit cards.  Plan ahead, because an ATM is a little hard to come by all the way west by the river.  Another thing I have to say about this spot: the waiters tend to be very cute Italian boys.  It's an added bonus.
