One of my favorite after work happy hour spots!!! I lust for this place.. The ilili wings are to die for!! The cocktail selection makes my taste buds go crazy. Not to mention the coconut sorbet is tantilizing!!! I could go on for days about it... And the prices are GREAT I would recommend visiting ilili, eveyone that I have taken here or told to visit here also loves it...
