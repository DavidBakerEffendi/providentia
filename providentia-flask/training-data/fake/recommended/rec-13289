I enjoy burgers, so I knew I wanted to eat at Umami Burger even before it opened. I heard that the wait times were horrendous so I avoided it for a while until I finally decided to give it a try with a friend. We went pretty early on a Friday evening and ended up waiting ~30-40 minutes, which wasn't too bad. There was some miscommunication so we couldn't sit at a table at first though but then we were offered a high table by the bar, which we didn't mind. We shared the fried pickles and also "manly" fries, and we both got the umami original burger, mine was medium rare. The pickles were good, and I thought the fries were tasty with all three different sauces. The center of my burger was slightly more raw than I would've liked, but it was still OK. I think the most prominent taste was the onion, and so I couldn't taste as well the meat, shiitake, or the cheese. Overall it was good and juicy. I would not wait more than 30-40 minutes for it though, and I may come eat here again if the hype dies down a bit.
