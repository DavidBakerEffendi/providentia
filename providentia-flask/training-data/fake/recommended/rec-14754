Whenever I visit home, Portugalia is the restaurant my family goes to for our meal out. The food is authentically Portuguese and delicious. If you dine at the bar or restaurant while there's a soccer game, you'll even get a side of Portuguese guys yelling at the TV. I love the Mini Prego: a thin slice of beef on a mini bun. With such soft bread, and juicy, tender meat, it's my go-to appetizer. You can't go wrong with the daily specials. If you're coming with a bunch of people, you can order a bunch of entrees and share. There will likely still be leftovers because their portions are MASSIVE. Dessert leaves something to be desired. They prepare everything in the morning and then keep it all refrigerated. It's not bad, but it won't blow you away. I'd skip dessert here and just grab a Pastel de Nata at Teixeira's around the corner.
