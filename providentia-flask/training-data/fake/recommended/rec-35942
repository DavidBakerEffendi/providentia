Come right when they open if you don't want to wait. On that basis, everything done at this ippudo was done right. Waiters and waitresses are attentive, knowledgable, and happy. The broth is flavorful, noodles are chewy and fresh, and ambience was nice yet casual. The brooklyn ale* is delicious too. *happy hour only applies to those drinking at the bar area.
