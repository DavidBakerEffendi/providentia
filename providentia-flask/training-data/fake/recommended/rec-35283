ok, the pizza is really really good. thin crust. bubbling cheese right out of the oven. simple but delicious. 5 stars for the pizza. but the wait is just plain ridiculous. it's just 1 guy making the pie. everyone's crowded around the counter hoping he looks your way and takes your order and then everyone watches him slowly work the dough, put the toppings on - i feel like everything is in slow motion. i literally waited 1.5 hours to get my pie - painful! next time, i will get a slice to go - i didn't realize you could do that until i saw someone literally someone get a slice, pay and leave.
