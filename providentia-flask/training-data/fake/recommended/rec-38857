After a night of drinking, I was in that state of not quite drunk,  but craving latenight food before heading home.  I polled my drinking buddies and the consensus was Amir's or Kountry Kart, depending on what I wanted.  I figured gyro was a little healthier than a cheese steak, so I went with Amir's.  My decision was the right one. Amir's is not fancy or gourmet, but it is delicious.  I had the lamb, which was warm and well spiced.  The pita wasn't too thick.  The veggies were crisp and fresh.  The tzatziki sauce was delicious, but it was a bit thin: much of it pours to the bottom of the wrapped gyro, making you wish you had a side of it to dip the sandwich in.  Nevertheless, by the time I reached the top of Church, it was all in my belly.  I have to be careful not to make this a weekly thing... while delicious, latenight food is not good for the waist.
