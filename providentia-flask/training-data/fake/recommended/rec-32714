Using Miracle Whip (or similar) in your spicy "mayo" is a sin that I cannot forgive. That alone is reason enough in my book to never come back! I really wanted to like this place because of its convenient location, but I was disappointed in the quality of the sushi overall. The rolls had too much rice and were overpriced. You can get the same mediocre quality at any other place in town for less. Rent is clearly much higher at this central location so the menu is priced accordingly. I was so hoping West Hartford had at least ONE high quality sushi restaurant... so far, they're all mediocre at best and this place is no exception. I might give it one more try out of desperate hope.
