Went to Little Owl with a friend who lives in the Village and wanted to try it after hearing all the praise about this place. Got there around 8pm on a Thrusday night (we called ahead and they told us they couldn't take a reservation). When we got there this guy greeted us outside and told us there could be "a wait". He didn't say how long the wait was going to be or even take our names before he went back inside and closed the door. This place is TINY so you have to wait in the street. The wait was like 15 minutes and we were seating close to the window. Service was ok, I liked that they let you try the wine before you order it (even if you are only ordering a glass). When my friend and I looked at the menu nothing popped out. We ended ordering various appetizer and sharing them. We had the sliders (which are good but nothing to die for as some people here say), duck salad (ok), lobster soup (very tasty). Portions are on the small side too! Overall, it was ok, but I had better ones.
