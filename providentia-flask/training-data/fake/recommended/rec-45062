The Irish chic that i may have mentioned on a few dinner excursions, took me to this little corner. I have to say each dish had great Taste, from the appetizers, entrees to dessert just plain old delish. it is a small but bountiful menu selections with great service to go along that makes this a nice spot for dining. There is not much room to move around, and one of the smallest restrooms you will squeeze into, Being a large man this is important. Make reservations it fills up quick. Big Joe
