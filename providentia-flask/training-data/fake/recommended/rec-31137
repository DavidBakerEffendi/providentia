Tops is my favorite dinner in Jersey. Every time my husband and I go there, we remember how good it is every time. The only side is that this place is good that this place is always packed. Be prepared to wait. You might get lucky if your a party of 2 like my husband and I but besides that, Â you will wait but it'll be worth it.
