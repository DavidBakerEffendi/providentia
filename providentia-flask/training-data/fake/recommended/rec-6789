This was such a disappointment but I could have guessed from the menu, which I checked out online before meeting friends there. The decor is roadside diner. In fact, we even thought we were in the wrong place when we first entered. The service was perfectly pleasant and attentive. Wine was sent back because it was bad and that was handled gracefully. However, the menu was thoroughly underwhelming to all four of us. We reluctantly selected four apps, and honestly not one stood out as delicious or memorable in any way. Fried polenta balls - eh; salumi - double eh; tuna crudo was a mess. Probably the Â french fries in beef fat were the best option. We actually chose to leave and went next door to Stephen Starr's Route 6 where we had a perfectly acceptable dinner. Will not be returning and will not be recommending.
