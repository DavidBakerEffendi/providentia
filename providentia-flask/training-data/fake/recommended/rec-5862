Really neat atmosphere and really great food. Very unique dishes, such as Lobster Mac & Cheese, and Cheesesteak Egg roll (both of which are fantastic) I was also impressed with the Quesadilla's which were not your usual Quesadillas but had a sauce that is very unique and delicious. They have lots of choices for drinks and a friendly staff. Â It is a little pricey but it's worth in my opinion as the food is delicious!
