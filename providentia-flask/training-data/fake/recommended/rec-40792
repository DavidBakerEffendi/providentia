I honestly love this place, the delivery is fast, food is always hot, and the boneless spare rib combination plate is hands down the best. The sauce they use is amazing. They also have great fried dumplings. From the times I've ordered from here in Fair Haven, there has never been any disappointment on my end, and the prices are fair!
