wow! This restaurant is such a jewel. I can not believe that I was able to find a top notch French restaurant right in my old hometown of Bloomfield  The chef was amazing he was so warm and friendly and came to our table and described all his dishes. It is well worth ordering the chocolate soufflé for your dessert when you order. It is so delicious. The appetizer salad with calamari is divine. I would highly recommend this restaurant to any foodie. I just loved it can't wait to go back
