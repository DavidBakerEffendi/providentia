Having grown up eating the cuisine, I've always set a pretty high standard for Filipino restaurants. Jeepney, as Maharlika's edgier sibling, hands down surpasses that threshold. Though it seems more experimental than Maharlika, Jeepney also does a very good job retaining authentic Filipino flavors even if it tries to rebel from standard preparations. And just like in its older sibling, you get a friendly, knowledgeable staff, and delicious drinks.
