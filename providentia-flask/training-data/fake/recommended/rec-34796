Uber tasty, quick, and cheap! Kati Roll offers Indian classics like aloo masala, paneer, channa masala, etc rolled up in bread. The great news is they cost only a few dollars individually - you can double up and get two of the same. Unfortunately, no mixing/matching on that particular special. Counter service - a perfect meal to grab on the go & venture to Bryant Park on a nice day. Had the aloo masala on my first visit - slightly spicy & after devouring two I was ready to take on my afternoon. Will definitely be back!
