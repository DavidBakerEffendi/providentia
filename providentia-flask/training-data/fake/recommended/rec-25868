Meandering past bars and what seemed like dozens of Thai restaurants as Ozzy belts out the lyrics from Volume 4.  Wait around for the party, the hosts who make a tardy entrance. We sit and I order a caipiroska.  Never had one and was eager to try it.  We chat, and pass the time with small talk and I find myself dreaming about booze.  The drinks finally arrive, we order, and as my stomach grumbles, no one comes by to see if we need to freshen our drinks.  When the food finally arrives, I'm so hungry I wish I had ordered two.  I had ordered an appetizer but had to find the waitress.  They brought it to me: a chicken empanada that lacked flavor.  Good thing my sandwich was amazing, though not good enough to warrant waiting an absurd amount of time.
