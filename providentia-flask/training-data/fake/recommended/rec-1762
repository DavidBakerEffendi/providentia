DiNic's was featured on Man vs. Food. DiNic's is famous for their Roast Pork Sandwich, which many locals say is a better sandwich than the signature Philadelphia sandwich, the cheesesteak. DiNic's is located in the Reading Terminal Market, which is an experience of its own. The sandwich was very good, but I have to say that I still prefer the classic Philadelphia cheesesteak. The Roast Pork Sandwich is a simple sandwich, consisting of roasted pork, sharp provolone cheese, and greens. Living on the West Coast, I always love indulging in an East coast sandwich, as the bread usually tastes so much better. The bread at DiNics was no exception, very fresh and tasty. The heart of the sandwich is of course the roast pork. The pork was warm, tender, and packed with flavor. There are a lot of cheese options that could have been used, however I think the sharp provolone was the perfect choice, as it really went well with the taste of the pork. The Roast Pork sandwich is definitely an above average sandwich but not quite worthy enough of a five star rating.
