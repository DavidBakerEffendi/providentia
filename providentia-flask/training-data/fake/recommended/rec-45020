The spicy drunken noodles with shrimp, bok choy, Chinese broccoli, egg, and chilies is hands down the best drunken noodle dish I've ever had.  The shrimp were succulent, and the dish had the perfect level of spice.  Otherwise, the other dishes I tried were a bit hit or miss.  The pork belly buns were fine but not memorable, the pan-fried pork dumplings were on the greasy side, the fried rice with Chinese sausage was quite sweet, but the glazed spareribs were tasty.
