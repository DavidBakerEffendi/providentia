Everything was excellent! This is my second time eating here. Normally I like to try different restaurants when I visit NYC, but this is one of my favorites. The atmosphere is cozy but upbeat. For a Tuesday night, this place was crowded. The waiter was very knowledgeable on the wine list and made a great recommendation. The cheeses were great and they had some great special selections of tapas which were very unique but delicious.
