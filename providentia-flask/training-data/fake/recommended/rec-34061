An inventive, delicious, but above all FUN place to eat. The chefs' charisma alone is reason enough to make the trip out to Bed-Stuy, but once you get here, you'll be charmed by the quality of their cooking, too. While not every dish was a home run, a few were grand slams - and every one had character aplenty. My favorite was the Nippon-nachos, an experimental riff on chef/co-owner George's theory that every food is either a nacho or a sandwich - either "shit piled on top of each other" or "shit in between two things." The Nippon nachos challenged my sandwich/nacho duality in an entirely satisfying way. The E666's (deviled eggs, natch) were delicious, with just the right amount of bacon. I also really enjoyed the shishito peppers with salts, especially the hickory salt. The duck breast was fantastic, the lamb breast not quite as outstanding - but still good. The foie gras doughnut, highly touted by food bloggers, did not disappoint - but honestly, with that premise, how could it? The fish and chips, billed as "A Fish and Some Chips" - i.e., a whole fish on top of French fries - was the only real disappointment, after the novelty of the pun wore off. Re: booze - stop off at Rand Liquor Store at Clifton and Bedford for a bottle of your favorite whiskey beforehand. Until they're able to secure a liquor license, Do or Dine is BYOB, but very happy to provide mixers, shakers, strainers, and all other good-time paraphernalia. For a truly memorable evening, try offering some of your libation to the kitchen.
