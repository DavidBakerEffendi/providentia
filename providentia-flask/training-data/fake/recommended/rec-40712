Great, friendly service, nice atmosphere, and OK food. Just went here last night and had ordered a hamburger - worst I ever had. Burnt to a crisp, dry and flavorless. Even the bun was burnt, I didn't feel like sending it back but in hindsight I should've. My husband had the mac and cheese, chicken pot pie, and chocolate cake. No issues with his meal but I would not go back here for dinner, there are much better places to go than this.
