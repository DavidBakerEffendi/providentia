Went there on the Fourth of July, and the waitress made us feel like we were nothing but an annoyance (we were not even drinking, and were courteous). It's not my fault you have to work on the Fourth of July. She unenthusiastically brought us our mac and cheese, which I believe came from a box. Food is mediocre.
