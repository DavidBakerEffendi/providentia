We stumbled upon this place during our wondering around NYC.  When you're a tourist and a foodie, you want good food, reasonable since it's lunch and we're dropping $ on dinner and local, nothing I hate more than being surrounded by tourists, yes I can see the hypocrisy here. So here we were in the later afternoon, enjoying the quiet and air conditioning, being from SF we don't get much heat or humidity.  The service was great and friendly, our waitress took the time to explain the dishes we were interested in with great detail.   The food was great, we had the salad nicoise and I had the sandwich, both super fresh, great flavor and combinations of ingredients and balance of flavors.  We had the picked plate to start with which was a great way to get our appetite going.   It looked like they had some great wines on the menu and beers as well, I had a Stella to cool off.   My impression, this is a great neighborhood place, simple food that's healthy and tasty, great atmosphere for food or drinks and a great staff that enjoys what they do and where they do it.
