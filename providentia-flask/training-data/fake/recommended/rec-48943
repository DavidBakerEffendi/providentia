Thoroughly enjoyed my experience this past weekend at Bar San Miguel. I was itching to try it out since I heard it opened recently. I am a big Mexican food lover, and I was very happy with the food and service. Our server molly was very patient and friendly. Lord knows I always have a million questions about a new menu and she answered them all with a smile. Â My one and only idea of something to fix would be the cocktail menu. I found it very limited. I would've enjoyed a fruity tequila based drink, but all I could find were overly tart margarita fusions. Other than that, I left very happy :)
