This is one of my favorite go-to restaurants in the city.  It's very cozy and great for an impromtu dinner.  It's a fairly small restaurant so there's sometimes a wait for a table but I usually come with one other person so it's easy to snag 2 chairs and eat at the bar.  The most recent time I went the hostess said a wait for a table was 30 minutes but we were seated within 10.   The food is perfect if you're looking for comfort food.  Their fried chicken is very good as are most of their side dishes.  I've heard good things about the preztel starter but have yet to try it.
