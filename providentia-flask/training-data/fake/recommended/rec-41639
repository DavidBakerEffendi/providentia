Went there yesterday, wasn't the first time, but the experience was enough to get me to write a review. Ordered a Falafel and Hummus Sandwich....a bit of miscommunication had me getting just a humus sandwich.......but the situation was quickly righted and i got some of the best falafel i've ever eaten brought to me.   These guys have some really tasty food...........definitely try the french fries.  Gotta try the french fries.
