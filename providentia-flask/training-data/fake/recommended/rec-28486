My favorite food truck in NYC, hands down! Words cannot express how much I love this place. The veggie couscous with the spicy mint & white sauces -- sooo freakin' tasty! Veggies are never overcooked and the couscous is perfectly done. And the portion you get is big enough for leftovers! Get the Moroccan mint iced with your lunch, too. Delicious.
