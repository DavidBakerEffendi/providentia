This was my second breakfast experience here in Philly, and certainly nothing short of amazing.  It's a chic breakfast nook with friendly service, and not to mention (hands down) the best French toast I've ever had.  Ever.  Even though it's early in my explorations, I could tell that this place is a local gem.  My only complaint (which I'm not really complaining about) is the price.  It is costly, but the quality of the dish deserves the tag.  So to me, this is a fantastic place every now and then to stop by and experience a creative, culinary-powerhouse of a breakfast.
