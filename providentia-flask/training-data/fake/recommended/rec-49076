Stumbled on this place when looking for some Indian food during a recent trip to NYC.  Three of us had samosas, quail vindaloo, deg gohst [slow cooked lamb], and chicken tikka masala, and garlic naan.  Vindaloo was very spicy as expected, but not uncomfortably so.  The lamb was my personal favorite-- great combination of spices melded perfectly with the lamb.  Service was very good, and setting was quite nice.  Highly recommended.
