Hey, its a great sandwich. But best in America? Im not so sure about that one (From watching the episode, i'd say the host shoulda taken another bite of the lemon lobster roll). Anyway, as someone said, its not something I'd go out of my way to get, but the roast pork is tender and tasty. The pairing of sharp prov w rabe is unique and maybe thats why it won... The line is long, but moves quickly. I think 10 is a little high for this sandwich, but its good
