Honestly, I only eat here when visitors come, or when it's 3 am and I'm in midtown. It's basically like the Denny's of New York City.  It's solid, cheap, heavy, and it's available. But really, when you think about it, it's not that great.  It's just chicken and rice!  That's it!  Pita bread, some mysterious white sauce and a hot sauce that's got some mad kick. But it's 6 bucks!  You can't get that quantity of food for 6 bucks ANYWHERE in New York!
