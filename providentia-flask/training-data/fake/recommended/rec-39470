For all the ramen freaks, Totto is definitely worth a visit. Just keep in mind that during the evenings, you have to wait longer for Totto than you would have to wait to get into Cielo or Marquee. Many compare Totto with Ippudo and try desperately to pick the dominant joint, but they fail to recognize that the broth/ taste are entirely different and should not be categorized to be contenders. Totto only uses a chicken broth, which is straying away from the traditional thick pork broth. However, it has very clean,, light and hearty taste that blows your taste buds. Must try the Miso and Spicy Ramen. Conclusion: Totto is the best by far at making great tasting Ramen using chicken broth. Ippudo is great at making Ramen using Pork Broth. Note: There is a second location on 51st ST, but opens during certain hours of the day.
