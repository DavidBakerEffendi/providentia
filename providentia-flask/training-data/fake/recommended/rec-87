Great spot with a bunch of TVS , always a good showing for hockey games too. They have one Giant projection screen too for what ever the big game of the night is too. Drinks are well made, the food is really good and the atmosphere is nice. It can get a little crowded but when It's not its a great place to hang out and watch a few games at, actually even when it is is still a great place to hang out and watch some games at , it can get a bit rowdy and lively but you tend to want that at a sports bar. Also the staff here is really knowledgeable about their drinks , on top of their game at the bar and really friendly , Staff can be the make or break point for a bar and this place has some real makers alright!
