As a long time West Village resident, I was thrilled to see a new restaurant in the space formerly occupied by Valdino West.  Four of us went for dinner last Friday and really enjoyed the whole experience.  The food is a mix of South European and North African with dishes ranging from Steak Frites to Chicken Tagine to a delicious lamb entree that my wife ordered.  For appetizers we ordered grilled octopus and baked shrimp.  Entrees ranged from $17-22 and appetizers were generally under $10.  The wine list was reasonable and we split a very good bottle for around $30.  Full bar and dessert as well.  Charming location, low lit and appealing.  Also of note is that I'm gluten free and they easily and graciously accommodated us.  Meme is off to a great start and was pretty full on a Friday night which is a great sign for a new restaurant in this economy.  We'll be back for sure.
