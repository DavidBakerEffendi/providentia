what a find it REALLY is. From the very first to my most recent, the brunch served up here has always been consistently good - great food, great portions, and great prices.  (LOVE their omelette's!) Service is very friendly and, best of all, they never, ever rush you out.  It's one of my favorite brunch spots on warm days when I can enjoy my meal outdoors and read the morning paper or just people watch for as long as I want. I've done dinner here a couple of times.  Can't really remember what I had, but I DO remember that I thoroughly enjoyed whatever I ordered. I'd like to go back for an outdoor lunch when spring finally comes around...
