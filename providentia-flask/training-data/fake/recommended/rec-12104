Went here Thursday night after reading these amazing reviews and have to say it was well worth it. Baked Ricotta and beef raviolis were amazing!! Desert was exquisite too. But I think what made it an overall great experience was the service. Not sure why a few yelpers are complaining about the prices, granted I'm from NYC but I thought the prices were reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber. Highly recommend.
