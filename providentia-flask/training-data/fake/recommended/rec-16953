Food was AMAZING! And they play really great Spanish music. But the drink I had didn't have much flavor (lemonade sangria). But on a good note, you can bring your own bottle of liquor or wine. Very friendly waiters, but they don't pass by your table to ask you how everything is unless they have to attend the table next to you as well.
