I've passed by this restaurant a number of times, and finally was able to visit for lunch. It might not look it from the outside, but the rooms are beautiful on the inside. Food was good, I enjoyed the penne with broccoli rabe and sausage I had as my lunch entree. Service was attentive, and the prices were reasonable. Would certainly come back soon.
