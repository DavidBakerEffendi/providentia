Delicious! Such a cute chill spot and the waiter was nothing but nice to us. His recommendations were on point!!! The stuffed French toast is TO DIE FOR!! (well... Eat more than one and you'll die of a heart attack! Hahah) Definitely recommend it. They are also per friendly and will bring out water to your puppy if need be. By the way, Harrison is one of their waiters... HIGHLY recommend him! Such a nice dude and knows the menu so well!!! :)
