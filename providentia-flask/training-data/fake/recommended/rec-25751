Lao Sze Chuan, your food is good.  Fantastic lunch specials, no doubt. But you may have brought your customer service from the old world. My wife went to Lao recently and ordered Beef and Broccoli, a staple favorite of hers.  She never gets anything else, I'm surprised she hasn't asked the Thai food to make a different meal. So the meal comes out, and the waiter dishes her Chicken and broccoli.  "uh, I ordered beef" "no you didnt" "what? no I ordered beef" He walks away, talks to someone, mad comes back and says "I wrote it here it is chicken" "huh, what? I don't know what you wrote down.  .but I want Beef not chicken." The guy seemed really pissed off, angry. . .finally he took the food. The rest of the meal he wouldn't serve my wife, another person took over.   Yeah that isn't acceptable dudes.
