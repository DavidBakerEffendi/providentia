Ok, so...I really don't get what all the fuss is over Pepe's. The first time I went, I waited in the blistering cold for over 1 hour and HOLY CRAP, it was shockingly disappointing. And by disappointing, I don't mean, "Oh...considering all the hype I don't know what the big deal is." What I mean is, "you've GOT to be kidding me. this pizza is TERRIBLE." I had their white clam pizza. the clam was plentiful, which I appreciate but it was HORRRRIFICALLY SALTY. Yes, I love thin crust pizzas, but not an entire charcoal attached to the bottom of my pizza. We had some other not that impressive red pizza that was more palatable, but still unimpressive. OH, and SERVICE SUCKED. They let all of their mysterious regulars or friends cut in front of you and I was somehow the second party in line for over 30 minutes. how is that even possible at a pizza joint? Even once we were seated, it took forever for us to see our server, and our server? You'd think we were homeless people he was forced to give community service to. ANYWHO"S I had a terrible first experience and vowed never to go back but I was dragged there a second time for a bday and....second time was just as unimpressive, though minus the horrible cutting in line and our server was much kinder. I say go to BAR. SOOO much better.
