The battle of Philadelphia is Pat's or Geno's for the best cheese steak in town.  My side of the battle is Pat's hands down. There is ALWAYS a line, but standing in line at Pat's is half the fun.  There is good Philly banter just waiting in line.  Then when you make it up to the window you best have your order in mind and say it fast.  This is fast food and you don't want to get a scolding for holding up the line. I have mine with wiz and everything.   Then you grab your steak and go to the next window for fries and a drink and then pay. Now comes the hard part - finding a place to sit!  There seldom is an empty table and people dive for the ones that do come open.  This is Philly and  you take what is yours - don't be shy! It's all sort of a cheese steak factory.  But honestly I don't know why - it's the best cheese steak you will ever eat.  The bread is soft the cheese gooey and the steak hot and perfectly cooked.  Every bite is a little bit of heaven. I have tired Geno's, but I am a Pat's guy.  After all Pat's is the KING of steaks!
