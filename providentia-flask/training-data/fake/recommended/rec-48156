Okay, as noted by my previous reviews I can be pretty picky when it comes to a meal.  Giving five stars is something worth waiting for and I'd even give a sixth for extra credit, if possible, to Chili Willie's.  Needless to say, this is a GREAT Mexican restaurant.  But aren't all small, family owned Latino restaurants usually great?  Their chips are fresh and crispy (and they even have green ones!) and their salsa has just the right bite to it.  Service is amazing and homey and the food delicious.  My boyfriend had the BBQ enchilada and I had a Mexican combo with a corn tamale that was 'to die for.'  The portions really are large and you will be taking food home with you for a second meal.  The prices are reasonable and their virgin margaritas (BYOB) really are worth tasting.  If you're anywhere near the area, I'd try Chili Willie's in a heartbeat.  It's a shame we can't get this anywhere in Manhattan!
