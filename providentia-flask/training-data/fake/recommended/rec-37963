I've been ordering food from here for several months now and I absolutely love it.  My 2 favorite menu items are the Drunken Noodles and the Basil Fried Rice, either from the lunch menu or the regular menu and both done hot of course.  I have an extremely high threshold for heat and they can cater to anyone's liking from level 1-10.  The flavors are great and I enjoy it every time.  Kudos to Clifton Thai!
