Popped in for a late lunch/earl dinner and decided to try the 'Smoker' and the 'My Thai'.  First, presentation.  Walked up to the counter and was met by a friendly lady.  She took my order, made a suggestion and took my cash with no problems at all.  The store was empty, but it has a nice feel to it.  It's not a first date kind of place, but definitely a  third date.  The dogs were made quickly, although I was a little squicked out by the counter nibbling out of a large stainless bowl.  No idea, it could just be her lunch. The dogs were placed in a to-go box and I was on my way.  The first note on carryout service is there was no bag provided.  While it didn't cause me any sort of problem, if you are carrying any package at all, it could get awkward.  They may have bags available, but it wasn't offered and I didn't ask. On arrival to my office, I popped the box down and opened it up.  Two tasty looking morsels stared up at me.  I tore into The Smoker first, as the lady at the counter said that it was the spicy one.  While it did have some heat, at no point was I wishing for water or bread.  Darned good flavor.  If I had one complaint, it would be the bun was not warm, so it was a little stiff.  Other than that, tasted great, was gone quickly.  Make sure you grab an extra napkin.  The toppings do tend to slide. The My Thai was next.  Same complaint about the bun, but the overall flavor was terrific.  I would have never thought of putting peanut sauce on a dog, but it really worked. Overall, I'm happy.
