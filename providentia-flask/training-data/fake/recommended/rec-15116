We were close to Sony's so decided to stop for a Philly Cheesesteak. It's the first cheesesteak I've had in Philly so I cant Â compare it with other of the famous joints but this is definitely a great sandwich! The bread is crispy on the outside and soft in the inside, the meat is sliced ribeye and its perfectly seasoned. We had the "classic" which comes with cheese wiz and onions. But there are options to add different cheeses and toppings to your cheesesteak. The original however was pure deliciousness and the portion is more than enough. If you are in the old city I definitely would recommend Sonys for a casual lunch or hangover bite as they are open until 3am!
