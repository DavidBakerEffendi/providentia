These folks do so much really well. The atmosphere and service is highly impressive. The menu is smart, yet down to earth. The food is good. Gumbo was delicious and presented very nicely. The f-que wings are perfectly smothered with a sweet chili sauce and served with tzatziki, which works incredibly well. Ok, so the pork chops were a bit overcooked for me, but they came with a heap of sweet potato mash, which made up for it. The chicken and red velvet waffle dish was good. It looks really amazing actually; the color contrast makes it pop visually. I think the waffle can be improved. It wasnt bad at all, it was just a bit generic; almost as if they used a boxed red velvet cake mix and poured it into a waffle iron. I doubt thats what theyre doing, but they can definitely make it pop more flavor-wise. Finally, the watermelon margarita was so good that I, the manly man that I am, did not mind being seen sipping on a lovely pink drink. It's a little on the sweet side, but has a good kick.
