I had brunch here with a friend a couple weeks ago and had no trouble getting a table right away.  We really liked the atmosphere - super cute homey decorations, beautiful old windows, and if you sit in the back it's fun watching the action taking place in the open (tiny) kitchen.  Overall the meal was good ...  quiche was light and flavorful and the brussell sprouts were delish with a touch of sriracha.  I also got a kick out of the mini-beer chaser that came with my bloody mary.  Yes please!  On the other hand we had the hash browns which were oily and flavorless, and the lardons in the frisee salad were more like wimpy cold pieces of bacon than the chewy warm morsels we were expecting.  Service and drinks were good, and the prices ok for the somewhat small portion sizes ... I'd come back to give it a second shot.
