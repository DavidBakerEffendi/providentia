Was here at dinnertime on a glorious Thursday night and enjoyed the outdoor seating.  It was quite crowded, but the Phillies were on so it was a nice atmosphere.  I liked the colorful outdoor mural that spiced up this gray part of town. Kite & Key is a great place to go for drink and socializing but I wouldn't go for the food alone.  The beer selection is adequate.  The staff is friendly and attentive - the food arrived quickly.  My shoestring fries were over-done and almost inedible.  The mixed green salad was just that, covered in vinegar and could have been a side portion.  Half-plum tomatoes were merely a garnish, but for the  price, disappointing.   I have been here before and the nachos are good.  The cheese plate is great, but a bit pricey for the portion.   Didn't have the wings, but they looked and smelled delicious. Overall, I would say this place is over-rated, but great for some after-work fare and happy hour.  Great place to watch sports with lots of seating to yak it up with friends.  As far as food goes,  if they can't step it up to to the nearby Sabrina's or Rose Tattoo, they should stick to pub grub and cater to the sports addicts.   Sabrina's & Rose Tattoo, walkable from there are two competitively nice places I would opt for if in the neighborhood for the food. K&K's great beer selection versus  the wannabe frou frou menu seem incongruent to the overall atmosphere.
