It's pretty good, not great. The "chicken" is pretty rubbery and frankly I've had better fake chicken from morningstar. If you're a Vegan in search of a place to get a cheesesteak, your options are fairly slim. The veggies and bread were very good. I just wanted to see something better as far as the meat goes.
