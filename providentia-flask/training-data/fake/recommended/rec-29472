Best cheesesteak in Philadelphia, hands down.  Each bite is smooth, the meat is chopped well (no thick slices here), and it just tastes that damn good.  No explanation is needed other than trying it.  It's worth the 20 minute drive, the 15 minute wait, the whatever.  Whenever people outside of the Philadelphia area ask about places to go for a great, not good, cheesesteak, I send them here. I went on a cheesesteak tour last year, and not surprisingly, this place topped most people's lists.  It's on Wendover St, which is off Henry Ave, across from that other place from Boy Meets World (Chubby's).  When Dalessandro's is open the clouds part, and the cheesesteak Gods shine a light on its infrastructure; believe me, it's that awesome. It's a small place, so seating can be a problem around lunch time.  It's also cash only, but those teensy-weensy issues won't make a difference when you're done eating greatness. Believe the hype.
