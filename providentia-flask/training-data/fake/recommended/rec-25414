I've had lunch here a couple of time and I have to say that love to order lunch from here! I usually just get the falafel on pita. It's always great! The falafel is filling, not dried out, just fried perfectly.  I also like the size of fries they give you per order, which fills an entire container and is enough to share.  I recommend this place, and can't wait to try to the rest of the menu soon.
