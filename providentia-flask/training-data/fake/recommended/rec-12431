So yummy! Ordered various dishes as this is kind of like tapas, so the dishes aren't very big so you will need a few to get full. I love their lobster salad and their yellow tail tartar. Secret, if you eat some of the lobster with the cassava chip that comes with the tartar, it is absolutely DELICIOUS! For some reason, the combo just taste perfect. The other dishes we got were pretty forgetful, like the scallop and oxtail terrine. The oxtail was a bit overcooked although cute coming in a square, and the scallop was just okay, its scallop. Overall, this place was great. Unique dishes and innovative combinations that's just worked.
