Chocolate chip bread pudding, peach pie, fresh melon, doughnuts. Sounds simple enough but ordering dessert at J.B.'s never is. The pastry chef is simply an artist. Some sort of rustic French flour wizard. Delicate presentation, just the right amount of drizzle as to not overwhelm the dessert. And always a little side pairing, like a dollop of homemade ice cream which activates and compliments your taste buds. So very thoughtful.
