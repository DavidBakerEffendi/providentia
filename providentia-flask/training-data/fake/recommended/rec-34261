One night I stopped by our tried and true Chinese restaurant for some takeout when I discovered they had either gone out of business or sold the place to Kenji Fusion. Whereas the old establishment had the typical drab interior and exterior, the new owners turned it into a modern looking bistro. The food is quite good and reasonably priced; a combination of Japanese, Chinese, and Thai. They do takeout as well. They're located in the strip where the old China Woks was.
