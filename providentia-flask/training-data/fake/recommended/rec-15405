We had dinner there last night - the first (and last) time. Our bill was $240 and we only had two appetizers and one entree. Yes, we did have couple of drinks but a place like this shouldn't charge $18/drink -it's a little too expensive! The place looks like a renovated diner. The waitress was nice but she was rushing us out. We always eat out, but we won't go back there again.
