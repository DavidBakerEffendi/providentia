Even though I live 45 minutes away this is my "go to restaurant!"  I love the  atmosphere! As soon as you sit down you are brought a dish of olive oil with fresh grated Parmesan cheese, as well as a plate of olives and Calandra's outstanding bread. Couple that with a glass of wine,Yum! The food is always outstanding be it a special, pizza or a seafood dish! We are always too full for dessert.  The staff is very professional too. Give it a try, you will leave with a fresh loaf of bread and a great feeling of satisfaction!
