I took my kids here last night.  The restaurant was clean and nice.  The service was excellent.  The portions were good with the exception of the tiny basket of chips.  I am a native Chicagoan who continues to miss really good Mexican food while living in NJ.  So i try every Mexican restaurant I can find.  Habaneros needs more flavor/spice as well as some work on the salsa.  I'm hoping this will improve.  I will try it one more time and hope for the best!   And for goodness sakes, get some larger baskets for your chips!!!  5 chips just won't do!!!
