This truck is on Park and 51st, usually only on Wednesdays until about 3:30 p.m. One of my favorite trucks, with some of the better Mediterranean food. My favorite dish from here is beef with couscous and Casablanca sauce some veggies and potatoes is very tasty. They also have dishes with fish. A platter runs for about $9, and the size is decent.
