Sonny's is one of the best cheese steak sandwiches I have ever tasted in my life.  This restaurant is recommended by the locals.  It's a must to eat here and experience the joy of putting the juicy, tender, tasty cheese steak in your mouth!  Yes... the experience was pleasurable and the service was excellent.  You need to get a great meal after a long day of absorbing all the American history you have learned and walking on Benjamin Franklin's footsteps!  Oohh yeah, next door is his home and businesses.  Go ahead! Grab a bite and visit the museum next door!  Have fun!
