We ate dinner at Ulivo for an anniversary - in such cases, it's a spoken rule that we're out for a treat, and shouldn't worry about what we're paying out. In the past, this mindset has procured some exquisite plates of food for us, but also some frightening final bills. Ulivo, a BYOB waiting just around the corner, was a different experience. We waited around a little for our server, a friendly girl named Lacey who was pretty damn busy but doing a good job of hiding it. She popped our bottle of wine and took an appetizer order for what was a tasty, crispy plate of calamari. We didn't get our entree order in until after we'd taken down half the appetizer, so we had some time to sit and get hungry again. Soon enough, I was given one of the better cuts of skirt steak I've had, with a glorious mess of chilled veggie salad on the side. This was all very delicious, but I was glad I ordered a side of fingerling potatoes as well, or else something would have been missing. My lady's ravioli special was not too heavy and extremely flavorful, and we had plenty on the table to fill us both. For good measure, she put down the bread pudding, and I the chocolate torte for dessert. All this plus espressos came to the very excellent price of about $79.50. Service was a little slow but very friendly, and therefore not an issue to us. We were out to enjoy ourselves at a leisurely pace, and did quite well, which I'd most certainly suggest you come here to do too.
