I'm torn because I really, really wanted to love Bubby's, but I left feeling meh. I do like the fact that they have some cool homemade specialty drinks. I got the homemade orange soda which was delightful. The service was up to par, but my meal was so-so. I got the Bubby's Breakfast and though the portions were great, the actual food items weren't that amazing. My eggs were scrambled, but still kind of runny which was off-putting for me and the bacon tasted and looked more like jerky. The potatoes and toast were nothing to write home about; overall I wasn't that enthused about my breakfast. The cost is always a bit steep for breakfast - we paid $60 including tip for two people. I don't think I would go back to Bubby's or recommend it to anyone as a good breakfast spot, as there are cheaper better places all over the city.
