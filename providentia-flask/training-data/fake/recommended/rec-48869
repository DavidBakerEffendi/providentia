Excellent experience all around.  Best designed Thai restaurant I've been to in NYC.  Some other gaudy ones in manhattan, but this is high quality authenticity with attention to detail.   Best Thai as well.  Have been to other very good Thai restaurants, but this will bring me back even though I live downtown and not up town. This restaurant is so well priced and good that it can compete with any trendy over priced pay for the name Asian restaurant with their food and decor. Enjoy!
