We visited Pasticceria Bruno last evening for dinner. It was, indeed, a fantastic dining experience. Our server, Adam, could not have been more pleasant! He was very familiar with the wine list, as well as the menu. We each chose a pasta special with two types of clams and crab meat. It was delicious and, of course, we had some to take home.
