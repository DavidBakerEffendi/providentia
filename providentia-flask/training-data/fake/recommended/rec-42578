They don't really need another review but I just have to weigh in on how good this place really is.  Sadly other spots have tried in  Bayonne  and have  been subpar - I don't like to take chances with raw fish.   The fish was very fresh, good presentation  and good service.  Loved everything about the place.  Had all-u-can eat as well as a la cart sushi and hibachi.  Everything was well prepared . I have gone on two separate occasions and was not disappointed at all  either time. The service was excellent and you could see the hibachi chef entertaining as he was cooking for party of 10. It look like everyone was having a wonderful time. The place is clean and welcoming.  Adding a picture of their valentine roll to this review -- adorable and delish!!
