Gotta love spontaneous Yelp finds :-) El Fuego, bless you, for the freshness of your ingredients and the lovely Mexican sodas.   I had a fascinating food adventure as it was my first time eating four tacos, each containing a different meat.  What a cool taco-making guy he was!  The adventure was also a risky one because I have not eaten a taco outside the comforts of my home (where I find tacos to be sacred) since...?  I do not regret any bite at El Fuego.  I just wish that the flavors were more like POW-POW.  No, I don't mean an elevated spicyness level (I'm a whimp anyway), but I mean perhaps, hmm, tacos whose tastes are not completely meaty?  Hmm, perhaps I also didn't have proper sides. I will come back to prove myself wrong.
