I've only been here once, but my meal was something to write home about (clearly!). The vegetable bowl with Udon noodles will most certainly be my go-to fall meal. The tofu-perfectly seasoned and breaded to perfection, veggies were fresh and not doused in teriyaki sauce, the udon noodles made it nice and filling. I'm stoked that I've found a lovely, quick meal for---wait for it, UNDER $10! Definitely a steal in this area. I'll certainly be back here. Oh, did I mention they have a groovy selection of tunes playing in the back ground.
