I went here on a weeknight to grab some dinner while I was in town for a conference. The place was packed, but the servers/bartenders were friendly and prompt. I ordered the margherita pizza, and unfortunately it really wasn't anything superb. It was really, really salty and just didn't have much flavor. The buffalo mozzarella was good, but otherwise it was just "meh," I've found it's nearly impossible to find a good wood-fired margharita pizza... so far the only places I've found that are worthy are Bertucci's (yes, I know... but they've got the formula right, even for a chain restaurant) and Pizza Paradiso in D.C. I would probably come back as the veggie dishes looked pretty tasty, but I was in a time crunch and didn't have the opportunity to try them.
