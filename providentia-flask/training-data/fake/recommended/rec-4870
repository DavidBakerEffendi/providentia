We went for dinner last night to S&H Kebab house and we loved it. We just came back from Istanbul, Turkey, and we really enjoyed our culinary experience there. Well, this place reminded us of how good Turkish food is. We started with the red lentil soup, earthy flavors with a touch of mint, this followed by a creamy and very flavorful babaganush. For main course, we tried the lamb kebab. This comes with a delicious pilaf and some vegetables. It was really good. For dessert, the baked rice pudding was the perfect ending, just like they make it in Istanbul. Personable and very attentive service.
