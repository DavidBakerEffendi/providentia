Came here for brunch around 10am on a Sunday. It ended up being a 2 1/2 hour wait but my friend and I were able to put our name in and they called us ten minutes before our table was ready. The wild Maine blueberry pancakes with warm maple butter and the sugar cured bacon really are THAT good! Remember cash only!
