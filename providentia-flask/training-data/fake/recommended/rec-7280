Their salmon dish is the greatest thing I've ever tasted. I think that the first time I had it, I underwent a religious conversion. I just checked the menu, and it's called Lachsfilet "notderney": Fresh filet of salmon topped with grilled shrimps and lemon butter over a bed of fresh tomato coulis, served with creamy spinach and mashed potatoes. It's so perfectly tender and flakey, full of flavor, and balanced with the freshness of the tomato. The spinach and mashed potatoes are great, but the salmon is the star. My friend and I had it for our shared birthday dinner. Every bite was interspersed with a happy sigh. I only wish I lived closer.
