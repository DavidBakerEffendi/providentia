Went to Locanda Verde for brunch after moving downtown and I've been looking forward to this for a while now since I'm usually too lazy to travel for food. So here's what I thought: Reservation: I called a day prior, they only had a 2 pm brunch reservation available on Sat. So I took it, but when I asked about possibly walking in earlier, I was informed by the hostess that if I was interested in an earlier walk-in, she'd much rather give my reservation to someone else who would really appreciate it. Not rude, but left a weird taste in my mouth. I also asked about a standard wait time for walk-ins on weekends, the hostess said she would not know, so 2 pm it is. Seating: Showed up right on time and we were starving, and was seated promptly by one of the three hostesses. Staff was professional if not overly friendly. Pros: food taste great, well thought out and service was fast if not super attentive. Bloody mary was amazing and so was the sheep's milk ricotta to start. The warm garlic focaccia was to die for. Cons: Entr√©e execution was borderline terrible. The poached Uovo Modenese had one poached correctly and the other cooked all the way through. Similar scenario with my Wood-fired Uova Al Forno. One side of my dish was cooked through, the middle was runny, and on the other side, the egg was pretty much raw: when I put my fork in, the egg white popped and ran all over my dish, a little unappetizing. Not sure that's how food is supposed to be served but we both ate half of our entrees, disappointing. Overall: After spending over $120 on brunch for 2, we were expecting a whoa moment. Locanda almost got us there, but not quite.
