Found Anella from the reviews on Yelp and we were blown away.  We were expecting good, we got great.  The Greenpoint cocktail is a wicked wicked beast of a drink. Potent, strong, wonderfully balanced flavors. I would go back for that alone. The Sunchoke salad was great, as was the fried artichoke salad.  The crostini were certainly good, but I was hoping for a bit more from that dish. The Pork Chop & Belly was rediculous.  If you could manage to incorporate all of the components into one bite, it was a wonderful sensation. The Mackerel was light and wonderfully complimented by the roasted brussel sprouts in the mix of salad greens.  The duck was a complete other flavor profile and was equally as good as the other two dishes. The home made bread in the flower pot is just the right amount of kitsch. The bread inside the pot is impossible to describe accurately. Light, fluffy, doughy, crisp, warm. We had three servings throughout the meal. Desert was ridiculous. Caramel tart with salted caramel ice cream? Oh yes.  And a cute take on bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and cherries... and the olive oil cake is fluffy and moist and the candied lemon and orange was a sweet treat. Go, you'll love it.
