This is a real family operated restaurant. The two owners are local guys who grew up in Verona and have quite a bit of experience in the restaurant industry. The food here is varied and excellent. The wait staff is so friendly and accommodating. Whether you go for lunch, dinner, have an affair here, or have an affair catered off premises, you will not be disappointed......and, the prices are very, very reasonable! Go, you will be back again and again!
