Absolutely LOVED this place! It is the kind of place that is packed every single day of the week. I went in around 8 on Wednesday - and luckily got a table right away. My friend and I had trouble deciding what to get because everything looked (and smelled) mighty good. We settled on the scallops appetizer (wrapped in bacon), garnished with wonderful sauces, and topped with a latke with sour cream! Genius. It melts in your mouth. We each got the herb crusted chicken - maybe it wasn't herb, I'm not sure, but I don't think I've ever raved about chicken in my life. The skin encrusted with whatever deliciousness effortlessly made its way onto my fork - mixed with the underlying risotto... unbelievable. Your taste buds are awakened. Then for dessert we shared the strawberry/berry cobbler with vanilla ice-cream. WOW. Oh ya and the bread is heaven. It's that perfect doughy soft middle with the tough crust... the olive oil is divine. We have been talking all day about how we need to keep going back until we've had just about everything on the menu at least once. Next up? The mac and cheese and those FRIES! I don't care that it's bikini season, just call me the Carb Queen.
