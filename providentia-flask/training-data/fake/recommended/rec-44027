I went into this restaurant with 9 people and no one was impressed (or wanted to finish their meal). The food was greasy (not in the yummy way) and one of us found a piece of plastic in the food. I was really surprised because usually yelp is really accurate for me (this place had 4 stars). Coconut curry is pretty bad - but the pumpkin soup was decent.
