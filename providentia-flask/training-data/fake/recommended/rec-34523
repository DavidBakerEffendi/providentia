I use to come here all the time about 2 years ago, and boy have things changed! My rolls had absolutely no flavor and were very dry. I think they forgot to put in the sauce maybe? Despite the bland boring flavor which was definitely not worth the extra calories, the service was poor. When I first came in the gentleman behind the counter was on his cell phone and pacing back and forth cursing at whoever he was on the phone with. There was no one else in line and I was standing there waiting to order. The gentleman did not acknowledge me once and continued to go about shuffling through receipts is what it looked like. Another person was working at the register and also did not acknowledge me whatsoever. I politely said "excuse me I have been waiting to order." He then pointed at the other guy who fooling around with receipts and abruptly said "he's not taking orders" -- so then I move over about 10 inches where I guess I should have been standing in order to be acknowledged and placed my order. Had the place been busy and hectic I would totally understand and would not be making a fuss, but I was the ONLY one in line and was just flat out ignored until I spoke up. Once I got my order, the guy gave it to me and said "I can't give you a bag for this" when there were clearly a stack of plastic bags sitting right next to him. Was my order too small? I have no idea and these rude people had no intention on explaining. -All that topped off with bland, dry food = 1 star for me.
