My cousin came to visit, and was basically here in NY for one thing: food. When she said she wanted to get pizza, I assumed we'd be in manhattan, getting a slice but instead we ended up at Paulie Gee's, a way classier joint. We were there early, around 6 so we were seated immediately. The interior is nice, although a bit too dim. The pizza oven is beautiful and the pizza that comes out of it? Delicious! Something about that cheese -- fior di latte - as if I knew what that meant! :) and the crispness of the crust was totally perfect. We ordered two pizzas because we couldn't decide - the Hellboy and the Regina. Both were good, but I think the Regina was a little stronger..maybe because it was simpler? Paulie Gee himself came over and said hello, and talked to us for a bit about pizza ovens. It was very charming. Overall, definitely worth a visit, and I would say one pizza is probably good for two, unless you have an amazing appetite.
