The food and the service was great! Fortunately we went on Friday for breakfast. Tried to go the next day, but the line was tooooo long (around the corner). If we had the time we would've waited though. Â I would suggest, as popular as Tom's may be, it would help newcomers find the place easier if there was better signage.
