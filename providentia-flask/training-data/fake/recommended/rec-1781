Special little restaurant and an excellent dining experience.  The food was really spot on, not a weak dish at the table -- 4 appetizers, 4 entrees, 4 desserts all were impeccable. Definitely recommend the beet salad, fluke crudo, and scallops/black pudding as highly as possible.  Among the entrees, the cod with mussels was a spectacular dish. Will be back soon!
