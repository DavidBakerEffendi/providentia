Friend and I ordered southern breakfast and blueberry pancakes -  we cleaned our plates.  Blueberry pancakes were fluffy, buttery and stacked to perfection....and the syrup made it even better (pour the whole thing) Southern breakfast -  divine! Eggs were scrambled to perfect consistency and simply good. I'm a condiment freak, but I didn't add any salt, pepper, tobasco... etc. to my eggs, whoa.  Cheese grits - flavor and texture  were perfectly balanced - not too cheesy or too gritty.  Fried green tomatoes - breaded, fried vegetable - yum.   And finally , sugar cured bacon - OMG, words cannot describe: thick and meaty, not too salty or too sweet... just take a big bite and you'll see We did have to wait 1.5hrs for our table, but service and food made up for the wait...just plan around the wait time. We ate our entire meal in silence and left with a huge smile.
