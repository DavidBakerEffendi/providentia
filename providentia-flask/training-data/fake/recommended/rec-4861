Being that it was brought to you by the same people as Standard Tap, much of the same is to be expected.  As soon as you enter though the corner door, you notice the strikingly similar layout with added warm red lights.  The main difference is the awkwardly placed pool table right by the entrance.  As soon as you walk in you will probably be hit in the balls with a cue.  Luckily, I'm short, so I'll just experience a sharp blow to the throat. Although I didn't try the food, there was quite a stench of fish.  It turns out that someone behind me was eating some seafood--but it smelled almost rotten. The beer selection, however,  is pretty decent.  It's mostly Victory  all priced around $5 (but they do have Lionshead and Kenzinger for $3).  Their Victory selections included Yakima Twilight (cask) and Wild Devil, both a rare find. Since it doubles as a live music venue expect the place to be filled with hipsters in too tight pants, scarves, stripes, and giant 70s glasses. Despite the crowd, it was a decent atmosphere.  But, this is like any other bar in Northern Liberties, so nothing too special to write about.
