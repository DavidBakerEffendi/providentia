Really cozy inside. As in a tight fit. But... Once you're in? Be prepared for foodie heaven. I tried their Fried Chicken sandwich. Big portion just finished the chicken and cole slaw. The bread would have done me in. It was peppered in spice! Not HOT spice just so much flavor the chicken alone was well worth it. Jazz music playing; great wait help; just a great atmosphere. Busy with people. Wait can be long. Must to try is their Sugar Cured bacon and their Fried Green Tomatoes!
