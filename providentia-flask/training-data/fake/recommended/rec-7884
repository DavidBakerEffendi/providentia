Salad bar was great Â , tried just about everything & enjoyed it all. Cheesy bread, garlic mash pot & fried bananas accompany the numerous meats that are served. Service is excellent, definitely have to use the red stop coaster , they just keep bringing more food! Great experience , will def be back.
