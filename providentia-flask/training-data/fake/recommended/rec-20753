OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG... I didn't believe the hype but after waiting over 1.5 hrs for this place... the burgers here are to DIE for.  Let me repeat this to you again, I was NOT a believer until I took my first bite in to the Bronte burger.  This is truly an EPIC EPIC EPIC mindblowing tasty deliciousness.  Who would have thought adding sweet chili sauce would enhance the flavors from the meat oozing out at you?! Disappointed with the selection of appetizers but the burger is a must. BOLD flavors I tell ya. =)
