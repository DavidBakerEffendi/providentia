Awesome food.  Best Moroccan I have had in NYC....and best I have had since I visited Morocco. I have had the kofta, vegetable and tilapia cous cous.  All excellent. The chicken cigars are seasoned like the pigeon pies in Morocco.  Very tasty. Got a kofta sandwich also.  The baguette was soft and for $7 a steal. Perhaps the best food truck in NYC.
