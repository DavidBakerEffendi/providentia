Hooray for Miriam in my neighb! Lovely resto, perfect for a date. The meze plates and entrees are a little small but quality over quantity am I right?? Burekas -- perfect flakiness, not too spicy either. Roasted marinated beets with green tahini -- it is cold, as beet salads tend to be. Cold and refreshing. Do not get if you're looking to warm up from the chilly outdoors (which I was). ...And I forgot which other mezes we got. They were ok. I mean they were fried. Fried stuff all tastes the same I guess. The striped bass was excellent, but a little creamy for my taste. I def plan to return to take advantage of their happy hour, which will undoubtedly be great given the intimate vibe and HUGE wine selection at Miriam. One of only a few gripes about this place was that on the night I visited there were a few puddles of water at the front of the place, which I guess got tracked and made several wet-but-doesnt-look-wet-especially-not-in-super-Â­dim-lighting mini-puddles around the restaurant. I saw 2 people slip during my meal and even I slipped a little on my way to the ladies' room. No one did anything about it. Eeeek.
