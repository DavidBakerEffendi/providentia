Such a wonderful place!! I've been there twice now and it was equally as good both times. While it is a great date spot, it's not exactly suited to quiet conversation. Ramen -The first time we went, my boyfriend had the Karaka Men with a poached egg and I had the Akamaru Modern also with a poached egg. They were amazing but I liked the Karaka Men slightly better (the slight spice was wonderful). It was also a ton of food! So the next time we went we got one of those, shared it (making sure to leave enough soup) and asked for extra noodles at the end. My boyfriend has an APPETITE but this was enough for both of us. Appetizers - Hakata Tonpu Yaki (Pancake with sliced pork belly) - phenomenal. I wish the pork belly had been a bit more substantial (it kind of got lost among everything else going on). Reservations - It's usually a 1.5-2 H wait. BUT you can go, give your name and number and then leave. They will text you (multiple times if you don't show up) when your table is almost ready so you have about ten mins to get over there. My BF lives in the area so once we just gave our name before we were hungry and then went back home for a few hours. It's also great to stop by and give your name then get drinks or appetizers at a nearby bar.
