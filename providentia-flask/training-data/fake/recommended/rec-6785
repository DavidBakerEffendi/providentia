Very cool and relaxed atmosphere. The lamb shank was terrific and the crabcakes outstanding. I think the most noteworthy part of the dinner was the music....you can't beat a great playlist while eating a great meal. Bloc Party, Arcade Fire, Muse and Springsteen. What Â can be better? Service was spot on and very friendly. I wish they served liquor instead of just wine and beer but i guess all in due time. Check it out and make a reservation way in advance.
