So unbelievably good and it's all vegan! Try the Spicy Mang roll and the Nutty Buddy wrap. My friends and I sampled each other's dishes and all were so incredibly good and flavorful. You won't miss the fish. I recommend this place to all my friends in NY or visiting NY. Do it. Random bits: * The place is small so seating is limited. * If you need to use the restroom, you'll need to go into the bar next door (which isn't too clean and makes you think your hands were cleaner before you washed your hands in that place).
