No, really, it is pretty delicious. The New Haven area has a lot of options if you've got a hankering for Thai food, but I was so pleasantly surprised by Thai Awesome. The portion sizes we had were perfect, and my drunken noodles with tofu were great (awesome ratio of tofu and veggies to noodles; so many places skimp on the protein!), and my boyfriend's ginger tofu was great -- and I really don't like ginger. Service was excellent, kitchen was quick, and food was yummy. Can't ask for more. (Note: Â It is genuinely a hole-in-the-wall, so don't bring a big group here.)
