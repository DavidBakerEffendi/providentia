4.5 Came here with a couple of my girlfriends on a Wednesday night.  The place was packed at around 9:15pm, but it's not a large restaurant.  They didn't take reservations.  We were seated in 30 mins.   The ambiance is pretty casual and perfect for a weeknight meal.  They have handwritten menus that I adore at restaurants. Our table ordered some market sides (4/$14) and the grilled trout entree. Sides ordered (...can't remember what each side was exactly labeled): - Mixed mushroom - Hearts of palm salad (they ran out of the kale :[) - Brussel sprouts - Soy-glazed tofu - Sweet potato fries - Beets with goat cheese - Grilled asparagus - summer quinoa - grilled zucchini Agree with the other Yelpers that the market sides were delicious!  Didn't give 5 stars because the trout was a bit dry and lacked flavor.  We also ordered mint lemonades that were very refreshing, but unexpected that they were like slushies.   The bill was pretty reasonable.  You can definitely make a meal out of just ordering sides.  Most of the entrees were around $15-$20. We were too full for dessert, but will definitely be back to try them!
