This place is amazing!! It was a two hour wait on a Friday night but it was def worth it!! I decided to order the delboy which has spicy soppresata on it and it was delicious. Â Make sure to buy there signature hot honey to take home it's addicting!! Although its a small place and the wait was really long, the staff is great and the food is awesome!! You won't regret going.
