Tia Pol is far off of the beaten track but not a bad option for tapas.  Came here with a large group and we were all well wined and dined for $60/person, which is basically unheard of in NYC. However, be warned: we made the mistake of getting the sangria and it was a bad idea. It was overly sweet and basically tasted like sweetened fruit juice. After that, we switched to cava and wine. We got a lot of dishes--probably close to every hot dish on the menu. My favorites, by far, were the patatas bravas, which were probably the best I've had in the city so far, and the skirt steak with cauliflower, which was a special. The lamb skewers and shrimp also win a honorable mention. The tomato on pan was also quite good, though also hard to share. Other than that, we also got the following: - Fried baby squid:  tender, but salty, and a little too much fried-to-squid ratio - Pimientos: spicy but I've definitely had better - Fried pork belly terrine: meh, was a little too strong for my liking - Potato croquette: slightly too cheesy on the inside - Cheese and meat plates: a-ok but hard to share - Egg omelette: strangely cold, could've probably skipped - Olives: good variety but small portions - Squid in ink with rice: small portion, not amazing, could've skipped - Chorizo: way too salty (though I still ate this anyway) Overall, most dishes were decent, while a select few stood out. I would only come here in a big group so that you can try some of everything. Otherwise, stick to the basics I listed above and you'll have a great meal!
