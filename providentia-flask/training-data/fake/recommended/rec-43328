Kind of want to give this place more than 2 stars, seeing it is AYCE and made-to-order. I've had some awful buffet-style all-you-can-eat sushi, and this sushi is considerably more tolerable. Definitely not great, nor am I particularly itching to come back, but I will certainly have this place on my mind should I come down with the munchies with a buddy who doesn't want to drive the extra ten minutes to get to the marginally preferable sushi palace. The first reason I wouldn't take a date here is because I completely gorge myself like an animal at ayce sushi places (especially because there is an extra fee for not finishing your food). The other reason is there is absolutely no atmosphere here, and I'm a little confused about the food service.
