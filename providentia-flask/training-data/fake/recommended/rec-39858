My friend and I came here on a late Saturday afternoon. It was small enough Â that it felt like a neighborhood joint. We shared the bruschetta and a fafandone pie. The bruschetta used pesto sauce which i'm not used to but it was pretty good. The pizza was very thin and crispy with decent toppings. I felt the wait time for such a thin small pizza was long. The waitress wasn't too attentive either. Good beer selection though . I'd come back if I'm in the area and craving pizza. but it's nothing to go out of the way for.
