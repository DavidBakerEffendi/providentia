If you don't end up waiting 30 minutes for a table - then Flatbread will leave nothing but a delicious taste in your mouth. First off, start with the Dancing Heart and a side of marinara. Garlic, Asiago cheese, and SESAME SEEDS. Yes, SESAME SEEDS on your garlic cheese pizza. Dip it in hearty marinara and watch the love flow. Then I'd say (btw, order a few beers, they offer some great brews), get the Vermont Sausage pizza. The Sausage is loaded (and covered with mushrooms) a tasty spiced pork sausage, a dash of sun dried tomato, and a plethora of fantastic caramelized onions. Seriously, my buddy and I ate an entire large pizza, AND the dancing heart without breaking a sweat (a testament to the deliciousness of the pizza - believe me, we shouldn't have eaten a large pizza). So yeah, the wait can be long, the tables can be in awkward positions (especially the one in the corner near the front of the restaurant), and the service can be hit or miss - but this pizza is what every pizza place should strive to be - fancy, but DELICIOUS. and LEGIT.
