I've been coming here since the first night they opened.  I was a hungry college student and it was after a late class that I discovered Sushi California. I was going to this plaza to get some Chinese food when I saw a recently added banner that said "Grand Opening" at the store front next to the Chinese place.  I love sushi and trying new places so this was right up my alley.  When I entered I could smell the slight hint of fresh paint and was welcomed by chef Oh and his wife.  My first impression of this place could not have been better.  The sushi was amazing the service was great and the prices were good.  I'm happy to say a few years later I still make the trek from Danbury to eat here and have recommended this place ever since. If your in the area and craving some yummy sushi then this is a must stop for you!
