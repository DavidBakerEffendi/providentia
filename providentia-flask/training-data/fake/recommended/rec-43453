Mamma Flora's is the most solid pizza that delivers in the Ewing/Lawrenceville area. Also, their salads are lovely - generous, with nice quality romaine and dressings that seem to be house made. The pies are thin crust, Trenton-style. To be honest, slightly lacking the character/panache of DeLo's or Papas, (not to mention the char), but otherwise it is so far superior to other pizzerias in these neighborhoods that it's not even a fight. Mamma Flora's wins. They deliver to all of Ewing, and Lawrenceville south of I-95. Would they venture north to the village? Ask them (my gut tells me they would). Go simple on the pies - tomato pie, sausage or pepperoni. The caesar salad is lovely, and their entrees are delicious. If you want your food brought to you and you're in this area, you need to call Mamma Flora's.
