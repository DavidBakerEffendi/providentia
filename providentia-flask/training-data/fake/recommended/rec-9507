The food is amazing! We had the bacon flight (2 strips each of 4 kinds of bacon), a burger, tater tots, and the bread pudding dessert. It was so good; we are definitely going to go back. Service was good and the place was busy without feeling too crowded. They are missing the fifth star because the music was very loud, and the style of hip hop / rap was a little too aggressive lyrically for a laid-back dining experience.
