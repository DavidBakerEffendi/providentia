Fantastic!!! I would definitely return next time I'm in new haven! From the draft beer selection to the menu- I can't say enough about it. I will agree with the other reviews about the sweet potatoe fries- best I've had, and I had the chipotle chicken wrap- mmmmmm good!! Â My husband and daughter both couldn't say enough about their food!!! Great find!!
