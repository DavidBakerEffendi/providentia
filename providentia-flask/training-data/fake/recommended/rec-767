I honestly want to like this place as I live less than a half mile away. I read the reviews. I see the long lines of people waiting to get in on the weekends. For what? I have been to OPH on at least 10 occasions over the years allowing for an opportunity to be impressed. But, I just don't get it. I leave more underwhelmed with each visit regretting that I had given it another try. The portions are huge. I guess that is the crowd pleaser. However, I find the quality to be sub standard. The food is heavy, greasy and common. Nothing creative. The prices are a bit on the high side for this type of fare. I actually prefer the pancakes and omelets at most of the diners in the area, which are abundant in this neck of the woods.
