I'm quite uncertain about the rating here. I didn't pick up the check: if I did, I would be more disappointed and more severe. But anyway, luck is luck, and it always counts, so I will be generous with the rating even for this contingent, psychologically related reason. It's pricey, for my standards, but not more than all the other Wooster Square non-pizza restaurants. We were three people, in a very slow night. For a while we were the only ones in this huge, baroque, kitschy hall. The waiter was very nice, slightly too much for my tastes. I had a pasta with eggplants and tomato sauce (what in Italy is called "alla Norma" with ricotta salata as well), which was eeeh. A bit overcooked, eggplants were tasteless, huge amount of stuff. I have had worse, however. My friends had a minestrone, that I did not taste; a mixed antipasto, of which the mozzarella was fresh, the prosciutto was ok, the pickled vegetables--apparently-- weird; and a chicken done with some kind of sauce, and vegetables, which tasted the best to me, but I have to say I am easy on chicken. Oh, the bread was ok, though, and the butter and olives pretty good. So maybe three stars is deserved, after all!
