i dined here with a huge party on a Saturday night and I have to say the service was impeccable.  I was a tiny bit worried how they would handle us but everything was great.   The food was fantastic - a few things to note that really stood out: Raw beef appetizer - to die for!  almost ordered a 2nd portion but decided not to fill up Yellowtail Jalapeno appetizer - outstanding! Fresh Scallop Sashimi was served with a cucumber disc, a very nice touch. i would definitely go back if i were in the neighborhood.
