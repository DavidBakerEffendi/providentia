beyond sushi has been on my radar for about a month now.  my sweetie surprised me by coming to town so we went to this little predominantly take-out spot and were lucky to find a spot to sit.  i had a fiesta and a sweet tree roll and my sweetie had the nutty buddy and we shared the homemade kimchi.  my rolls were both great, especially the flavor combinations of the sweet tree, which combined sweet potato and avocado with crunchy sprouts.  the rolls are actually really beautiful to look at, much prettier in my opinion than traditional japanese sushi.  the dark rice and the colors of the veggies make for an appealing dish.  the nutty buddy was fantastic, just peanut buttery enough and coupled with some cashews, baked tofu and julienned carrots.  i wish there were a few more places to sit, and i hope the restaurant does really well so they can expand to a few more locations or a larger one.  i'll definitely be back.
