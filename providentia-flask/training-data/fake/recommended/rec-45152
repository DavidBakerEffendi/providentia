Totally disappointed. Â Restaurant wasn't even busy and I found myself waiting 25 minutes for a bowl of chili. People sitting behind us also had the same problem. I ditched after waiting way longer than is acceptable. What a joke. Terrible thing is that I have eaten here before, had a good experience and loved the food. After reading other reviews I see that lengthy waits are commonplace. What a bummer. Anyway, find somewhere else to eat on Church Street. Don't waste your time.
