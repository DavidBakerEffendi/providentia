JoJu... what happened to you guys today???  Did you have someone new making a sandwich back there??? I am a frequent customer there and I always leave very happy.  But NOT today. First of all, the bread was Not crunchy as usual. It was rather soft.  Then, WHAT HAPPENED to the amount of the meat??  SERIOUSLY.  It only had half the amount.  I am NOT exaggerating.  I don't know.  You guys seemed busier than usual so maybe you ran out of the meat???   I really hope this is not the new trend now...  You will lose customers if you start going cheap like other places.....
