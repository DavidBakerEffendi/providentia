Bubbys is a awesome place for late night food. The prices are reasonable and the food is quite tasty. I have been here three times now, and all three times I had a pleasant experience here. Wonderful place and even more wonderful service. I enjoyed the Smoked Salmon, and the Fried Okra was excellent. I found that the flavor was somehow exotic, it was delish. I'll be back, hopefully sooner than later!
