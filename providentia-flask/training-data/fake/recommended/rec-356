I looooooove this place. I'm so glad they're back in business after having closed for renovations for months. Been here for both dinner and brunch, and both are fantastic. The Selection of Spreads for 2 is a great plate to share, and the tubular pasta is so deliciously fresh. The only downside to this place is that it's too far away from me :( tinyurl.com/pp6lfp7
