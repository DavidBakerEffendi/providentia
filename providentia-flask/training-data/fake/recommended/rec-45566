Service: First and foremost, I've worked in the food/hospitality industry for over seven years now so I understand how it is to be under pressure of a busy restaurant atmosphere but it doesn't justify horrible service. I came for brunch on a busy Friday afternoon, the wait for a table wasn't as bad as I expected but the wait for service took a bit. When we finally received service, it was very poor and inattentive. Before I started my order, I told the server I have a groupon voucher and then he rushed through our order. Close to the end of our meal, not only did he toss my check onto my plate before I could finish my meal, he also failed to acknowledge that I even mentioned the voucher. When I went up to pay at the register, he snatched the money out of my hand. I found that to be very disrespectful. Food: I ordered the ribeye steak and eggs. I specifically requested for my steak to be cooked medium rare. I received my steak very well done, which was a big disappointment. The only thing that he got right was my eggs being sunny side up. I would have overlooked the bad service if the food was at least satisfying but unfortunately, it wasn't. Not only that, I had two glasses of orange juice that were rimmed with a layer of what looked like a combination of lint and mold. Overall, my morning experience wasn't so glorifying at Sam's.
