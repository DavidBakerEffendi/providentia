Fa Realz...Taim is the bomb!!! Strolled into this tiny closet of a shop on Wed afternoon in some serious need of lunch time grub.  Despite their offerings of 3 different types of falafel I went with the "classic" green to provide a comparison to other falafel-related experiences.   For  under $7 I got the hook up, a falafel sandwich in wheat pita; it must have weighed 2 pounds and was STUFFED with falafel balls of goodness (at least 9-10), along with hummus, tahini, isreali salad, and pickled cabbage.   It sounds like a lot?  Heavy?  Not even!  On the bites where I could get everything I was in some kind of Middle Eastern Heaven!!!  Also, each of the components had their own unique taste and could easily stand on their own on any plate.  This was the perfect intro to both NYC and Greenwich Village!
