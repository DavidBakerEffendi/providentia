I'm pretty sure I just had an orgasm in my mouth. My roommate said she just had a fried dough and meat orgy in her mouth. We can agree to disagree, and I know this is borderline food-pornish, but all I know is that everything there was AMAZING. We had one of each pretty much (as you can see from the pictures) and everything was really delicious. The highlights were the beef and the turkey, and the meh ones was the pesto one and the sausage/potato. But it wasn't even meh, it just wasn't as slammin as their meaty counterparts. I am totally not a nutella/fried banana person, but when I put that sweet empanada in my mouth, I almost died, and not from embarassment because I had nutella running down my chin AND MY ROOMMATE DIDN'T WANT TO TELL ME (ahem, kelly!!!), but because that thing was so tasty and perfect. Anyways, I'm coming back, probably every other day, and I expect the rest of you yelpers to follow through.
