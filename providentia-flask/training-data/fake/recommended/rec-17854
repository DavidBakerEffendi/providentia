We went to Alta last night for the first time and really enjoyed it. The space was lovely, though it looked more southwest cantina or Mediterranean osteria than Manhattan restaurant. Great collection of diverse flavors on the menu. Our favorites included calamari salad, roasted Japanese eggplant, shortribs with horseradish. Lovely drinks; the white sangria rocked. Our only complaint was that the service was almost too fast. The orders were barely out of our mouths before the plates appeared so it all felt rushed. Also, the space was a little loud, and tables weren't terribly comfortable - impossible not to have a wooden table leg wedged between your legs. Otherwise, really great food and lovely place.
