I ate there last night with a group. I ordered the crabcake appetizer. The appearance of the small crab cakes were that of a small scoop of mashed potatoes with no caramlized color or hand rolled shape. The texture was close to that as well, very soft. Also very salty. I did however like the lettuce variety the cakes were served on but wasnt a fan of the sauce/dressing. I give this 2 stars because the crab cakes indeed had a crab flavor and the lettuce was nice. I would not order this again nor would I recommend it. I would however eat here again and try something else off the menu.
