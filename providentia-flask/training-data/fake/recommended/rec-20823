Red Stone has a fairly upscale bistro vibe, but we entered through the Fuddruckers', which should tell you something. We were seated by a dapperly-dressed and very-well-mannered 9-yr old host. Seriously. As odd as that was, it would turn out to be the last good service of the night. Our waiter didn't greet us for 10-15 min, and food was equally delayed. The whole staff is young and seems new. The menus are laminated, two-sided cards depicting a wide selection of standard American (aka upscale bar) food. The pizza and salad we ordered were thoroughly enjoyable, albeit not particularly unique. With time, and more experience, the place would be a step up from your typical Applebee's or TGIFs.
