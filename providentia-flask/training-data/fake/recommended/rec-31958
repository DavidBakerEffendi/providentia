I went in the summer time and there was no line.  I got the roast beef which was really good.  Get the gravy on the side so you can pour the gravy on and then dip it as well.  I couldn't get enough of this gravy.   I also had the chicken parm and fried ravioli which were both really good.  Both sandwiches had fresh  mozzarella and had great flavor.  I wish the meat were just piled a little higher.   If it was then it would have been a definite 5 star.  I'm looking Howard to coming back on a Wednesday and trying the fried shrimp parm which I hear is awesome.
