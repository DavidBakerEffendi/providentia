The lamb burrito is out of this world. After suffering years of nachos with soggy chips I finally see the el Rey has gotten it right by using a pizza pan for maximum coverage when it comes to toppings and not steaming the chips and making them limp: genius. The frozen pineapple margaritas have the perfect balance of sweet and tart. Even if I only have one day off a week I've been lucky to spend it here
