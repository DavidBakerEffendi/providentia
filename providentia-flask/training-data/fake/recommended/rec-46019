Sushi you is my favorite sushi spot. I've been going here for sushi ever since they opened.  It is a small place, BYOB and they take credit cards except for discover.  They have unique roll.  If you have friend that are trying sushi for the first time, this is the place to bring them/recommend.  Everyone that I have referred to this spot rave about how good it was and they become loyal customers! They  have a large variety of cooked rolls for non-raw fish eaters.  The best cooked rolls is the snow mountain,  golden shrimp tempura, and the dynamite roll.  Don't let the 50% off sign fool you, they've had that there since they opened!
