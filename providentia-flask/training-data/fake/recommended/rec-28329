This place is actually very delicious. The service could use some work, but the food speaks for itself. Only downfall are the portions. Small plating, high prices, BUT it is top quality so you get what you pay for. Definitely a little gem. EVERYTHING on here is delicious and you can tell that the chef didn't miss any details on his menu.
