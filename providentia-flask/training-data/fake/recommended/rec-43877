This place is a hidden wburg gem. I've probably walked by it a billion times and not even noticed it. In a neighborhood where even the street vendors have hype, juniper is modest and unpretentious, as if it is unaware of the madness going on all around it. This is a place where locals, scruffy hipsters and inebriated old timers alike, can camp out with their byo tallboy and not be bothered on a Saturday. I got a pulled pork sandwich with spicy fries. The servings are huuuuuge, so my sandwich came overstuffed with juicy barbecue-saucy meat and a pile of hot, crispy, just-made french fries coated in Cajun seasoning. The flavor of the pork was right on, not too spicy, a hint of sweetness and vinegar. A little coleslaw would have been welcome though, just to break up the grease-party a bit. I also got a sneak peek of some other dishes and everything looked great. As a rule I had been wary of this 'hood on the weekends, but I could see juniper becoming a go-to spot.
