I'm surprised by the negativity for this place.  For what it is, it easily trumps any other "fast food" Chinese restaurant in the area, and I've been to a bunch of them.  I dropped in after the gym one night, and had food in front of me and friends within 5 minutes.  Quick, cheap, and way better than any place near me (Milford).  I had a huge roasted duck and wonton soup with udon noodles and teriyaki chicken skewers, all for around $10.   I do agree with the reviewers who said the staff is rude and impatient - their ornery attitude needs some work, but they definitely know how to get quick cheap and great tasting Chinese into my belly.
