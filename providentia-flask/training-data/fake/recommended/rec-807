Came here for a late night drink and dinner, this place was pretty impressive. Must try are the Nachos, these bad boys are large and in charge come with chicken or steak and you get them for the low low price of $12.50. Realistically if I come back I will just get a couple drinks and split the nachos with like 3 to 4 people, yeah they are that good and big. We had the pitcher of red sangria, which was $32.00 a little pricey, but its and works out. For our entree, well I'm from Los Angeles I'm use to cheap delicious tacos, taste is usually there quality may lack. This place had a taco sampler $23 for 5 tacos, no rice no beans... I would have never have picked this, but the tacos were all amazing high quality and taste. You get a carnitas, a ahi tuna, a carne asada, a chicken and I believe some other fish taco. Service was excellent, food was amazing, drinks were good, for downtown thats probably just what you pay. Will definitely be back drinks and the nachos.
