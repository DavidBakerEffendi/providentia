Found this place on Yelp. Was looking for some Asian food near where i work in the Fashion District. Honestly I was craving something along the lines of noodles.... The reviews seemed decent enough to try. So my girlfriend and I ventured here for lunch. It was around 2 in the afternoon and the place had about four patrons all together at that time. We were welcomed and seated quickly. The waitstaff was pleasant and quick which was great given I had an hour for lunch. I ordered the Pad Kee Mao which I loved. I am not big on spicy food but this had just enough of a kick that it didn't ruin it for me. I accompanied it with a papaya salad which was just as tasty. My friend ordered the GuayThiew Nam Tok which she enjoyed very much. Overall good service and great food. Definitely a go to for Thai.
