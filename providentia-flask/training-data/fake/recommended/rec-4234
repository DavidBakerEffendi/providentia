The Staff was friendly. But the place got pack quickly and the one waiter was clearly overrun with customers. He was working the tables and bar. But was still very Friendly. The Pizza was ok Kinda Burnt. My Daughter order the Meatball Sub which was ok aswell kinda spicy. Took Forever to get the check because the one waiter working the table and bar was very busy.
