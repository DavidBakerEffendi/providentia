I must admit, when it comes to turkey burgers, an establishment either gets them right or gets them terribly wrong.  Well, Bobby's Burger Palace does burgers quite well in fact. It's casual dining, but the interior layout and hospitable staff, make the place one of  THE hangout spots for UPenn & Drexel students.  Unpretentious. Never boring. Each visit brings back memories of my undergraduate days.  Just a cool, laid back atmosphere to hang out with friends and enjoy a good burger and an authentic shake.
