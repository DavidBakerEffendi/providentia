One of my favorite brunch spots in the city. The portions are just right and the place is really cute and cozy. There is main dining area seating, few bar seats and a patio area when it's nice out. The menu isn't dense which I like. I typically get the waffle which has just the right amount of sweet and meat complement to it. Portions are small plates. Waiting time can be long for large parties and during prime brunch hours. They do not take reservations so be patient waiting for a table. I typically do not like large brunch plate options, which is why this such a nice change from a lot of the brunch places in the city.
