Walking into Joe's was literally like walking into a restaurant in Shanghai- crowdy and loud, and English was a second, maybe even third, language...and I loved it all the more so! Â I wanted to go to a place which serves authentic Chinese food in a place that feels authentically Chinese and this is exactly what you get at Joe's (despite the very American name). We went here mainly because of their famous soup-dumplings, and just one look around and you'll see the dumplings are as ubiquitous as the water on the table. We ordered two orders of 8 each and they literally flew off the table. The soup inside is nicely salty and the pork is very flavorful- I could have easily eaten 20 of them! We also ordered the turnip cakes which far exceeded my expectations. They look like a patty with flaky phyllo dough on the outside and the shredded turnips on the inside. For the entree we ordered sesame chicken and it was so amazing we had to order a second one. The chicken was like nothing I've ever had; it was tender and actually moist- not dry and hard- and the breading was light and actually complemented, not masked, the chicken. For a feast of 4 our grand total was only $40. So if you're looking to have a taste and feel of China but you're on a budget, head to Joe's!!!
