Let me preface my review by saying that I am NOT a meat eater.. so I'm probably not umami burger's best audience. Regardless! I came here with the boy for his birthday on a Monday night, around 6:30 after work. I had heard about the horrifying wait times and was a little nervous that we were going to wait for 2 hours, but we literally were sat almost immediately. I did notice though, on our way out, there was a much bigger crowd waiting inside and outside. I guess it helps that we got there so early. Anyways, once we were sat, we both ordered a beer and some apps. We decided on the truffle fries and onion rings. The truffle fries were AMAZING... IF you like truffle, which I am obsessed with. The onion rings were good but very greasy and we didn't have any dipping sauces for them for a solid 10 minutes. We also didn't have utensils, napkins or plates so that made it difficult to eat the apps until they were finally brought out to us. I ordered the Earth Burger and the boy got the Cali Burger. I enjoyed my burger.. it was definitely unique. I hadn't had a veggie burger like that before. I enjoyed the "soyrizo" on it. It didn't wow me by any means though. The boy felt the same about his burger. He said it was "good but not amazing." The staff here was really nice, which was a plus. And the food came out super quick. We were in and out of Umami Burger within an hour, I think. Very efficient. I'm not sure I'd come back here, but again, I don't eat burgers. I think it was definitely worth the try to see what all the hype was about though!
