went for brunch with my fellow yoginis after class today. ordered the feta, spinach, kalamata olive omelette. delicious fluffy omelette with perfect proportion of ingredients. as usual, the roasted potatoes rocked (possibly the best roasted potatoes in the city). shared chocolate cake for dessert. their whipped cream is special. orlin has one of the better brunches in the city. i've been coming here for over 10 years and the quality has remained consistently good thru-out, which is why i'm giving them 5 stars. they have great sandwiches and the dinner entrees are solid. the prices are very reasonable, too. great low-ceilinged, exposed brick wall interior.
