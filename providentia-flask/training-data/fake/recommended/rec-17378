I LOVE LOVE LOVE the atmosphere of this restaurant. It makes me feel like I'm actually in cuba (although i wouldn't know because i've never been to cuba).   I don't think their tapas were that great but their entrees were amazing.   We had the skirt steak entree and it was one of the best steak i've ever had. The meat was perfectly cooked, tender and just melts in your mouth. We also had one of their whole fish plate with plantain and it was delicious. I'm actually craving it now as i'm typing this review. I would definitely go back to this restaurant the next time i'm in new jersey. There were four of us and our bill came out be less than $90 because the place is BYOB. Very cool.
