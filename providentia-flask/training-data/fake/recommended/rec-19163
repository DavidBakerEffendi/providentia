My boyfriend's brother was visiting from Tunisia, so we decided to take him to a Mediterranean restaurant for "comfort food". As can be expected for a Saturday night, it was busy. But the "hostess post" was vacant and we needed to wander through the outdoor seating area (the restaurant main entrance was closed), to get a table. Once we found someone, they were helpful and accommodating. Clearly, the place to be at this restaurant is the outside hookah lounge (which provides full menu). In fact, no one was seated inside. Â No one! The food was mediocre at best. Kufta was overlooked and the roasted chicken a little bland. But a big win is the appetizer platter. Not sure if we'll go back.
