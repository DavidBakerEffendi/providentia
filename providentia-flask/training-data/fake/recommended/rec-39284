When I crave pho, my mind thinks of that Vietnamese joint next to the laundry mat. That's code name for Pho Hong, hands down my go to spot for pho. You will have to wait in line for a table during lunch and dinner time on weekends but the pho is worth it. Having grown up in LA, I know pho here don't compare to pho back home. Only complaint I have is there is no X-Large size, but ehh..I probably do my kidneys a service since the high sodium content from the soup will probably kill them if I ate the noodles and drank the broth every day. Prices are reasonable. I go here on cold, winter days or after I stayed up all night "studying" very hard on a Fri/Sat night. Tried the avocado milk shake. Highly recommended. Wait can be really long which is the downside.
