Great experience all around for dinner on a busy Saturday. Seated immediately with reservation,  very friendly and attentive server who made good recommendations. Food came out at a good pace and was tasty.  No, it's not gourmet and that seems to really get people going in these reviews but it is accessible and fun comfort food with cool presentations and plating. The atmosphere is very lively and has a fun night out, young vibe. It's really all about the desserts, so go easy on dinner and invest there. Recommend the chocolate martini, cheesesteak waffle sandwich and euphoria sundae (split it, it's huge).
