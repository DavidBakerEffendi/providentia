If you are looking for delectable meats, moist poultry, succulent sides, and microbrewed excellence, look no further. Dino BBQ has it all. NYC is a very underrated BBQ town (southern folk please do not kill me) and there are several places that I REALLY like a lot- DBBQ takes the funnel cake. It isn't even close. The wings here are absolutely tremendous. They are (as noted above) MOIST and JUICY, voluptuous and flat out meat-tastic. I would be completely satisfied going here and order 18 wings for myself and calling it a night. Except I wouldn't because I would be cheating myself out of the BEST PULLED PORK AND BRISKET AND SIDES YOU CAN GET. Â  Great place to go and meat up with friends and family, or take that special someone. Nothing says "I love you" like a slab of ribs with a side of salt potatoes.
