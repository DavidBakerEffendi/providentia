I love this place. I had ordered a chicken and waffle dish which I forgot the name of but the chicken was drizzled with honey and my waffles had mushroom and rosemary SO DELICIOUS. Reminded me or Hash House in Vegas which I love. The chicken was nice and crispy and very tasty, and the waffles were to die for.. I am definitely coming back for more.
