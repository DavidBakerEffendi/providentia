Up to the last visit I would have given it 5 stars but........ I had a bad oyster, the used to check each one really well & they were perfect, at $3.50 each they all sould be perfect. They changed the preperation on the bone marrow, still good but nowhere where it used to be. The service was sketchy at best, my wife would have ordered another $12 glass of wine if we could have gotten the waiters attention, it was a quiet night. Used to think it was amazing & would crave it above other similarly priced places, the last experience will probably make me try other options first.
