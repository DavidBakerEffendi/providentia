Top of the line tapioca pearls in the bubble tea (tender, chewy, lightly sweetened)--too bad that the drinks are made with powder and non-dairy creamer. I definitely enjoyed my coconut bubble tea while I was drinking it, but personally am prone to belly aches and sugar crashes after consuming things with high high fructose content. Â Definitely the place to go for $3 range bubble tea in New Haven and the winner of the powder category. Let's remember this is a college eatery. So it's cheap (you are paying for a meal and a half, maybe two), a little dingy inside, and loud. The food I find pretty greasy, but sometimes that hits the spot! The portions are huge. I found my beef noodle to be too greasy to finish comfortably, but my friend's tofu coconut curry soup was fantastically spicy and the soup diluted the grease well. That is what I'll be ordering next time. There's a Chairagami bench in the basement! I'd always wanted to sit on one. So that's a plus.
