Eastwick is reliably good. I've never had a disappointing experience and have dined there 5-6 times since we moved into the neighborhood. Bottom line, if you're down to spend 10-20$/person for a meal, this place is notably good all around. Food is particularly tasty, service is always friendly, sometimes a little slow, but mostly very good. I only wish they had a larger menu, or changed it up more often. Brunch: Prix Fixe for 14$, including drink of your choice. Sides not included, bacon 2$ extra, fries 2$, etc. Everything I've tried was great but particularly the Shakhusa - savory, tomato-y, delicious with poached eggs. Essentially a tomato stew with loads of garlic and greens with poached eggs in the middle. Lunch/Dinner: Smoked eggplant dip is a wonderful appetizer, great for sharing with your party. Burgers are great. Brioche buns hold up to the juicy patties. Mac and cheese comes highly recommended, as do the mussels.
