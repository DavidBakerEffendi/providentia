After screaming and hollering while watching the Super Bowl in a bar (and eating the not so great food), it was an extreme pleasure to find Joseph Leonard.  My friend and I were walking around trying to find a decent place to eat and we stumbled across this place.  It is pretty small, but who cares?  The vibe is great, the staff there are amazing and the food is OUTSTANDING.  I had the escargot toast and I left absolutely nothing on my plate.  I had an excellent rose and the caramel pudding and they were just amazing.  What a great way to end an already awesome night (NY Giants!).  I will definitely return.
