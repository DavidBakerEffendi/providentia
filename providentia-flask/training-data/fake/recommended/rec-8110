Quick and friendly service, delicious Malaysian and Thai cuisine, great spot in Chinatown, very affordable, and BYOB! I've seen people have a dinner party here and I've also had a birthday dinner here before. I recommend: Seafood tomyam noodles, hainanese chicken, Thai basil noodles, Mango Chicken or Beef. Stop getting the pad thai (not that theirs is not good) and it's time to get adventurous! ;)
