We loved this place! So cute inside, food is delicious and the service was great. We ordered the ricotta donuts which were AMAZING. They melted in your mouth. And I got the pancakes with strawberries and a lavender sauce, also very yummy. My husband got the steak and eggs, he loved how the steak was seasoned and cooked. We will definitely be back again!
