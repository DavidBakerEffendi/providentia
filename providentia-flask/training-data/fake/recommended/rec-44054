I stopped by Rangoon on a recent work trip. I was dull and ordered the tea leaf salad and thousand layer bread based on reviews. The thousand layer bread is basically the Burmese version of roti canai, but made with coconut milk.  It was good, though a tad pricey compared to what I'm used to with roti canai.  The tea salad was a tad bland (though not bitter) and a few of the split peas were as hard as rocks. They seem a bit stingy on the tea leaves in contrast to some of the Bay Area restaurants. If I end up in this area again I would try some other dishes given the less interesting options in the neighborhood.
