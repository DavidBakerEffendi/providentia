Let me just state that I don't think it's the best ramen ever, it's okay, and the overall experiences is fine. They don't take reservations here and it's BYOB, which is fine, though we called ahead and were assured our party of three would be seated within 10 minutes. When we arrived, that turned out to be the case. The restaurant is in a narrow space, and they shuffle tables and chairs around to accommodate different parties. The crowd looked half hipster, half Chinatown, which is to be expected, I guess. The seating is on stools without backs, which is fine, but I have a tendency to sit at the edge of my chair, I guess relying on the weight of a seat back to keep me from tipping. No such luck here. Yeah I looked like the drunk guy at the ramen place not being able to handle his four-legged stool. Some of the appetizers were awesome to not awesome. The edamame was salted fine but way overcooked, and was a little mushy to the teeth. The Korean fried chicken was great! Highly recommend. I also recommend the pork or chicken buns. So great. I ordered the small bowl of Shoyu ramen, and I was kind of unimpressed. The egg was overcooked, there were too many cellophane noodles, which I've never had in a ramen dish and which I don't particularly like. Sigh. Maybe I could try one of the other ramen dishes. I'd be willing to give it a try, like a veggie ramen bowl or the spicy ramen bowl.
