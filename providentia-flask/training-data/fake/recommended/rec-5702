A person who knows nothing about Philadelphia will easily find out about Village Whiskey, as it seems to be one of the first places to be mentioned whenever you ask a local about what bars/restaurants to try out. Â  Though I didn't try them, I've heard very good things about the duck fat fries and the burgers.
