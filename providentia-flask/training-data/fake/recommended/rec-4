Sushi Burritos, whaaaat? I've been to Hai Street twice now and it hasn't disappointed either time. The first time I got the bowl with brown rice and tempura shrimp, it's one of their suggestions. So good! Nice Asian Flavors without the heavy, greasy feeling. There was mango and cucumber with a nice sweet and spicy taste. I also had their iced green tea, delish, just as the guy at the counter insisted it would be. I was so happy with my dinner choice! I've heard lunch there is super busy but since I don't work in the city I can only check out places for dinner usually. There was no wait and the employees were nice and informative of what they were offering. I went back a few weeks later and got the burrito with chicken. Â This time I tried the hibiscus tea, it could have been a little sweeter but was still a nice drink to have on a hot summer evening. I will definately be going back soon!
