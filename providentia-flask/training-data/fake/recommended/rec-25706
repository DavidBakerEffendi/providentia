I had been wanting to go here for a while, and I heard it was an under-the-radar-but-good-food-and-beer place because of the ritzy yet popular Bar Ferdinand right next door. This place gets the 4th star because I really truly enjoyed the Pig Wings and would go back just for them!  The Fried Pickles Yelpers on here rave about were good, but I think only while they are fresh and hot; the sauce complimented them really well.  I don't think Fried Pickles are for everybody, though, but overall tasty.  Nice as a beer food for the salt content, fellow sippers. The hot wings were hot (as in spicy) and cooked well.  Everything was sharable, too.   We did have chips and salsa, and it was also very authentic tasting.  We munched on these as we chatted and drank the evening away. For my beer fans, they have a nice variety on tap for the avid beer drinker, some locals mircros (Philadelphia Brewing Co, for example) that have nice flavors; plus the pilsner, pale ales, lagers, all on tap for ya. Although I was treated by a friend, the prices are reasonable for the portions. We sat at the bar to be casual and close to the beer, but I digressed and  had a margarita, because the flavor of the day was strawberry.  It had a nice punch and it was on special during happy hour, so why not, right? (Happy Hour is 5 pm-7pm) They have outdoor seating, but it was beer (i mean 'ritas) and AC for me, people! Ended up that we hung out and watched some sports in between bites, then proceeded to chat and chew the night away.  Since it is a "tapas" style menu, I would like to go back and try some of the ribs (since the Pig Wings were sooo yummy) and some of the more Mex side. NIce, leisurely, and tasty. I am a fan and would love to return in the near future.
