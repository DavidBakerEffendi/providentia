A new favorite place for dinner.  Been here a couple of times, now.  The food is well prepared, with good produce and quality ingredients.  The menu is pretty straight forward, which I like in general. however, a lot of dishes have an interesting combination of ingredients that mix flavors in a subtle, enjoyable, and sometimes surprising way.  The chef deserved the accolades.  Good service, nice space.  A bit on the pricey side. I would definitely come back again at the next opportunity.
