Walked to the cart after the SNL show.  Let me tell you, the food here was worth waiting in the pouring rain for.  The line was not too bad although I heard it can get pretty crazy. The food..Oh my, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Soo soo delicious.  Make sure you add this on your "Things to Do List".  I could fly to NY everyday for this meal!
