So glad there's a place like this in the neighborhood. Great decor, food was also good. I've had the steak/fries, crab cakes and ribs and all were really good, especially the ribs. The entrees are a little pricey for the area. For two people (1 entree, 2 apps and 2 drinks), the total was about $65. I'd go again, but I think I'd skip the drinks to save some money.
