Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh? This is Haitian cuisine done in an exquisite fashion. Hailing from an Haitian background, note to everyone this isn't, the place you come that gives you absurd amount of food. That is something that I have come to be accustomed to. This is where you bring your date, a bottle of wine. And comment on the interesting Caribbean décor. Hope your French is up to par, if not rock it in Creole. The owner constantly spoke in French, bit pretentious. That being said, I have to admit I liked it. It's about time there is a little class added to the black hole known as Haitian Cuisine. Not put it all to Krik Krak in the UWS, NY, to demonstrate the upscale factor. So was Haitian New Years to celebrate we eat a "soup joumou," A squash soup..  So some friends tagged along, soup was our mission. Alas the soup was lacking here was more of just the broth. Was pretty expensive in terms of what I was used too. The owner tried his best to accommodate. He added noodles and some beef to try to spark it up so. My friends that have had the same were a bit disappointed but sheer enthusiasm of the owner made us content. "And big up to my french vanillas Parlez vous, francais, mi amore, merci, oui oui, bon bons and all that good stuff"
