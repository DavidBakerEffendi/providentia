There are several things from my trip to New York a few months back that I feel I will chasing for something as good for the rest of my life.  Momofoku's pork buns are one of them.  I had never had pork buns before.  However, I have now had them elsewhere several times since, but no where else has come remotely close.   I will ever love my friend for taking us here on our trip to New York.  The three of us shared several dishes and everything was amazing.  The pork buns are definitely the star here.  Both the buffalo and steamed buns are great.  Tender amazing pork belly in a perfectly light steamed bun. I am serious, I dream about them.  We also had diver scallops, I love scallops in all forms and this is a great one.  The sardines on toast were also great, my husbands now orders this everywhere as well, none have been as good as well. The service was great, the environment was great, and the drinks are great as well.  The food is the star.  Next time I am in New York I will definitely be back and will probably try another Momofoku restaurant if I don't come here for every meal.
