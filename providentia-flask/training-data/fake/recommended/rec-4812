Heard major hype, but was still satisfied with my burger! I had the Truffle Speciale- it's like the truffle burger with a runny egg on top. Medium rare, of course. We also got 3 kinds of fries (no big deal): regular, sweet potato, and loaded. My friends and I agreed that they were delicious, and the 3 sauces that come with it complement them very well. Only downside is that there's a decent wait. By 8-8:30 there was at least an hour for a table on a week day.
