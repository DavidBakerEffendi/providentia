Just eating Tori-Shin the two days before I was very impressed with this place. The idea of the grilling was pretty cool but I feel bad for the two people who have to grill. Watching them jump back and forth over the grill even got me tired. Overall I thought this place was overpriced, and the food not worth it for the price. The tiny fishes were about $20+ each and way overpriced. Another downfall is that we can't even see the people grilling the food. It's like a mystery what type of grill is down there. I don't think I'd return just because this place is out of my budget.
