I don't mean to sounds crass, but you would think that it's nearly impossible to fuck up french fries.  But, plenty of places prove that it's not only possible, but elevated to some difficult to attain pinnacle of fucked uptedness (not a word) heretofore unseen. Fortunately, Pommes Frites has figured out that it's not rocket science.  Good potatoes, good oil, and a concern with respect to dressing is all you really need.  Of course, if you're going to make just one thing you had better be sure you consistently make that one thing pretty spectacularly.  Pommes Frites is able to deliver the goods on their french fries each time. I've written this before, and I will write it here again.  French fries are super bad for you.  They deliver flavor wrapped carcinogens with every bite and enough cholesterol to fill your veins with butter.  Your poor heart is not going to thank you, innocent NYU student, when you're getting that Bill Clinton special quadruple bypass in 30 years because you got addicted to cheap-plentiful french fries while living in the village as an undergrad. But, alas, college is the time for experimentation on many levels.  Might as well beat your heart up literally whilst you do it symbolically.  What's the point of living in NYC if you can't indulge in a little decadence now and then?
