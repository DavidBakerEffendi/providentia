All of the dishes that we had were just excellent. As a party of six, I'm pretty sure we ordered almost everything on the menu. Some recommendations are: 1. Nan Pizza 2. Gnocchi 3. Bean Tower The chef came out for us and made our experience even more delightful. It's nice to see someone with so much passion realizing their dream. Take advantage of it, your stomach will thank you!
