I have been to this restaurant numerous times and every time it has been a delicious and satisfying culinary adventure. Surfish offers exquisitely prepared, Peruvian delights, in a friendly, Bistro setting.  The place is a tad small but it is warm and inviting with a menu that is a compelling  combination of traditional Peruvian dishes and novel experiments that take the flavors of Peru to new places. In particular, I am in love with their Ceviche menu.  You have to go for the Ceviche tasting, in which you may select any 3 Ceviches from the 12 or so varieties.  We had the seared white tuna with ponzu ceviche sauce, avocado and red onions, the mussels with red onions, tomatoes, corn and red pepper aioli, the octopus in  kalamata olive aioli, the toro with avocado mousse, capers and soy-lime sauce, the oysters with tangy tiger's milk, and the grilled salmon skewers.  All were heavenly, sharp, delicate, fresh and rich.   Wonderful. After thoroughly enjoying the Ceviches, accompanied by a couple of glasses of Sancerre (a tad too fruity, but just fine with the meal), I followed with the traditional Peruvian soup, known as Chupe.  It was simply heaven on earth.  Perfectly prepared shrimps, just barely seared so that that they had a snap to them, hot corn nuts, peas, lemon essence and rice, swimming in a red pepper cream broth, and  topped with a fried egg.  So savory, so complex and delicious.  A must try.  My wife had the tomato and mango salad, which was peppery and tart, and set off perfectly by the sweet mango chunks. Things that could be better - the drinks menu could be more expansive - you can only order wine, beer or sangria, and the service is uneven, though very friendly: long waits, followed by rushes of food, people who arrived after us served before us, etc...  The garden area is nice but cramped and the tables in the garden area are rickety, endangering your beverages.   Yet to try: their new, fabulous looking Peruvian Brunch menu!
