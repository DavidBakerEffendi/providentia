Came for brunch over the weekend and the only request we put on the open table reservation was "comfortable." Well, they didn't disappoint because we got a nice table with nice leather chairs. The food was really good too, I got a burger with fries. I tried the pancakes as well and what I really liked about them is they weren't heavy at all, perfect thickness and tasted really fresh. I also had a couple bloody mary's and they come in pretty large sized mason jars which is nice. No one likes getting drinks and they come out in tiny cups Lol.
