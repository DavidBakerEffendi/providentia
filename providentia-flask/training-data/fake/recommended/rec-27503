I am so impressed!  I suggested Il Bambino for dinner and drinks and my friend was like ehh about it when we got there.  However, we had a few Allagash wheat beers and the proscuitto, basil pesto, and parmesan crostini and it was SO delicious we decided to stay for dinner.  I had the same ingredients as above panini with extra proscuitto, and my friend had the italian sausage, hot peppers, and fontina panini and oh my goodness, they were both DELICIOUS.  Seriously the photos do this place no justice, I was highly impressed.  Additionally to really top it off, they have a nice outdoor seating in the back with very friendly waitstaff.  Loved this place!!
