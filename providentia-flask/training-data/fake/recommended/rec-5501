Nom Nom Ramen is situated in the heart of Center City. However, this isn't a fancy place. The menu is short and to the point. There are some appetizers and 3 different ramen soup bases that could come in 2 different sized bowls (regular or large). You can also opt to add more ingredients - additional pork belly, a soft-boiled egg, bean sprouts, other veggies - at an additional cost. Nom Nom Ramen still ranks 3 stars, in my opinion, because a true ramen house is not fancy by any means. A good ramen place depends how good the soup bases are and how fresh the ramen is. I have never been disappointed with the quality of the ramen noodles. There is a good balance soft and al dente when I devour the ramen. The two soup bases that I always get are (regular) miso or karai miso (spicy). There are times when I find that the soup base is a bit too salty (which is why I'm giving 3 stars instead of 4). This place gets packed during lunchtime, but at least the turnover is pretty quick here. I mean, it should not take you longer than 20 minutes to eat a bowl of ramen. And you usually get your ramen within 3-5 minutes after ordering. I prefer to get here around 1pm during the weekdays so I can avoid the lunch hour craze. There usually isn't a busy time during the weekends. So just remember - the service here is nothing to rave about; cash only; fast turnover.
