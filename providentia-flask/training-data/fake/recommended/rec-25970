Went 2 times to this place, my friends ate I just had a beer. Friends liked it, my complain is about the staff! The owner should pay more attention to this. I asked for a beer never got it had to ask to another waiter & another day we try to eat but the same waiter that never got my beer told us that they were only serving drinks, no food! So I called them & they say yes that they were serving food, I went back to confront her & she acted all stupid. If u tired & u don't like ur job, GET ANOTHER JOB!!
