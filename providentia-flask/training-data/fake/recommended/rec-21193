The lunch special is very good and cheap.  Chicken is 6.90 and comes w/ jasmine rice and an appetizer. I've gotten several appetizers, pad see ew, pad thai and ginger chicken. The ambiance is most fancy than the other Thai restaurants in Hell's Kitchen.  You can still dress casual, but the actually restaurant is nice.  There are lots of chandeliers.
