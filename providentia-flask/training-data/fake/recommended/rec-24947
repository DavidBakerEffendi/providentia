Second time coming to Blue and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Make sure you save room for dessert! The cheesecake is homemade and pairs extremely well with the pistachio gelato. The only thing I would suggest is dress a little bit more fancy but still casual, just no tank tops! They won't let you sit in the dining room with one on.
