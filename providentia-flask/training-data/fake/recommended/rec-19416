Well, my bf and I were going to eat here for his birthday (a Sunday night) and off we went. The place is the size of a shoebox. Seriously. It is one of the smallest restaurants I have ever seen. Considering Jose Garces opened this post Iron Chef, what's his excuse? Anyway, we were informed it would be a half hour wait and had to give them our name (OK) and cell phone (odd). We were, of course, asked if we would like to sit at the bar. We went back, sidled passed a waiter or two and quickly realized there was absolutely no seating at the bar. I told the hostess we would be having a drink elsewhere, and to please keep our name on the list. So, we went and had a beer elsewhere, and about a half hour later, I asked my BF if his phone had rang at all. It had not. He called VW and was informed that they had called. We went back to VW and the hostess chirped that it was their policy to call twice. I said I had a hard time believing that as my bf's phone showed no missed calls, no messages, nothing. She said we could wait another half hour, if we liked. I almost told her to go eff herself. My bf used their bathroom and we went to Standard Tap instead. So the 1 star is for their total lack of space and lame waiting list procedure. The food I saw looked good though. Maybe I will go on a Monday at 4:00 or something.
