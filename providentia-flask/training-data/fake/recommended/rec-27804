My boyfriend and I went to Alta for our Valentine's Day dinner and had a fantastic experience. We're not overly "romantic" people but wanted something with a cozy, charming atmosphere, and Alta definitely delivered. We sat downstairs in the main room near the fireplace which was great! The room had a laid back but elegant vibe. As for the food, everything we tried was delicious! I think my favorite dishes were the mussels, avocado relleno and shrimp risotto. We washed it down with the red sangria which was wonderful. I'm knocking off one star cause the service could have been better. However, I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to a friend. Especially a friend going on a date!
