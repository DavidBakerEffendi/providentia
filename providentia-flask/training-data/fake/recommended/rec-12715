Does the idea of watching yourself use the toilet in a full-length mirror do anything for you? If so, you may want to come here. I don't know why the chandelier is mentioned so often; this is far more interesting. The room service pad thai was pretty decent--thin glass noodles with large tasteless shrimp in a kind of sourish red sauce wrapped in a sheet of egg. I would probably just go for the straight up American pad thai next time if looking for satisfaction. The tuna tartare with fried wonton chips was good.
