I've been wanting to check out the Portland location since reading about it on Bon app's most impt restaurants list. Finally made it to the NYC Pok Pok. The food was yummy. MUST eat family style to try lots of different things! Pretty much everything is spicy. (I liked this. Boyfriend did not.) the chicken wings are stellar. I LOVED that I didn't know what ANYTHING was on the menu. pok pok really introduces you to a whole new dimension of Thai food! Honestly, I have to admit that I'm not dying to go back again. However, the food was good and I'm glad I experienced it! A few negatives: the server didn't really provide much guidance. She seemed like she couldn't be bothered to answer our questions about the menu, which was very unfamiliar to us. Also, she didn't tell us the water (which appeared to be normal water) was flavored with pandam until I asked. I think this is concerning given the prevalence of food allergies.
