I used to work and live right nearby and now that I moved away, I miss this place terribly.  One of the rare gems in Brooklyn Heights, a Brooklyn neighborhood that can't seem to get its culinary stuff in order.   The space is cozy, dark, and somewhat modern looking.  The tables are scattered throughout the small space, but not too close together so you aren't on top of each other.  Lunch is a bargain whether you order a box, entree, or the sushi specials - $8 for 2 rolls or $10.50 for 3 - which all come with soup or salad and may sound quite ordinary, until you have a taste and fall in love.  House special rolls are also very reasonable for the quality of the fish. Dinner is definitely more hectic.  So make sure you come before the rush if you don't want to wait, which gets to be unpleasant when you are out in the cold, as there's no real space to stand.   The ladies who serve you work hard, friendly, adept, and know how to treat a regular.  Sushi crafters are also diligent in readying your oh-so DELISH and FRESH and TASTY!
