They say great things come in small packages. I think people need to rethink how they view food. Small plates are an amazing way to share a meal and really savor what you're eating. Mistral does an excellent job with their plates; they come out fast and pace with your eating speed. The waiters are incredibly knowledgeable and always happy to provide suggestions and explanations on the sometimes not so familiar ingredients. Lovely space and perfect for a date night.
