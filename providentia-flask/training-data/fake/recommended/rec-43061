So finally I did get a chance to go to Cafe Orlin. Just as I expected, a very laid back, dim, and wonderfully nice place to wine and dine. Minus the wine, since I'm not a wine drinker. Psshaw. I went there on a date, and what a wonderful date it was. The good thing about Cafe Orlin is that they are open 24 hours on Friday and Saturday. So, that being said, it's nice and empty when you're there on a date until 4 in the morning. During this past week, I went there twice. The first time I didn't really eat much, but I had a very delicious almond cappuccino. The next time I went, I actually did eat and had a very delicious Spaghetti with Rosemary tomato sauce. It was very very good. I'd definitely recommend it. The whole atmosphere is just very calm and dim. That is the main reason why I enjoy going there. It's the perfect place for a date.
