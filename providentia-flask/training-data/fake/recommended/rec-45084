The first time I went here was on a Friday night, needless to say it was packed and I had no reservation. The hostess was really sweet and offered us the bar after a few people were seated at their table. We were a party of 2 looking for a great bottle of wine and a few apps, so the bar was perfect. They have a nice wine list and the food is great! always interesting specials and if you're splitting apps, they split them for you! We had a lamb pappardelle and scallops, they split them so we both had our own plate. Oh yes also try the oysters if they have them, they usually have a great mignonette with them! I like the atmosphere here; big windows, dim lighting, lots of movement and typical restaurant noise. Staff was very nice and accommodating. I'll definitely make it a Â regular spot until they give me a reason otherwise.
