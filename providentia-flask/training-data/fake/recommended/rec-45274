My husband and I ended up here on accident. At first we were a little reluctant to eat here, in fact we almost left because our server did not come to help us for 15 min we sat waiting. But we just sat it out and we were happy we did because the food was awesome! We both ordered the fish and chips. DELICIOUS! We probably could have shared one order because it was huge.
