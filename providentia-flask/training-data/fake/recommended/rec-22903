I went here yesterday for brunch and was very happy with my meal. I got eggs Benedict, but did it vegetarian style instead with spinach. The eggs Benedict is delicious, I do think they should offer vegetarian menu options but nice to know they were happy with substituting. The prices are decent and the service was great. I was very happy the owner was also the host and came over to our table to see how our meal was. I will definitely be back on my next trip to Philly.
