As a Newark resident I am always excited to hear about new restaurants opening, we heard about Alva Tavern and decided to give it a try.  From the staff, drinks, and food, everything was fantastic.  Our bartender was attentive but not overwhelming, every drink we ordered from the cocktail menu he took a lot of time preparing and you could tell they really cared about pouring a good drink.  We ordered the burger and lobster roll for dinner.  The burger was cooked perfectly and the fries were amazing, the lobster was good quality and was great as well.  The restaurant itself was really impressive and they did a great job preserving the old building that they occupy.  It seemed that they basically built the restaurant around the old bank vault that was there and you can still see the old vault door with the marble that surrounded it, the bartender said they make the pizzas in the vault now.  Overall it was a nice experience and I really hope this place picks up and does well.  We will definitely be back, tell your friends and go there!!
