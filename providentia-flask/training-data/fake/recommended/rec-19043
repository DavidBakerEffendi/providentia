My boyfriend is old school Brooklyn. So much still that when I show him places I'd like to try in certain parts of the borough, he'd look at me like I'm crazy and ask why would I want to venture into that neighborhood? 20 years ago Red Hook was far from being that neighborhood on your "to visit" list but after a visit to the nearby IKEA, he opened up to the idea of trying some of the nearby eats. With Red Hook Lobster Pound in the game, this luxurious crustacean can be enjoyed yet again. Though the frugalista in me still cringes at paying premium for something that costs $6/lb at the market and is basically steamed, RHLP offers one of the best lobster rolls in NYC for its fair pricing* and the simplicity of its preparation. Whether you prefer your rolls Connecticut style drizzled with warm butter or the cold Maine style roll that uses just enough mayo without drowning out the sweet lobster meat's, you'll be delighted to enjoy this treat without having to drive hundreds of miles up the east coast. Make your experience complete by downing a bottle of Maine blueberry soda! RHLP is a great light lunch option if you're in the area or willing to make the trek to Red Hook. I wouldn't recommend it for dinner as this small girl can easily down 2-3 rolls in one sitting. I have to wonder though.. what do they do with all the tail meat since my rolls were all claw and knuckle meat? ---------------------------------------------- *$15 for a lobster roll, a bag of chips, and half a pickle
