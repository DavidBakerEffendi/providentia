Anella has taken over the spot previously occupied by Queens Hideaway.  I had walked by the latter many times but was alway turned away by the decrepit decor and insane prices.  Anella is an improvement leaps and bounds over Queens Hideway.  The pricepoint is 100% accurate for the Greenpoint area and very reasonable considering the excellent quality of the ingredients.  We had the farm greens, margherita pizza, scallops, mashed potatoes, and roasted vegetable.  The pizza needs work (too soggy) but the greens, scallops, and sides were awesome.  You can taste the freshness in the ingredients.  Service was not that great.  Our server was slow and the bussers were clumsy but I am sure that this will improve as the place has been open for only two days.
