Bottom line- this is a new place. I like what they are trying to do but they are not quite there yet. Â I'd suggest going for happy hour because they have some decent deals. I've been twice and could complain about some stuff but again I will reserve judgment (and 1 star) for a month or so and see if they work out their kinks.
