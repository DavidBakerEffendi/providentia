Just finished my blackened chicken burrito and shrimp quesadilla. Burrito was prob the 3rd best burrito I've ever had, the tops was at La taqueria on 7th ave in Brooklyn, my hometown. The quesadilla was just O K, but was fresh as can be. Â Will return! They are super friendly, the place is cute and cheery, and they are a great addition to the not so great sushi bars that dominate South Orange. I just read a few reviews that say the burritos are small and need more seasoning. Not everyone wants salty, gigantic burritos. I shared my burrito with a visitor and my husband and everyone was satisfied...the size is more than adequate...for those that comprehend the surgeon general's portion size recommendations.
