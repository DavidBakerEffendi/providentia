Been meaning to try Riverpark since it opened around fall last year. Finally went last night for restaurant week. It wasn't as hard to find as most people reviewed. The view from the restaurant is really nice. The space is sleek and modern. I really like the cube decoration on the ceiling. As the sunset, they started to twinkle like stars. Â  We had the best server, Jamal. He was so friendly and accommodating. We had oyster in a half shell and cavatelli to start (i loved the touch of mint). Next was the squid ink chitarra and berkshire pork chop (recommended by jamal). For dessert we had lemon steamed pudding and the beignets. I'm not big on desserts but these were really good. There was a good selection of wine. I definitely will be back to try the dishes on the regular menu.
