Really good place for the price! As a college student, Say Cheez is definitely one of my go-to's the Mac & Cheese is good and it's my favorite sandwich there. I would stay away from the fries because they're not the best and get soggy quickly but everything else is worth trying. The owners are really nice and they really appreciate their customers. Now I'm just hoping for a Westminster sandwich to be added on the menu and represent all of the Princeton Community :) . Come give it a try!
