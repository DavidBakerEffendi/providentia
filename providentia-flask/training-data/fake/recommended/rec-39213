A great stop on the way home after river tubing in Connecticut all day. We were all so hungry when we arrived! We were greeted right away by a kind and enthusiastic woman and waited on by a friendly, attentive gentleman. The appetizers ordered: egg roll, scallion pancake, vegan spare ribs, cold sesame noodles, hot and sour soup and vegan wonton soup were served incredibly fast and all tasted fresh and delicious. Note: three of the four in our party are not vegan, but we are all open to it. I must say, the flavors and consistency were not lacking in any way. Our entrees were assorted vegan chicken sesame and vegan garlic beef. By the point we got them we were pretty full from the array of appetizers, but all were quite good. The only negative I'd say is the sauce used on the entrees were a little thick and salty and left us pretty thirsty. Oh we also had decent scorpion bowls with our meal too! On the way out the woman at the counter thanked each of us with a big smile. A great find during our day trip away from Providence!
