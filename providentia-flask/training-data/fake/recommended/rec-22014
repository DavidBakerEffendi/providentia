Service is pretty bad except for Tim, ask for him for awesome service! Food was really good and they serve Heady Topper which is definitely a plus. View is pretty good, you can see the lake but also a lot of other buildings not to bad though. Little side tip if your server looks like Posh Spice just ask for another server she was horrible all the other servers seemed pretty cool. Tim is by far the best and most engaging.
