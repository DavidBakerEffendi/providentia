This place has amazing potential.  I love its location and everyone working there is super friendly and offers up great consistent service. The specials are usually creative and tasty.  I think they always have a special sandwich which has knocked it out of the park for me the two times I've gone with their creation of the day. The pizza is thin and light; utilizing fresh ingredients and tasty combinations.  I wish they would get a little more consistent with the "done-ness" of the pies.  The first time I had the pizza it could have been left in the oven about 2 minutes longer and it would have become pizza perfection.  The second time they hit the nail on the head and the crust was perfectly done: not too mushy and not to burnt...it was that desirable middle ground that's the best for the crust and the flavors of all the toppings.  The third time I went, the crust was back to being a little more on the mushy side.  I have faith that they will perfect their crust technique! Super props to their main chef who makes her own gelato on-site in a teeny tiny gelato maker.  My boyfriend and I tried the salted caramel and it was DIVINE. I would recommend this up and coming pizza place to anyone and everyone!
