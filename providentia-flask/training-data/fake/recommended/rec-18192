This is my favorite bar. True, it is only a block away from my house and true, I am an extremely lazy person, but still, I really believe this place can also survive on its own merits. First, the beer selection. Always pretty diverse, and pints of Kenzinger are three dollars once you are done with the rare vos. I think the growler pricing is kind of absurd (charge by the pint per growler, so 5 pints x 5 dollars or so for a pint of good beer, uch) but really that is my only complaint. 6 pack takeout is reasonably priced. City wide special is a tallboy of Naragansett and a shot of powers.The food. The food is great, but I think they should leave some of the items on the menu rather than rotating everything else out except the sardine sandwich. The open faced chicken is my favorite thing to eat right now. For the last month I have had it twice a week. Â Sage Mushroom gravy, roasted chicken, mashed potatoes on a piece of toasted bread. It is the most comfortable comfort food ever. Walt wit braised pork si also excellent. Brunch! Brunch here is also great. Anyway. I promise you will not be disappointed if you come here. I swear. Write me if you are and I will come to ASB and you'll buy me a beer and we'll figure it out.
