The paninis are to die for! Very authentic and fresh, and reasonably priced. My favorites are the prosciutto/fresh mozzarella/sun-dried tomato pesto and chicken cutlet/spicy mayo/arugula. These aren't like your typical Manhattan deli "pressatas" where they use the flatbread with tuna or chicken parm or roast beef. These are the real deal. Go eat one. There are vegetarian ones too. Do it! edit 3-2-08: this place is still kickin', sooo glad to see them doing well. we go here quite regularly now and have their coffee, a panini, or tapas.
