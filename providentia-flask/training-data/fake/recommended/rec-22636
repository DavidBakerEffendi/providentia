This is a great hangout place; very relaxed and excellent service. We were in the yard during the day with friends and their kids. The kids were not agitated because they were not in an enclosed dark space. My husband really liked the cider options. I really liked the fried pickles. The other food (mostly dogs) choices were okay.
