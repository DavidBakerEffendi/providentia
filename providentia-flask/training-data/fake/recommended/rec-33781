Lots of food served piping hot. Eat with your fingers so if you don't have hands it could be problem. 7 courses. The spicy chicken and salad tray were our favorites. Went with group of nine and we were all stuffed at the end. We had 4 bottles of wine but the bill was reasonable. I did not think the Moroccan wine was the best. It was ok but for the price we could have had 2 bottles of a better red. Belly dancer was great and got everyone involved. I taught her a few new moves. Surprise at the end was when the bill came they only took cash! Maybe that was prominent on their web site but I missed it.
