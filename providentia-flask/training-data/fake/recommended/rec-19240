Thanks Tommy for being there to greet us and give us way too many sandwiches! I came here with my friends for a fun trip to Philly. I honestly didn't know what to expect. I have had cheesesteaks before, but I guess they were not very authentic. Granted, I probably don't want to have another cheesesteak ever again after this ... but regardless it was awesome! We waited in the long long line, which is way worth it, and got to meet one of the owners who took a photo with us. He generously loaded us up with cheesesteaks before telling us about all the great eatries in Philly. Who knew Philadelphia was food heaven? I have to say though, if I were to come back I'd only stick with one kind of meat. The other ones give it a variety of interesting flavors that are not as traditional to me. Loved it!
