Nothing Beats Charlie Benanti's. Charlie is the best.,Old school, friendly and is there to make sure you are happy. He makes you feel welcomed. Cheese's are great.. Fresh mozzarella can't be beat & the Sicilian cheese with black pepper is incredibly fresh. Charlie's sauce is just "simply" fantastic. His meatballs are a taste of paradise. Plenty of oils, vinegar's, peppers, tuna's and authentic products and pasta's to choose from. An overall nostalgic and magnificently delicious experience.
