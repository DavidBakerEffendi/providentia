I finally made it to the infamous Umami Burger. I heard about this place and their truffle fries for a couple of weeks now. So here's the deal... THE WAIT TIME - Yes, there's a line. I went around 8pm on a Saturday night, and saw somewhere around 25 people waiting out front. We heard the hostess telling people the wait was around 35 minutes. We Â couldn't wait so left to go watch a friend's band play at another venue, and returned around 9:30pm after the show. This time there were maybe 6 people waiting out front, but again hostess said 35 minutes. We chose to just sit at the bar and have our burgers there and not wait at all. Once we got upstairs, we saw more than 5-6 tables available. Weird. Inaccurate? It's no secret that businesses love lines out front to attract crowds, but hey I'm just saying. It's not like I've never seen that before. Moving on... FOOD- I'm not a huge burger fan, mostly bc I think they are so filling and I could never finish my meal. This was not the case at Umami. Portions were perfect and I actually finished my burger. I had the "Truffle Burger" and while it was very good, I found it to be overly greasy compared to my boyfriend's "The Original" burger. Overall, the burgers are juicy and bursting in flavor. Quality over quantity! We went for the truffle fries and they were delish. I guess I had high expectations but was not blown away. I would've probably rated it a 3 but compared to other burger spots, Umami rates way above average. If Shake Shack had a classier, fancier, richer, more creative older sister...Umami would be her name. I'm likely to return when I'm craving a good burger.
