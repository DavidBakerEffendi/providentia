Went in today and got 2orders to go. Skirt Steak and Breaded Chicken breast Both dishes were excellent and I couldn't wait to eat them. The drive home was only 5 mins but the smells coming from their food made it seem like an eternity. Portions are large and prices are great. All the food are great seasoning and tasted authentic. Also both the red and black beans were excellent with the white rice. I'm definitely going back!!
