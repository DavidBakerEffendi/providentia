A NYC must! I always get the elote and the shrimp tacos. The wait is totally worth it, so definitely wait it out if you must. It may seem a little cramped inside, but it definitely is an experience go eat elbow to elbow with a complete stranger :) a part of New York charm! The workers are a bit sensitive with the waiting list, so just be patient; your time will come.
