I hate the disconnect between how I feel about a place and how I want to feel about a place. I've been passing this very forthcoming spot since I got here, and tonight in a dinner-seeking desperation, I stopped in. It's clear that in a past life, this place was a garage, but if you didn't see the outside, you'd never guess. It's very clean, I'll give them that. Sadly, that's pretty much their only saving grace. I got a falafel sandwich with everything except the hot sauce, natch, and was disappointed to see that that meant including pickles on there too. I'm a strong disbeliever in pickles on a sandwich. Yes, that makes me a horrible southerner for not liking the traditional "chicken sandwich" as I grew up knowing it. I care not. Maybe it's because this is my first time eating falafel and I just plain don't like it, but my stomach has not been happy with me ever since ingesting this messy amalgamation of condiments and dry carbs. Oh, one more thing: the veggies are super fresh. I enjoyed that part... marginally. My best advice is go in knowing exactly what you want, exactly how you want it. Hummus may not share the Soup Nazi's curtness in customer service (in fact, the cashier was very friendly), but it's definitely a beast you want to familiarize yourself with before going into battle. No falafel for me!
