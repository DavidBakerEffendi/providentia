I LOVE this place. Came here with a few friends for the first time... The wait staff are always so friendly, and the food is always amazing. My favorite thing to get there is the tempura green beens with spicy mustard on the side!!! I actually liked it so much the first time, I came back 2 days later with my mom! Definitely recommend! :)
