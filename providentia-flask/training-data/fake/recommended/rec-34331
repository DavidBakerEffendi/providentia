I have been there 4 times First was opening night which was good considering it was opening night but I will give an overall comment on the place in general. SERVICE::  Jen Andrew and a blonde (didn't get name)  ALL were great!  Very nice and attentive.   Bus boys were FABULOUS!  Kept a clean table PRICES :: Can't beat them.  I do not think you can get a cheaper beer in town.  Food all reasonable.  It's a place that you can go to a few times a week and not feel like you broke the bank. SCENE::  Tons of TVS  Great place to watch sports, lots of room at the bar to go a few rows back and still see any of the tv's in the place.  Good looking crowd... I did not feel like the youngest person in the place.  Age (32)  Some places in Fairfield I feel like I am dining with my grandparents. SPACE::  All the tables have a good amount of space between them.  Accommodate strollers and high chairs.  I read a previous review and am confused cause the person said the hostess stand was not at the door.  The hostess stand IS the first thing you see when you walk in.  The door they are talking about has big letters on it that says PLEASE USE OTHER DOOR.  I think that is the area where people can go outside to smoke.  Again... I only know this from being there 4 times.   WAIT::  First night waited 30 minutes, 2nd trip no wait, 3rd trip no wait, 4th trip we were a party of 9 on a Saturday night with a reservation and had NO wait.  That was impressive!   FOOD:: Turkey Burger my favorite.. Montclair Salad my husband's favorite.  NACHOS  DELICIOUS!!!!   Red Velvet Cake.. YUMMY! Overall.... check it out!  It's a new place in town and worth a trip to make your own opinion!
