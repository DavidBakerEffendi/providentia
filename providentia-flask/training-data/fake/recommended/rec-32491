This deli is pretty popular. It's always packed around lunchtime. It's best to show up before 11:30am or expect to spend most of your lunch hour waiting in line. Don't go late or all the good stuff will be gone! The popularity is justifiable. Service is friendly and their sandwiches are great. I'm a big fan of their chicken cuttlet and their roast beef. But it's their buffalo chicken on Thursdays that most of my coworkers go crazy for. Highly recommended if you work in downtown Hartford.
