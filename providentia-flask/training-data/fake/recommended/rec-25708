Pros: great tots and the monkey bread was perfect. Although we didn't get a Bloody Mary, the concept of the customized menu was interesting, and they looked delicious. Overall the food was good but not stellar. Cons: we waited 45 minutes to be seated for brunch, and the host sat his friends as soon as they walked in. The only place to wait was up against other tables which was uncomfortable for the people waiting and eating. When we were finally seated it was so cold by the door that we ate with our coats on. The waitress was very nice but had tables all over the restaurant so we barely saw her. It's a great concept but poorly executed.
