i think it was Nafeesa who's review mirrors my sentiments.  Perhaps the only difference is I did not have any preconceived notions prior to going this this establishment.  I actually read the reviews after dinner and was wondering if they were as bland as my experience. I'll start with the good:  the drinks were decent.  whether alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks (i had something with ginger) i'd have to say they were good.  We dined in the back outdoor area it was a great day and didnt want to sit indoors so that's a plus.  the lamb breast  was only decent and that's where my train stops.  The nachos were just ok, felt like it was missing something....and where are the rest of the nachos?  felt like a kids meal.  same for the shishito, just ok nothing to write home about. I decided i would also try the chicken and waffles.  big mistake.  the waffles were fried, i think, and the chicken was super dry.   the proportions were pretty weird:  two small waffle pieces and hilariously large portions of chicken.  the waffles tasted like fried mulch.  as hungry as i was i couldnt eat the waffles.  they were terrible. lastly, the mashed potatoes....ah the mashed potatoes.  those were edible but still  pretty bad. Wiith all these great reviews i must be missing something but im not sure if i want to spend my time or money here again anytime soon.  Im easy to please, but this experience just didnt make the cut.  sorry.
