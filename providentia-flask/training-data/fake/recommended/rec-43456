There is a good chance that I have developed an allergy to fish, and the only reason I am upset (other than not being able to eat sushi..) is because of this restaurant. I try to avoid food involving fish in general (again, unless it's sushi..) but practically everything that comes out of the Blue Point Grill kitchen is delicious--and it's alll fish. If you're looking for some meat, dont bother. But if you want to enjoy some salmon, tuna, shark...any sort of edible fish, you should go here. The entrees arent huge but still fiilling (which i love because i dont leave the place feeling like i am going to puke from eating too much). There's always a long wait though, the main restaurant is only open for dinner--the little store to the left of the restaurant has lunch (sandwiches) though, and I dont think they take reservations. So if you have a lot of free time to wait for dinner and want some good fish--BPG is perfect.
