We came here after reading reviews from Yelp, and I can honestly say that myself and the two friends of mine who were traveling with me were seriously impressed.  None of us are strangers to Italian delis, but Belgiovine takes it to a new level.  Amazing subs, friendly and attentive staff, and ridiculously low prices I would have paid $20 for their capicola, mozz, and salami (#7), but it was only $6 and change.  Awesome!  I would drive 4 hours from Baltimore just to visit this place again, and I just might next weekend.
