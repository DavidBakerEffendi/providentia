We got a great waiter and awesome service. She was so polite and talkative. Our food Â came out surprisingly fast too. Only thing is after we finished our meal out waiter I got the linguini with meat sauce which came with a soup - chicken noodle - and a salad. He got a meatball parm sub. The soup was perfect. Salty and definitely home made, with chunks of carrots, celery, onions, plenty of shredded chicken bits, and lots of swirly noodles. It's so good I think I'm gonna order more to go. The salad was delicious with all sorts of leafy greens from spinach to arugula, lettuce, purple cabbage, purple onions, cherry tomatoes and cucumbers. The linguini was really delicious, with generous amounts of meat chunks. The tomato sauce tasted home made and had a yummy sweetness to it, with parsley, basil, onion bits & tomato chunks. We also got an appetizer of mozzarella sticks - it came with 6 and they were pretty good! The tomato sauce it came with was fresh and home made. My boyfriend said the meatball sub was very good, and he rated it a 9 out of 10. It came with French fries too which were thick cut and crispy and yummy goodness (of course I stole a bunch when he went to the bathroom).
