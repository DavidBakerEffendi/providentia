This will probably be the most unorthodox review ever but I gotta do it. I want to make it clear I have Not tried this place in a long time so I hope they are still as good as I'm going to explain!!! I used to go here at least once a week for lunch way back between the years.... here goes, 1989---1995... sorry, I haven't tried it since!! All I want to say is I will Never forget how good their Sicilian pizza was. Going there at lunchtime there was always a line, not just for Sicilian but that's what I got almost every time. What makes it so good?? At the time I used to go, Sal (one of the owners) explained they would partially cook the dough plain on the tray. Take it out, pop any bubbles, top it with 'some' delish sauce, bake it a little more. The last step was to top it with cheese, sauce and more sauce 'on top' of the cheese, bake it to a perfect 'crunchy bottom' work of art!!! Now, I haven't tried every single pizzeria in the world but maybe the extra step of letting the sauce seep into the dough first gave it that perfect crunch, yet not dry like so many other places? I have tried the 'reg thin crust' pizza but it never stood out enough for me to pass up... you guessed it, Sicilian. It kills me that none of the reviews I've read are about the Sicilian pizza? Can somebody try it for me or at least let me know if they don't make it anymore?
