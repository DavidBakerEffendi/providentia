Don't even bother eating at any of the other Halal carts in the city. This is THE Halal cart! $6 cash buys you a huge plate of rice and lamb. There's squeeze bottles on the right side of the cart (after you pay) of the white and red sauces. I usually use a lot of the white and a tiny bit of the red since it's very spicy. The plate for $6 is enough food to feed and fill 2 very hungry people. If you're eating alone, it's enough to bring home for another meal. This is my favorite place to eat when I'm in this area and it's totally worth the wait in line!!
