Needed a quick meal and the Panera next door had a line out the door.  Went into Taqueria, who doesn't love tacos.   Ordered the Veggie Tacos to go.  They have a salsa bar.. Grabbed some of the hot and medium avocado salsa.  Both on these tacos were delicious.   I would definitely go back on Taco Tuesday for more!  Four tacos for 5.95 seems a bit high but very good quality.  Taco Tuesday 5 Tacos for 5 dollars!!
