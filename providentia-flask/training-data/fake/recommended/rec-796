I've been going here for years, however, after my most recent visit I wont be anymore. I walked in and asked for a table for two. The host said she could seat me at a table in front of the door, It being cold I said " Okay, unless you have something else?" She told me she would look. She came back a minute later and told me she just had to clean it off, I said okay and waited. In the mean time the people that were behind us in line were given the first table we were offered. Then a second hostess comes up to us and ask for our name and say it's a 20 minute wait. I explained to her that the first hostess was cleaning a table for us now, to which she rudely replied, "no, I said its a 20 minute wait" I explained to her the situation and asked why the first table was given away if there was no other table for us and she gave me an attitude and said that the first hostess never said she was cleaning off a table. I work in the industry and I know what poor customer service is and they certainly have it!
