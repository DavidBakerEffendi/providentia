On our last evening in NYC, our friend told us about the Halal cart and how good the chicken and rice with white sauce is. She talked it up so much that we had to try it.  As we walked to the location, she pointed out imposter Halal carts which supposedly are not as good as the location at 53rd St. and 6th Ave.  I guess other people know that because there are few people in line for the imposter carts. We approached the real deal and there was a long line, but the line moves fast.  The chicken and rice also includes lettuce and pita bread. We asked for extra white sauce (not sure what it is, but it's good!) and you should too because it really makes the meal. The portions are generous (could easily be two meals) and only $6!  Given that we spent a lot of our money in NYC on food, it was nice to finally have a value meal that was quite good.  Extra bonus: that evening they were handing out Halal Guys tote bags which came in handy because my wife used it to carry her shopping bags aboard the plane.
