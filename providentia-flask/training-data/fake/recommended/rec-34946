Have you ever had Onion Buhjia by the light of a pale blue Miller Lite sign?  They won't give you any Miller Lite, but you can bring your own booze and expect there to be an opener and frosty glasses brought to you right away.  You might have to ask for tamarind sauce and you might stuff yourself full of papadum before you even order, but save room because the food is great.
