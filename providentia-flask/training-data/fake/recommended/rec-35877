I wanted to love our lunch more than I did.  We made a reservation and took our kids and had much better (cheerful even!) service than expected but the food was just ok.  Kids loved their burgers...husband had steak frites and I had the chicken paillard salad which was very disappointing (isn't chicken paillard supposed to have lemon and capers? This was a mild white wine sauce...no flavor).  Again though, great and friendly server (surprising w/2 kids) who brought crayons for the paper table covers and shirley temples that came with 2 cherries!
