we had the chicken sandwich and falafel sandwich with real homemade (i think) PITA bread that tasted like no other i've had before! it's not thick like the bagged grocery store kind that some places use. the 'hot sauce' is mild and delicious but if you want heat, ask for extra. outdoor patio is so cute. i want to go back and try the 'Pitzas' that they make right in front of you, hot and fresh!
