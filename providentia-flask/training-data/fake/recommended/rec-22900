Lombardi's is the best pizza In NYC! We had a large spinach pizza with extra pepperoni and extra mozzarella. It was delicious. We took the subway after a Yankee game and it was Â a perfect ending to our day in New York. Not to mention, the bartender was awesome! He makes great cosmos!!! Next time you are in little Italy, you must make a stop.
