I'm a huge Ishkabibble fan. As a huge french fry aficionado, the fries here are at the tippy top of my favorites list. I'm glad I don't live in Philly, I don't think I could resist eating here all the time... The place is small and can get a bit crowded and cramped, but the service is relatively fast for the demand. I have the pizza steak when I'm there, which is yum! The veggie cheese steak is also delish, as is the Gremlin drink. Prices are extremely reasonable as well. Those fries... oh man. Mmmm.
