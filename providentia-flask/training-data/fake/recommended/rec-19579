I couldn't believe it when a friend told me you could get hand-drawn noodles in Philly... yum... noodle soups (I'm partial to the beef and fish ball noodle soup) are tasty, filled with vegetables and have the proper noodle/vegetable/meat ratios - this is very key for noodle soups, in my book. With the knife-cut thick noodles, this is definitely the best bowl of noodle soup in town. If you're not feeling like soup, the jia jiang mian is also tasty. It doesn't quite make sense with the knife-cut thick noodles, so the server might look at you a little funny if you order it with the knife-cut noodles, like she did to me. If that sort of thing bothers you, just go with the regular thin noodles (more traditional for jia jiang mian). And if it's too crowded, or if you prefer to eat in the comfort of your own home, take-out is easy and they pack everything nicely (soup in large plastic containers and noodles separately so they don't get soggy).
