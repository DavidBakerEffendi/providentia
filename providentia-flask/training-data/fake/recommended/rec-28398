This place is so great. I had a Spicy Buck which was wonderful and a bourbon cocktail that was also solid. I tried a cask-aged Sazerac which was also great. They also give out free whiskey, which is never a bad thing, although our corn whiskey gave off some potent fumes and tasted pretty much the same as it smelled. As for the food, I enjoyed it all, particularly the scallop and watermelon salad. All in all a very pleasant place, not in my neighborhood but I'd love to return someday.
