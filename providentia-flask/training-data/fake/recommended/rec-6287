A weekend lunch at Juniper earlier this fall turned into a a game to test our levels of resourcefulness and patience. Test 1: How to sit in their outdoor garden without burning, as only 1 table out of 5 had an umbrella. We kept shifting toward the restaurant and took turns in the sun. We got to be human sundials! Test 2: How to eat a pot of mussels without utensils. I learned something new. You use one half of the mussel to loosen up the meat on the other half, and then enjoy. (Truth be told, they were quite yummy). Test 3: How long can you go without laughing at the granny panties hanging on the drying line of the apartment next door? Test 4: How long do we have to wait? Answer: forever o'clock. Our truffle burgers were okay; juicy but lacking in flavor. Fries were crispy and savory. Well, we passed all the tests with flying colors, although we felt defeated upon leaving. Service was kind, but slow (they were short-staffed, so this is forgivable). Juniper's final grade: 3 stars.
