I think this is a cool place...just miss-labeled. The restaurant is very rustic feeling.  The bar was a good place to grab a drink and watch the football game that was on. We went in excited for burritos and tacos and typical tex-mex mexican food that we so long for in Philly. Instead we found a lot of Bar-B-Que.  We did a big sampling of all the food and it wasn't bad.  We started with Margaritas and beer - can't go wrong there and the margs went down very easily.  The chips and salsa were great to start too. The bar-b-que pork was recommended to us, and it is very tasty.  The burritos were ok, but small portions and a little dry. Overall I would go back to hang out, but would rather eat across the road at Bar Ferdinand.
