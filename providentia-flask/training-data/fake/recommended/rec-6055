This place is the classic brunch spot. However, I went on a Friday morning for breakfast and it was probably just as good, although the menu items aren't as diverse/impressive. I got the Tunisian eggs just to mix it up a little and it was decent but nothing special. The home fries were very nicely seasoned, though, and I could've probably just eaten those for my meal. Freshly squeezed orange juice was on point - definitely get that. I would come again but for brunch next time.
