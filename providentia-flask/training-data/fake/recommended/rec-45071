Been trying to get reservations here for years - every time I call, they were "fully committed".  Now that I have a bit more time on my hands, I swung past by myself around noontime and nabbed a spot at the bar.  I'm often a bit skeptical of places with a serious cult reputation, but I had a seriously good lunch today.  Started with the meatball sliders - had to try the signiture item.  I was expecting to pronounce them good, but not great, but DAMN, they were great.  I wish I had ordered two plates, but I had the truffle oil risotto instead and was slightly disappointed - it just missed that special moment where creaminess and toothfeel reach perfection and was just a little bit starchy, if that makes sense.  Also, the meager truffle oil was overwhelmed by the parmesan cheese, although the flavor was still good anyway, just no truffle.   Anyway, the meatball sliders are the real deal.  Now I have to come back at night for the pork chop.
