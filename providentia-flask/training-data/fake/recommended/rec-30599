I'm not sure if the no reservation policy and 1.5 hour long wait is warranted. The food is definitely "comfort brunch" and very reasonably priced. I had the omelet (nothing special) and my friends had the seasonal pumpkin waffles (better) and apple cider mimosa (unique concept but mediocre taste). I enjoyed the environment and the homey feel. Sometimes, I feel like the food tastes better due to the package of the experience... long waits build anticipation. It's a very nice experience for brunch but beware of the wait, regardless of weather. I've been a few times for dinner and actually prefer the vege-burger and their house salad with country bread.
