came here on a thursday rainy afternoon and waited about 15 mins to get seated.. my friends and i ordered the truffle and original burgers. i asked for medium and was given medium rare. the meat was falling all over the place. definitely was not impressed with all the hype going on about this place. the only good thing about going that day was that we received 50% off our burgers because their buns were not up to par.. maybe i'll come back and try it again. their side dishes .. smashed potatoes, fried pickles, and thin fries with truffle seasoning were all tasty alongside with their sauces.
