The food here was good, just as good as any other Tapas place. Nothing which spelled Chef extraordinaire. I have nothing to say about the food or the alcohol and enjoyed both on my birthday. What cheesed me off was that they weren't too good about us having brought our child along. She is 2 and the calm sorts. She didn't scream, didn't throw a tantrum and ate her fries in all earnestness. If truth be told, it was thanks to the video she was watching. Everything was fine. No-one complained until the uptight man who seemed to be the manager came along. He look at her as he walked by and the next thing we know we were being told by our server to cut down the volume of the video and so on. It ruined my day when while leaving the place I felt as though I was being snubbed off when I was spoken to. I think when you go to a Iron Chef's restaurant, experience is key! Mine wasn't.
