Went with friends from work for lunch, good lunch spot - nice decor and funky background music, easy to relax, talk and unwind.  I had chicken panang curry, which was excellent, it had just the right amount of spice and creamy coconut milk.  My friends had the pad see ew (which she thought was just a little salty) and pineapple fried rice, which she thought was good.  Food tastes fresh, which makes it better than several other Thai places in the Hell's Kitchen area in my opinion.
