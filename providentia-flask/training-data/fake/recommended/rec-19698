The food here is ...... REMARKABLE DELICIOUS & SCRUMPTIOUS! I had the Grandma Eda's Meatloaf it was sooooooo GOOODDD! I even added their housemade hot sauce and it packed in the extra zing & kick, you people may like! The place is small I can say that, it's best to go early evening. But the food outweighs all the wait because I was very satisfied! The mac & Cheese is amazing. Just delectable! The bacon potato salad is just as great. The pricing is very reasonable and service great.
