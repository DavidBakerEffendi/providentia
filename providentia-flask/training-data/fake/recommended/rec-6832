I don't think I would necessarily go out of my way to return to this spot but I was happy with the mussels (shallots and white wine) and the onion soup. We were out shopping and wanted to grab a snack and drink before dinner so we walked in here at around 4pm. It was pretty packed but we had no problem getting a table. Seemed to have a good selection of beers and they had these cheaper versions of enomatic wine dispensers. They serve generous portions of mussels- they tasted great and were not overcooked. The onion soup was much better than the average we've had in NYC.
