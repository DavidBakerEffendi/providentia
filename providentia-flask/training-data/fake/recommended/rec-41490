Fun and cheap restaurant if you are craving for French fries! They sell only one kind of fries (Belgian style, that's to say thicker than your usual ones and double-fried) but several dozens of sauces to serve with (pesto mayo, parmesan and pepper, sundried tomato sauce...). You can opt for one of them ($1.5) or select 3 ($3.5). Ketchup, mayo, pickles and onions are free with the fries. This is more of a take-away place (and is open late, perfect for an afterparty craving!) so they only have a couple of tables in the back. I'd recommand sitting though - quite difficult to manage the fries and cups of sauces while walking!
