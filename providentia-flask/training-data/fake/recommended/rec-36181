Avocado toast! Enough said. I love coming here for brunch. Â It's a small restaurant so on a nice sunny day there can be a wait but I usually don't care. I love the avocado toast so much that I don't mind waiting a little for a table especially if I get one outside. I know you're thinking: "avocado toast, you can make this at home!" But for some reason mine are never as good as Cafe Gitane's.
