The food is excellent, the drinks are awesome, the decor is great. Word to the management of Devil's Alley, your wait staff are hit or miss on service. When we showed up on new years morning 2015 we were seated at the coldest seat in the house, right by the windows on the ground level. When we asked to be reseated further from the window the hostess told us those tables needed to be reserved for other guests. The table was slanted because of the melt plate and my left side was freezing the entire time. We were left waiting for our beverages after we ordered them and another staff member ended up asking if we had been served and we had to tell him we were waiting on our drinks. The meal took much longer to prepare and serve than I it normally does. I will keep coming back, but a word with your service staff is in order.
