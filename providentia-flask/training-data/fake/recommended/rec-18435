Flavorful food that was complicated blend of color, flavor and texture. The portion was good if you are on a diet or controlling your food intake. Dont go very hungry, you will feel it was not enough. I had the mahi mahi with brown rice in thai curry and it was good. I felt the salt was low but just slightly. The rice with veggies in it felt good as it seemed to be a well balanced meal with good proportion of carb, protein and veggies at a moderate price.
