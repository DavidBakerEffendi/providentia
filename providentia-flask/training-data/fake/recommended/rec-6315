Four girls for a night out on the town + Osteria = X) Wood-grilled octopus as appetizer was soft not chewy and flavorful. The portion wasn't large but worth it. Two pizzas (one artichoke, one egg): Delicious! Flavorful! Worthy of a mouthgasm! Definitely recommend the artichoke pizza. Fresh, tasty ingredients. Thin, wood-fired pizza with a little crisp to the crust. Wild boar pasta: Meh. Not my favorite here. It was vaguely comparable to something I've had at Melagrano with this ground wild boar sauce and long tubular pasta (ragatoni? raglioni? grrr... don't know my pasta types). I'm not a fan of pasta (though it was cooked very nicely here, a little softer than al dente) and I was pretty full by the time this came around, so maybe don't take my word for it because all the other girls liked it very much. (What can I say? I'm a pizza-girl! :D) The only qualms I have are: 1) Nothing a cab can't take care of... But the location leaves something to be desired. 2) There are some gaps in communication between the staff. We were asked three times if we wanted our coats checked (Uh... Hahaha. No.). Otherwise, though, the staff was very pleasant and took their time to describe the items on the menu to us. Overall: * I'd definitely recommending going with a small group so that you can taste as many things as you can. * The meal was very nicely paced. There was a good pause between each dish, which were brought out one-by-one per our request, and that allowed for good conversation, as well as some good ol' digestion. * Casual, warm decor. Not too dark and not too bright. The clientele is an older, more refined crowd, but the atmosphere is relaxed and evokes a rustic, classy feel that's great when you just want to wind down and have a bit of fancy--but not too much. * This is definitely one of the better $25 I've paid to go to a restaurant in Philly--most BYO meals aren't worth this much.
