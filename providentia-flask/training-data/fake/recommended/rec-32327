This place was fun, and I just got take out.  Talk about personality, the woman who took my order on the phone was the queen of the upsell.  While some people come off pushy and exploitative, "OMG, you can't have a meal with no desert!"  Sketch was fun, I enjoyed every moment of our phone conversation and they seemed genuinely interested in me enjoying their food to the fullest.  I got a burger with the Wasabi sauce.  A little undercooked for medium rare, but luckily I love rare burgers!!!  Fun place.  Will definitely go back.
