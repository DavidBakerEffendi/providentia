Instead of watching the July 4th fireworks, my friends and I decided to come here for dinner. Don't regret missing the fireworks for this! Excellent place for big groups with various dietary preferences, vegans and carnivores will all be able to find something delicious and satisfying without emptying their wallets. They have a wide selection of soondobu, bulgogi, bibimbap, and japchae. You can also choose from five levels of spicyness: plain, mild, medium, spicy, and danger. My friends and I shared a vegetable japchae, which is super delicious. The dish is presented with one big piece of tofu that they cut in front of you and mix with the noodles. I also ordered a vegetable soondobu, which had a good mix of ingredients with a mild broth. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Since it was my friend's birthday, I bought a cake from across the street to surprise her, and when I brought it back, our waitress knew exactly what to do. She cleared the table after dinner and surprised my friend by bringing out the cake, lit with candles, and singing happy birthday. ADORABLE!
