such a fun place! tons of space and tables for beer pong, jenga, and lots of outdoor picnic tables for getting your drinky drinks on out in the amazing sun. love the happy hour menu with the variety of yummy food options. got some HH food togo for the bf who was sadly home studying :) can't wait to come back!!
