One of my favorite restaurants in NJ.  I've been dining here more than 10times and it is still one of best restaurants in NJ.  If you are wine lover, this is the place!!  It is BYOB and also have a little wine shop with a free wine tasting while you are waiting.  However, it used to be much better in services.  Maybe they are becoming pretty famous place in NJ but I always miss 2007 Cafe Matisse.   Good for: Romantic Dining, Wine Lover, Bad for: Group of more than 4, Looking for fancy large scale modern design restaurant, Pricey Meal
