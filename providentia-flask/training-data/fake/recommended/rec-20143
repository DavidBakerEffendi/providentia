I'm probably echoing half the reviews below, but seriously - best Pad Thai in NYC. I've been here twice, once for the Pad Thai and once for the crispy duck salad, and absolutely regret not ordering the Pad Thai on my second visit. It was that good. The wait for a table isn't too bad for the after work crowd and the prices are reasonable. Decor is a bit schizophrenic - either genius or faux-chic. Someone please explain the floor-to-ceiling chandelier in the middle of the room? Please? Plating and presentation have been ironed down to a science but timing and food delivery is off. Not sure why some restaurants think it's okay to serve half the party at a time? I hate when people have to sit and stare at each other while someones food is inevitably getting cold. Minor pet peeve. Otherwise, everything's great!
