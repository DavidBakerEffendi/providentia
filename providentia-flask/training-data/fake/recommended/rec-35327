What's not to like? Vito's pizza is inexpensive and tastes great.  Thanks Yelp for helping me find a local pizza place that was exactly what I wanted.  There's nothing like eating a great pizza that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I came to the area visiting family, but if there was a Vito's in CA, I definitely would come every week for their pizza!!!
