Four of us had dinner on a weekday evening.  The place was packed although you would not know it from the outside on Macdougal Street.  We dined outside and had a variety of appetizers including the Pomodoro e Basilico and Pate con Cippolla plus three pizzas, salad and a bottle of Sangiovese. The food was excellent as was the service.  The outside garden dining area is very small and very dark.  Good luck if you happen to drop anything under your table or chair.  You will never find it without a flashlight.  Service was prompt and pretty regular considering the number of people in the restaurant.
