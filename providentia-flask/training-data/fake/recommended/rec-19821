Came here with the lady.   Atmosphere: - Nice and intimate while having a neighborhood charm to it. Service: - Polite and unobtrusive.  Helpful and didn't detract from the evening at all Food: - It was 2 months ago, so don't remember everything.  I had the pork tenderloin wrapped in prosciutto which was cooked perfectly (juicy, flavorful and nicely seasoned).   - Beet salad was beautifully presented (golden beets in there as well) and was fresh and delicious Highly recommend and can't wait to go back.
