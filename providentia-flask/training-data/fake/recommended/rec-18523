This place is like a pretty girl who wears too much makeup.  Great quality of food... but desperately over prepared with too much butter, vegetables masked with chili too hot even for the connoisseur of spices, desserts dripping in sugar, bread burned. But great ambiance, Delicious cocktails, well curated wines, and attentive service.  But the food is heavily and almost inedible its so over prepared.
