Had dinner here last night with my husband and we really enjoyed ourselves! We had been once previously when it first opened and I'm fairly certain the menu has since been changed. The decor is very chic and the host who greeted us was exceptionally friendly. We decided to order 3 small plates each instead of a traditional entree. While I'm glad we did because each dish was delicious it was a LOT of food! I ordered the salad, calamari and crab cake sliders while my husband ordered the Mac and cheese, pappardelle and southern fried chicken sliders. We also split a side of grits. My husband and I probably could have eliminated one dish each and still would have been more than satisfied - instead we were stuffed and I'm not complaining! I thought the small plates gave you a very hearty serving for those looking to go that route. Everything tasted amazing. I thought the calamari took the top spot on my list and my husband said the Mac and cheese was delicious. We talked about taking friends here who came to visit and I think we will.
