So surprised at how great the food was! The mac and cheese was maybe the best I've ever had (and i had lots :). An awesome culinary experience and the service was 5 star as well. Cant wait to go back and cant believe I hadn't heard about it sooner! Â The adult top sirloin sloppy joe and the duck salad are awesome too!
