As far as Breakfast or Brunch goes, this place is as good as it gets. The place is somewhat cramped but it maintains it's charm with its eclectic collection of coffee mugs and excellent service.  The servings are generous without sacrificing quality.  So many places offer a stuffed french toast but this place does it right! After eating here i understand why people wait an hour outside on a Sunday for this place. If your not such a patient patron however, you can call ahead to put your name in to cut down on the wait time. I will definitely be bringing people back here
