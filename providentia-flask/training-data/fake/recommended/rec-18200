I should've listened to these Yelp reviews, but i always have to find out for myself. Granted I went at a strange time (around 4:30 on a sunday), so they were just opening, which always makes for an awkward time. So I won't kill them for the lack of ambiance. My partner and I each got a beer (not very cold), and ordered some apps. The hummus and the catfish (not good). The hummus came in a huge bowl, and was probably enough to feed an entire party, and it also had at least a full cup of oil poured into it. I've had hummus with oil on it, but nothing like this. It was comically bad. The accompanying veggies were strangely presented, but the Pita was decent. The catfish and chips were bad. Thick cornmeal crusted catfish fingers, ridiculously greasy, with undercooked french fries. The accompanying sauce was okay. We asked for some ketchup for the fries and we were given a ramekin of tomato sauce. Seriously. It wasn't ketchup. All in all, everything needed more flavor and less grease. I can't say I'll ever go back. I gave them an extra star because the waitress was very nice.
