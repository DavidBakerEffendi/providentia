Just love Ants Pants for breakfast. They have good, strong coffee and that's enough but they don't stop there. Swing by for breakfast - I usually get the Dill scrambled eggs - so light and fluffy - or the creme brulee french toast with the sweet, sacrilicious sour cream topping. I've tried just about all the breakfast items and they're all great. When you're choosing bread, though, go for the toasted Brioche. Awesome. It's a cozy little place so expect to wait if you go on a weekend afternoon. They used to be closed on one day of the week but I think they're open every day now. Free wifi too (but I've never seen anyone using it). There are a couple seats outside in the back. Park on South or south of South (not too bad during the day). While it's not cheap, it's not outrageous (about 7 or 8 bucks for each breakfast entree) and the service seals the deal: it's exemplary. But be prepared: cash only.
