Me my old co-worker came here for drinks and dinner on a Tuesday night. I ordered a Room Service special which consisted of vodka, rum, gin, and some apple juice (?) garnished with a lychee and maraschino cherry ($13) and I have 1 merlot ($8) and 1 cab ($9) it was ok. Drinks weren't anything spectacular, but the ambiance was nice. The food was ok. Nothing to rave about. But the prices were fairly reasonably in mid town/ Hell's Kitchen ($8.75 for the steamed tofu pad Thai).   Although, one thing I would say is a MUST is the sesame tofu! It comes with 7 pieces of tofu rolled over some black and white sesame served with a dipping sauce of sweet and spicy chili sauce. It's really good! Only $3.75. Super cheap and tasty! Well worth it!  The service, however I had to dock some points off of. :-/ Also, I've order delivery from here through seamless, and it's not that good cuz of the wait time. The pad see ew and the pad Thai we ordered was soggy from the steam and wasn't as flavorful as if we had ordered in the restaurant. Rather disappointing. :-(
