Why are you guys hypeing up such a standard halal cart. Its the same crap they serve on every other block. The food is decent but I would never stand on a line of 40 to get the same sh@t I can get 1 block down. Also the guys working their are nasty , rude and completely unappreciative for the business. they should just realize that they picked a good corner and got lucky with it.
