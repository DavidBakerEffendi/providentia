Definitely a great spot for izakaya! The restaurant is a hidden gem and once you step inside the people are beautiful and authentic and the bar makes you hungry instantly. Unfortunately we couldn't score a seat at the bar so we sat at a table in the back. We started off with the sashimi salad which was delicious, then we had the homemade tofu which was a little too much and strong of  a taste, I also had the zucchini and shitaki mushroom  which were great, the grilled duck was good but a little too rough, the black cod was one of the best I ever had, the grilled squid was actually horrible and I couldn't even swallow it, the rice for two with salmon and fish roe was amazing just great. Overall the food was great and I cannot wait to come back and sit at the bar.
