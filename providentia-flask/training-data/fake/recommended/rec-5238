There are a lot of pizza places in the area, and their menus are pretty similar, but Cantore's manages to stand out.  The pizza isn't the best, though it's pretty good, but the rest of the menu - especially the sandwiches - is fantastic.  Everything I've ordered has been delicious; a clear step above anything else around here. This place really pays attention to the details, and it shows in everything down to the stylish black-white checkered paper in take-out boxes.  The service is top-notch; really friendly people.
