Came here with a couple of other ladies for a much needed night out. To start, I had the homemade root beer on tap, which was delicious! Was there actually root beer? It's unclear! It was listed under the beers on tap section, but there was no taste of beer, which, as someone that was famished and ready for a feast, I appreciated ;) We ordered the nose to tail feast (and tried to get the goat cheese tarte a la carte, to no avail, womp), which was incredible! All of the appetizers were cooked to perfection. There was a perfect balance of flavors that just exploded in your mouth. I particularly enjoyed the "shepherd's pie," which I recommend just eating in one bite to get the full picture of how delicious it is. The entrees were also quite delicious, though by that point, I was pretty much full (which was an awesome feeling...how often do you get to eat top quality food and be full?). The lasagna had an interesting but delicious texture, though it was slightly on the lukewarm side for my liking, but it was still top notch. The dessert basically stole the show, and therefore deserves its own paragraph. Pear galette, maple walnuts and bourbon cream. So freakin' awesome. It's not a surprise, considering one of the owners comes from a family that has its own bakery. We concluded that pear is underrated and pairs so perfectly with the bourbon cream, which in isolation, is a bit strong. P.S. the decor is amazing and the soap in the bathroom is minty and fragrant (the scent of the soap could be a deal breaker, and therefore is worth mentioning). also the service was great and the waiter definitely was a champ and was totally cool, though he walked in at most inopportune moments and had to deal with our ridiculousness.
