Some pregnant women crave chocolate or pickles and ice cream, but 25 years ago when my wife was expecting our son, her craving of choice was Poor Henry's salad bar. We made many a trip to that salad bar over those long nine months. We still get to Poor Henry's occasionally. Still the best Prime Rib around. Live music on many nights in a friendly environment.
