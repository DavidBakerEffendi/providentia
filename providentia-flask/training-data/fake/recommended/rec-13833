When the BF and I want a cheap but good burger, we go to Corner Bistro.  We usually do not have to wait long for a table, 10-25 mins depending  on the time.  The menu is simple and written all on the back wall.  Bistro burger w American yellow cheese comes with the usual tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and pickles for $5.00... sweet!  French fries for $2... super sweet.  The burger is very well priced for it's size.  Each patty of beef is 8oz.   Completely satisfied two people for around $20.  Mission accomplished.
