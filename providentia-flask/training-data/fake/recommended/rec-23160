This place is super!  Sushi, great Chinese food and Hibachi all in one.  Never had a bad meal there.  Although this last time I think we got a rookie chef, the food was still pretty tasty.... he just wasn't on top of his game entertainment wise. When we lived in the are we ate here often, now it's just for special occasions.  When we are there and not eating hibachi, my husband has the hardest time choosing his meal because of the expansive menu.  And it's totally worth the price.... and BYO as well.  You can't lose!
