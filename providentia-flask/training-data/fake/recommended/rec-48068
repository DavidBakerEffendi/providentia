Absolutely wonderful. This is by far the best nu-Italian restaurant I've ever been to. Porterhouse Thursdays are TOTALLY worth it. The staff is generous, kind, polite, funny, awesome. Complimentary bread and cheese. Great wine selection. Our waiter even gave us a free shot of aguardiente after dinner because we didn't have room for dessert, and we were genuinely upset about it. I had the gnocchi with gorgonzola and it was perfectly creamy, tangy, delicious. They had another special on the menu that sounded great, although I didn't order it since I went for dinner: strawberry risotto. Wtf? So summery and predictably AWESOME. If you want a nice dinner, GO. HERE. I love it.
