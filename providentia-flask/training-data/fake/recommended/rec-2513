I actually give it a 3.5. This is the most "authentic" Japanese restaurant that I've found in center city.  I mean, majority of the workers are Japanese(I think the owner's Chinese though), how much more authentic can it get right?! The fried chicken is good with the delicious spicy mayo sauce. I also like how they serve the hot udon dishes in mini sizes(duh because it's tapa style), it's perfect where I can have room to eat a variety of other things. Beyond those dishes, the specialty sushi rolls weren't very appealing to me.  The fishies didn't seem to taste very fresh.   They have "sochu", not to be confused with soju here.  I had saki in those cute bong-like pitchers. Makes my drink much more appealing. Happy hour here serves the yakitori skewers which is a must try.   Come upstairs if you get drunk and liquid courage calls for some singing!
