The newest in a long line of 5 star reviews...   A few weeks back my Fiance and I enjoyed a delicious cupcake here.  It was a big Reese's Peanut Butter Cup-cake made fresh by the owners wife.  We vowed to come back and try one of their Panini's. Cut to last sunday.  We wandered in here fresh from an exceedingly dissappointing time at the Tea House accross the street.  We ordered our panini's hoping that we wouldn't be let down.  And guess what, they were delicious.  I had the sausage and hot pepper panini, my fiance had the sopressetta and olive tapenade, and my good friend had a Mozz and pesto panini.  One was better than the next and our faith was renewed in Astoria culinary tradition. Thanks Il Bambino!
