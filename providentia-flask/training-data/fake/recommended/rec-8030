Despite some of the complaints with the place, I think it's a good place to go if you want variety, fast service, good quality, and a decent price. I went with my girlfriend and we ordered the steamed chicken dumplings (not great, but not bad), the ox tongue and tripe in chili sauce (delicious), and a chicken wonton soup bowl and twice fried seafood noodle. Both of the entrees were great, and our total was only $32 ($22 in the end, see below). Also: go online and join their mailing list. You get a $10 coupon on a purchase of $30 or more. It essentially makes ordering an appetizer save you money. Overall, I would recommend this place if you are looking for good Chinese food on this side of the river.
