My parents were in town and my wife and I took them to Osteria and it was great.   We ordered the special vegetable platter to start which was amazing.  It is a large wood board with a cornucopia of different fresh in season vegetables.  Everything on this platter was unique and equally great tasting. My father and I are vegetarian and we had no trouble finding something great to eat.  In addition to the vegetarian friendly items on the menu the offered to make a couple of the other items vegetarian which was awesome. We all had a great time with a nice bottle of Chianti and a great meal.  We will definitely be back.
