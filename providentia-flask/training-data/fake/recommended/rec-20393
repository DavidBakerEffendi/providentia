I had a wonderful, wonderful belated birthday dinner here a few months ago. We were seated by the warm, welcoming fire, which was the perfect antidote to a cold, crappy day. Everything was wonderful, from the pate appetizer, to my meal of goat with polenta and shallots - my first time eating goat, and to have it both braised and grilled was the perfect way to experience it for the first time. The waitstaff was excellent, always taking care of us and making sure to put a candle on a cake that I managed to find room for after eating all I could of my meal and still having plenty to bring home. I can't wait to come back and experience Applewood again.
