My first Umami experience was out in Los Angeles and it was pretty damn good. My 2 visits to the NYC store haven't disappointed. It's really good although it gets packed and the wait can be lengthy so we've opted for the upstairs bar. Typically no wait and pretty good service. Service: Really good considering it's at the bar. Food: Pretty excellent, great flavor and the truffle fries are a MUST try!
