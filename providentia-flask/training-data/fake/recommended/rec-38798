Went around 11:45am on a Tuesday.  It was empty at that time so I had none of the wait issues that other people mentioned. (to go order was ready in about 5 minutes) I went for their lunch special -- 1/2 Classic Sandwich + House Salad + Iced Tea/Soda for $9 1/2 Original Sandwich + House Salad + Iced Tea/Soda for $11 I got a chicken salad sandwich on whole wheat; simple, but good and filling.  Not sure if it was a mistake, but they gave me a whole sandwich. yum! I also grabbed some whole wheat zucchini bread for later. Overall, good experience and would definitely come here again to try some of the more unique sandwiches.
