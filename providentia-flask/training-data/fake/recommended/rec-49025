LOVE DADDY'S PIZZA.  They won my heart with their pizza but dazzled me with their french fries and fried dough.  The service is always fast, there's live music every Saturday night, and the food is reliably delicious.  Plus, I've encountered the owner sitting outside during warmer months and he seems like a genuinely nice person who is interested in bettering Claremont.  I think Daddy's is a great addition to our downtown district.
