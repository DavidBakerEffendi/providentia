If you want to why New Haven pizza is so renowned, this is the place to go. What makes the pizza so great is a combination of two things--the coal brick oven and the high quality ingredients. Although you can get a pizza with lots of interesting toppings (such as clams), I recommend going basic to really get a feel for why it's so good. I usually get pepperoni. The sauce and the cheese are excellent, the crust is uniquely tasty (even the charred part), and the pepperoni is nice, thick, and full of flavor. It's a bit expensive and the wait can very long sometimes, but it's worth it. Make sure to get enough for leftovers!
