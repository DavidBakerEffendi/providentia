Went here last night and totally loved it. Before you walk in you can smell the deliciousness of the barbecue from outside. I ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs with a side of Mac and cheese and harlem potato salad. Didn't care for the potato salad but loved the ribs. They were filled with the smokey flavor and were succulent and juicy! Best ribs I've ever had hands down. Also, there sweet tea is everything you want in a sweet tea, the perfect amount of sweetness without being overly sugary
