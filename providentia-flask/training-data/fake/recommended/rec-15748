I want to love this place but at the same time want to hate it. The food was phenomenal. Came here for brunch and had the Gouda grilled cheese (black bean hummus, jam, jalapenos, gouda) - it was spicy hot but delicious and came with a delightful mixed green salad. My boy had the cheddar and mozzarella grilled cheese with tomato soup which he very much enjoyed. The coffee was also spot on - nice and rich. The decor was super cool. Very chill, minimalist, hipstery. Dim lighting. Nice hearty wooden tables. Old timey coffee and draft bar area. Things that prevented me from giving this place a 5: wtf is with the service - food took forever to come out, the waitress kept trying to take our side of ice, had to ask for silverware. Also, the cider list. While it was comprehensive (they have A LOT of bottled and a few draft ciders), there were no normal, classic ciders. Each one felt like it was trying to one up the next and all had weird flavors that I didn't think belong in cider, so that's unfortunate. However, they have beer and wine, so it's not the end of the world. Another thing: it is VEGETARIAN, but I did not realize this and the food was awesome. Just don't come here expecting to get bacon with your brunch.
