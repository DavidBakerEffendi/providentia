Visited Mood's cafe for the first time yesterday , the awesome food was matched by Hasan's warmth as a host . The food is absolutely splendid. I had the paneer chaat with an apple fig lassi . The chaat was really good but the lassi was exceptional , this has got to be the closest I have had to the real thing ( try the salt lassi if you have the taste for it , exceptional !!) . Also the owner Hassan is a great host , taking interest in a customer and treating them like a human being there to enjoy food as opposed to just a number to serve a dish too is all the difference between a great place and just another restaurant and the experience I had here was awesome !! I will be back for more chaat and lassi
