I genuinely enjoy coming here to eat. The food is always fresh and delicious. But the service is even better. The tag team of husband and wife works hard to provide the best service possible for you. I once went there with a friend of mine and while we were waiting for our food, they treated us to some freshly brewed tea, without us even asking. In this day in age good customer service is extremely hard to find, it seems like most places you go, people are dry and don't want to be there. If you like good food and excellent service, this is where you want to go.
