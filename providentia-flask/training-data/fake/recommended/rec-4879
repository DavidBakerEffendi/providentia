Cute, intimate date spot or dessert with the girls. Wooden bar tables and stools set the mood, as you pass the crepe-master on your way in. The smells of the crepes cooking welcome you in from the NYC winter. Sit where you like. My bf took me here after a short walk down Stone Street -- such a cute little area near FiDi. We passes Smorgas Chef on the way there, and I thought what a cute place. I was happy to find out that Smorgas and Crepes du Nord are a joint location, directly connected through the middle, sharing even menu items. What a great pairing. We started out our night with the lingonberry juice and the blueberry juice. Both were phenomenal. Sweet, but not overly, and the lingonberry had bits of berry pur√©e at bottom. Delicious and refreshing. For our appetizer, we shared the Black Forest Ham Crepe. This crepe batter was almost greenish, darker...maybe spinach or something. Served with Jarlsberg cheese slightly melted into the crepe, and perfectly layered. Chives. Simple and good. Came also with a small side salad. For our entree, we split the 1/2 pound Sirloin Burger from the Bistro menu (from Smorgas). This was hearty, learn beef, with a dill dressing. We added Jarlsberg cheese and strips of bacon, for $2 additional each. Came with some well-cooked seasoned fries. For dessert, we had the S'mores crepe, but substituted nutella for the dark chocolate. My BF could not stop eating this one, despite being so full that he was about to burst. The marshmallow melted with the heat of the crepe cooking, and was chewy but warm. So good. All in all, a perfect intimate date night. I would gladly return here or Smorgas Chef for a cute night out in FiDi.
