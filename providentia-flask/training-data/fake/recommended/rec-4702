I liked the food the couple times I ate here, but won't be back - they had bugs by the zillions flying around in a decorative display near the front, probably had to do with a coconut that appeared to be cracked open there.  I can't recommend a place that has bugs flying around.  I've eaten outdoors and seen fewer bugs, often.
