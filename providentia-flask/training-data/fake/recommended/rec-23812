I've had an excellent meal every time.  The staff is friendly. The sushi is fresh and delicious.  Any time I want to experiment with a new kind of sushi, Uzu is my go to.   The dining area only consists of 7 tables at the most and is very intimate but I like it that way.  Plus, who doesn't like BYO?
