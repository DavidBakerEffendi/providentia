This place was great. Very helpful staff. GREAT MENU. I went in for brunch on a Friday afternoon with some friends and everything on the menu looked and sounded delicious. We all had our own dish, but we decided to split an order of the Red Velvet Pancakes, which I highly recommend. I went with the Eggs Benedict because as far as I remember, I'd never had eggs prepared this way and decided to have it on a whim. DELICIOUS. No alcohol, and I'm pretty sure it was BYOB but the food was so good that you won't even notice its absence from the menu. Enjoy!
