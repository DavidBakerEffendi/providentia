Usually I think New Yorkers are pretty discerning judges of food, so when I see a 4-star place with lots of reviews, I assume it's gonna be pretty decent. This place has a lot of things going for it. First of all, it does have a nice vibe - it's pretty sexy. Second, it's really very inexpensive. We're staying in Midtown and there's not a whole lot in the immediate area, so I was pleased to see a nice-looking place just a few blocks away. However, the food is really exceptionally mediocre. We ordered the beef and apple salad, which tasted okay but was *really* over-sauced. For entrees we had pad see ew with Tofu, which was soggy and the tofu was weird and sour. We also had the chicken massaman curry, which was decent - certainly the best thing we had. The bill was something like $26. In any case, the food was certainly worse than our local delivery place in LA. It's not "bad," just really nothing special at all.
