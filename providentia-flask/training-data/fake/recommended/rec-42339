great brunch.  I had a plate with 2 eggs, seasoned with herbs, thick homemade bread, hashbrown patties and a side of avocado and beans.  The beans definitely weren't kosher (im pretty sure there was bacon in there) but they were delicious! also, they have a well trained barista working the espresso bar, serving Wandering Goat espresso.  Extra points for changing it up with micro roastery coffee.
