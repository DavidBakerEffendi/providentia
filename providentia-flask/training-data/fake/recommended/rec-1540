I wasnt a fan. Personally I dont appreciate you telling me to get in the back of the line when im paying you! I had never order a cheesestreak Philly style and just needed an explanation Nope and for their rude attitudes ill neve go back. Your steak isnt that good to be that rude! Genos is way better hands down!
