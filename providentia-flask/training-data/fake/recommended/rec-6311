True to its name, this place is very petite, but add to that charming, delicious, non-pretentious, BYOB, what more can I ask for? Pan seared scallops dijonnaise were seasoned just enough so I could actually taste what I was eating. My husband had this huge bouillabaisse-type special to which he gave two lobster thumbs up.
