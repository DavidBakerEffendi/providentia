Omg all I can say is hmm hmm good!!. I went with the recommendation of the beef ribs, also added brisket, pork ribs,  potato salad, collard greens and stuffed sweet potato. .. First let me state that this is hands down the best BbQ in NYC outside of Texas. . The best way to judge good bbq is by the brisket and boy did they serve that pretty darn good if you ask me.. I wasnt a fan of having to pay extra for onions, pickles and  jalepenos, (the texas way, and no im not from texas lol but i know my food) but it wasn't a complete deal breaker. . The ribs was seasoned very very well and tender not over cooked or dried out.. the sides was delish except for the potato salad that was a no go! Didnt look right nor did it taste right.. the sweet potato delish the bbq sauce delish and the ribs didnt need it in my opinion. ..
