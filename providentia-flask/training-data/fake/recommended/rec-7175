First time here. Very satisfied overall! Good service attitude, delicious food, comfortable environment. Ordered duck roll, not bad. Roti, very good with lots of chicken and curry sauce so we ordered a side of white rice. Drunken noodle, very flavorful. Ginger mojito, fixed my alcohol craving. Thai iced tea, taste about right. Not bad at all, will def come back again!
