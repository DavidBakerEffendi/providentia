Baker&co is now among my favorite places in the neighborhood. There are a lot of options around here Â by way of reasonably priced Italian, but Baker&co definitely stands on its own! Excellent ambiance, great food, friendly service, and a solid $8 draft red wine. Perfect for chilling with friends over a leisurely meal, but also good for catching up with family/friends from out of town. Best of all, they haven't fallen into, shall we say bad habits, of NYC dining: they take plastic (I'm looking at you, bar pitti, Malatesta, and Malaparte), accept reservations online (yeah, you guys again and Rosemary's too), and they seat tables promptly even if a couple of people are running late (major convenience!). I've had a few of their pastas and each has always been perfectly portioned and mighty tasty. The gnocchi in particular is delightful, and the tomato/basil pizette is fresh, crisp, and always a part of the table's order to start. I've also recently discovered the joys of their risotto croquettes and will definitely be adding that to my list of "go to" orders. The burger looks good, too- that may have to be my entree of choice on my next visit!
