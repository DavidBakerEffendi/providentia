Last night I went to Miami Mike's in East Hanover to watch the Giants game. My friend and I ordered food and drinks; she had diet coke, i had beer. When we were finished with our meal, our server asked if I wanted another drink. I said no thank you, may I just have some water. She said no. The new policy at Miami Mike's is on weekends, they will only sell you a bottle of water, you may not have tap water. I was completely shocked and disgusted. Not her fault, Miami Mike was the man behind the idea. She said a lot of people complained throughout the day bc they were asking for water as well. So I declined for another drink and we asked for the bill at halftime. On the bill we were charged for 3 diet cokes; obviously no complimentary refills for soft drinks. If business is tough, wouldn't you want to make incentives to bring people to your establishment, not drive them away with ridiculous policies?! A LOT of people I know go there, and it is always busy. I don't understand the change, but I won't go back there. It's just not good business.
