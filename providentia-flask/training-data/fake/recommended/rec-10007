A great place been there 5 or 6 times now in the last 12 months.  Great place to take out of towner as most have never had Peruvian food and everyone finds something they like. Hard to have a conversation downstairs  due to the loud noise upstairs is better but only in the back the front upstairs is very drafty and full of people coming in and out.  Best to make a reservation during prime hours or better yet ideal is to go early especially for brunch.
