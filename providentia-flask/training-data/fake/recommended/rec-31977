#7 Sliced Granny Smith Apple with Turkey, Brie & Raspberry Mustard IS THE BEST THING ON THE MENU, YOU WILL NOT REGRET ORDERING THIS.   AND THE ICED RASPBERRY TEA IS AWESOME TOO, GET THE LARGE ONE. REAL BITS OF BERRY COME UP IN THE STRAW, VERY DELICIOUS.  BURGER WITH CHEDDAR IS GREAT ALSO WITH ALL THE TOPPINGS........PEOPLE ARE FRIENDLY, SUPER FAST SERVICE EVEN WHEN IT'S CROWDED.  DON'T LET THE LINE SCARE YOU, IT MOVES VERY FAST.  WORTH THE LITTLE WAIT....5 STARS ALL THE WAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYY!!!
