Great little neighborhood joint. We arrived to Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare a bit early so they sent us over here for a pre-dinner adult beverage. The murals in the walls and wood beams give it some great character, and the staff was friendly. If I lived around here, this would be my go to hang out spot.
