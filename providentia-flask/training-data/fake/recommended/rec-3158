I had a 5 star meal and Mr. G gave his a solid 4 stars, so I settled on 4. This is a cute restaurant that feels very local - casual-ish, but feels like a good place for a nice Italian dinner. BEST parts: (1) The homemade ravioli with the corn and truffle sauce is AMAZING...the highlight of the night - of my week, really - try it!! (2) the shrimp/avocado appetizer was super tasty and fresh, (3) they have some unique wines, and I had a unique glass of white, perfectly cool and great for a summer night, (4) Attentive, friendly service. I think it was the head chef who checked in with us before we left to ask about our meal. The only less than great dish was Mr. G's scallops with fettucini, which was just a little too simple and didn't have quite enough scallops to make up for the simplicity or the price. I would definitely LOVE to go back to this place - they have several unique pasta options I would look forward to trying, and it's just such a pleasant place for good food and conversation.
