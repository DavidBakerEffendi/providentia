Just went to Zento for lunch and the Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box was delicious!!  6 of us had lunch and everyone was pleased with the options sushi, sashimi, etc.  Server was very attentive and all lunch specials came with miso soup and salad. Only con of Zento is the size, on a weekend night I am sure it gets packed and there is no room to wait for a table - other than the size, food is superb!
