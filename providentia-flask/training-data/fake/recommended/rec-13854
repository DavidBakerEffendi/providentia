Thank you for serving the best $6 meal ever. Chicken and rice can be enjoyed any time of the day, especially since they're open late! Key is to pour that white sauce, go super easy on the red and bbq sauce, if you like. It's great even as leftovers. My 80-something year-old grandma even approved of this as her favorite "american" meal in NYC, so that is quite telling.
