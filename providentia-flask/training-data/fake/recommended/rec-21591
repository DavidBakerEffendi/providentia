since i live right around the corner from this place i really want to love it.  i do love the carnitas tacos!  the prices on the food and drinks are super cheap, but the thing that kills it for me is the service.  i'd have to say 9 out of the 10 times i've been there our server/bartender has been wasted, can't remember an order, charges for things that were never ordered, and then laughs if off and thinks it's funny.  turns out, not so funny.  working in the business i think sometimes i get a little too critical, but when i have to bus the table i want to sit at b/c you are too lazy to do it and then proceed to make me wait 20 mins and still not even a hello...eeehhh not so fond of it.
