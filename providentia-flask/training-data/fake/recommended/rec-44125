So I was super excited about this place after reading rave review after rave review.  However I was extremely disappointed.  I ordered the Braised Beef Noodles and Pig Eears as take out.  Perhaps my experience would have been better if I had ate in, however I had the unfortunate pleasure of smelling the noodles in my car all the way home which smelled like dirty feet (strike one.)  By the time I got to my house in Roxborough I knew that this was not going to be the mind blowing meal that I had hoped for. Moving beyond the pungent smell of rotten feet, I put the noodles into my awaiting broth and beef.  Or should I say fat, there was so much fat and grisly pieces in my bowl that I got no more than 2 or 3 bites of edible meat out of the whole thing (strike two.) The Pig Ears were no more appetizing than the fatty beef (strike three.) All in all a pretty disappointing experience.
