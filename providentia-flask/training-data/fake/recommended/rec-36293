This place is really good went for lunch when I was visiting NYC. I got the lunch special a wrap, and a side for $20. I got the chicken wrap with a side of Lebanese rice with almond. Was really good, place filled up very corperate lunch environment. Service was very good too. Also they brought out homemade pita with the meal. Â Looked really good, but I ordered a wrap so I didn't want even more bread.
