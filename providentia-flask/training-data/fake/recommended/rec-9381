Chef Samir might be a newcomer to the mobile food craze but with food like this, he's sure to make a name for himself. He serves up amazing Morrocan food with a smile at an affordable cost. I'm sold. So far, I've tried the Mogador burger, the Mergez in both sandwich and platter form and the cous cous. Everything has been delicious. But, that mergez is a standout. I've heard only good things about the chicken but I can never seem to bring myself to try it. The mergez always calls to me. Â He offers a choice of four distinct sauces that can please even the most diverse crowds. My favorite would have to be his spicy mint sauce. What strikes me most about Chef Samir is that his food is never, ever heavy or greasy. He's completely elevated my standards as far as what I now expect from a food truck. The portions are extremely generous as well. So far, I can't think of one single thing to fault him on. He's on point.
