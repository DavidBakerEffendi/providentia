Great place! I love the vegetarian soup options, only 2, but that's good enough for me. there are plenty of vegetable toppings to have and more as add-ons if you would like. It's a nice seating area, quick service. There are waits at times, but the usual times that you would expect (ie.. Friday and Saturday nights). I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a vegetarian broth soups. I also definitely recommend this place if you're looking for good soups.
