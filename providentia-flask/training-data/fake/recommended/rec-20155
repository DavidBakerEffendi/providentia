Came at around 3 on a weekday, ended up waiting about half an hour. Umami was definitely good, and has a different enough vibe from most NY burger places that I can understand the hype. Is it fully warranted? Not sure. I had the original burger without the bun--I know, but a medical procedure I had earlier in the summer keeps me from being able to actively bite into things, so I figured that it would be easier to fork-and-knife it without the bun. It ended up coming protein style (lettuce wrap) which I ignored straight for the meat. I think I would have enjoyed the mixing of flavors more had I been able to eat the burger like a sandwich, so I'd definitely be willing to try again once my mouth has more mobility. The meat was flavorful, albeit essentially raw (but that is medium-rare, I suppose), the grilled tomato and parmesan delicious. There weren't very many mushrooms and onions. Overall, a solid burger, but not the best I've tasted. We ordered a variety of sides, namely the truffle fries and smashed potatoes. The smashed potatoes were very good with the garlic aoli, though they resemble hashbrowns more than the potato mash we were expecting. Truffle fries were delicious but didn't taste very much like truffle--more a nice savory, salty cheese. I also had the 21-U cocktail (bloody mary) which was very good. I'll be back once the line dies down, but I don't think I'll be waiting two hours to eat dinner here anytime soon. There are many equivalent burgers in NY.
