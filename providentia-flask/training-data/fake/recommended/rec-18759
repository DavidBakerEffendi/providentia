I had jury duty around the corner for 2 week (yeah thats right TWO WEEKS) and ended up eating here multiple times. It is average in terms of price and quality and has great lunch specials. The sushi is fresh and you get a lot of stuff with the lunch combo deals (rice, noodles, salad, spring roll etc). It was fairly busy around lunch - it seems I am not the only one taking advantage of the specials - but I always had a seat and quick service.
