Stopping here today was a bad bad bad idea for my future earnings...can I say that MeltKraft will more than likely be getting all of my money any time I am anywhere near Reading Terminal ? Admittedly, I am a cheese lover but I, unfortunately, have never had Valley Shepherd cheeses before.  Until today. Ordered the Avenue D with tomato---figured I would start with the basic and work my way up from there if it was good.  And man oh man, it was.  It's a mix of 3 cheeses---rich, buttery, melted.  I bet it would have been even better had I not had to walk back to my office about 6 blocks away...it cooled off a little but the cheese was still a good consistency when I bit in. Was a little skeptical about the price (eventually, I decided that high quality cheese is worth it...cheese lovers might understand...the rest of you, get outta here!)  But I will say that it was well worth it---the high quality of the cheese is apparent, the service was friendly and fast.  And the sandwich was very filling---I would even venture that I can get full off just half of what I ordered. Quality, quantity, service- A+.
