AMAZING! One of the best meals I've had! Me and my friends split the duck burger, truffle burger, and truffle special burger. All were amazing, but my favorite was the truffle burger. The meat was SO fresh and juicy. The truffle flavor was perfect. The bread was slightly sweet and soft. Also, tried the truffle fries, and they were fantastic. The fries were thin and had a nice crisp. They were covered in cheese, and had the perfect truffle flavor. Split the Arnold Palmer ice cream bowl. It came with a scoop of green tea ice cream, snicker doodle ice cream, and salted caramel ice cream (Noramlly its limencello sorbet but they were out), and a huge soft and chewy snickerdoodle cookie. Service was great. Waiters and hostess were friendly and attentive. Will definitely be going back here!
