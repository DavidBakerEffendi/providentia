My friend and I made a trip to Brooklyn/NYC and our friends toop us to Blue Ribbon. The place itself is lovely and intimate.  I had the Salmon Asparagus and the food was delicious... Excellent wine list....  Superb... We were with great company so that made the experience even better... Oh and the service was delightful!
