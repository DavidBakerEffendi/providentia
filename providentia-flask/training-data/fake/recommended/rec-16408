I visited Dil-e Punjab on a weekday for lunch with two coworkers. The deli had a nice stream of patrons coming in and out. First of all, this is not a sit-down establishment. You go in, order, and leave with your food, or you stand at the counter at eat there. The space at the counter is not spacious, but as we ate our food we didn't get bumped into, so it's not too cramped. These are not fancy digs, but everything is clean and there are even pitchers of water and plastic cups on the counter. The deal is that you get 3 vegetable dishes on top of rice or with bread or a combination of bread. You also get a little bowl of yogurt, some cukes and purple onion, and a little bowl of rice pudding. The entire thing costs $7. I tried a dumpling dish in a creamy gravy (kofta?), eggplant with potatoes, and string beans with potatoes. I got these over rice and got one roti on the side. All dishes were very flavorful and well-seasoned. I especially liked the string beans with potatoes. The yogurt was unseasoned, so that was not too impressive, but everything else was very delicious. The meal was tasty, filling, and very affordable. I highly recommend Dil-e Punjab and will visit again. Chelsea is nearly a wasteland for Indian food, so this place is great!
