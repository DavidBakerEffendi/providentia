HALAL AND I HAVE A LOVE/HATE RELATIONSHIP. Holy shit, I can handle spice... I mean I drench EVERYTHING in hot sauce....Buuuuuuuuuuut your red sauce is probably the spiciest I've ever tried. like DAMN. I came after a long drunken night and drenched my shit in red sauce... could not breath after the two bites and immediately felt a sharp pain in my stomach, but that did not stop me. That's how bomb halal is. omg. BEST drunken food ever. Hahaha our cab driver the last night had a "connect"... we skipped the annoying line and he pulled to the side and had a couple handed to us. DRIVE THRU HALAL CONNECT, hollaaaaaaaaa
