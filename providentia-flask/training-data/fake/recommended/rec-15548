I'll start off by saying that overall, the food was good. However, I don't think I'll ever go back, especially considering how many amazing Italian restaurants there are in this city. We went early, around 5pm, and missed the dinner crowd. I can definitely say that I was not impressed with the service. They were not knowledgable about the menu, and even told us not to order the duck. I thought that was odd--shouldn't you want to the food here? For the appetizer, we ordered a variety of the bruschette. The mushroom and arugula was perfect. So good, in fact, that we asked for a second order. The next round was burnt and chewy. Seriously, what a downer! The entrees were all pretty good--the red fingerling gnocchi is such a different flavor and I would definitely recommend that. I thought that the mezzelune alla boscaiola (pancetta ravioli with a creamy mushroom sauce) was a little bland and dry, and didn't have enough sauce. This was too bad because it did have the potential to be a great dish. The veal ragu and scallops wrapped in prosciutto were delicious. The wine and atomsphere were great for a Sunday dinner, but I don't think I'll ever come back to Uva.
