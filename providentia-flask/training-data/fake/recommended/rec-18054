The food is undoubtedly delicious. But if you order on Grubhub they have a RIDICULOUS delivery minimum. Not only that, but they take forever (no matter how close you are), my orders are often wrong, and the last two times I ordered delivery, my food was cold. (Cold Dan-dan noodles are not very tasty.) If you want to try this, I recommend eating there and not ordering delivery otherwise it will leave you with a very bad impression. If I could give the delivery 1 star I would, but 3 was awarded for the fact that the food *is* good.
