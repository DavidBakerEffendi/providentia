Things you already know: they have an awesome beer selection & killer burgers. I've gone twice two years apart.  I live in RI so it's not that easy to make it to Elm City or else I'd be a regular.  Both times were for my birthday since it was a halfway point between my home & my family in CT making it easy for us all to meet. Our waitress was a bit overwhelmed since we had a party of 9.  My sister & her husband couldn't find the place after parking & our waitress was nice enough to get on the phone with them & guide them there.  She definitely earned her tip that night. I got the smoker & I'm craving it right now.  Loved the cheese & bacon plus they cooked it medium just the way I like it.  Meat was flavorful & the bun was solid.  Fries weren't the best I've had but good.  Next time I'd like to try their wings! I had 3 beers & they were all amazing.  I can't stop thinking of the Rogue Oatmeal Stout!  The Anchor Christmas & West Coast IPA were pretty damn good too. They have a kids menu which includes a hot dog so my 3 year old was happy.  My wife's only complaint was about the onion on her BLT.  My mother & sister both got salads.  If the salad wasn't good my mother would've said something.  She seemed happy with her meal & the service which is never an automatic. We had a party of 9 & our bill was just over $150 including a mandatory 15% gratuity for parties of 8 or more.  I'm still amazed a meal for that many people was so cheap. I'd give them 5 stars but their hosts can be a bit rude.  As other reviewers have stated the place is LOUD but it's a beer bar so you shouldn't be offended by noise.  Finding parking in the area is a challenge.  But after filling up on great beer & amazing burgers you tend to forget these things as long as you can find your car after you pay your bill.
