"Im not going in there.  Tacky name.  Stupid." "Nope--we're trying it.   If it sucks I'll buy." My agent snagged me.  THANK GOD!  This place was so f***ing good that I am writing a five star review on it and I am a Native Caifornian back in California.  I was just out there as Yale was on my short list for grad schools. I had a pesto swordfish there I still dream about.  The waiter was so professional and courteous.  And everything my group had was PERFECT.  In fact--we still talk about this place and next time I'm back in town I will be at this place as soon as I land. Just a side note.  One of our guests spilled their water all over the table cloth.  The waiter came over and REMOVED the entire cloth and replaced it in a second with a brand new one.  He then says--"I would not want you dining with a wet cloth under your plates--that is unacceptable..." Now that is service--and part of the reason I am writing this review TWO YEARS LATER!  Go to Goodfellas--don't let the name give you any ideas--it is amazing.
