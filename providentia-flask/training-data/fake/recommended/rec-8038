Been here a few times for breakfast and brunch.  Overall, it's super pricey, and I'm not entirely sure it's worth the hype and cost it charges for its food. Being located in the Four Seasons, there's undoubtedly a premium associated with that, but the food just seemed uninspired and quite unoriginal.   Also, skip the side of turkey bacon, it comes out overcooked and tasteless.  Though the breakfast potatoes are always a classic.
