I should be working right now but I was a little too excited to write this review and if I started it last night after my cocktails at little branch I would likely have forgotten something. I am honestly stuck between 4 stars and 5 stars. I eyes rolled with how delictable my meal was and the overall dining experience. Started off with a glass of reisling and it was too dry for my taste. Literally my tongue went dry I hold that expectation with mainly reds than whites. The waitress was prompt and accommodating and suggested a different white I liked it more than the original choice but..still didn't tickle my fancy. Â (minus half a star) Decor: LOVED the touch of cherry blossoms, exposed brick, dim lighting, wood tables and beams, decent space between tables. Great date place and very impressive. Decent bar seating area and they had good music in the background from fiona apple to stevie wonder. Appetizer: We shared a beef carpaccio. It was a cheeseburger without a bun, you have your cheese, beef, mayo hollandaise and tomato and lettuce. Ok I really liked how the meal was presented (see photos). The flavors came together and made sense. BUT I think parmasean cheese is too pungent and strong of a flavor with this combination & the french fries in the meal took away from it; I'm not a huge fan of fries. On side maybe more appropriate than in the meal. ( minus half a star) Entree: This gets me excited. I had the yellowfin tuna cooked medium rare over leeks and carmelized, love the flavors, I ate the entire meal and didn't leave a drop on my plate. He ordered the lamb shank, it was soft, juicy, fell off the bone, it was hearty, I felt like I was eating comfort food. We sat quicky, service was timed perfectly. I didn't feel rushed; the busyboy came over numerous time to fill-up our water cups. We were asked if we'd like more bread. It was a great dining experience.
