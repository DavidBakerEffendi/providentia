I enjoyed my brunch here.. I went here a few months ago with a friend.. man oh man... The food was delicious.. (was it the best I've ever ever had?) Heck No! But why be so critical? Listen I enjoyed it.. was it spacious? HECK NO! it's New York! We are always in a crowd! if you want to be isolated STAY HOME! lmao.. I seriously enjoyed my brunch here. I'd love to go back the drinks are very good the food was delicious I recommend this spot. The only thing is when I went on a Sunday.. or was it Saturday? I'm not sure but when I went we had to wait for a while (meaning 20-40 minutes).. but... just enjoy your date make conversation.. meet new people.. ENJOY LIFE! After a few drinks... 2 appetizers.. and 2 entrees my bill was 90 bucks for two. Expensive? eh...... I'll say their prices were average. No worries mate! (Australian accent)
