I often go to Tria on a whim and wonder why I don't go more often. It is always pleasant and service is professional and warm. Nice wine selection and beers too! After reading a few of the reviews I realized that Tria is often too crowded for us to wine and dine. Some of the reviewers don't like to waste money on drinks so to them I ask why would they go to a wine bar? Just to take up valuable space for us wine and food lovers? Go somewhere else and free up some space for us!
