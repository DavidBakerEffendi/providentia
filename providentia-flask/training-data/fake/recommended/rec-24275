Found this little place from a gluten free website. It's a cute little local place. We sat at the bar, as there was some sort of large party taking up most of the restaurant when we went. Â There were a lot of great choices on the menu. The food was yummy and our "server" explained the meaning of the names and joked with us while we ate. We also got to briefly meet the chef. The meal was very inexpensive and we left feeling satisfied.
