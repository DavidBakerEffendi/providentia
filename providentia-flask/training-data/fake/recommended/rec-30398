Went on 4/29 with two friends. We were seated promptly which was nice on a Sunday. The food was mediocre and expensive. The mimosa ok and the beer ok too. I had the croque madame, I though it was fine. My friend had the eggs with the red wine something and it looked like pig slop. My other friend had some other egg dish and he said it was nothing special. Â We each had a drink, 140.00 bill. **The one thing that we did notice was how hungover and miserable the staff looked. At first we thought it was just our waitress but then we looked around and laughed. All of them looked seriously tore up. Messy hair, wrinkled clothes, and kind of dirty looking. I'd expect more for a restaurant in the Time Warner (I've beent o Avoce and loved it). TIP: Girls and boys of Landmarc, take a shower before you come to work! I brought up how if you go to for example Hillstones, the waitstaff is so well put together. It really does make a difference. Overall a so-so experience, no need to come back. I know they are renovating and I hope they start with the benches. I my seat had a big hole in it. We joked that you could go to the bathroom right there (sorry for the image). The cotton candy at the end was nice but gimmicky.
