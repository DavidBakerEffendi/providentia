Really nice place...it's pricey but you are warned of this. Love the atmosphere. It's cozy and inviting, the staff are so nice and very professional. Really liked their old-style waitering outfits, complete with armbands. I wanted to try Walter Foods because I knew the head bartender is co-owner and his speciality is old-fashioned cocktails (think Singapore Slings, Tom Collins). I went here for a birthday drink or two (the best dark and stormy ever) and ended up treating myself to the lobster club. This, I feel was way too expensive ($24) for a sandwich. But it was a big sandwich and delicious for the most part...my one feeling is the sauce that was on there was a little too thick. Lobster is a rich taste and too much of sauce is overwhelming. My friends ordered the pork chops and steak - no complaints there. Plates cleaned. Blissful smiles. We also tried the fruit crumblecake - yum yum yum. Being late November, it was cold and windy out. This food warmed us up - we could face anything after that meal. Cocktails run about $11. I tried the Singapore Sling and then had a dark and stormy (made with Gosling rum, Gosling being the creator of this cocktail). Seriously, if you are fan of the dark & stormies, this is the best one I have ever tasted. I could drink it forever. Bottom line: Walter Foods is a great place for something special: a birthday, an anniversary, a celebration of something wonderful. Despite it's expensiveness, you really do get your money's worth and walk away feeling more than satisfied. Â P.S. Should you need to use the facilities while here, the bathrooms are terrific. They've kept some of the old detailing, used soft lighting and we loved the cottony-soft paper towels.
