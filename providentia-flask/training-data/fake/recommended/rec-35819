About three minutes wait for seats since there are only like 5 picnic tables and its very small and cramped. Ordered the chicken pasta and it was slamming!!!!!!!!! My mouth is still watering from it and I want to eat another one right now!!!  It was really flavorful!!!! The only thing I didn't like is that there isn't much privacy because you have to sit next to strangers on the same table. No space to move at all.  But I love the food and love it when the ppl on my table left I had more air to breathe
