Toloache makes you wanna fiesta!! My entire experience was just happiness. The service is above and beyond...my server (had I not had so many of the delicious drinks she recommended I would remember her name!) was just awesome, she was on point with appetizer recommendations (the pomegranate guac-is to live for!), she also recommended the beef tacos and some of the most tasty margaritas I've ever had! The managers Luis and Ricardo are so much fun, I felt like I had known them forever because of their warm, lighthearted hospitality. Everything was perfection and it's truly a dis service to your Mexican craving taste buds to not go! See you there!
