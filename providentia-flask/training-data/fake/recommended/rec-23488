This place is a hidden gem for authentic mexican food.. I've always been a fan of their sister restaurant 'el bandido' in spring valley NY. If you're looking for pure authentic Â mexican food that hasn't been diluted to appease the commercial crowd then this is the place for you. I'm honestly surprised of the other bad reviews and would suspect they're coming from competitors. The service and food here is great. The waiters are very attentive as well. The sangria is really good as well as must compliment to your meal especially if you're in the mood to drink. The only complaint I have about this place is that it seems relatively quiet at times and they don't seem to have a mariachi band like the other location does but other than that this place is still an ace!
