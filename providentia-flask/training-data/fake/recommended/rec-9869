Went there over the summer. Traditional Serbian restaurant with good food, great service- the waitresses were amazing and super friendly, and great decor-black and white photos on the walls, pretty cute. Had the burger with kajmak, my bf had the stuffed burger which was great. For dessert it was palacinke-crepes and wheat- zito. will come back for sure!!
