Momofuku Ssam, you stole my heart that evening. We entered at 5:15 on a Sunday evening and were seated right away. The four of us started off with a bottle of champagne and ordered. As C M. and I took our first bite of the steamed bun, we said "wow" - literally simultaneously. Our friend J.O. could only nod in agreement, his mouth full and eyes wide in "mmm" thoughts. Two big chunks of pork belly were piled softly in a white bun laced with hoisin, cucumbers, and scallions. Edward's wigwam ham (surry, va) - soft, smoky ham sliced as thin as prosciutto. It came with a spicy honey mustard and warm, crusty baguette. A perfect pairing of sweet and smoked meat. Beets - rhubarb, labne, meringue. Simply amazing. Beet sorbet lay under a thin beet meringue crust, all above a soft and creamy layer of labne yogurt, with more beet and chunks of rhubarb. I was in love with this dish of purple. Chili soft shell crab - green tomato, asparagus, lemon confit. The lemon was a little overpowering on the skin, but the crab was cooked to a crispy finesse that cut to the knife, revealing thick and savory crab. Stuffed quail (cavendish farms, vt) - sticky rice, shiitake, sour mustard greens. The quail replaced the familiar green wrap of an even more familiar filling of glutinous rice. The rice portion was my favorite, but the quail meat gave it a nice gamey touch. Bev eggleston's pork shoulder steak - golden raisin, miso, spinach. Sliced and well prepared, with just a bit of char. Service was really friendly and quick. The people in the kitchen said hi as I walked by (before it got really busy). Â The wine and drinks list is long and diverse enough. I LOVE this place.
