I loved the burger and the rest of the food looked just as appetizing.  The decor is referencing some kind of old hunting club motif, and I'm just not too fond of all the taxidermy, but that's just my taste.  The location is great, tucked into the dead end of an alley in the LES.  All in all, a great place with high quality food and pleasant service.  I heard that the new place PEEL'S on Bowery is their current new venture.  Will have to give it a go.
