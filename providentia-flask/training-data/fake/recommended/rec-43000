I work across the street and one day at lunch I decided to give it a shot.  Boy am I happy I did.   I first checked it out a 3-4 weeks ago.  It's the best falafel I've had in a long time. The place is itself is very nice.  It's very clean and brightly lit unlike most eateries in the area so it gets points before you even order the food.  I've had a 2 or 3 different items on the menu and each was really good but I must say The African in a whole wheat pita is my favorite.  The spicy peanut sauce they put on it is soooooooo good.  Don't waste time with the salads, just go for the sandwich.  I promise you'll like it.
