$5 FOR 5 TACO TUESDAY!!  Place was clean and it actually had HOT sauce.  Like not salsa con aqua but actually real hot sauce!!  Taco's were kinda small but 12.50 for 2 meals and a drink.  I def will be back if I am in the area but my love belongs to Ralph's...it's an obsession.  TACO TUESDAY!! I LOVE TACOS
