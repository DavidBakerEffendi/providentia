Peaches, peaches, peaches.  My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant this past Saturday.  There were no tables available so we were told we could sit at the bar.  The bartender was ok.  She forgot to give us silverware but made us really great drinks from their limited  drink menu.  We had the wings. delicious.  The sausage chicken gumbo...delicious.  The blackened cat fish sandwich...delicious, the barbeque fries...delicious and the chips and spinach dip....not so great.  A live band was performing as we came in but were packing up shortly after we sat down at about 2:30pm.  I wish we could've gotten there early so that I could've heard more of the band.  As we were leaving the waiter was telling arriving guests that they could only order from the appetizer menu from 4 to 5pm as they transitioned to the dinner menu from 5pm on so if you're going to visit Peaches go well before 4 or after 5pm.  Overall I really enjoyed the experience and will be returning soon.  Peaches is truly a gem in the heart of Bed-Stuy.
