Cool bar next to my favorite bar Drop Off Service!  Service with a smile :) Decent selection of beers on tap and decent food to start your night out!  Place seems to be more a drink spot and not food when looking at the scene, but definitely a fun scene!     Pros:   friendly bar staff and strong martini drinks are great along with the different taps of beer as well. Cons:  ordered Kimchi dumplings and wasn't too impressed not much Kimchi so the food might be weak, but oh well its the drinks and atmosphere that counts there.
