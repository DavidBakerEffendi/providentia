The best thing here was the lychee martini, this would probably be the only thing to bring me back. I came here with 2 friends and at first sight walking through the door, you would think its a bar only but there are a couple seating areas for dinner and what not. So here's the low-down, the fried shrimp shumai didn't seem very special, you can hardly taste the shrimp but it was okay, not bad, dragon fries are okay as well.. different taste of fries and something new to try, dragon wings, not as spicy as they say it is and is mainly just like a spicy buffalo wing minus the blue cheese dip, i thought the sliders were going to be a must try but fell flat and not special as well, for entree I had the bulgogi rice bowl, disappointing since it was just a bowl of rice with meat on top. Overall, I would come for drinks and appetizers, thought the restaurant area would be bigger but mainly is a bar, and definitely come during happy hour for half price drinks!
