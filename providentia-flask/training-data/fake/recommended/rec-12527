This place is five minutes from the home and I use to frequent here every Sunday. The food was great and the wait on Sundays was ridiculous!!! Â After visiting a month straight the service began to go downhill, my wait time was quoted 10-20 minutes and the hostess forgot about me and sat other parties that came after me before me, when we finally sat down to eat I ordered my food (I usually get the farm burger). The waiter never came back to my table to refill my coffee, he never came back to check on our food period. He only came by to drop off the check. I usually tip 20% but only gave him 10% I felt as if I was too gracious. I've never been back, I'm giving them time to shape up
