Great beer selection, spacious, great tapas menu (while 8 out of 10 items were fantastic -- the other 2 were prepared well) and the staff was amazing! I stumbled upon this place randomly last week - the chef came out to greet us took the time to inquire about our experience. I chose to bring some friends a few days later visiting from out of town. The owner heard it was our birthday and treated us to champagne. A+ for service, Open Door!! :)
