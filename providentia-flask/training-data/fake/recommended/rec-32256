Great little bar in Fairmount and easily my favorite haunt since moving to the neighborhood. The outdoor seating is perfect on nights like tonight where all you want to do is be outside sipping on a great beer with some amazing eats. Tap selections is always manageable and you can find something for just about anyone to enjoy, the food is great too, particularly the pulled pork according to my pork loving roomie or the nachos. All in all, another one that you can't miss if you live in Philadelphia.
