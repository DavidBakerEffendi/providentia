Very basic menu of Pizza and Salad. Beer selection was good. Overall I would give the food a 4. The dining area was a bit overcrowded with wait staff bumping into each other. Also, the wait staff was not very observant nor did they check back in with us. Both of us went through the entire meal without receiving plates! We ended up eating on out napkins. The service gets a 2.
