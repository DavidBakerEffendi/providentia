I stopped in for brunch with my sister who was visiting from out of town on a tip  from a friend and was not disappointed. I had the cornmeal waffles which were awesome and she had the shrimp and grits which were equally as good. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about each menu item. I  really liked the interior of the space and the feel of the place. I will go back to try the dinner menu soon. Keep up the good work.
