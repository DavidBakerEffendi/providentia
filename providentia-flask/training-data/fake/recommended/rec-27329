I've eaten here twice. Once for lunch, once for dinner. Both times the entrees (pork tostadas, open faced quesadilla) were good, but nothing spectacular. I'm not typically a fan of "frozen" drinks but the blood orange margaritas were delicious. The sangria was REALLY strong. It didn't taste anything like any other sangria I've ever had so I asked the waitress what exactly was in it. I think it was the Patron that set it apart. It was good, but I would stick with the margarita next time. I've had the original guacamole and the one with the goat cheese in it. Both were fantastic. I would come here for margaritas and guacamole in a heartbeat. Take a picture in the photo booth and post it on the wall and enjoy the ambiance. If you're looking for dinner, go somewhere else.
