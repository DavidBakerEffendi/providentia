What a great new place! In Riva is a breath of fresh air in East Falls and our experience was nothing short of fantastic. Wine: the $6 house Pinot Noir was pretty nice Apps: the meatballs and charred octopus were both delicious, but the vasi stole the show. We got the ceci and lentils which came as almost a bruschetta of sorts, and it was amazing! Pizza: the sausage/peppers and cippolini pizzas were both excellent Overall, we absolutely enjoyed our time at In Riva. It has great service, food, and ambience and is the perfect new addition to East Falls and Kelly Drive.
