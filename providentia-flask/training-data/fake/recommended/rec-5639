I've been to Kite & Key a few times now and I can say they have a pretty good beer selection and a decent food menu. I've been there on a Friday night when the business was fairly slow and I've been there on a Friday night when you can't get a seat and the noise level is beyond moderate.   I've tried the vegetable flatbread (pretty standard) and the veggie burger (seriously delicious but comes as a double burger...I wasn't even sure how to go about eating it).   Service is kind of hit or miss.  Not a bad place to grab some food and a drink considering it's right in my neighborhood.
