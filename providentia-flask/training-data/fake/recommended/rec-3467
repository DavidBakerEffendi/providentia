Incredibly romantic evening. Spent three hours enjoying great company and great food. The minestrone soup was THE BEST I've had. The prosciutto pizza was pretty good. The chocolate Mudd cake... served warm... was orgasmic. So rich and mouth watering. My belly is full and happy. I feel so peaceful and warm. The service was the best of all. Our waiter Wesley was not only incredibly handsome, but never failed to refill my water. I will definitely be coming back.
