Went here with my boyfriend and was not disappointed.  -- Cheap, fatty, spicy tex-mex food with quick service.  All the food was really fresh.  Their jalapeño popper is DELICIOUS and is definitely made to order. The bean dip was really like a cheese and bean dip, to my delight.  The shrimp tacos were awesome -- a nice amount of tender shrimp with the perfect amount of spicy mayo.   The servings are sizable and the service is friendly.  There are a few tv's for watching a game and/or Avatar, which was on when when we got there. We waited about 10 minutes for a table on a Sunday at around 3.  My only complaint was that the acoustics made it a little hard to hear, but all in all this was a great spot for soaking up lasts night's drinks.
