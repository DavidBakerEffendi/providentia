Ate at Hana for the first time tonight -- discovered they just acquired their liquor license today.  Service was prompt, courteous and attentive.  Food was excellent --  Miso Soup and Hibachi Soup were both enjoyable.  Vegetarian Sushi offered a nice assortment and attractive presentation.  Hibachi Chicken was large portion, delicious freshly made fried rice, and assortment of vegetables.  Seafood dipping sauce was superb.  Will return for eat in or take out.
