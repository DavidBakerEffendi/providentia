This place is over rated.  Mind you I just went for brunch, and the food was good - but I do not see what all the hype is about.  We had 3 dishes, asparagus, fettuccine and the trout salad.  All good, but I thought this place was a heavy hitter?  Not to mention that all the food was on the table before I got my drink.  I will not be back - at least not for Brunch.
