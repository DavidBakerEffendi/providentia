Agree that cocktails are adventurous and creative, from the staff's introduction to the presentation. Speakeasy atmosphere in FiDi fill the gap for the area. However, servers seemed uptight and the wait for upstairs was too long to stand outside. Servers are pretentious and kept asking if I've been here before (not sure why when I work on the same block). Overpriced as well.
