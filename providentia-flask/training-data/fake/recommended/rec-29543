First off, if you like food/beverages with a horseradish kick, then you MUST try the Bloody Mary ("the Butcher" they call it).  It has a wonderful, refreshing kick that I haven't had in other drinks. The food was very good, but my boyfriend had to get pizza immediately afterwards - somewhat disheartening after dropping $150 for dinner for two.  The serving sizes are more appropriate for slim socialites rather than young male 20-somethings that work out. The vibe of the place was upscale but not arrogant.  The clientele on a Sat night were older than I would have expected, after hearing how trendy this place is. Bottom line: underrated for drinks & overrated for food.  I'd recommend taking a date here for cocktails and cheese plates.
