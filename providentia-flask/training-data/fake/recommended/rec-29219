So I went here for my birthday. Im still new to the area and everytime I go to the laundromat I see this place is packed. Even at the most random times on a week day, it is packed. So my mother, aunt and I went to this place. I have to say they are a very professional place. They keep that line moving even though there are tons of people. They are respectful, they get your order and send you on your way. My only issue was that the cheesesteak was just ok. It wasn't awful but it wasn't the most amazing one I have had either. But I did like the atmosphere and one lady we sat next to had been going there for years. I will probably give this place another chance though.
