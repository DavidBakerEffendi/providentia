Excuse this French for not having French Macaroons It was raining and cold compared to my sunny California. We were running against the reservation time through the subway station just to get in time for some famously known French cuisines and bakery in Soho, better be worth it! After a good 30 minutes of hustle and bustle, we arrived and seated immediately. The scene was packed with tourists and locals, all the silverware noises "cling-clang" filled the entire room. The place reminded me of modern Moulin Rouge era where big rusty mirrors, white ceramic tiles, and giant red canopy can be found. -french onion soup. perfect for the weather. the best I've ever had. -steak tuna tartare with mini baguettes. scrumptious and flavorful. ask for extra baguettes 'coz four surely wasn't enough. -beef stroganoff with buttered noodles. perfectly stewed to tenderness. simply amazing. -duck shepherd's pie. so rich and full of flavor. kinda too heavy for me. -steak frites. so disappointing, it was flavorless and so chewy. but the fries, SO good! - ...then she brought us the wrong macaroons. french macaroon is light round thingy with creamy fillings, but what's up with this macaroon? not only ugly looking, it was painful to even take one bite out of it. pics - yummycrave.com/2010/04/bâ€¦
