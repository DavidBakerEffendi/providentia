Just moved around the corner from this place, and after wasting an entire day waiting for the internet guy to come (he never showed, it was a frustrating experience) I wanted something delicious to cheer me up. I went for the lobster roll, and it was absolutely amazing. It came on a pretzel roll (10 inches long is my guess? it was huge) The amount of lobster was very generous and was also topped with avocado. Came with a small side of fries and a salad all for $12. A total steal, and it turned my frown upside down. It's also worth noting that the guy at the counter was friendly and even came out to ask everyone how their food was a few minutes after bringing it out to us.
