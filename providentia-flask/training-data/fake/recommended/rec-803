Soooo ... I absolutely  don't understand that awful motorcycle sculpture or whatever it is located at the bar it' instantly makes me feel cheesy and annoyed .  I have dined here at least 5 times . First experience I felt like it was a glorified  chilies , and was only impressed by the awesome tall comfy booths . My other experiences the food improved each time and was very satisfied and happy ! Love the photo booth and bathroom design. This place is more like a yuppy Mexican spot to be seen at , which is not my style at all ! Probably be back at some point but I walk past often and it's always crowded and loud full of bros with suits and over processed blondes who look fake from a block away ! I don't recall the actual service being good or bad which I guess i have a neutral feeling about it .
