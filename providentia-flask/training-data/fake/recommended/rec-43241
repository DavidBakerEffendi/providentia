Last time I visited Philly and knew nothing about it, a friend took me to the typical Pats and Ginos to try a cheesesteak. I remember being really freaked out by the mass amounts of  patriotic, and some racist, paraphernalia. This time around, I decided to find a more moms and pops, low-key *real* cheesesteak joint.  I read about Cosmi and stopped in. The small neighborhood deli vibe was really intimidating to walk into because I felt like the new guy walking into a family party, but my apprehension didn't last long because of the super friendly service. The guy at the register (i'm assuming he's the owner by our conversation) is really really nice. he struck up a conversation while we waited for our cheesesteaks and even mentioned how he was glad we decided to stop in at Cosmis instead of Pats and Ginos because he didn't think anyone should support a place that displayed such racist sentiments as "Speak English. This is America" as one of places (cant remember if its Pats or Ginos) has that at their order window. The cheesesteaks are good. I haven't really had many cheesesteaks so I'm not an expert, but I enjoyed my sandwich if that counts for anything. They have a long plastic table set up outside which was wonderful to sit and watch people while we ate because it was a beautiful day out. This place really is a friendly neighborhood deli. He greeted everyone by name as they walked by or came in. Cheesesteaks are between $6 and $8 depending what you add in them.
