This was a very quaint place with a cozy feeling type atmosphere. We went for Sunday brunch and were seated right away. Coffee was great. Homemade soda was very good, not too sweet. I ordered the "autumn veggie omelet", which had squash in it. Very tasty for a veggie omelet. I also ordered a pork sausage as a side dish which was yummy. Boyfriend ordered the pastrami hash - this was very tasty also. Size of the Portions were just right even if you are pretty hungry. The food did take very long to come out but everything was so fresh as if all the ingredients were hand picked from a farm minutes before they prepared it, so no complaints.
