My friend and I just ordered from this burger joint and insulted and disappointed is what I'm left with. Ordered delivery. Was told 40 mins. And hour and 10 minutes later I call and he says they got hit by a rush hour and pushed my order back and that the driver was just about to head out the door. I asked if the food was prepared hot and not old and he said yes. Food came cold to the touch, fried were old and ice cold, my shake flavor was wrong, my cookie that he was giving as an apology wasn't even put in the bag. Oh and je gave me a free soda...thanks. called back to ask if I could get my shake thar I actually paid for and how cold the burgers were and then he said he'd credit me the shake LOL really? I told him not to even bother coming back for the shake. They should be very disappointed in themselves. Oh and my lettuce on my burger was nasty. Safe the trouble and go somewhere else. Will never be ordering from this place.
