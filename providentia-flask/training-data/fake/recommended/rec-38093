From the moment we walked in from the pouring rain, my friend and I were treated with the utmost courtesy, kindness, and respect from everyone at Amelie! Due to the pelting precipitation outside, we opted for champagne. One glass, two glass, three glass...four, our bubbly was never empty. Although we, of course, had a dedicated waiter, whenever we needed anything someone was intuitively at our table immediately. That instinct, in my opinion, is imperative to client-centric success. The food was delicious, both of us having French onion soup and a frisée salad. Wonderfully seasoned and hot. (I like it hot) Following an amazing experience we hopped in a cab and headed back to midtown. As I began packing for the airport I couldn't find my ID anywhere. Not just my ID but my entire wallet. I immediately called the restaurant and my sweet friend told me he would wait and not leave well past closing time so that I can come and retrieve my necessary items.   20 minutes later I was greeted at the door with my wallet and a hug. I cannot thank the staff at Amelie enough for their epic consideration.
