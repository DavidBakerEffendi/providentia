This place was perfect for brunch. The selection of coffees is varied enough for the discriminaring tongue. Plus they served our coffee at the RIGHT temperature! Not too hot. I wonder if they let it cool or they control the temperature. Curried pumpkin seeds are also a yummy choice.  The helping is surprisingly larger and more filling than one would expect though so be careful not to eat too much of these or it will spoil the rest of your meal! Last time I tried the squash soup.  It was very good, and the toast with goat cheese was also tasty.  However, I brought some of this home since I couldn't finish it all, and let me tell you--it is TWICE as delicious with the plain-type toast I had at home.  I'd suggest that Kickshaw just get a loaf of fresh bread, slice it nice and thick, lightly toast it and drizzle it will olive oil.  Now THAT was delicious to dunk into this soup! They were playing some really good music (at least I liked it) last night - lots of 90's R'n'b hits.  And everybody there was friendly and having a good time.   I would highly recommend this place if you are in the area.
