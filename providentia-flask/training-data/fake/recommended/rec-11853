Although I've never eaten their meatballs, I can surely vouch for the ice cream sandwiches. I mean, you really can't get much better than a big scoop of homemade ice cream sandwiched between two soft, luscious cookies can you? I thought not. I ordered a sandwich with an oatmeal cranberry cookie and a snickerdoodle with caramel ice cream that absolutely made my heart skip a beat. Probably the creamiest, most delicious caramel ice cream I've ever tried. You can definitely tell that everything was fresh and homemade from quality ingredients. My friend ordered a sandwich with gingersnap cookies and vanilla ice cream that was also pretty magical. Without a doubt the best ice cream sandwiches in the city. Oh, and the staff is extremely friendly as well which is always appreciated.
