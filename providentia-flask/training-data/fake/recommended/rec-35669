The chef thinks that doughy tasteless pizza is a contribution to food culture.  It is not.  Try Alforno in Old Saybrook or Don Pepe in New Haven if you want gourmet pizza.  Bivio pizza is so bland and I wa quite surprised.  I expected so much better.  The reason pizza works is the acid flavor complementing the bread.  You won't find any taste contrasts here.  Just a chef who is full of himself.  For the best pizza in New Jersey go to The Star Tavern in South Orange.  It is not a fancy place.  But it is kid friendly (a baseball team was there when we last went and the boys were behaved and happy) and the pizza is so much better and not nearly as expensive. And no, I don't work for Star Tavern.  I just don't like overpriced pizza at a restaurant where the chef is too full of himself to add a topping or deny the table more bread.  Never going back.
