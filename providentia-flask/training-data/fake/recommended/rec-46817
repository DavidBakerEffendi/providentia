I've been back to the Yellow Plum several times since my first review, the menu has changed seasonally which is so refreshing, they get me to try things I wouldn't normally eat, based on the quality they offer & everything is so delicious.. for example all my life I've hated scallops, strange I know this gal loves seafood. Well.. Chef Lukic's are out of this world!! As are many of his other dishes not to mention deserts. Omg! leave room for desert!! I was in recently they had a king crab leg special so sweet, full of flavor just mouth-watering. Yum!! I eat at the bar most of the time; it's nice to see what everyone else is eating & their feedback. The bartender Erica is so friendly & accommodating; they have added some really great signature drinks. There is music at the bar on Fri nights at first it started out with drab piano music didn't pay much attention to but nice as background music, they seem to now have a rotation of different musicians each bring something fun. Speaking of fun.. I heard rumor of a tiki bar outside to accompany their beautiful outdoor patio. Looking forward to that for the summer. I'm happy to report they really have found their groove, such a nice neighborhood spot to grab a quick bite to eat, family dinner or event.
