My go-to place for cheap noodle soup. They also have other very good, cheap dishes. For soup, you can choose either Â shaved or hand drawn noodles. I always go with the shaved because they're fatter. I wouldn't recommend anywhere else for noodle soup for this price. Service is quick and efficient. Don't be surprised if, due to the place being crowded, you're seated only inches away from other people.
