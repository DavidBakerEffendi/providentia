I love Chavela's. My go-to order is the guacamole and chips, a Plato Don and the white sangria. I'm shocked to see people commenting that the food was bad here- because I come here quite often and every time it's delicious. Looking forward to trying brunch here sometime. It can get quite busy at times so be sure you have time to wait if you're going at peak hours. But in my opinion, it's totally worth the wait. So glad to have this awesome place in my neighborhood!
