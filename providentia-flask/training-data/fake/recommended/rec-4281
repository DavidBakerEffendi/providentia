If your looking for a place to have a quiet dinner,  this is not the place. Very loud atmosphere with close seating. I practically had to yell for my girlfriend to hear me. Clam chowder was good,  calamari had way to much batter,  could barely taste the calamari. I ended up not staying for the main course. Might try again on a weekday, but definitely wont go again for dinner.
