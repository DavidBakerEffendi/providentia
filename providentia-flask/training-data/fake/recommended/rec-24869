Zento is without a doubt the best sushi spot in the city for a whole host of reasons, conveniently laid out in list fashion: 1)  Chef is dominant.   Worked at Morimoto, presumably lived up to the Iron Chef's standards.  Rolls are creative & delicious. 2)  Fish is the freshest I've had in town.  Considering we're on a heavily trafficked water way, I'm always shocked when establishments have frozen, old, or just plain nasty fish.  Thankfully Zento takes advantage of our ocean-friendly placement. 3)  Location is strong...vibrant part of town, although you might want to wear shades to protect your eyes from the spiky Jersey blow-outs that infest Olde City on the weekends (I'd like to know who showed those people how to get across the river).  Popped Collars aside, I enjoy the pulse and hum of 2nd and Chestnut...great change of pace from the Squares in Rittenhouse. 4)  I've seen several posters on here complain that the price was too high, but I found quite the opposite to be true.  For my girlfriend and I to eat our fill of rolls and edamame, the cost was approx. $65 including tip.  This day in age, I'm fired up any time I can escape the dinner table with a sub-$100 tab. 5)  Save the best for last.  Jimmy the waiter!  Extremely attentive.  I've got a sneaking suspicion that he might have a mild crush on my girlfriend and her friends, but that's fine with me if it guarantees prompt service, hilarious jokes, and consistent positive vibes. Zento is one of the best BYOB's that I've been to in the city and my vote for the best sit down sushi spot in town (VIC is the best take-out). Affordable + Tasty + Vibrant + Free Cool Breeze Waiter = Numero Uno.
