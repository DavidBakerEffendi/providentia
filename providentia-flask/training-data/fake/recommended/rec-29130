if you like attentive service from your waiter this is not the place. on the early Â side of saturday night my girlfriend and I stumbled upon the chocolate bar and after remembering a friend's over excited recounting of his visit we decided to give it a try. the wait for our table compared to a few other restaurants was a mere 15 minutes. after being seated and going over both mouth watering menus, our waiter finally arrived, and well that was only one of a handful of visits. it took over 15 min for the cocktails to arrive, after that our food took another 30, dessert was surprisingly quick given the first part of are meal took 45 min. the food was good and dessert was amazing, but when the only thing your waiter says to you is what do you want and are you done with your plate. it really makes me regret spending as much money and time as i did on this place.
