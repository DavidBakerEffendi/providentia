Hooorraayy! Windows Phone app can finally write reviews! Now down to business. I stop by the charming little row of restaurants Â after a visit to the Penn Muesum. My girlfriend and I decide to stop by the white dog cafe to take advantage of a checkin deal. Although the free beer was great. Everything else was entirely overpriced. Yes the food was good but the depending on what size plates you order. It is miniature , tiny, and small. All of the ingredients are local and fresh. However, no one could tell me if there pork products had nitrates in them. If you pride yourself on using fresh and local and depend a higher price it seems irrational to have nitrates to cheaply cure your meats. Lastly our waiter was a nice man but seem to lack focus on us because we weren't middle aged Penn alumni.
