Used to come here quite often.  Last visit was on Tuesday night at 7pm. The food was excellent as it always has been! BUT, gave the rating only 2 stars though because the waiter we had this last visit was horrible. Only came to the table 3x - first for the order, then when he brought the food out, and then last when he brought the check out, which we had to ask another waiter  for several times.  He kept disappearing to unpack wine bottles and fiddle around behind the counter with the other waiters.  The people at the table next to us were pissed off for the same reason. He kept apologizing to them for the service when he finally came to the table.  You could see him the whole time though just meandering about behind the counter which added insult to injury. Problem with this restaurant is that although the food and desserts are fantastic, and they really are, the service can be downright horrible and unprofessional at times.
