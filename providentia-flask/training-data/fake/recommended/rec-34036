Holy crap.  This place is amazing.  It is truly a foodie paradise, it's also a great place to turn a not-so-adventurous eater into a believer.  I had the shishito cuatro sel, which is their answer to a marinated olives or edamame bar snack.  Super delicious and interesting.  Followed it up with the steak tartare, my favorite thing of the evening by far and had the fish and chips for an entree.  It's a whole freakin' fish!  The charming bartender sent out the shumai while my bro and I were waiting for our fish, the wasabe in those effers is no joke, but it's really good.  The only reason I have four stars is because the joint needs to be expanded for winter months (it gets pretty cramped in there on a Friday night) and the wine list could be a bit bigger as well.  Other than that I can't wait to go back when it's warm and loiter on their awesome back patio.
