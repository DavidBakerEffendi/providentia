Sad place and will not return....EVER!!!! There is not much about food, the appetizer section is extremely sad, please DO NOT ORDER the Wedge salad, it's a joke!! The entrees  that we ordered  chicken and the NY strip steak were not so bad, but nothing amazing that  you have to visit this place. This place deserves only one star, but since the entrees were ok-ok I decided to give it one extra star. Only one server who was trying to keep up.......not succeeding much though, he had to be reminded for everything from water, bread..... The menu listed on yelp is not a true representation of this restaurant, more than half the stuff is missing and when asked, you promptly are being answered that it's not the season...... really??? How can you not have those dishes cause of which people have given you 4 stars....that's pathetic!! Tea lights are kept for decorations on each table since none of them were lit. Please don't waste your time, money and appetite on this one, there are many more amazing places around this neighborhood. The food is as sad as the place looks sad n run down.
