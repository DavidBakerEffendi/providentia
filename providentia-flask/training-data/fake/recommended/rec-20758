I was expecting much more...so much more. Considering I've been told this was one of the best burgers in town. Unfortunately, it wasn't. I thought Burger Joint was better. On the flip side though, the patties were fat and juicy, medium done which I did like and the fries were yummy. J was kinda surprised by its dive-bar interior. I suppose we were expecting a burger place not a bar. Anywhoo, at 3pm on a Saturday it was full and just when we were done eating and stepped outside, it started to POUR!!! boo.
