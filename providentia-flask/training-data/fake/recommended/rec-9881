The entrees took a long time to come out, around 15-20min, but luckily we had ordered the calamari appetizer. The calamari is seasoned well and comes with a garlic yogurt sauce for dipping. The complimentary Turkish bread that came is fine, nothing spectacular, so we didn't bother filling up on it. The Kofte kebab comes with 4 big flavorful meatballs. The swordfish is charred and has a great meaty flavor. Both dishes came with pilaf rice, salad, and carrots. The servings are huge here. The service is attentive and polite. The menu isn't large but they do a great job on each dish. The dishes are about $15 each and the portions are worth the price. The crowd eating here is a bit older and it's quiet place to have a low key chat.
