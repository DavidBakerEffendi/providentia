Delicious food, good waiters, horrible customer service from the manager/owner? on a busy Saturday. I went last night to celebrate my Birthday and saw many people leave because the wait was ridiculously long (no reservations on Friday/Sat), and because of the lack of tact from the owner. As I was standing next to the hostess booth I heard the owner describe people by their skin color. I was the only person of color with my group and when we were finally called to be seated after a long wait, the owner decides to make a joke and say 'Are all these white people with you?' What the hell does that have to do with anything and how is that in any way professional? The last thing that you want to hear after waiting hours to sit is a smart mouthed comment from someone who is supposed to be providing me with costumer service. Delicious food, but the owner is a douche!
