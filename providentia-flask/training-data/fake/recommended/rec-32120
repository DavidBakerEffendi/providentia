Luna is such a fabulous find in the heart of Chelsea. This modest neighborhood coffee shop boasts delicious iced and hot coffees freshly brewed each day, and decadent mid-afternoon treats! This is the only coffee shop with iced coffee cubes, homemade pumpkin spices lattes (yes- they bake their own pumpkins, Starbucks) as well as NEWLY INTRODUCED empanadas and abuela's homemade salsa. You will be in Latin heaven upon taking your first bite. I'm so glad I found this place. It makes the workday less stressful being able to sit with my laptop and delicious purchase, among coffee-loving New Yorkers and a friendly staff. One of the baristas is pretty cute too. Always a fan of eye candy with my coffee ;)
