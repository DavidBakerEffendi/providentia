You'd think there'd be something special about the sauces but there isn't. We sampled seven different ones (three of which were recommended by the server) before deciding none of them were worth paying for and went with good ole ketchup. There is nothing special about the fries either. In fact, I'd say the fries at Mcdonald's taste better. Finished half of the regular cone and couldn't stomach it anymore; got rid of the rest. I'm never coming back. Don't waste your time.
