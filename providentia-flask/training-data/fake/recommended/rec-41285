Maybe it was the high expectations or the 4 hour wait that made us make Ippudo a MUST GO TO place before we left New York, but I am a bit disappointed. I thought the ramen was good, but the highly anticipated number 1 ramen joint in New York had to see my bowl unfinished. I couldn't eat the entire meal. I tried Chuko in Brooklyn the night before, and I have to say that Chuko wins over Ippudo. This is a non-biased review from a girl who does not live in New York. I would come back for the buns. Great job there.
