I've eaten all around Philly, and one word that sums up the race st. cafe is inconsistency.  The Tilapia was as bland as the water, what a mess.  The only thing that earned this place a star, in my eyes, was the beer selection.  In a city filled with exquisite culinary locations, do not waste your time going here and leaving your palette yearning for more.
