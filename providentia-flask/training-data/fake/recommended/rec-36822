This is a great place to people watch. We came for drinks on a Saturday night and sat out on the sidewalk. Saw quite a few bachelorette parties walk by. At least 4, loved the one in the hideous 80's prom dresses. People, ok girls in stiletto's, were constantly tripping over the grate. And why does everyone in this town honk like a crazy person? There's nowhere for anyone to move because the street is narrow and everyone who apparently wants to be seen wants to drive down it. Can't comment about the food, but I would definitely come back to enjoy the atmosphere next time I'm in Philly.
