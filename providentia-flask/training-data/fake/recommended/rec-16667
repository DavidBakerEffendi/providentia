A very authentic spanish tapas bar. Typical place to go for a glass of wine and a good piece of tortilla espa√±ola. And if you are having a good time, then you stay for more. The food doesn't disappoint and the young man at the bar (from Valencia I think) is very knowledgable of the excellent selection of wines they have (several of them by the glass). Price is fair. Definitely a place to stop by.
