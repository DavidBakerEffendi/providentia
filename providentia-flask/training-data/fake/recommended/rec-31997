wow!  surprised to find that I like German food- if done well.  What a great space on South Street.  Picked from an overwhelming beer selection with the help of our waiter.  Servers are very knowledgeable (and nice).  Here's what the table ordered: sauerkraut fritters, foie gras liverwurst/cherry compote, tons of sausage platt,  a wurst brett, pilzstrudel (was so very good with smoked barley inside a crispy strudel shell), schweinshaxe.  Every single order was reported to be yummy and interesting.  (Did I mention great service?) Then somehow we managed to eat the Bavarian pretzel bread pudding (the best!) and an apple and a pear strudel.  Rolled out of there delighted!   Nothing like it anywhere around -I know it's been said before - but  you will not be disappointed.
