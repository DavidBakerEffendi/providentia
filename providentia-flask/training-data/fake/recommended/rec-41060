The space is small but cozy. Might have trouble getting seated for dinner without a reservation and possibly lunch. The food was delicious. We went before 4pm and had unlimited sangria for $14/person. They were strong but tasty, well worth it. Strongly recommend the Ropa Vieja and the Vaca Frita as well.
