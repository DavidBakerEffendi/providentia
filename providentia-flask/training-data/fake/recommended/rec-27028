Don't even bother this place is horrible! They play bait and switch with the prices. Their advertised price that we received in the money mailer is not the price they charge you! We also arrived a full 2 hours before closing and not once did they replenish the buffet. Most trays had a spoonful of food left in it. This place won't last long a huge disappointment!
