Tim is a rockstar. We went here for our first time last Tuesday. The draft/bottle list is better than most places with a solid food menu. (Typically you're comprising one or the other at bars in philly..) Tim was awesome for dealing with customers like us. We work closely in the beer community and are extremely picky. Long story short - He gave us the hookup. He knows beer, and even treated us to some apps that we were wary of. Food and service deserve 10 stars. The only reason for 4 overall on yelp is due to one bottle that we were interested in...which was out of date. No bigs. Just a heads up to the spina folk! We'll see you & mr. Tim very very soon!
