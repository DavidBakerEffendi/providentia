This was a great casual date place.  Not a problem getting seated on a week night.  A neat unique experience to have Japanese tea and dinner.  I had green tea and it was excellent.  We ordered the reisei gayu as recommended by a fellow reviewer.  Some of the items were really tasty.  Others were not.  There was a slimey seaweed item that had an unpleasant texture.  But the desserts were divine.  I recommend the black sesame creme brulee and the chocolate mochi.  Yum...
