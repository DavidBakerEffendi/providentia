I find it challenging to rave about this place without casually swearing about how (expletive) wonderful it is. It really is. My hub and I were completely impressed from the moment we walked in. The service, for starters, was fantastic. These folks really seem to love what they're doing. More over, they're all so knowledgeable. Go on, throw a wine question at 'em. I dare you. Truly, each person who assisted us took their time and walked us through our selections, questions and their own suggestions. The wines were fantastic, but perhaps that's a given. It should be noted that you can do a 3oz size or a full glass. Every morsel of food was perfect, and complimented the wines fabulously. We had smokey almonds, marinated olives, "funky beef balls" (a must), whipped lardo (another must) and a cheese plate. Perfect little bites for perfect glasses of wine. The interiors are simple, sleek and romantic. A great date spot, actually. Anyway, I'm just so (expletive) impressed. Haven't been to the other Terroir(s) but the one in Tribeca shouldn't be missed.
