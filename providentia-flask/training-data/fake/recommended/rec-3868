As I have fallen behind in my Yelp reviews, I must admit I don't remember each dish that we ate here a few months ago, but I wanted to write the review to give them their props, as they deserve them. I do recall we had polenta and bruschetta, both of which were excellent.  My partner had squid ink pasta and he raved about it.  If I remember correctly, I had ravioli and it was also excellent. What I do remember is how surprised we were with this place.  It's a quaint little bistro tucked into the south slope and it is not a pretentious, overpriced disappointment.  The host/owner was charming and nice, taking time to speak with us for a few moments and exuding a positive vibe.   I also recall we left feeling very happy and content, which is the greatest compliment a restaurant can receive.
