I have had brunch at Tinto several times and am always delighted to return. Most recently, I arranged a set menu brunch in their private room for a family group aged 6 to 86. Everyone had a blast. The room size was perfect for our group of 10--I had been a little worried knowing that it can accommodate 20, but the room felt intimate yet spacious. The food was great: lots of variety, nicely presented, and so delicious. The orange french toast, pork belly and little flans are foods of the gods.  I want to give a special shout-out to Christina, who took wonderful care of us and made a small boy's 8th birthday an extra special surprise by providing a candle with his dessert.  It's the little touches that matter, and Christina's attentiveness, warmth, and graciousness were really exceptional.
