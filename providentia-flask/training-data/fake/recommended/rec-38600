Govinda's is a place I always like more in theory than in practice. I want to support a vegetarian (mostly vegan) spot like this but can't always help leaving disappointed--  the appetizers are nearly always luke warm, the main dishes hit or miss, the atmosphere rather depressing, and the service incredibly slow. You may be the only one in the restaurant but can count on waiting 20 min to have someone take your order.  It's not just that but in an upscale-ish place you expect appetizers to come out at the same time, to have napkins at the table, to have your water glass refilled-- and you often just do not get that type of service.  Despite all of this, the food is generally good (much better than Horizons, in my opinion) so I keep coming back. FYI, Govinda's has a sandwich shop ("Gourmet to Go") open 7 days/week as well as a fine dining restaurant (what I am reviewing) that is open Thursdays-Sundays.
