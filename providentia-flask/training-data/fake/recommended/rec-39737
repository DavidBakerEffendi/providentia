This place was much better than I expected!  Usually I'm not a huge fan of tapas because I usually leave the restaurant still feeling hungry, but Yuca's good sized tapas left me feeling pleasantly full.  My friend and I shared three tapas between the two of us thinking we could order more if we were still hungry, but found that three was plenty.  We ordered the lobster quesadillas (awesome), taquitos de carne (also awesome) and the espresso bbq ribs (also good, but a little on the sweet side for my taste).  The drinks were strong and the atmosphere was nice although it was a bit loud-- had to sort of shout to each other in order to have a conversation.  I would definitely come back though, especially for half-price tapas on Tuesdays.
