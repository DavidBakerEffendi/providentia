Great place for a happy hour! Cocktails for only $5 and a variety of tapas for $2 or $3 per small plate. The regular menu is amazing, especially the chorizo and figs. Only downside is that they were booked for all of Wednesday night (seriously??) and we had to drink and eat at the bar. I'm sure the experience is even better if you're seated at a table!
