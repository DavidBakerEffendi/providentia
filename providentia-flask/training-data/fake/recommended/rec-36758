A friend told me this was her favorite restaurant of all time, so I had to go here. I came here with a friend and went in to be seated but unfortunately had to wait for 20-30 min for a table so we put down our names. What's the best way to kill time? EAT! Conveniently, they have a bakery next to the restaurant so we shared a pastry with plums and blueberries. It was one of the most delicious pastries I've ever eaten. This got us really excited to eat our food. Once we got seated, we were given a free basket of bread with butter. The bread and butter were so good together. Better than they usually are. For my entree, I ordered the Steak Frites. I had heard all this fuss about this dish so i decided to try it out. Surprisingly, the steak wasn't all that. What really made steak was the herb butter that it came with. I was sad about that, but the fries more than made up for that. This place supposedly has the best fries ever and I would have to agree. They are perfectly crispy, flavorful and of course even better after a dunk in some ketchup. I would love to try other things on the menu but that will have to wait until the next time. Definitely check this place out if you feel like spending some money (or share a dish with a friend!). Their decor is exactly what I imagined a NY restaurant to be like. It was crowded, loud, and lively.
