This place is an oasis in the uprising of newer, organic-er-than-though restaurants around here.  It's been here for as long as I have (10 years) and has been through its own ups and downs.   No matter what competition appears - Bare Burger, Burger Bistro, Brooklyn Flipsters, Dram Shop, Corner Burger - I always find myself coming back here.  Burgers are enormous, on fluffy well toasted buns and have just a hint of spice.   Make sure you order slightly overdone than you would normally; they sometimes undercook because they're so busy.  Fries are great and come with a tangy mayo that makes the fat-on-fat-eating experience ever more enjoyable.   The only downside is the amount of patience you have to have when ordering over the phone... on a busy night they will either just let the phone ring or hang up on you.  Don't take it personally, just be persistent and eventually someone will answer.  Cash only for delivery.
