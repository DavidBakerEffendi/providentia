Maybe one of the most solid burger joints in the city. Unpretentious good eats with a chill atmosphere. The ladies who work this place are genuinely good-natured and possibly more excited about the burger you're about to eat than you are. Took a date here -- she had the truffle butter burger, I went with the smashed onion. As other reviewers have mentioned, the green chili cheese fries are a must. Those fries are so crispy, they masterfully stood up against the cheesy spicy goodness. WMGK was playing over the radio. Something is totally perfect about hearing Led Zeppelin as you're consuming burgers amid a backdrop of hand-drawn art. My only complaint: wish they'd expand the soda choices and include Pennsylvania Dutch Birch Beer. Will definitely return.
