took my fiance and two friends here  last night........as soon as we walked in a felt a really good and upbeat vibe......the hostess seated us right away at our 7.45 reservation .......we had  a great table in the center of the action......had our first drink after meeting a very lovely server named gigi, e started with mac and chwho made our night fun......we started with mac and cheese which was the best i ve had in many years and calamari, which was hads also very good.......more drinks........i had salmon grilled to perfection and sauteed spinach and asparagus........portion sizes are nice and come out hot as the staff is attentive and many.......i would avoid the bread which comes in little egg roll wrappers......the desert menu is full but so were we so coffee was the finale of our evening......i would recommend this place to   friends and the new location at 64th should be a cool place too
