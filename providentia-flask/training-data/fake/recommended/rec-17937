We went with a group for a birthday party last Friday, and boy was I looking forward to a meat festival.  Going in, I had no doubt that I was going to order the Rodizio.  Skewered meat after skewered meat would be brought to my table, sliced into piles just waiting on my American gluttony to take over. After we arrived, and took our seat, we ordered two pitchers of the red sangria, which did not disappoint.  The apples soaking up the alcohol were crisp (and sodden with wine!) and tasty.  I've had sangria many times when you can tell the apples are leftovers: squishy, mealy, and bad.  not these. The salad bar and bread that came with the meal were fantastic.  A great salad bar, with plenty of options to put on your plate, and warm bread. Unfortunately, the Rodizio left a lot to be desired.  The meat came out fast and furious, but several of the cuts lacked flavor.  By the time the chicken hearts came to the table, I was luckily done for.  Some of the options were really impressive, the bacon-wrapped ones being my favorites. My review, I might add, is somewhat tainted by my post-meal experience.  Perhaps my gut just isn't used to having a variety of nothing but meat to digest, but it did not digest it well.  Several others that went complained of the same digestive challenges.  The worst experience, however, was the one friend who tossed and turned all night having vivid nightmares which he referred to as "meatmares."  I can't say for sure that his meatmares are due to the parade of meats, but he did say that's very uncommon. If you go, I still say get the Rodizio.  If you go *back*, I would avoid the Rodizio and stick with a lower priced option.
