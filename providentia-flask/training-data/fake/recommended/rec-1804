If you are going here for good service and non-greasy food, then you have a problem.  The ruggedness (not rudeness) of the staff is something I love and I think it's fun.  They don't mess around here.  Yes this place is a tourist trap where it's not really worth it to pay ~$10 for a cheesesteak with fries.  But, it's an institution and for that price, I'm willing to spend in the double digits for some shaved meat wit whiz and onions.
