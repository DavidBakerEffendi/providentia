What a great first experience at the Biscuit Cafe! Charles was our server and even while waiting on 3 other tables, he was still super attentive and friendly during our meal. We ordered the chicken wings to start and they were HUGE. Very juicy and the buttermilk sauce it came with was so delicious. Then built my own biscuit sandwich with fried chicken, fried green tomato, and honey. It was just the right serving size and I left feeling perfectly full. The highlight of our meal definitely had to be talking to the owner John. We ended up staying an extra hour sharing stories with him. John, thanks for the great meal and talk!!
