The #1 spot I go for all-you-can-eat sashimi!! The sea-weed salad and teriyaki squid is SO good... definitely start it off with that. I rarely eat sushi when I'm here because I chow down on sashimi. Don't get me wrong the sushi is slamming too but not a lot of places have all-you-can-eat sashimi so I make my visit worth it. The red bean ice cream is good and I usually end my meal with it mixed with vanilla ice cream.
