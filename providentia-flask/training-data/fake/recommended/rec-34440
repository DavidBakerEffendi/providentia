Tried this place after moving to VT and seeing them on Food Network. Needless to say this place was a huge disappointment. The food and menu were terrible, not even close to real italian food. I got some form of chicken parm and it came with white bread.... really? I believe the purpose of this place is to remain stuck in the 40s and offer low quality food at a cheap price; but you get what you pay for. At the end of the day, their ''famous'' sauce was gross. It was all over the place in terms of flavor. I couldn't even finish my meal it was so bad. Every time I see someone buying it at the store Im confused as to what the appeal is.
