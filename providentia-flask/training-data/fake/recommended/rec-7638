Although the food here is relatively cheap, the quality leaves much to be desired. When we first saw the burgers cooking in the kitchen, I was salivating because of how good and juicy they looked. However, after actually eating it, I was severely disappointed as the burger was incredibly under-seasoned. I rarely ever put salt in my food, so it's not a good thing that I had to add a good amount to my burger here. Beside that, the burger was flopped on a generic bun, with generic lettuce and tomatoes. Really nothing special. Fries were also very unimpressive and just not flavorful. I guess this place is only worth coming to when you have the drunchies, because that's when everything tastes good. I am genuinely confused as to why this place has high ratings - maybe I just got a bad cook that day?
