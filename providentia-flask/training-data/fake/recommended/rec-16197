After two peopl reccomended this new-ish spot I finally found the time to go. YUM! Delicious Greek food that you don't find other places. It's not all spanikopita and pitas. The octopus was wonderful as was the orzo entree...and the shrimp. The Soudzokakia (think meatballs) appetizer was decent as well, but I'm partial to my own recipe for this dish. They also have a full bar with many Greek wines, a few (non-greek) beers on tap too. There should be nothing holding you back from trying this place! Go! I mean, now, call them and book a table because they fill up fast.
