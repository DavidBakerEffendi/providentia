Funny place!  They ran out of bread and couldn't make my panini for at least 20 min (since they make the bread fresh).  I had already been waiting, so to fix the situation the chefs (these two adorable italian women) decide they will whip up something even better.  Next thing I know they are prepping their homemade lasagne for me.  At that point I was so hungry I didn't even care, and I was up for the challenge of taking the chefs request.  The wait wasn't horribly long (I had ordered it for take out), I got my food to go and finally got to bite into the thing.  It was delicious!  The ingredients couldn't be fresher, the taste is truly homemade.  Now all I can think about is how good that homemade bread I didn't wait for must taste.  A lot of love is going into that food, and I will definitely be going back.   Now lets just hope they keep those prices down!
