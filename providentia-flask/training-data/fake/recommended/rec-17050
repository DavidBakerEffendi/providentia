I came here with some family the other night for dinner. The meal started off okay but declined as it progressed. We started off with some nice looking bread and olives in a tasty, infused olivie oil. I really wish the bread was served warm but it wasn't. It's really unfortunate because they have a small open kitchen for pizza and paninis that they could've Â warmed the bread in. Our waiter proceeded to list some specials for us and we ordered our meals. We began by sharing a few appetizers: the zuppa di mussels, zuppa di clams, the shrimp and white beans, the spedini, and a sausage and escarole dish. Both shellfish plates were good, their sauces were mopped up with bread all around (warm bread would've been better here too). The shrimp dish was nothing special and there wasn't even enough shrimp on the plate for us each to have one; something our server could've mentioned...The spedeni was good and lightly covered in the same fragrant sauce as the shellfish. The sausage and escarole was good too and a nice break from all that red sauce. For entrees I ordered the veal paillard which I would never get here again. Pieces of my veal were a little tough in some spots and the salad adourning the veal was just chopped up romaine and a boring vinegrette. The fresh mozzerella in the salad was so scarce that I wish they hadn't diced it up so finely so that I could enjoy one creamy bite. Everyone else made off a little better with their entrees. The chilean sea bass special was good, as was the porkchop that I tasted. The desserts were your typical north jersey Italian restaurant choices, nothing to write home (or yelp) about. I'd come back to try the pizza but I'm not in any rush. The servers we're a little unattentive once our appetizers were served...I know its early evening on Sunday but come on. We went out to eat so we could relax not you. At the end of the day there are simply better choices in the area...
