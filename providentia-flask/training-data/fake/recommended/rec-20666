Expectations and executions are in harmony here at Corner Bistro.  About the only thing this place's reputation promises you is a delicious, no-frills burger, and the burger this place delivers is in fact delicious, and no-frills.  They will put onions and lettuce and tomato, on this burger, and they will put cheese or bacon, or both, on it.  The price is $7.75-9.75, depending, which maybe feels like too much but not enough to throw off the harmony. You can also get fries, a chicken sandwich, a grilled cheese sandwich, and some very well-priced beers--a pint of McSorleys goes for $3.75, which is pretty tough to beat.   And that is about it.  Some of the seating is cramped--I kept having to scootch around to make way for people.  And I've heard the crowds are sometimes intense, but I came late on a Sunday and it was half empty--we were sat right away and quickly served.  If I'd had to wait and then feel rushed in the middle of a crowd, it probably wouldn't have been worth it.  But as is, things felt in harmony.  Gongs had been sounded and cows had been slaughtered.  Burgers were eaten, and burgers were indeed enjoyed.
