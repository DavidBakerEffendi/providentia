I am partial to pho places, honestly.  I like the extras that pho comes with that this place doesn't include but this is not to say that this place isn't good.  It is.  It's cheap, it's tasty, very nice fresh ingredients and the service is pleasant.   The cucumbers in sauce is a really nice garlic and vinegar dish.  The cucumbers are really crunchy.   The soups, keeping in mind that I like pho better, are made with very fresh and aromatic vegetables and the noodles have a very nice consistency and are tasty in their own right. I ordered some dumplings and the spicy tendon dish for take out - all were excellent, truly. Overall I really like this place a lot and will go there more often.   This place does not take credit cards so bring cash.
