Went there with the gf on a friday night.  The decor is definitely a bit stylish, and I noticed they had separate sections for groups and for those looking for a more intimate setting.  I sat with the gf on the more intimate side, and we were lucky to get an end table so that we were only next to one other table (which was pretty close, but not totally unreasonable - that plus we got to secretly spy on the line of couples obviously on first dates!) We didnt realize it was restaurant week, but our server recommended we go with the one entre/2 sides/1 dessert per-person RW option if we were first timers.  After a careful scan of the regular menu (and dutiful comparisons to what we'd be missing by going a la carte), we decided on the tasting menu. Between the two of us, we got the warm eggplant, the foutosh (sp?), the lamb sausages and the bone marrow.  The foutoush was excellent - very refreshing salad with sprigs of mint that left a clean aftertaste.  The lamb sausages were small and drenched in a mild sauce, and the warm eggplant was a bit too sweet but still enjoyable.  The bone marrow was a miss - congealed and only served to set up the inevitable comparison to the bone marrow a la blue ribbon brasserie.  We also shared the lamb chops and the chicken shish.  The chicken shish was absolutely juicy and flavorful; I wish there was more than one kabab.  The lamb chops were also as delicately flavored - we both remarked at how savory each small chop was. The dessert was decent; pistachio ice cream (tasted more like gelato) and the "candi-bar" (great crunchy base-layer). Only negatives were when the waiter mistakenly left our bill at our table pre-dessert, and the fact that certain items on the RW menu (like the lamb chops) cost an extra $7.  We asked the waiter and got the impression that this was a recurring issue; it should be more clear on the menu itself. All-in-all, a good time.  The wait-staff and maitre'd-staff were very friendly and professional.
