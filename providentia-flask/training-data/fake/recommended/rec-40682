I made the booking for us and two friends. One is a vegetarian, and the others somewhat picky. With a reputation for it's "variety meat offerings" I worried the menu might put them off. As for me I am a totally double diamond foodie, I was eager to "go off the rails" with some of their more exotic dishes.    All that said, Osteria had something for EVERYONE; Foodie or neophyte. My partner had the Margherita pizza. Looking dry and bland was instead AWESOME. A very thin crust was slightly smokey and salty with occasional rich cheese and fresh basil.    I followed Yelp comments and had the chicken liver rigatoni. Awesome, but sadly for my diet, I ate nearly all of it.  And while others said pass on dessert, we opted for the gelato and sorbet. The sweet corn gelato was amazing. Best was service, she was more than an order taker. She described each dish, asked our likes and dislikes guided us through the AWESOME experience.
