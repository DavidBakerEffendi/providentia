Fabulous little spot tucked away in the corner of a shopping center. Excellent food - had a veggie omelet, which had more vegetables than eggs. The eggs themselves were light and fluffy, not greasy and was able to sub fruit for potatoes at no cost. Professional , friendly service. Highly recommend.
