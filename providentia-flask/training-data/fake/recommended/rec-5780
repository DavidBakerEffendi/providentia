I went back and forth on this one between 4 and 5 stars, but I know that every time I'm there at RTM, I'm looking to see how long the line is at DiNic's.  Their roasted pork is amazing.  The brisket is masterful.  The italian sausage looks and smells tremendous too. And whatever you get, top it with broccoli rabe and sharp provolone.  You won't regret it. Good(s): Everything on the menu Bad(s): Nothing yet
