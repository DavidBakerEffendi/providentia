My boyfriend and I took and impromptu trip up north last week...he's from Delaware and while we were there he promised me an authentic Philly Cheese steak! Apparently cheese steaks are serious business Â up north so everyone had their own opinions of where we should go to get the best steak...but we are Yelpers and of course we turned to this site to help us find the best cheese steak in Philly...and we found it at Dalessandro's!! I must've have looked like a visitor when I walked into the place because the ladies behind the counter were more than happy to sit me down and explain the menu to me!! I was a little nervous about not knowing exactly what I wanted when I got there because I had read reviews of other places and I was afraid that my head would be chopped off if I walked on all dazed and confused while I tried to order. Anyway..hands down this was the best steak I have ever had and I am only an every once in a while beef eater...I wish I would've ordered it with a little more cheese...but it was so good with the mushrooms, onions, sweet peppers...and yes even a little ketchup on it! Awesome...awesome....I'm looking forward to visiting this spot the next time I take another trip up north!
