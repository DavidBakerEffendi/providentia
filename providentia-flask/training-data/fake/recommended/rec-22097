Nailed it! Salad and sandwich heaven; great fresh ingredients, excellent choice of menu items, fast service, super tasty, a bit of room to sit down, efficient take-away. Winning. I had the prosciutto pressed sandwich with a side salad, and my (gluten-free) boyfriend had the Mediterranean salad (no pita) + side of sweet potato. All their sides are gluten free. Simply can't fault it. While I was devouring my food I was having food looking at other people's sandwiches. Can't wait to go back! TIP: Get take-away and sit in the sun for a 100% totally nourishing experience.
