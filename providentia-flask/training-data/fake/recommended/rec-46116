My family loves going to this spot. We live in town and consider it among the best. The great thing is the food. Always good and always consistent. Some times takes a bit to make it to the table but when it does, always hot a delicious. Service is hit or miss. Mostly hit and Jose is great. Ask for him as he's very nice and professional. Great overall Italian with wonderful food.
