an amazing dining experience! ambience: beautiful glass house with gorgeous evening light and a view of a gothic church, got even more beautiful when the sun set and the lights came on pizzas: excellent crust and ingredients, a little burnt but bearable antipasti: fresh ingredients, wild alaskan salmon was well flavored and matched well with the red onions primi: had the canestri with nettle pesto, snails and parmiagano. LOVED THIS. one of the best pesto i've ever had! secondi: rabbit was tasty, but a little dry. otherwise very flavorful dessert: it's hard to go wrong with chocolate flan and pistachio gelato, which marked the end of an excellent meal. while the food was excellent, it was probably worth 4 stars. what marked this as a 5 star experience was really the beautiful ambience of the place. very very highly recommended for the full dining experience.
