I went to Nai this past Saturday after I had booked a reservation for 4...for Sunday - ouch!  The host (David) handled the situation as perfectly as you could ask for.  He discretely informed me that I had booked for the wrong day as to not embarass me in front of my party.  Then, he gave me the option of waiting to see if he could find us a space at the bar or come back another time.  After about 10 minutes, not only did David get us a space, he got us a full table.  The place was packed so I don't know how he did it, but he pulled it off. After the phenomenal service from David, it continued from our server as well.  He was patient with our group as it took us a little while to figure out everything we wanted to order.  He was knowledgeable about the menu when asked, and paced the meal just right. Amazingly, the food was just as good as the service!  We ordered about 6 different dishes each one better than the last.  The empanadas were amazing!  When it was all said and done, the bill came to about $130, extremely affordable for 4 people including 2 large pitchers of sangria. I never Yelp but because I had such an incredible experience at Nai, I felt the need to share.  I will certainly be back soon!
