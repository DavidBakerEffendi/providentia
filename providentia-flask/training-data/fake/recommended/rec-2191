Tried both Geno's and Pat's on trip from NY. Neither was worth the trip, but Pat's was better. It was a bland and overpriced sandwich ( $8.50, for steak-ums, whiz, and tasteless bread). Go to your local deli instead. The nearby Italian street market was interesting, but Pat's and Geno's were a bust.
