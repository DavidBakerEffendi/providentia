No reservation? LONG wait. About an hour and a half. Pork buns? DELICIOUS. It's like freshly-made clouds of dough and prime pork strips with a spice to them. Like little heavenly dough wraps. My thumbs left impressions in the softness. Ramen? Small portions? Check. DELICIOUS? Check. Yes I WILL be returning for more of their over-priced, non-American-sized ramen portions and I will greedily slurp up the flavor-packed noodles with a happy heart and lay down my hard-worked for earnings with no regrets. Maybe you will, too?
