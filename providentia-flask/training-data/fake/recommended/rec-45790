My boyfriend and I LOVE this place! We order from here 1-2x a week and the rolls are always fresh and delicious.  We are a bit of food snobs and have been to really nice restaurants in NYC, California...etc so we feel we know exceptional food when we come across it.  I am also particularly picky when it comes to sushi because there are a lot of mediocre places not worth the money.  We went last week for my boyfriends birthday with another couple and got a bunch of rolls which were all amazing.  They also had this special that I have thought about everyday which was a tuna wonton, and if I remember correctly was thinly sliced tuna with some tempura, scallions and possibly something else inside.  Yes they give you 2 big "ball" sized wontons but I just cut it into 4 with my chopsticks and it was perfect.  Not fried, but instead just really delicate and it just melted in your mouth, one of the best tuna appetizers I have ever had.  If you are into sushi you have to try this place, you won't be disappointed.
