Lovely location overlooking the lake. Nuclear blast loud. And the food? Nuclear blast good. Soft shelled crab with creole remoulade and full bellied clams. Very helpful and engaging staff. Only negative was over refrigerated coleslaw. Maybe I'm picky, but coleslaw should always be fresh and should never taste of refrigerator. Could not have asked for a better meal. Enjoyed it immensely.
