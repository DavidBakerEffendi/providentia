Belgian / German beer pub with a gazillion of bottled beers and some on tap. The menu is short, less German than the name of the place suggests but the food was good: the Bratwurst, Schnitzel, Pretzel bites and the kids Burger were all fine. The Hefeweizen was good too. Only warning: the Spaghetti "Sp√§tzle" with some kind of a tomato sauce on the kids menu were so bad that my daughter couldn't eat them. Overall: nice, comfy place with great beer and decent hearty food.
