Petite Crevette is such an awesome place. Great seafood restaurants in Maine or Boston, yes.  In Cobble Hill,  Brooklyn? Had no clue!  Thank you Yelpers! The food were extremely tasty and fresh.  The dipping oil for the bread was fantastic.  Becca F was right!!! It was like liquid crack.  So good! I had the lobster dish and hubby had the curry fish dish.  Seriously, we ate our food and did not come up for air.  Then the owner came around and chatted with to us.  He found that we were Petite Crevette virgins, so he gave us Lecha Flan on the house.  That was really sweet of him.   He told us it was made from skim milk.  I am not sure if he was pulling my leg because the flan was super tasty.  If its really made from skim milk, then whoever made it got some serious skills! Cute place. Great for group or a romantic couple date.   The service was great. The bathroom is very clean and cute. Cheers!
