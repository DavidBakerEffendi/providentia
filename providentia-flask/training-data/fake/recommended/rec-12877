Fabulous, unique brunch. The sheep's milk ricotta with honey on toast is DIVINE...and what a massive portion of ricotta!! Hubby and I were nearly full after sharing this dish but still immensely enjoyed the Salumi Misti (selection of thin-sliced cured meats) and the Uovo Modenese (their version of eggs benny but made with a salami hash). First-rate brunch in Tribeca!
