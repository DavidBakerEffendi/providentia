This place is awesome!  The Mensch is my favorite with a close second going to the 50/50.  I usually go with the Mensch because my coworker and I usually split an order of Farm Fries as well. We're big eaters and we walk out of their stuffed. Careful around lunch time because it will most likely be packed but they still sling their sandwiches quickly.  You can call ahead but you may still get stuck in line since they don't have a seperate pick up spot.  The food is so good that doesn't bother me though.
