Delizioso! What a great place to eat.  I found the food to be exactly what Home Italian food is all about.  Fresh, home cooking that has amazing flavors that go great together.  I am an Italian-American who travels to Italy often and found their food very authentic and exactly what I am used to. I had a pork chop that was in a pizziola sauce (more cacciatore) that was perfectly cooked and went well with all the ingredient.  We also tried the all you can eat pasta.  It was perfectly cooked and had great flavor.  One was a butter sage ravioli that would give Firenze a run. I did not like the Caesar salad as it was more mayonnaise than Caesar.  Also the spread for the butter was very bland and unflavored.  I would have enjoyed a nice bottle of olive oil instead. I can't forget the dessert!  We tried the dessert sampler.  OMG!! This was great!  All home made! Panna Cotta, cheese cake, chocolate mousse, bread pudding, and grape sorbet.  Perfectly made! The place is cozy and feels like a small home setting.  Careful when going to the bathroom as it is right in front of the kitchen prep area and you will have to dodge a little.  However, it is very nice to be able to see all the action going on there.  Prices are very fair and the wait staff are amazing and very nice!
