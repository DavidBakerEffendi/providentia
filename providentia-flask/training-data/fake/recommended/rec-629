I was really disappointed with the shrimp & scallop enchiladas.  The mole was was very heavy & there was too much of it.   It was spicy, but bland at the same time.  The shrimp & scallops were tiny & I didn't like that there was tomato inside.  It just didn't go with the mole - not that I would have expected it to.  I do not recall seeing tomato in the description of the dish - if I had I would not have ordered it. I wish I'd read other poor reviews of this dish before wasting $19 + tax & tip!   My second star is not for the enchiladas, but for the rice that comes with them.  It wasn't award winning, but I thought it was a better side of rice than I usually get at Mexican restaurants.  (The beans were very heavy & taste was just average.)
