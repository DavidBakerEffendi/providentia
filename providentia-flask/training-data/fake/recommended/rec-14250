Everytime I hear about this cart, or even as I glance over the existing reviews for this place on the side bar as I'm writing this one *ding* a bell goes off in my head and immediately the Pavlovian response of salivating begins. I am literally swallowing a bunch of saliva at the moment trying not to drool over my keyboard. Other than the line up, this place is great. You see I love street meat and this place definitely gets the "street" into the "meat". Â Easily having the best street cred of all the carts around. Chicken & Rice + Hot Sauce - $ = #$@#$@%! Amazing meal that will hit the spot for sure. Especially after a night of drinking or aimless wandering.
