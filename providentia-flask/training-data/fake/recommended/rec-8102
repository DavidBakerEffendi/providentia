Do NOT go here for Brunch, at least not the Wayne, PA location.  The French toast was as dry as a newly packaged kitchen sponge and equally flavorless.  The Pumpkin pancakes were mediocre to poor also a bit dry and lacking ANY flavor, let alone pumpkin.  The waitress introduced the food mentioning organic this and locally farmed that.  I would have rather it come from a locally bought generic boxed pancake mix from the supermarket, it would have had WAY more flavor I'm sure.  The saving grace was the ambiance and service.  I had mentioned the dryness of the french toast casually and unbegrudgingly when the waitress asked how our food was.  At the end of the meal the manager sat down with us and apologized which was considerate but I still found my kitchen sponges charged on the check even though I left half on the plate and force-fed myself the other, hoping the next bite would be moist, but it never came.
