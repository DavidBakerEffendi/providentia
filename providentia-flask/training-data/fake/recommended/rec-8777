Wow!!!  Tried the Totto Miso ramen and it was delish.  They apparently always have a wait.  We arrived at around 9 pm on a Sat night and had to wait about 45 minutes.  Is have to say they have mastered an efficient process as they have you order a few minutes before they seat you so just as you are finally seated your dishes come right out hot and flavorful!  Great job!!!!!
