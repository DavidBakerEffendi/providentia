Yo, this place is dope. I think the only reason why people give negative reviews is because they had too high of expectations and/or they had to wait too long to get a seat. I came on a Tuesday night around 7 and had no problem getting a seat, although it was still plenty busy. On to the food...They had a ton of interesting selections. On the menu, they list the calories of each item, which may deter some people who are watching their weight (which begs to question, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?). It took me a long time decide but I ultimately went with their "classic"/regular burger (medium rare) just to get a baseline. My boyfriend got the truffle burger. When I bit into the burger, it was flavor overload! Each ingredient soooo savory and blends well together! I took a bite of my boyfriend's truffle burger, which was a lot oilier, but was also rich in a distinct flavor. My boyfriend said the truffle burger was "the best burger he's ever had!"(that's not something he says lightly!) What can I say? Both were excellent. Their desserts are equally delectable. I tried their sea salt caramel milkshake and it was sooo flavorful! I wanted to down the whole thing, haha. This place definitely stays true to their name with the savory, rich flavors of everything! Also, our server was really sweet and funny, bonus points for that. I will definitely be back to try their other options and maybe have some fries, too!
