Very, very good! Came here with my husband, sister and brother in law that were visiting from Florida. This is basically a renegade style tapas place. Our waiter recommended 10-15 dishes for four people, which sounded ridiculous, so we went with 8. Believe it or not, it was too much food. The food was amazing. My favorite dishes were the shrimp, brisket sliders, gnocchi, scallops, mussels and the carrots with cheese (forget the name). The crab with biscuits was alright, too heavy. As were the doughnuts with bacon and ice cream, it was just too overwhelming.
