We got a caprese app, a mixed baby green salad and an artichoke/smoked pancetta pizza. Overall, it was okay but nothing special. The crust tasted good but it was a little thick. The artichokes overpowered the pizza with it's vinegary tanginess (we picked them off the pizza). The salad was boring. My bf and I walk from Clinton Hill, and we didn't think it was worth the time. At the end of the meal, we agreed that we should've just gone to Emily--they have better salads and pizza.
