Just like everyone else says: Roast Pork Sandwich with Provolone cheese.  Its juicy (they dipped the pork into the sauce prior to the serving).  The cheese melted into the pork - delicious. Its huge too.  If you are a girl or have small appetite, one order can simply take care two people. Its no doubt that this place is one of the most iconic store inside the reading terminal market.
