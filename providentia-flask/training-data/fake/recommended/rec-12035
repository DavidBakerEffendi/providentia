Tasty dogs.  If you are in the Little Falls area-- Big Daddy's is as good as it gets. Authentic Sabrett's dogs, boiled and wrapped in a fresh hot dog roll, Big Daddy's is as close as you can get to the Bloomfield Avenue trucks near Branch Brook Park in Newark. Quite a variety of available toppings and you can customize you dog with scores of hot sauces right off off the shelf. Only problem, some of the dog combinations are not always available. i.e. the "Sweet Fire" dog, my personal favorite.  Nevertheless, there are many, many options if they are out of the spicy pickles for the Sweet Fire dog.
