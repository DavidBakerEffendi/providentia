YUUUUUUUMMMMMM! My family and I have been eating here since it opened. It is a BYOB with a cute casual atmosphere. Reservations are necessary especially for dinner and for a larger party. Seriously everything I have had here is amazing. Pastas, pizza, salads, soups, everything! Last time we were there my dad orderd the seafood salad special which is not something I would typically order but we are still talking about it. It was fresh and delious. If you are into desserts then you have to order the Nutella pizza. It is Nutella rolled up in pizza dough, baked and then sprinkled with powdered sugar. It is large enough for six people to share. This is a favorite restaurant for my family. My brother, who lives in California insists on going here every time he is home visiting. It is just that good!
