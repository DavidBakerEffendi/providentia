My then BF had watched an episode of Bobby Flay Throw down and since then his mind was set on visiting this place! So on our last day in NYC- we had all these things planned but everything was pushed back because we had to wait over an hr or so just to be seated! I guess the show really gave them a lot of publicity We walked the block a couple of times before we went back, the waitress was kind of rude but i guess i understand she needed space to walk around and take orders. Anyways when we were finally seated we got the famous pancakes which were decent in my books.. I got full super quickly cause of the eggs Benedict and cubed potatoes. My ex bf said it was because everything i was in-taking was just super heavy so its no wonder id get that full! Either way- good experience
