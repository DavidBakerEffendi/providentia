Southern/New Orleans/Soulful/Jazz vibe. Good atmosphere if you enjoy those things. We were easily seated but seems like the place might get packed later in the night seeing as they often have live music - reservations can be made. The food is not for the health conscience but definitely tasty and flavorful! Great place to go to with a group of people to hear live music and eat soul food.
