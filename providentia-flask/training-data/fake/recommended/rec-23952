I just had the best meal I can remember. The first time we went to Hawthorne's we liked it, it was good.  We were back tonight and had incredible meals matched with super friendly service. We started with cheese and mustard - beautifully served with ample mustard, toast, berry slices and some jam.  I didn't love the actual cheese, but it was a great appetizer. I ordered a special - potato encrusted chicken breast served atop mashed potatoes (skin on), corn puree and poblano sauce.  It was an amazing combination of flavors, elegantly served, and the chicken was crispy,  ridiculously moist, and flavorful.   I had a bite of the Hawthorne's burger, which I knew from the menu would be far too rich for me, but I really appreciated the complexity of it - nothing to complain about (except that I could only have eaten a few bites).  My dining partner love the burger. The service was attentive and friendly, and both people we spoke with seemed very knowledgeable about the beers - we have very different taste in beer and they were able to recommend excellent choices for each of us. We were slightly surprised by the price when it was all said and done, but the chicken was more like something I'd get in any of the pricier big name restaurants in the city. I can't wait to go back.
