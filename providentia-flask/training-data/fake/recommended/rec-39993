Great place to hang around with friends, with what I've heard it's pretty popular. The ambience is a mix of old rusted pipes with meters and goth-candle-bottle-animal lit combo, yeah that's quite a combo. Their flagship model is make your own margaritas, with a bunch of sauces ! Bunch = 5 dozen or more. quantity and quality of food is decent, not bad at all. They have over 15 beers on tap usually. How heavy on your pocket / like a usual modern bar. 50-60 bucks for two with lots of drinks Go there, and oh, it's loud.
