Ehhh the Wishing Well.  What can I say?  I have probably been there about three times wanting desperately to like it but come away feeling a bit underwhelmed.  I was trying to put my finger on it and I think I came up with some sort of explanation.   To start off, the staff is usually super nice and all that great jazz.  I met two of the owners; the one guy is very cool but the other stumpy one is a total ass hat.  Regardless, douchy bar owners are a dime a dozen but that's the world we live in.  The food is ordinary I guess.  I had the shame burger once with my girlfriend when I was a bit buzzed and thought it was awesome but she told me I was an idiot and am the same person that thinks Ellios pizza with tuna on top is a great idea after a night of drinking.  But I still think I liked it. It's the little things; I mean the rocks pours on their liquor are shamefully off for a part of the city that prides itself on it's beam slurping hipsters.  These guys want to do their coke, drink their bourbon, and shit out blood.  Serving booze in thimble glasses with an ice cube in it will not win you popularity contests anywhere.  But then again, the hipsters don't really come here.  It's an even crappier clientele.  Each time I have been in here I have never seen the same face in the bar or even the neighborhood for that matter.  The people in there don't seem to live here.  I swear Scotty is in the back room beaming douchebags in from Manayunk and Conshohocken.   I know that can come off as a bit pretentious but you really cannot like an establishment if you thinks their "regulars" are a bunch of dweebs and spazzes.  They just don't fit and they pretend to like playing board games in the back while they drink vodka out of one of those tiny dentist cups.  I dunno Wishing Well, you're just goofing up my hood that's all.  I really have no ill will but I can't say I would be bummed to see you go either.
