This review is geared toward vegans and vegetarians, so if you're interested in that, read on... They have traditional Chinese menus, which offer quite a bit that can be made vegetarian, but they also have a separate vegetarian menu. It is quite surprising to find such an extensive list of veggie Chinese dishes outside of cities like NYC and San Francisco. They offer dishes like veggie Moo Shu Vegetable made with mock meat, mock red pork, lots of veggie dishes, General Tsao's Tofu, or the same dish made with mock chicken. This isn't a tremendously fancy restaurant, and the prices are not totally cheap, but all in all, this is about the best Chinese food you'll get in Burlington, and has one of the best selections for vegans and vegetarians, except for A Single Pebble downtown. My only gripe is I wish they would indicate if a dish is vegan or vegetarian, but I asked, and everything we ordered was vegan.
