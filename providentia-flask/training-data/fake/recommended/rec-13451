I've been to most of the noodle shops in Manhattan Chinatown and Flushing. Unlike Super Taste, this place has real hand-pulled noodles (you can tell by the consistency) even though the broth can be a bit bland sometimes (remedy this with mustard greens and cilantro). My favorite, though, is the beef knife-peeled noodles. Try it with a plate of the cold cucumbers and the pan-fried (not boiled!) chicken dumplings with their hot sauce. Tasty and cheap.
