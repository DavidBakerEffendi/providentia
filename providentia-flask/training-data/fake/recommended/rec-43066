The food here is very tasty.  And the staff is very nice, which is a change from the major attitude the staff gives off at their East Village location.  Ultimately Caracas' food is expensive for what it is, but the atmosphere is nice and the menu is good for both meat eaters and vegetarians.  I would  avoid the cocktails though, $9 bucks each, and they come in a tiny rocks glass.  Stick with beer.
