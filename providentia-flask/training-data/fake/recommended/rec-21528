This place is so bad that to me the core of the consumer experience is that I would never even think about going to this place unless I was really thirsty/hypnotized, which I might be one day, but not today or ever right now. Judging by the fashion of the people who go here and the quality of the storefront--which I designed, by the way, today, in Photoshop, to make it less intolerably offensively poorly-designed--this place is overpriced, boring, and induces severe anxiety/fear for the nature/future of humanity.
