Really enjoyed the place.  Had their Huevos Mexicanos.  Tasty! My wife and I went there for brunch on our anniversary day out...it was really nice.  Service was attentive and friendly...I would go on a weekday, whenever possible.  I can see where it would get packed up on weekends.   I love the neighborhood...it's a great place to enjoy a leisurely morning of people watching.
