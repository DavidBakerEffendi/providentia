I felt "pure" just walking into the place! From the moment you step in their is a lush earthy, herbaceous sort of smell that greats you and lets your subconscious know, "hey, whats about to happen here might actually be good AND good for me." Freshly squeezed juice? Why yes please! I paid under $4 for a small orange, apple, ginger squeeze (a concoction that I thought up myself) and I was convinced I had done something amazing for myself. I love that feel so I'll be back to experiment with more delicious natural juices and smoothies.
