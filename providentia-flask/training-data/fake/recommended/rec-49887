If you want an amazing cheese steak just go elsewhere. If you want the typical tourist attraction cheese steak you might as well hit Pat's up. Their cheese steak isn't to bad and I've had a few in my day. I've had a couple cheese steaks where the meat was kind of fatty so don't be shocked if you find some in yours. Gotta get a whiz wit if you do decide to get one.
