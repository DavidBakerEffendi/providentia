On a recent trip to NYC a friend made reservations for us at the Little Owl.  It's a tiny place that's hard to get into, but it was well worth it!  I had the best Pinot Noir I've ever tasted--it must only be available to restaurants because I can't find it anywhere and its not available through the vineyard either.  BUMMER! We ordered the meatball sliders--WOW.  I could have ordered them as my meal they were so delish!  The bun wasn't too tough or too soft and the meatballs inside were seasoned just right and almost melted in your mouth--if meatballs can melt in your mouth. For my entree I had the lamb.  It was served with a perfect amount of gnocchi and some greens (I can't remember what the greens were).  We also ordered the Brussel Sprouts for the table.  Another wow!  They were dressed with bacon and bacon drippings and walnuts.  I'd highly recommend both my entree and the sprouts.   I went with foodie people and so we tasted each other's dishes.  My lamb was the winner--YEA!  I love when I pick the winning dish.
