Very, very good. Dominican food with a slightly healthy twist. Salad was good. Waitress suggested adding avocado which totally made the salad. Sancocho was very nice, less meaty than many versions but delicious. My wife loved her Sopa de mariscos which was loaded with seafood as well as vegetables. The yuca fritters were outstanding. The Maduros and tostones were very good but not the best I've ever had. Wasn't wild about the mojo. The crispy rice - concón was great, beans good. Sautéed veg could have used some garlic and comino or something but glad they had vegetables. Drinks were great. Both the tamarindo and chinola were full if flavor without being very sweet. Only problem is we ordered way too much food - not their fault. The service was great.
