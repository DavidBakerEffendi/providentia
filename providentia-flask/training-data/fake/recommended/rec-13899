Drinks were a little pricey, but it's a airport restaurant so that's to be expected. They offered two different salads that looked great. The one I had was the one with green beans and it hit the spot. I think I spent around $40 with a few drinks and the salad with chicken. They have a window facing out to where the airplanes load up so you have something to look at. Service for me was great, but there were some other folks there who waited for a while before anyone came by and ended up leaving in a huff. Just try to make it clear you're ready/go to the bar to order if needbe - I think they probably are just training new staff.
