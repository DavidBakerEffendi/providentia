I hate to say it because this place is going to get insanely crowded but this is the best BBQ I have had in NYC.  First off the owner was there behind the bar the night I went and not only is he one of the nicest people I have met he actually was cool enough to tell me exactly which items my son (who is celiac) should steer clear of (BBQ sauce, hot sauce and mac and cheese).  The beer list is top notch, the service super friendly, the live music kick ass and most importantly the BBQ is just damn good -- end of story.  I had the brisket, jerk chicken, ribs, and pulled pork along with every side on offer.  I don't care about the sides--though the beans were a little too sweet for my taste, but the brisket was life changing--i cried onto the brown paper tray, the ribs were heart stopping-ly good and the jerk chicken made me feel like I was on cloud nine.  It is obviously all smoked for the correct amount of time with the best ingredients and you can taste it in every bite.  Lastly, the family friendly environment, great decor and awesome staff just makes this place fun to hang out in with my family.  I hope it doesn't get too crowded, but honestly these guys deserve all the success in the world, because they hit it out of the park.
