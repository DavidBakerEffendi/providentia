I only had lunch here with a friend but the twenty-five to thirty-two dollar prix fixe menus cannot be beat in terms of quality. Enjoyed at this lunch: Bucatini with a lamb? ragu- nice portion, taste but not too much complexityif flavor Beet Salad- very fresh and simple with a nice vinaigrette Hangar Steak- five buck supplemnt is worth it for it comes with onions an almost chimichurri sauce- actually better than a chimichurri. Branzino- subbed in for Black Bass and broccoli-ish green. The view is nice and sunny but it is tricky to find the restaurant and one feels like the location is forced on the side of a business building lobby. That said, I cannot wait to come back for a late supper.
