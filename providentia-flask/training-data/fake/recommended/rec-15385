I ordered the pappardelle ($19) with high expectations, but what came out was mushy -- both the pasta and the ragu, and overly salty. It might have been slightly better if I didn't tell them I was in a hurry, but still it was really disappointing that this can ever happen to a restaurant. I'd be willing to give them another chance but I don't live in NYC.
