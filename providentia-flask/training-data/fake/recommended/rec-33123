A group of friends and I headed to Ardesia for my birthday dinner before a show. We loved that we were able to make a reservation just a few hours before heading to the restaurant. When we arrived, our table was ready, and our server got our drinks quickly. We ordered a variety of dishes. The spinach and crab dip was delicious and to me the most memorable dish. The pretzel and croquettes were pretty good, nice and hot. We ordered a cheese plate, which had a nice presentation on the board but would have been better if the server who delivered it would have taken the time to tell the group which cheese was what. Our server was great at first, but as the night went on, he was around less and less. Our water glasses went empty for a long time. He asked before the meal started if we were trying to make a show, and we told him we were but that we had a little time. But at the end of the night, we were rushing to make it because it was took so long to get our check. The restaurant had gotten busier, and it looked like he was running a lot of food, but it would have been nice if he had been just a little more attentive or asked another server to check on us. It made the difference in our experience. I would have given Ardesia four stars if not for that because the night began so well. Ardesia has a great atmosphere; it's a lovely spot to gather with friends for a drink and snacks. It's tucked away on a quiet street. I might come back here, but perhaps at a time when they won't be crowded.
