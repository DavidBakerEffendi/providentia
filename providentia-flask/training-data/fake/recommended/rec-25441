I've now been here twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. Just ok. Convinced that it has high ratings based on value for money because the food is just ok. For lunch today I had lamb vindaloo and chicken tikka masala with basmati rice and naan. Portions were generous, but taste was just fair. Barely any heat, naan was just ok. No table service for lunch: elbow your way to the counter to order. Absolutely no ambience. It's a dive with decent Indian food cheap and fast. I that's what you're after, this is a solid choice.
