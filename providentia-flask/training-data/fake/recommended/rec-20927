Like many people who have reviewed this place before me, I've first heard of this place on Bobby Flay's TV show and had wanted to check it out ever since, especially since I love good lasagna. This was over two years ago and I've been patiently waiting for an opportunity to go to Burlington and when this opportunity came, I seized it and was not disappointed. As my parents and I planned our drive back from Montreal to Boston, Burlington seemed like a nice place to breakdown the drive and get lunch and I suggested (actually insisted!) that we go to Bove's. I had been purchasing their pasta sauce at supermarkets out here in Massachusetts since I saw the show and had always loved their jars of sauce - it all just made sense. We walked in and this place was a lot more modest looking than the TV show made it seem to be. Whatever, I didn't care. Our rental car was in their large parking lot in the back of the restaurant, far away from me and that's all that mattered, now onto food business. I promptly ordered their lasagna which came just minutes later. It was delicious to the very last bite. I was not disappointed at all and it was one of the best lasagnas I've had. The service was friendly and quick and the prices were just right. The only hiccup was the fact that they were cash only which almost became a problem for us and would have meant that one of us would have had to go to the ATM machine next door. That aside, I'd definitely go back there in my future trips in the area, especially with Lake Champlain just a two minute drive from there.
