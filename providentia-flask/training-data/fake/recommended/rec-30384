Have eaten here well over ten years running. Never a bad meal...yes its tight, and yes its crowded...but don't cry It's not Manhattan with table on top of table and prices on the top tier. This is solid, well done Polish food and by far better that any other place in this area. Soups are awesome and don't need the novelty of a bread bowl. Would/will go back in a heart beat !
