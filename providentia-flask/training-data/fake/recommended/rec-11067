I visited this place since it got many good reviews. The atmosphere is nice, with a second floor with more tables. Most of the diners were American. The food was ok, portion sizes were smaller than typical Vietnamese dishes, and were the perfect size. There are no vegetarian Pho options if your friends are vegetarian. I would come here again for the atmosphere.
