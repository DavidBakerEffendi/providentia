As many others have mentioned, upon entering you are seduced with a smoky smell that is both bacony and bourbony. Sadly, I'm not really Â a bourbon or whiskey fan (or do I thought...) so in looking at the drink menu I tried to find an alternate libation..but the thing is, getting a bourbon or whiskey based drink is really essential, as the smokiness lends itself so well to the food. My advice is the noreaster..SO DELICIOUS! Bourbon, ginger beer, maple syrup and lime. a perfect balance of tangy and sweet. We got the cheese curds with pimento-was kind of a no-brainer-hello, FRIED CHEESE? Sure! The pork nuggets were an obvious sidekick , both for content and the cheap price of $4...they were fried as well, smoky and savory but the hot sauce-BEWARE! It's HOT!! As for the entrees, I had the shrimp and grits while my friend had scallops over butternut puree. My shrimp had scallions and microgreens strewn prettily over the top, and though the shrimp had a beautiful caramelized char over creamy and nicely textured grits, it was lacking on seasoning. I had to ask for salt. Was lovely but needed a little kick. My friend's scallops were delicious, but she too felt a little salt was in order. We got a side of beer braised cabbage topped with little fried shallots, which had the most delicious balance of earthy-smoky-tangy sweetness and were the perfect foil to my slightly unexciting shrimp. For dessert we shared the homemade butter pecan ice cream-creamy with the old-fashioned-homemade bits of ice crystal, the pecans were divinely enrobed in praline and a shot of bourbon over the whole thing capped the meal just perfectly.
