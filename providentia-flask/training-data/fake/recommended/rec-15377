The atmosphere was romantic and cozy, but the food was lacking. We started with the pizza style focaccia - the pesto sauce was a bit boring, the cheese was bland and the bread wasn't anything special. It was decent, but I wouldn't order it again. For dinner we shared the truffle gnocchi and the prosciutto stuffed ravioli in mushroom sauce. The dishes were good but way too heavy on the cream. We were definitely in a food coma after that meal. Along with dinner we were able to catch the wine flight special. It was a good deal ($14 for three wines) but I didn't enjoy the white wine selection as much as I enjoyed the red wines. Overall, the service was great, but the food was unmemorable.
