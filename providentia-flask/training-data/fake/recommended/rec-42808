Great and quaint. Came here with my bf on New Year's Day. I ordered the french toast and he ordered the western omelette with cheese. We both split our meals with each other and every bite was delicious. The service was great and they have $6 screwdrivers (for those of us who like our breakfast drinks). The place is a bit small and can get really crowded, but we ended up only waiting for about 15 minutes. I would definitely go back and, as someone who grew up in Manhattan, the laid back BK vibe was much appreciated.
