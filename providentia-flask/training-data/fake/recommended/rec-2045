King of steaks....I'd consider false advertisement. It's hard to express to people that haven't lived in philly all their life that Pat's and Gino's are just name dropped places. Just because it's in S. Phila doesn't mean it still has the charm of a corner pizzeria from a local business. Skip this place all together to get a REAL cheese steak experience. But if you must choose...go with this.
