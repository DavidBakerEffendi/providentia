I haven't been here for nearly 20 years (it was the first Thai place at which I ever ate, so I had fond memories), but stopped by about a month ago with family. It was very disappointing. The food was bland, the curries were not the usually soup-like curries I tend to see in this area, the service was unpleasant, the decor shabby and grimy. I usually go to TK3 which is excellent but far, so I was hoping this place would please. Alas it did not.
