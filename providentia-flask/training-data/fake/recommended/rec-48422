The food is really simple and really, really good.  It was very reasonably priced, and the service was friendly.  We got a sampling of appetizers and pasta entrees.   Everything was delicious.  The roasted red pepper and goat cheese crostini and the zucchini parmigiana were both outrageous--don't miss them!   I'll definitely be back. Soon.
