I am very conflicted with this place. The food here is excellent. The oxtails and jerk chicken are really really amazing. The upstairs dining feels like a secret hideout, but can get stuffy. Also bad if you are claustrophobic. I've been here twice and each time the service was completely different. The first time around, our food had come out in a matter of minutes, as it should since oxtails are probably simmering all day (people who complain about stews not made to order are idiots). The second time around, oof. It was about an hour to get one order of jerk chicken. The waiter / DELIVERY guy at one point refused to take my order. I felt bad for the kid, hes definitely a family member that doesnt want to work there. He would take orders and then leave to make deliveries. I also inquired about what they had to drink (this place is byob, btw) and was told of a pineapple ginger juice only to learn later that it was a soda. Eventually, we did get our jerk chicken and it was very good, but not 1 hour wait good. Go for the food and not for the service. Might be smarter to just call in and pick up. I want to give this place 5 stars, but its lack of organized service is unexcusable.
