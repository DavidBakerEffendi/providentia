I'm not sure salt and fat is 'as good as it gets' but it's pretty darn close. You get artful, delicious food at not-outrageous prices! And you can dress casually :) The name does suggest the amount of pork products you are going to encounter, and it also gives the restau that trendy vibe that seems to be happening in newer restaus all over, but it doesn't at all prepare you for the culinary excellence you are about to behold. I have to say - The yellowtail tartar surprised me at first. I am used to yellowtail being presented with spices and peppers. Not here. They present it as delicately and deliciously as tuna tartar. I could literally eat 4 of these and still want more. They are just that dang good! Also extremely yummy is the truffled beet salad with a bit of creme fraiche and I believe arugula. Love it!! Â Probably, you should eat this before the tartar b/c the tartar will make this less impressive than it is if you eat it first ;) Another great dish appears in the scallops with an awesome roasted carrot puree. YUM! My friend enjoyed Korean BBQ wraps more so than I did, but you have to try to know, yes? We were fortunate to go back a month later with a larger group thus trying even more deliciousness. Unfortunately I eat out way too often to remember what we had - but it was also great. Try not to fill up on the bacon-flavored popcorn!!
