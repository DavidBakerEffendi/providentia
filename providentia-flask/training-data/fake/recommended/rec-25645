I had dinner here, I was the only one who really ordered since my friends already had dinner. The waitress didn't seem to mind and she was very kind. I ordered the crispy pork cutlet and a bottle of Gr√ºner Veltliner, Schloss Gobelsbur. The wine was amazing, one of new favorites, a white option from Austria & Germany list. Crispy, yet sweet and strong.
