UVA UVA UVA ~ what delicious food you have! Took my boyfriend Nick there for his birthday this past weekend & we had a fabulous time. The decor and lighting is romantic (LOVE). We had a lovely waitress who was making sure to check on us every so often.. Not pushy at all. We started off having the appetizer dishes... 1) the dish that is smoked mozzarella rapped in Prosciutto with bread crumbs was to die for! 2) we got the meatballs, so yummy! We both got two different types of pasta.. Simply wonderful. The one thing we were a little upset about was that they didn't make it clear on here or on the website that they don't start making pizza until after 11 pm! We found out after we were seated and asked for a type of pizza, Bummer! Other than that it truly was a perfect place for a romantic dinner for two! A must go to dinner location if your in NYC!
