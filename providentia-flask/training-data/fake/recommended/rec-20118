Frenchican food? YEP... This place makes it work. I had the Guacamole and chips for the app and it was real good! They make it right in front of you which is always cool! Â For the entree I had their version of surf`n`turf it was fin, but I knew I should have ordered a fish or spicy chicken dish but I wanted to try it! I love the atmosphere here, very dim and they don't rush you out but it can be a little pricey! I'll definitely give it another try soon!
