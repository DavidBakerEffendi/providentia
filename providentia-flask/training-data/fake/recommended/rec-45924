Very friendly and they seem to want to be better but they're clearly struggling. After being sat, it took nearly 20 minutes to place an order. We were looking to get in and out - and had viewed the menu before arriving - we were the people who are gone in 40 minutes. Our food came out at different times, and we were a two top. Â With a movie theatre so close, they need to learn to execute quickly. The food also lacked flavor, the pad Thai had onions which was a surprise, and the tuna roll we ordered as an appetizer didn't come out until after the entrees. I hope they get it together.
