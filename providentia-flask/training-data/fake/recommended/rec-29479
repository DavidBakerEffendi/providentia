Nice atmosphere, I think it would be a good place to go if you just want to chat with a friend over wine while snacking on bruscetta.  I went with a big group- the wine was great, the food was just decent.  The rabbit was fine, nothing special.  The gnocci was cold and gummy.  I'm glad it joined the neighborhood so I don't wanna trash it, but I'm not sure if I'll be back.
