I didn't give five stars because it really pisses me off when they won't seat you without your entire party (especially when the bar is too packed to get within 50' and you have to stand around freezing in the lobby beause 1 person was stuck in traffic on 76...) Oh, and they also really rushed us out of there- like took one of my friends' unfinished drinks (that was 3/4 full!) off the table before she was done with it...granted it was a busy Saturday night, thats really annoying. Either way, this place has great food, drinks and fun atmosphere. They have great (complimentary) chips & salsa to start. We also got the queso fundido, which was super yum. I had some kind of lobster/crab/shrimp enchiladas, which were beyond amazing. Everyone was happy with their food. We had a very charming waiter who didn't seem to mind us asking him to repeat certain things so we could enjoy his accent over and over again...ha!
