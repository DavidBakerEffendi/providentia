I wish I could give these guys 50 stars. This place is delicious. I'm definitely a full scale carnivore but I do eat vegan a few days a week (weird, I'm a terrible person, blah blah) and this place cannot be beat. Spicy Mang is my favorite by far but La Fiesta and the sweet potato one are really tasty. It's such a clean place inside and they are super nice. I ended up going two days in a row and they remembered me. Seating is miniscule but with all of the surrounding places to sit and relax (i.e. the square, belfry, etc.), it's not bad. Do yourself a favor and stop in ASAP.
