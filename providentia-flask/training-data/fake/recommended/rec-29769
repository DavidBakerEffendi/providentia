the Five Leaves burger had a great flavor combination- fried pineapple and egg on top- but i still dont think its the best burger in BK....few tables outside but the place gets filled up quickly. Â The salad had a nice light summery dressing on it...the truffle french fries were cooked well and were tasty...I am a sucker for truffle oil, i have to admit...adjacent to the now-shit-filled McCarren Pool....
