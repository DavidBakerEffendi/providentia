Awesome awesome!  We were going to Helium comedy and looking for a place to eat. We came across Slate and it was fairly empty. After dining there, I can only assume it was empty because no one knows of this gem. A burger stuffed with short ribs? Creative and delicious!  Salad was great too!  Sat at the bar. The bartender was nice and helpful.  Go here now!
