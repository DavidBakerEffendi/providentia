We - group of 5. After some waiting, seated in the cavernous dining area downstairs. Impressive. Waiter: pushing drinks on us based on best for men/women.. also by saying they have 'the best' whatever whatever. really? Can i quote you on that? Our wait just to get water: 20 min. Our wait for food after placing orders: 1 friggen hour! other tables sat down later and were almost done with their meals. we are still waiting. Waiter is absent. Finally he swings by to tell us that hes really sorry and our food will be out in "3 minutes, i promise". If you cant deliver on that promise, then don't promise. Food was out in 10-15 additional minutes. We are starving at this point and they know it. We're still just drinking water and whatever drinks were ordered - oh yeah, did not bring at all one of our drinks. I would not recommend this place if you're not going for the chicken, seems like that's the goal here. I keep reading about those huge $14 chicken portions. How come my quinoa and spinach was so much more costly then? Food - unimpressive, service totally sucked. We ended up asking for a discount due to neglect & long waiting time, they took of 20% off of our total bill. Overall, this place has awesome decor, but food is uninspiring (outside of chicken i suppose), sort of pretentious, and doesn't live up to it's hype.
