Oh, Olea. I would come here just to bask in the sun-filled space alone. Seriously--lighting matters, and this place has got it down. However, Â this place has much more to it's credit than well-placed windows (which really are very well-placed! and plentiful). The mosaic tiles, clay stucco, and wooden ceiling of course do a lil somethin somethin to the overall ambience. But of course, the Foooood: I came here for brunch a couple Sundays ago. It was packed, so my roomie and I sat at the bar. No problem with that. We had more opportunity to chat with the gracious bartender (yes, even on a Sunday morning) and get all of her reccomendations. Speaking of which, everything on the menu is a reccomendation. Very fresh, big portions, and truly unique. DO try the chocolate croissants. They (comes with 2) come piping hot and the gooey chocolate is melty magnificence. Also, they're a different take on the typical--the outer dough is more phyllo (in keeping with the Greek theme of the place), which to me was an UPGRADE. Mmmm just thinking about em.... And just wait till you hear what I had for my entree--Savory Parmesan French Toast Topped with poached eggs, peas, scallions, pea shoots and avgolemono sauce-- don't even know what that last delectable sauce even is, but the whole thing was a DIVINE and transformative take on french toast. In addition, the omellettes are spot-on. Good luck with picking just one from all the delicious choices though--Greek? French? Spanish? Italian? Turkish? ALL PLEASE. Which is why I'm heading back ASAP....
