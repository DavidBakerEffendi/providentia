First time at Traif and of course not the last one... This place is amazing and the food is yummy! The pork sliders are the best... the spicy tuna with eggplants is delicious, not to forget the crispy shrimps... Will return soon to try more dishes The only thing that I didnt like was the music... very loud and lot of trance which is not appropriate for the place
