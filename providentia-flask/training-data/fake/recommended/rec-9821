Apparently I have to dine-in to get the full experience. From the few delivery items that I had, I was not very impressed. The Spicy Thai Basil Noodles were neither spicy of basil-y. (I found 2 small basil leafs). Furthermore, the noodles were a bit chewy and bland. I would not order it again. The saving grace so far has been Chicken Satay and the dumpling appetizer. Not your traditional dumplings, instead they were more of a thinly covered pork meatball. Tasty! You only get 3 small ones though, so be warned. There are too many other great spots on 9th Ave to give Room Service a second go around.
