The waiter recommended ordering two dishes per diner.  We thought that was silly so ordered one, and it's a good thing too.  The food was descent, the crab pad thai was very tart; almost floating in lemon juice, the tofu satay was delectable, and the wasabi taters were veery good.  I ordered a scotch on the rocks, but that's impossible to screw up!
