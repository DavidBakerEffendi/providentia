Great weekend brunch place with kids. Big space and able to accommodate larger groups with a reservation. Ricotta pancakes and french toast are delicious. Steer clear of the bagels - they are hard and either under or over toasted. Wish they'd invest in thermos pitchers for the coffee so that refills are actually hot. But overall the menu is diverse and has something for everyone. Conveniently located to MOMATH and the new Flatiron Lego Store.
