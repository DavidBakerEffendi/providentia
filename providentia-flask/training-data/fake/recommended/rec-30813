For a place with a great brunch menu, I wish they had had a deal or something on food/drink combo. They seemed to be doing an awesome drink business with their fruity brunch cocktails. The bartender seemed to be making pitchers nonstop. I ordered the salume pizza and it was definitely one of the best pizzas I've had in nyc. With their brick oven it came out great.
