My boyfriend and I stopped for coffee one morning, and decided to stay for breakfast. I will agree with others here that the portions are huge. I wasn't too enamored of the hollandaise on the eggs Benedict Florentine as it tasted too strongly of orange, and had a orangish hue, but the garlic sauteed spinach was amazing. I would've been happy with a bowl of that. We also ordered the tofu scramble and the Barking Chihuahua, along with the bagel and cream cheese. The entrees were both quite good, with the tofu coming up as the favorite, and the bagel had two gorgeous slices of perfectly ripe tomato. The $9.95 price tag for a bagel and lox seems a bit much (we didn't order it so I don't know how generous they might be, but considering the size of the other plates the price might be spot on) but a few of the other dishes I would say could be marked a dollar or two higher and they would still be acceptable prices. We returned again today and our server was the same as before, which was fine with me because she was great the other day and just as fabulous this morning. She even remembered us, which was nice. She was extremely friendly, knew the menu very well, and made a change on a dish for me without me having to ask (I've never had scrapple before so she put it on the side of the Benedict just in case I didn't like it.). We've driven past on weekends and yes, it looks extremely crowded. We had no problems on our two visits as we went on a Tuesday morning around 10:30, and then this morning at 11:30. Â  The soundtrack for Tuesday and today was all 80s but that works for me since I'm 41! Oh, good coffee. They are also pet-friendly and our server brought our dog his own little water bowl.
