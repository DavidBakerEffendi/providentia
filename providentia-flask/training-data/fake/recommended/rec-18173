I went here twice for Dining Days and was not disappointed. For $15 you get an insane amount of food-i think was the best deal around. Both times i got the crispy pork spring rolls to start, then I got the vermicelli one time and the fish claypot the second time. Both are awesome. For dessert, i tried the pudding which was a little strange, but still worth trying, and the second time i got ice cream. What a deal! Service is always great, and I'll give a nod to the cool hand dryers as well.
