My Husband took me here last week after he was raving about it for over a month. His friends took him there before his bachelor party and he loved it. He bragged so much about the Dan Dan noodles. We made reservations so we got in easily and the food was great we tried the dan dan noodles and I had lamb and rice which was absolutely delicious we will be back. I plan to try the one in university city next time. Great experience everyone should go at least once.
