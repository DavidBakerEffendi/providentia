This place is cheap and delicious. I found the counterpoint of chewiness, flavor, and fried skin of the pork and chive dumplings was right on the money. We didn't try anything else because we were headed to lunch around the block, but I will be back. The only problem I had was a bit of a misunderstanding of the ordering process. There was a pile of people waiting, and it was somewhat unclear that you had to push your way to the front. I know, mostly my fault, just a word to anybody that hasn't gone yet.
