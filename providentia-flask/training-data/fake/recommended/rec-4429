I get the craziest cravings for foods and this day was fish taco's. Recalled that Jose Pistolas sold fish taco's and decided to go before my class. Noticed that an order of taco's included only 2 taco's and no sides so I'd decided to get some nachos and the taco's. The waitress informed me that that wasn't a good idea unless I was just really really hungry almost quoted exactly:) Not totally rude not totally sun shiny. Decided to believe her and order the meal which came with a salad some beans and rice. I enjoyed it although I'm not usually excited about a beans and rice side option. But the taco's were really really good and probably not them as much as it was the fact I enjoyed the sauce that was on them. Gripe would be wish it was explained that it would be a soft not hard taco, not huge issue just saying due to preferences. And would have been nice if my waitress didn't tell me she'd forgotten about me after returning about 15 minutes after I'd finished my meal. Wasn't a huge deal that day because I was waiting to go to my class and had the time, just saying. And not to be uppity but the wardrobe was a bit too laid back for my taste at least when it came to my waiter oppose to the guy behind the bar. Something about how someone looks while serving me food I suppose. Not the wardrobe itself but cleanliness.
