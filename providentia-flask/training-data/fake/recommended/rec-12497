This is one of my favorite brunch spots in the city especially when the weather cooperates and I am able to enjoy the outdoor seating.The only downside is to perfect weather is that everyone else in the city wants to fight you for a seat at this lovely establishment on that day and that time. The lines are long and the waiters can get a bit cranky but the food is worth waiting for. I don't think I've ever had a "bad" meal here - the eggs are always cooked to perfection and the hollandaise sauce is absolutely perfect! For this reason, I always tend to order the eggs florentine but my brunching buddies are more adventurous and will order something different almost every time. I am greedy so I always take a taste test and can vouch that this cafe can make things other than eggs taste good!
