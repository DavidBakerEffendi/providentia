I walked into Lovers & Madmen right before work to grab a iced latte and perhaps something to eat. When I walked in, I wasn't waited on until about five minutes later. I asked for a iced latte and a blueberry scone. I was given a raspberry scone and the latte was mediocre. The total came out to almost ten dollars and the barista told me that the scone was 4.25. Extremely overpriced for a mediocre scone. The sugar and condiments stand was messy and they had silver stirring spoons which were iffy on whether or not they were clean. Overall, I found that my experience at this cafe too overpriced for an okay scone and watery coffee.
