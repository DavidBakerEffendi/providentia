Great new bar for the neighborhood. Good bartenders and drinks, and the backyard is perfect for the summer. Chill atmosphere and decent crowd when I was there as well. I didn't get a chance to try the food, but my friends said everything they ate was delicious. Will definitely be back, and I'm interested to see how this place grows over the summer as more people find out about it.
