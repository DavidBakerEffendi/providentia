The pizzas are all delicious, the pasta is great, beer list was well rounded, and dessert was a great finish. I have had a chance to sample 4 different pizzas, all very good.  The octopus pizza was very good, the octopus was not rubbery at all.  In addition to the pizzas I have tried three different pastas the chicken liver rigatoni, a lamb ravioli, and a mushroom ravioli.  The chicken liver rigatoni is very, very good just as advertised.  I was very wary of even trying the dish because I have not been a big fan of liver in the past, but I was so happy that I did.  The ravioli dishes were good, both incredibly rich. For dessert I would highly recommend the polenta budino.  It is an amazingly delicious pudding topped with hazelnuts.  I think that it is once of my favorite desserts of all times. I have never been to any of Vetri's other restaurants, but I am very anxious to try them.
