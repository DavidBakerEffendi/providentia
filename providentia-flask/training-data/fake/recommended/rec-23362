In addition to their beautiful bar, this place has amazing food. I went for the National Escargot Day snail menu. It was fantastic! My husband is not as big a fan of snails, so he ordered off the regular menu. His clams were particularly delicious. I highly recommend this place for a delectable meal. It was a little cold out for us, but they have a lovely patio area for outdoor dining as well. The service was great too - very knowledgeable and courteous.
