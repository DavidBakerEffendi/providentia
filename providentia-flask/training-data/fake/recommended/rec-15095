We've come here several times and have always enjoyed the food and had good service. You do need to be careful what you choose if you don't like things too spicy because their spicy dishes are rather hot. The Tom Yum soup is very good if you do like spicy food. They have good thai iced tea and other drinks such as limeade. I can't think of any dish I've had there which I didn't like. The waitresses are always nice and attentive. Unless they're busy, it's often a nice quiet cozy place.
