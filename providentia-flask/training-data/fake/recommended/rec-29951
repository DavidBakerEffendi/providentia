The only complaint I have about this place is that they refuse to take reservations for parties of 6 or more! Come on! Use a credit card to hold the reservation....oh wait, they are too cheap to take credit cards. You would be 5 stars if you corrected this stuff Bianca! More importantly though? The food is amazing!! And so very reasonable! All the pasta is handmade and homemade! Do NOT MISS the Lasagne or the Gorgonzola Gnocchi! Typically good as gnocchi is? It is usually like lead balls in the tummy. NOT HERE!! light as a feather! There is actually too much in the portions to finish. Truly the best kept Italian food secret in Manhattan! The soup with a broth and parmesana cheese and the spaetzle like noodles? A meal in itself!! I have dined here 3 times now. Totally consistent. Once was a party of 11! EVERYONE enjoyed their food! And basically NO ONE could finish! We're a foodie supper club to boot! I am headed back with some friends in a few days. Can't wait!!
