I really don't see what people like about this place. In Riva specializes in pizzas and I tried a few different ones when I've gone there (about 3 times). I did not care for any of them. For a place that specializes in pizza I was expecting a lot better. I really didn't enjoy any of them but I'd be willing to go back and give it another shot. Maybe I'm just not ordering the right ones?? But DEFINITELY try the split pea soup. It is absolutely AMAZING. I would go back and eat about 13 bowls of that stuff. It's legit.
