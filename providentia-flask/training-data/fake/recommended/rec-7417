I hate to have to write this review but after my experience last night I'm left with no choice. Note: this is not a review of the food. As big Fatty Crew fans, my boyfriend and I were super excited to try Pig and Khao. We arrived at 6:05 (20 minutes late for our 5:45 reservation) and apologized for our tardiness. The male host informed us that he had marked us as a no-show and given our table to a walk-in. Understandable. Our bad for being late. As he's trying to figure out what to do with us a blonde woman appears and rudely tells us the restaurant's policy is to hold reservations for 15 minutes and since they had already given our table away there was no way we'd be able to eat there that night. But there's 3 empty tables I point out. All reserved. Ok, what about the bar? No, it's full. We can wait. We're all booked for tonight. Suggestion to future diners: DON'T BE LATE! Never in 8 years of living in NYC have I been flat out turned away by a restaurant. I'd love to give Pig and Khao another chance but this experience left a really bad taste in my mouth. So across the street we went to Yunnan Kitchen. And what lovely service we received!
