I had a pathetic diner experience here. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but when I say, "Burger with blue cheese and bacon" and my brother-in-law says "Blackened burger with blue cheese", how hard is that to accomplish?  Our (possibly high on painkillers or just slow) waitress brought me a burger with some bacon on it, a roasted red pepper and with a few shreds Monterrey Jack cheese.  Brother in law just got a plain burger with nothing on it. We told her what we were supposed to get.  She walks away with our plates.  Then comes back in 5 minutes with the same f-ing plates.  Is that a joke?  Nope!  She then proceeds to bring back the menu to tell us what we got.  Thanks idiot!!  I need to see your f up in writing.  I don't care what you wanted to bring us.  I just wanted what I ordered.  At this point, we had been waiting for our food for a long time and I was hungry so I ate the idiot's selection... cold. Don't ever go here while this tard still works here.  The place is craptastic.. don't waste your time at a crap dinner while there are good ones around.
