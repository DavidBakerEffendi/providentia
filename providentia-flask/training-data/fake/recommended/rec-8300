This place has some of the best Indian food in New York. We took a friend who had never tried Indian and she loved it. I was blown away by the chicken tikka masala (which I understand has won awards). Also had the jalfrezi, which was perfectly sauced and seasoned. The vegetables were flavorful, still crunchy. The saag paneer was very flavorful as well. The best part for me was eating the coconut poori with everything. I've never had anything like it. This restaurant was reasonably priced ($43 for 3 people), and we were able to bring some white wine, which was nice. The waitstaff was extremely friendly. I will be back!
