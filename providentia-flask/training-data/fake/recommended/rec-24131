Oh. My. God. I was introduced to this place by a friend who lives close by and boy am I happy for it! A few of us needed to grab a quick bite to eat before seeing Jurassic Park 3D (which is awesome in case you're wondering) and this cart was on the way. I got rice with chicken, lamb, and white sauce and OH MY GOD it's SO delicious!! None of us could clear our plates either because they were PACKED with food. Not only that but it's c-h-e-a-p. All in all I think I spent about $6 for a bowl and a soda. Needless to say this place has been on my mind, so I will most definitely be back.....a couple of times. I mean, I need to share this with my girlfriend and then again with my dad right? Don't pass it by if you're hungry.
