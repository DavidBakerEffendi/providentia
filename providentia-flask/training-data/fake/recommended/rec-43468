I must mention our server was polite and did a great job overall.  The food here has really slipped and was not good.  I feel cheated having paid for any of the food at all while the drinks were actually rather solid.  One star goes to the poor execution of the food, missed ingredients and lack of overall flavor.   Hamachi- can't taste any hamachi with all the other garnish on there so why not just use any fish as the hamachi is just lost. Tortillas- nasty, bland and very dry around the edges Squash special- if your a fan of dirty water you will like this watery and dirty looking dish. Chicken mole- decent if this were a staff meal. Jicama salad- missing three of the listed ingredients, very poor execution on the cuts of vegetables and seasoning was non existent. Terrible restaurant and will not return as there are far better Mexican restaurants all over philly.
