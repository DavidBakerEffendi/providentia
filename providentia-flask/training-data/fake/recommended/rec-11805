I just came home from an extraordinary meal at Northern Spy. Not a plate left the table that still had food on it (well, except for my friend who got the chicken and took home half of it). We started with a cheese plate, which was demolished in approximately 3 minutes, then the three of us split the duck fat fries (almost like they were covered in bacon fat...delish...). One friend had the kale salad (TO DIE FOR PLEASE GET THIS) with the warm squash soup (I didn't try it, but she said it was ahhhmazing), then I split the pear and celery salad which was recommended by the wonderful Kristin -- it was unexpectedly delicious and full of unusual but amazing flavors. I loved it. For the entree, I had the striped bass, which was served with bok choy and cranberry beans. So delicious. I couldn't quite put my finger on what was so tasty about this at first, but then I realized that YES it was the cranberry beans and YES it was perfect. I tried a bite of my friend's chicken dish, and after I learned that it was brined for 48 hours, I understood what made it so deliciously juicy. The grains and veggies it came with (swiss chard, freekeh and cheese pumpkin) just added to the dish in the most delectable way. For dessert, we had three different dishes that we split: the hazelnut torte with sweet potato gelato (unexpected and so very tasty), the poached pear with chevre ice cream (holy moly, one of my favorites for sure), and the special dessert, the egg nog pudding (GET THIS GET IT NOW). I should have been rolled home after all the delicious food that we ate, but somehow the bus managed to accommodate me. I WILL be back -- I absolutely love that the specials change and the menu changes with the seasons. And as long as Kristin is working there, recommending the best dishes and providing most excellent service, you can bet that I will be visiting much more often! Thanks for making our Monday night so wonderful, Kristin!
