This has to be an east coast thing?-- Â really amazingly great restaurants that are aesthetically unassuming, stuck in between Quiznos and Cheap Cuts in strip malls. Carlucci's is perfect. It has to be that great grandma and grandpa passed through Ellis island and grandma planted victory gardens and this is the first generation to move away from Brooklyn where mom and dad had a carlucci's where the kids were raised busing tables and learning the ropes. They do it, the whole restaurant experience, like they were born into it. It smells right when you walk in -- without looking at the menu you want to order whatever it is you smell simmering away in the kitchen. You're shepherded to a table where, before you know it, food and wine are flowing. crazy puffy garlic bread that's more like naan than anything i've ever tried -- It's actually puffed up like half a basketball, and you jab it with a knife to release steam and watch the bread deflate. this is delicious bread and should be served at every Italian restaurant, everywhere. My broccoli rabe was perfect (pour some more red). There were 13 of us and plates were passing to enthusiastic mmm's all around. Great plates of pasta with giant prawns and spicy red sauce (more red). Tender chicken picatta (another bottle of chianti!). Too full for dessert, and that was fine since the selection looked disappointingly pre-packaged. All in all, a great, fun experience. Not the best of the best by any stretch, but well worth the trip from Princeton or anywhere within 10 miles or so. Beyond that, there's probably another one not too unlike it.
