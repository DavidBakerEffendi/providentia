On a recommendation I went here with 2 friends on a Tuesday night.  We arrived at around 8 and although the place was basically full we were sat quite promptly. The decor was great. I loved the chandeliers and the bare wooden tables were also sharp looking. We sat in the room to the right which looks like we were sitting in someone's house... A feeling I like from restaurants. I love beer and they had 10 taps and the selection was very thought out. It was my first taste of this years Sierra Nevada Celebration and it was awesome.  The service although busy was adequate.  We never waited long for anything and sometimes a server not being so overbearing is welcomed. One of my friends is a vegetarian and Arianne made a special pasta dish for him as they were out of the ravioli special.  Food was great.. crabcake app was perfect. We had some mushroom app that was addicting.  We ordered that for the vegetarian but I think I ate most of it. I had the pork chop which is now in my top 3 pork chops of all time.  My other friend had the chicken pot pie. It wasn't as expected but the quality of the chicken was top notch. Very rarely am I blown away by grilled chicken but the juiciness and freshness of this dish was memorable.  It's hard to mess up dessert and they didn't.  All in all a great place that I am sure is still working out the kinks of being new but I will 100% be back.
