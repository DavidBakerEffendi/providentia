A perfectly-placed quaint cafe that draws a cute, laid-back crowd 24/7. Best during summer nights (outdoor tables!) or weekend brunches, you're well-perched for people watching while you nosh on yummy desserts or fresh salad fare. If you're there after the sun's gone down, I recommend the $15 pitcher of sangria; unfortunately, they serve wine and beer but no cocktails. No need to rush your stay here--they let you sit and just drink coffee while you study for your finals, if that's more your speed.
