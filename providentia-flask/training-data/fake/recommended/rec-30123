What a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  Having been there a few times, i can add my opinon.  Bar scene is great, cocktails made carefully with fresh ingredients..the Gin on on the list with cilantro a definite bow to Tabla.  Dining room is a little different from DM's others, a little more corporate...but food iwill not disappoint.  So far we have tried the scallops, the lanb and my favorite, the hallibut which is served  with a spicy broth..Tabla throwback again.  Service ....lots of people and everyone tries...but having read DM's book, I agree with him and I'd never judge a restaurant within a few weeks of opening.  We were waiting a long time for apptisers and before we were finished the entrees show..they'll get this together and North End Grill will be another great success from DM and team.
