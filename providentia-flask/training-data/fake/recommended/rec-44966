I like this resaurant overall. The decor is very cool and it gets packed out!  Almost feels like you are going to a vintage Ralph Lauren store.   The food was good and I really enjoyed the artichoke dip.  My Piedmontese burger was par and it was actually kind of cold when they served it.  Maybe because there was a group of 12+ for a prix fixe birthday menu.   I suggest this place strongly if you need to organize a large group gathering.  They have a private room that can accommodate 15+ people and you do not feel crowded. The location is awesome and definitely stop by the Freeman clothing store as well.
