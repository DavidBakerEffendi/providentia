Stopped by tonight with my daughter and her fiance to try their pizza dog, but unfortunately they were out of the dough, bummer, but the dogs we did have were very good. I had the ban mi dog which was fresh and flavorful just like the original ban mi. The fries were outstanding crisp on the outside creamy on the inside with several dips like wasabi and garlic. Would like to come back to try that pizza dog.
