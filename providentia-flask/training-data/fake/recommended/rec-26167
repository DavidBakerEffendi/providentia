Sunny and Annie's has been serving up some of the meanest sandwiches in Manhattan.  They will fill you up quick, but won't flatten your wallet.  The real gem here is the Pho sandwich, complete with bean sprouts, brisket, and hoisin.  Too much deliciousness in each bite, and make fresh to order.  Its the definition of hole in the wall dining, but my god sometimes I get more pleasure eating shit like this than dining at Michelin starred restaurants.   PROTIP:  They take credit cards.
