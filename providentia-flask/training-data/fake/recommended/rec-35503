The overall experience was good and the beers were tasty. Fun crowd, a little dark which is great when you're looking for it on a Friday night out. What was not so fun however was when I was over charged...Although the bartender had apparently refunded it, a week later it had not appeared. When I called with my concerns I was blown off by the day staff multiple times and told to reach out to my bank because it was no longer their problem, and then when I called again, someone took my info and said that it would take a few days to clear up...I am still waiting for the call. I may consider going back, but I will only be paying cash.
