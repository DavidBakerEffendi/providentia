Ehh I hate to say it but as with many Starr Restaurants, the concept outweighs the food. I'm not going to hate on the guy...I give him 5 stars on the idea, the decor, the authenticity. He's a powerhouse! He has some spectacular restaurants...and some that just have better atmosphere than food (Read: you almost always get an A+ in my book for concept and atmosphere....but some of your places taste like chain restaurants....not to say that they don't taste good but why pay $20 a plate for things I can get at Friday's for $8?? Snap, I just went there.) It's a great place to hang out, plain and simple. They have firepits, board games and lots of seating. Their staff is super cool and super fast. Kudos for the s'mores. Butttt I gotta say, their food was okay. Love German food! I've been to Germany numerous times and always found some awesome little beer hall with killer good food. So as basic as the fare sounds, it could be mind-blowing. Not to say that Frankford Hall has bad food by any means, but I was hoping for something more memorable to the tastebuds for a pretzel with homemade cheesewiz for $8. The bratwurst was decent but again, everything tasted like things I could buy at a store...Auntie Anne's? Hillshire Farms? I will rave about the potato salad and the cucumber salad. I could eat BOWLS of each and they both taste just like my German uncle makes them. Closing statement: Great hangout place. I ALWAYS HAVE A GOOD TIME. Definitely a place to go with a group to drink a few beers and just chill. HAPPY HOUR is awesome, $10 .5ltr of beer and a sausage?! Decent!! Buttt given how many AWESOME beer bars there are in Philly, if I'm going for the beer or the food, it wouldn't be my first option. Maybe I just end up there for the wrong reasons. I'll be back to hang out, but I'll get food somewhere more exciting before hand. Harsh or not, you asked for my opinion.. Entschuldingung.
