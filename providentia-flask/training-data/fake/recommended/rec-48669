One of the best restaurant I have been to! My boyfriend and I went here a few days after Valentines Day, and it was super quiet on the 2nd floor. Great date place. Service- Great, the waiter frequently asked us how we were doing, and our waters were always filled. Food- Excellent! Family style plates, so I recommend ordering a few plates to share with everyone. Roasted mushrooms, hanger steak, and Olive oil cake were so delicious. Would definitely be coming back!
