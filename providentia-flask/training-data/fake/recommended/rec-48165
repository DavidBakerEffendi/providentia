This review is regarding the restaurant at the Old Town Farm Inn only. Simply amazing.  The fish is extremely fresh, the owners have a very deep commitment (and knowledge) to providing only the best sustainable and fresh fish they can find, and there is a focus on really providing sushi the way it should be done.   Try the Unagi.  I hope I'm not incorrect, but the Farm house Inn sources theirs from Japan, where it's the sweetest and silkiest you will find (compared to unagi from China or Taiwan, the usual sources for most restaurants) Reservations appear to be required on a friday or saturday night due to the popularity.  This is where the locals eat, as very few people realize this gem of a restaurant exists.  Dining room is very small (fits only about 20-25 total), so make sure to plan ahead accordingly!
