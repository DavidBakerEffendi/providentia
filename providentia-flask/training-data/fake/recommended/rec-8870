This place is very cozy and intimate like a real french bistro. Food is great as well, fresh, tasty and real french. Service is pretty good and laid back. Nice selection of french, Italian and american wine list. They also have rare beer from Corse island really hard to find like Petra and Colomba. Your clothes will stink a bit if you sit inside, but In spring and summer you can enjoy an outside table. Overall great for an intimate casual dinner or for a brunch.
