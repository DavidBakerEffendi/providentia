I've been to Lyndhurst Diner twice so far and I equally enjoyed both my meals. The first time I had a Philly Steak Wrap, which was delicious and my mom got an Open Faced Steak Sandwich that looked amaazzzinnnggg - def. unexpected for a diner in my opinion. I wish I had taken a picture. It was cooked perfectly. The second time I got a Turkey Burger. Usually turkey burgers look unappetizing, but this one looked picture perfect with the lettuce, rounds of red onion, and avocado. I'm not usually a big fan of turkey burgers because they are usually just blah, but make me feel better about what I'm eating. This one, on the other hand, was delicious. I went with curly fries too. Real good. My sister got a Philly Cheese Steak. This is surprisingly one of the best diners I've been to. Also, the cashier stand is a bar haha so drink up.
