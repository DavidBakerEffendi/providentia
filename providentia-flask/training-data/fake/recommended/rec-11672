I went here on a Monday night- which wasn't too insanely busy. We decided to take a seat at the bar- and get in on some happy hour action- we ordered a large pitcher of sangria (which was deliciousssssssssss) and a super great deal as they do not put ice in the pitcher itself (amazing)!!!  The sangria was strong and super yummy! I also had the guac, which was tasty for but $9 was a little small.  The shrimp quesadillas were also really delicious and well worth the price. So why the 3 star rating?  The Service! The bartender was totally inattentive- and pretty much seemed as if she had zero interest in being there, let alone serve us at the bar... Its a Monday night- NOT that busy- there were probably 3 other parties at the bar if that- it definitely wasn't the crowd-  we had to waive her down for drinks and then when we wanted to order food we had to "pull" her away from her friend (who I guess was visiting her) at the end of the bar...I mean- sorry if we pulled you away from your personal convo- so we can get a meal in! When we finally got the bill- we noticed that we were mischarged- and our charges had to be voided out/redone etc. womp womp- Overall the food and drinks here are great- the service on the other hand....
