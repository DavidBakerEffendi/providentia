This place is teh awesome. Went there for drinks with a friend, and we had snacks but didn't eat a whole meal. I had a Hemingway Daiquiri, which was beyond delicious--I'm not usually a fan of bitter drinks, but this was oh-so-tasty. We split the Farmhouse Platter and a plate of their roasted potatoes. The aioli was revelatory, and the cheeses were fresh and yummy. Great olives, too. I was totally full after those two dishes. The bartenders are very friendly and highly personable, too. Southwark, I'll be back!
