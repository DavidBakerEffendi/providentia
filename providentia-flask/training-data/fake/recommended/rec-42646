Authentic Brazilian food!! I've tried other places but the way they cool their meat-- hands down delicious! All the meat is cooked in a brick fire place which you can peak in and see al the meat on skewers. It's the last stop on when getting your food. It has bacon wrapped chicken, lam and other meats! I wished the Buffett had different choices sometimes. It's mostly the same choices with a little variety. But the rice is just right and not over spiced up. Even if your not Brazilian it's still a safe place to eat. I know how new foods can upset some people's stomach. ( And the chef other staff were fluent in Portuguese and very respectful) Clean , yummy, pay by the pound, and has select drinks.
