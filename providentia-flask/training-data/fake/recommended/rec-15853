The stars are completely for the food. The service has always been subpar. I don't know if we never go dressed up enough but we have never had good service. The last time we went it took 15 minutes before we were approached by anyone after we were seated. With all of that said, we keep going back for the food and the hours! I love that they serve a full menu until 2am! Their truffle honey and goat cheese crostini is amazing! I literally have dreams about the sweet party in my mouth of flavors! The gnocchi is excellent and their pizzas are good too!
