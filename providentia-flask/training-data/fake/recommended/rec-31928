cozy lil place. ordered florentine which was a sandwich with grilled chicken, spinach, and feta cheese on a hero. plus fries. the hero was soooooo soft! if there was a hero bigger than me, i'd want to sleep on it. the fries were crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside. there are a lot of regulars and johny knows them by name and what they want. i'm always amazed at places like this. it's a small town joint in a big city. you can get a big meal for under $10, which is a bargain!
