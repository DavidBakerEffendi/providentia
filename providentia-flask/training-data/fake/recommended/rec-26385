Absolutely delectable! Stumbled upon this place while searching for a local restaurant with some friends. To start off, the atmosphere was really amiable and the waiters were more than friendly (I think we even got served by one of the chefs). Make sure to go early or make a reservation, as the place fills up quickly. Now on to the food. Appetizers: We ordered the Mussels Africana, Â which were really nicely flavored. It was a little spicy (as a word of caution, they don't indicate on the menu whether certain dishes are spicy, so you will have to find out for yourself). At the end, quite delicious. Entrees: I ordered the stuffed filet, which was basically a flounder stuffed with crabmeat on top of a bed of spinach and some fingerling potatoes. The fish almost melted in my mouth. I wish the dish was a little less salty though, which was the only minus. I had to drink a lot of water. My friends both got a chicken dish, which was also very tender and well-prepared. Dessert: We shared a tiramisu cake. It tasted really fresh, with a strong coffee taste. Loved it! One of the best tiramisu I've had. The place is a little pricey though, but if you are looking to go somewhere with a nice atmosphere, quick service, friendly atmosphere, and good food, this is the place to go.
