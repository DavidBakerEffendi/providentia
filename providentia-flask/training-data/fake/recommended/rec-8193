My first trip to Koch's was in 1979. I haven't been there since Bob passed. It's good to see from a recent review that the place seems to have landed on its feet. The world would be a poorer place. My favorite is hot brsket with Munchee cheese, with cooked onions. Just a bit of mustard. Milk shakes and blintzes -- perfection. Plus Vel-ray and Vernor's Ginger Ale (at least they used to carry that.)
