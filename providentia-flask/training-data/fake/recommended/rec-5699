ROAST PORK SANDWICH with provolone and spinach??  Jackpot!   The only sandwich that probably that beats it is Philip's Cheesesteak.  haha.   If you're in the Reading Terminal Market, I highly recommend going to DiNic's to get a taste of that juicy roast pork with melted provolone.. and the spinach is such a nice touch as well.
