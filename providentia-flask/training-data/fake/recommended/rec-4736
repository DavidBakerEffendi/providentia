Went for brunch on Sunday.  4.5 stars.  Buffet was 15.00.  Nice variety of sweet bread, coffee, traditional dishes, and a few unique options.  The buffet comes in phases so try to get there at 12.  Entrees were wonderful.  Huevos con carne.  Steak was awesome.  The pechuga poblana was dynamite as well.  Poblano sauce remarkable.  Service was perfect.  4 stars because it wasn't off the charts - but it is authentic and prices are reasonable.  Bloody Mary was meh....  We will be back.  It's better than good - close to great.
