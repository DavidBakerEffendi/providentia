When I crave Mexican food this is where I go. The food is sophisticated without being pretentious. It's a more affordable and better executed version of Dos Caminos and Rosa Mexicano. I'm a big fan of the enchiladas here, especially the mole ones, which pack in a bold punch, as well as the tortilla soup, simple and comforting. Props for the margaritas (especially the pineapple chipotle one, as I love spicy/sweet combinations). The portions are very generous (enchiladas were about $19 and they were big) and they come with complementary rice and refried beans. Tips: Check in with Yelp. I received a free desert (tres leches!. Not three leeches, as autocorrect suggested). Sign up for AAdvantage Dining Miles or Skymiles Dining (one or the other, you can't do both). This place is included, meaning you get airlines for dining out. Win!
