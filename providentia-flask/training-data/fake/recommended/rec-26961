THis place got 3 stars right off the bat because the bar tender Bry, or Bright or mister salt and pepper totally took care of me. He saw me enter the bar, was very attentive(sp), and gave me a menu right away and was all smiles. He seemed impressed when I asked for the whiskey menu, seemed even more impressed with my oban selection, and they treated me to a great whiskey that I was given because they were out of oban (I kindly asked for the rest room and slipped a 20 under the glass, I am never one to get free drinks without tipping). The sly winks also helped out but it seems like he does it to everyone. Great bar side maner. Great decor, and, oh yeah, great food! I had kangaroo as a started. It was fantasmagorical, a little mountain of kangaroo atop a falafel. My friends ordered the scallops (mouth orgy), and a simple salad with a good vinnegrette(sp, screw you I can't spell). As main dishes of doom. I head the deer with some pan fried cheese like thing, and mushrooms. Friends had red snapper and lamb. All were great, and I don't eve like fish. Creepy dumb non animal. Its like a slow kid that society sees as ok to eat. eh. Dessert, well it was good, but nothing grand, We had the chocolate cake with the brittle and beer ice cream. The brittle was the best part. Â Wine was great, Bri, Bry, Bright made the ladies some great mango vanilla mojitos, a drink of great mojitos, and I am very critical of mojitos... Does anyone get that I really like this place?
