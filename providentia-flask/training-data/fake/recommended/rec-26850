Pros: Â Party of four on an extremely busy New Year's Eve with 7:45pm reservations. With our table waiting, we were seated immediately. Hostess & server could not have been more pleasant and welcoming, which was surprising considering such a stressful holiday dinner service. Appys of arugula salad and fried calamari were shared and enjoyed by all. Entrees of pan seared sea scallops, lobster risotto, hanger steak (medium well), and filet mignon (ordered butterflied & well-done) were all appropriately prepared, and served properly (read that: no "who gets" from the runner!) Bottle of wine, coffee & a shared dessert came to $60/person, incl. gratuity. Nice, cozy atmosphere. Fairly easy to locate and situated in a very trendy area. Clean, though small restrooms (you know what they say, "If they can't keep the bathrooms clean, imaging what the kitchen looks like.") Festively, jam-packed, ballooned ceiling decorated for New Year's Eve. Cons: We were not told when we made reservations, or prior to being seated, that we would need to be finished and out by 9pm for the beginning of their final NYE seating. By 9:30pm our waiter very apologetically mentioned that they really need to turn over the table. Not a big star-deduction as we were already finished with coffee & dessert and headed out. Yes, would have been nice to be made aware ahead of time, but perfectly understandable for a 2nd service on a busy New Year's Eve. Overall, a very pleasant experience. Only caution is the prices. Ordering off the regular menu (not prix fixe) can be $$+, but check the menu before visiting, and be prepared. Value for price is average......not great, but not disappointing either. Would consider returning or recommending to others.
