The spicy tuna sushi roll is huge and delicious! Not being from around here, sushi from a "fast food" place was a gamble - and one I'm glad I took! The roll was really yummy. I was a little sad to have to split it with my husband! Ha. The shrimp rice bowl was ... meh. The veggies were fine. The rice was good. The sauce was good, though I'm not a huge fan of teriyaki sauce (mostly got the rice bowl in the hopes that my two-year-old would eat some). But the shrimp were awful. I ate two and threw the rest away. Had I been eating at the restaurant, I would have complained; unfortunately we had ordered takeout. Folks were right: The sweet potato fries are a must. Mmmmm. So crunchy and sweet potato-y. If I lived here and needed a quick sushi fix, I'd be back.
