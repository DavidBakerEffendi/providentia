Love , love , love this place. ....   Great coffee.  Fresh , delicious & HEALTHY food . Friendly owner and staff ( they remember your name & coffee order when you walk in which is always nice )   Really nice back yard that has free wifi  :-) .   I get the cold brewed ice coffee with almond milk & the other day I tried the steel cut oats with fresh berries and enjoyed every bite .... I look forward to coming here often and trying a lot more on the menu.  Oooo and they have Dough donuts for those days where you want a real treat .  This place is just what the neighborhood needed
