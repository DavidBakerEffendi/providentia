I don't understand the negative reviews. I live just down the street from this place and go pretty often. The food is always delicious; the craft beers are always a good selection; and I've only once gotten less than awesome service. Their food main menu is small, but to me that means they've got it streamlined so everything is up to par. And they always have a new specials list. There isn't a single thing I've ordered that hasn't been at the very least satisfying. And their beer - it's always a great selection. I'm definitely a wheat beer fan, so it's nice to know that if I don't want anything on their rotation, they always seem to have Allagash. And honestly, there was only one time where the service wasn't as attentive as I thought it could have been. It wouldn't have really bothered me, but I was out with family, and I wanted them to think this place was as great as I think it is. They have outdoor seating, a charming indoor dining room, and prices I think are more than reasonable. I really like this place, and I wish those who didn't have a great experience might give it another shot.
