Solid beer list, but the food and service is underwhelming. I had a burger that I am 99% sure was actually a Bubba Burger which is sad. Additionally the service was mediocre at best as we waited for over 15 minutes for our beers and then had to seek out the manager when our credit card sat on the table with the bill for 20 minutes with no waitress to be found.
