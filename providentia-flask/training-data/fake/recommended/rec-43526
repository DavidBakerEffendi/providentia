I was visiting Philadelphia last week and all I wanted was some White Fish Salad from Day by Day. I was able to coerce a friend of mine to take me for lunch and it was everything I remembered and more. Although, the restaurant was out of bagels.. How does a Jewish restaurant run out of bagels especially with a store right next door? Anyway, I got my fix of White Fish Salad and it was goood!!!!
