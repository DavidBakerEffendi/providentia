I'd give them two stars but they ruined my man's b-day so one star it is! Take that, 4.5 average. Peaches Hot Mess. Okay, so the Hubs was dying for some Nashville Hot Chicken so we headed here, ordering the fried green tomatoes, regular chicken, the fried whiting, collard greens, and creamy grits. The cornbread arrived first, too sweet and tasting like the box I suspect it was shaken out of. Okay. We sip our Cokes and listen to R&B. And listen to R&B. About 12 songs in, Hubby crankily announces that we have been waiting 50 minutes for food. I somehow distract him for another 20 minutes until the food comes. The fried green tomatoes were acceptable; covered with too much bacon and sauce, yes, but fine. The creamy grits had a distinctly 'off' taste, like moldy cheese. The collard green were bland and limp. My whiting was a shockingly small portion, like three fish sticks that might be served to a cranky todder in Park Slope and while my husband's chicken was adequately sized, it sucked. There was a sour quality to the batter (excessive vinegar or buttermilk or, you know, rot) and it tasted burnt. It was so over-battered, that we removed the batter in a whole piece and it sat there accusingly, like a mad soft shell crab. The words 'pissed' and 'disappointed' come to mind, yes. The waitstaff was nice but overstretched and basically, we waited 70 minutes to spend $40 on awful food. We left in post-entree record time and the husband had to sate himself with the birthday cake I made. I know there's almost nothing to eat in Bed Stuy and trust me, the neighborhood has my condolences Â but please stop hyping this place; it's all kinds of dysfunctional.
