I loved the atmosphere in this place. I went there on a Friday night around 9:30 for a birthday get-together, and it was super chill, very mellow vibe that was reminiscent of a speakeasy. Unfortunately, as the night went on it actually became less crowded which was kind of a bummer for a Friday night. I only stayed till about 12 so maybe it picked up thereafter. But honestly, its not a late night crazy party type place so I doubt it. Maybe it was just a slow night...who knows? I was excited to try their food and drinks from reading all the great reviews. But I wanted to pase myself so I started off with a glass of wine...a $10 glass of wine might I add which was only about 4 oz when served...BULLSH*T!!! This is what really pissed me off. Yes, their glasses are wide and big so obviously they're not supposed to be filled high. I get it. But I know my ounces, and their pour was lite. I should've said something, but I didn't...because who wants to be that guy. But it's the last time I'm gonna keep my mouth shut when served a lite pour here and I encourage anyone in the same situation to stand up for their right to get their $10 worth of wine because that nonsense is for the birds.
