All Pio Pio restaurants are amazing food-wise, but this is the best Pio Pio in New York because of its size and ambience. It has two floors and it's a spacious place - or at least it feels that way. All of the other Pio Pio's I've been to are very small and cramped. The food and service are always incredible here, portions are very generous, and it's all definitely worth what you're paying!
