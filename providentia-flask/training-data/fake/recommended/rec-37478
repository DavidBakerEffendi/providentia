Selamat Pagi is an incredible new addition to Greenpoint and to the New York restaurant scene more generally. As someone who grew up on Indonesian food I consider myself somewhat of an expert on the matter, and let me tell you Selamat Pagi fully delivers. The Nasi Goreng is excellent. I have been back for it twice now. I also highly recommend the steak and eggs, and the Flan is a must! All the ingredients are of the highest quality, as is to be expected of the Van Leeuwens. I am so glad the best new Indonesian restaurant opened up right here in Greenpoint!
