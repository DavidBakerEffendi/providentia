my parents live in cali, and this is the one place they go back to every time they visit. everyone knows how good the corn is, so i dont need to repeat that. other hidden gems on the menu: (1) steak taquitos (2) corn cakes with black beans and cheese (3) grilled chicken with yellow rice and beans (they only serve that next door at the takeout place) - throw on some tobasco and some worchestire sauce (which they have readily available) and you're good to go!
