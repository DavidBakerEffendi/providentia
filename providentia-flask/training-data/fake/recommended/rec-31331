Tried this place out for a date last night and really enjoyed it. Their Pho was amazing and only 9$! Also got some good cocktails and their signature appetizer - beef wrapped sugar cane sticks, which were unlike anything I had ever eaten but very delicious. The interior has a cool atmosphere, dim lighting, funky decor, and was otherwise intimate/romantic if not for the LOUD dance-pop-utlra-remix music they have blasting constantly. It totally clashes with the rest of the vibe and was annoying as hell. My only other criticism is that they brought us all of our orders at once instead of staggering the meal, so we wound up with the drinks, app and dinner all on the table within seconds of each other. Dinner felt rushed because of this and I would have liked to soak in the interesting ambiance and relaxed more. Still I'd recommend going.
