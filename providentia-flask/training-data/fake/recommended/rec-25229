Very nice place.  Server was nice and attentive. Even the chef came out to see how everyone was doing. She was probably the manager but overall the food was yummy, the restaurant was clean and those bathrooms were amazing.  I had the bisteck special ($7) and fruit punch.  I will definitely be returning
