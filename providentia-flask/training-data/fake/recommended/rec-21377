I thought it was going to be better than it was. Mediocre at best. I looked over the menu prior to visiting and had high hopes. We were there for brunch and saw lots of tasty menu items we wanted to try. It was just alright. My omelet was dry and the mac n cheese stuffed muffin was eh. Not worth another trip.
