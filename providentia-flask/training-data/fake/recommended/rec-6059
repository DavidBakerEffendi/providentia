I went here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon around 2:30PM.  It was empty, but I have heard around dinner time it gets packed.  There is a lunch special where you can get an app and an entree starting at $6.90 - my friend got the soup and some noodles (it was more than $6.90 though, maybe about $10).  When I was in Thailand/Laos, I really wanted to try the larb I saw on street carts everywhere, but didn't want to OD on my cipro RX, thus I never tried it.  So at Room Service, I decided to order the larb salad (about $8).  The salad was tasty - although WAY too heavy on the meat.   It must have been about 2 cups of ground chicken meat with a few (butter?) lettuce leaves.  The dressing was soy-sauce based, and not too heavy (I hate when salad is over powered by the dressing).  The presentation was really cool though.  I also ordered a thai iced tea (they didn't have iced coffee for some reason), but I was not too impressed.  It was served in a tall skinny glass with mostly ice.  I've had better at Sri Phra Chai in Queens (and by far my all-time favorite).  Minus one for that.  But, plus one for the really funky decor.  It was black everywhere with unique chairs, and a huge chandelier in the middle.   Good spot for dates or for a dinner with friends.  The drink menu looked extensive as well.   I would recommend this place if someone asked me for a Thai restaurant (aside from Klong) and I would probably go back to try dinner out.
