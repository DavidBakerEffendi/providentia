I will definitely go back! This place was so delicious. A friend and I got the Veggie Platter. It consisted of 6 different veggies (potatoes, lentils, green bean/carrot...); some were cold and some were hot but all were seasoned to perfection. This is a no utensil restaurant, so you eat with your hands which makes it an interesting experience! Its a must try place, for sure! I went in on a Friday night Â at 8pm without a reservation and the staff was great- they got my party of two seated within 20 minutes and it was packed! Very nice staff too!
