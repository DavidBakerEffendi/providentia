They don't use gloves while touching all over the food at the "bar kitchen" where they make the appetizers and soups. She even picked up the phone, touched dirty receipts that were balled up in the trash bin, and touched a dirty rag then kept making the food. I don't know about you but I'm very sanitary and I don't like bare hands touching my food. Bleh!
