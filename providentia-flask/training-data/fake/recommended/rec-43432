This place is awesome.  It's small, there's a bit of a wait for lunch, but it is good.  It's actually connected to Smorgas Cafe (Swedish Restaurant in Stone St.) The chef recommended the ribs, he said it was the best, and it was.  Of course at the end I needed to have the crepes with raspberry and ice cream.  And it was how I imagined it to be. Perfect!   I have yet to try the chicken and the fish.
