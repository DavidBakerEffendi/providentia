Was in town for NYC for a night and stayed at the Yotel. This place is a block away and was delish! Order appetizers- the pepper thing (don't remember the exact name) is the best thing on the menu. Empanadas are delicious too. Dinner- Order the roasted chicken. It's a lot of food. Order a few things and share with the table. And the sangria is great! It does sneak up on you though :)
