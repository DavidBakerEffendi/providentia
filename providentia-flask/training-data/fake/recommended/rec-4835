My sister (Brit K.) and I took my Dad to Tequilas as a birthday dinner. I have to say that I really enjoyed the authenticity of the dishes, the interesting/entertaining staff that did amazing "culinary-acrobatics", and the beautiful interior of the place itself. They need to get a better sign, as I went out to get my wallet and when I walked back I went right by it and walked for about a 1/4 of a block! Their low key advertising and my Columbus-like navigational skills aside, there were a few low points to the meal. First, the dining area we were sat in was very loud and squished right against the bar. I didn't realize it until later, but there was a giant and beautiful(ly quiet) back room that would have been perfect for a family of four out for dinner. Some might enjoy a more lively ambiance, but it's not really my thing when I'm just eating dinner. I don't really drink too much, so I can't comment on the tequila selection. On the other hand, the guys sitting across from us seemed to be enjoying their bottle(s!) too much. The whole meal they stared at the female members of our party until my Dad and I switched seats with them and stared back at them until they quit. I didn't like that frat-boy vibe... but I don't know if it's common there or we just got unlucky. Overall, I would say to check Tequilas out! Make sure you ask to sit in the back if you want a quieter dinner and allow the knowledgeable (they seem like they really care about what they are doing and want you to enjoy yourself) though sometimes hard to understand waiters to help you select something. Best bet: Carne Asada a la Tampiquena. "Our chef selects a thin slice from lean steak.  This in turn is seasoned and grilled.  Includes a tamal, guacamole, rice, refried beans and chicken tquito." - From their site.
