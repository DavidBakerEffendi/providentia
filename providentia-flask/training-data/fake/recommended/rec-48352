Talk about fellow yelpers coming through on this one. Was down on 7th for a work event and needed yelp's help to find a lunch spot. Found Cafe Steinhof and gave it a shot on a whim. Turned out to be an excellent decision. Described by some as a German place, it actually proclaims itself as Austrian. The inside is is decorated as such. Most people have covered the big points but here are a few additions based on our meal. -Tried the Austrain Goulash which was amazing. Really hearty with lots of meat and potatoes, probably not best around lunch time since I felt like I needed a nap afterward -Prices are very reasonable -The tomato soup is a must try if you are a fan of tomato soups -The beer menu had a large selection of European brews ive never had the chance to try and wish I had more time to experience a few others One small downside is that we went around lunch and there was only one server on. The place was pretty busy and the guy did a great job but inevitably everything moved at a slightly slower pace. Not a deal breaker at all though. Â  Those are the quick hits. Final thought is that if you are cruising around this area I highly suggest giving this place a try. I hear they are also great for take out.
