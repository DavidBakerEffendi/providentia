Unfortunately did not get full experience, which seems very pleasant, since I only had delivery for lunch -- but the rolls were delicious, fresh, and there are plenty of options. I wish I had their updated menu when I ordered because it seems they have added to their selection. Next time around I plan to order something other than sushi since their fusion options of Thai and Indian cuisine seem very appetizing.
