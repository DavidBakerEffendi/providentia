Have been here two times recently for dinner.  The place is dingy and provides the same atmosphere as a college diner (complete with plastic seating).  The food is moderately priced but almost everything is drowned in oil making for an uncomfortable meal.  Some things are better than others such as the calamari appetizer as well as the peanut chicken but most everything on the menu is pedestrian including anything they make with lamb, the middle eastern dishes and the pastas.  I hope that I am not dragged back here.
