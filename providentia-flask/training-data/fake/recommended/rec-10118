Cute lil local burger joint that is BYOB! If you forgot your beer, there is a deli across the street a few doors down :] I got the truffle burger w/gargonzola & spicy fries. I saw from other yelpers that the "spicy fries" came in criss-cut form, however when my fries came out, they were just regular fries, no criss cut :[ The burger was alright. I wouldnt say it was amazing, but it was good. The patty was thick, the buns were brioche. They cooked it medium rare per my request. The lil asian lady, I think was maybe an owner or something, she was super nice and very attentive.
