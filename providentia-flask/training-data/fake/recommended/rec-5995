By way of San Francisco, my husband and I moved to Manhattan over a year ago, and I have tried many New American style restaurants in the City. Not only have we eaten at some established restaurants in California such as Boulevard, Postrio, and Chez Panisse, but Gramercy felt like home from the moment we stepped inside. The rustic decor and well-lit bar and dining area are very elegant but without being overdone. The price fixed menu is totally worth it, and won't disappoint even a finicky eater. We have eaten in the dining area just once, so I don't recall everything on the menu. It's fun New American, and flavorful WITHOUT being over the top. Service is efficient and down to earth... our waiter, Colin, was helpful and recommended a terrific bottle of wine. Added bonus: the tapioca dessert/pudding... if it's on the menu, definitely order it for a special treat!
