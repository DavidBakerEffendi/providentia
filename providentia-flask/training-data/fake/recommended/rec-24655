The same people who own Maharlika also own Jeepney. Unlike Maharalika, Jeepney looks a lot more casual, and definitely more Filipino looking (if that's a thing.) I wouldn't bring little kids/parents here because the walls are filled with naked Filipino women. There was a long wait when I came (over 20 minutes) because seating is really limited. They can probably seat about 20 people at once so make sure to get reservations or go when it's not a busy time. The menu is pretty limited but everything seems really good. If it's your first time try the pancit malabok negra.
