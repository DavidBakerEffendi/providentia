Jimmy's Diner is where I go after yoga. It's where you should go on a snowy day. It's where you should go for a late breakfast to recap the fun night you had out. It's where you go to have an inexpensive breakfast with your boo. It's where you go to have a mimosa. This is not where you go to eat healthy.  It's comfort food and it is good.  They sometimes give you whip-cream on top of your Irish coffee and sometimes they don't.  They deliver--if you live somewhat close by and they are never pretentious or weird. A lovely little place to eat and be happy.
