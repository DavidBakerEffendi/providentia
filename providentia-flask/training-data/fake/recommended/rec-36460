Never going to forget this Dean and Deluca-esque food establishment, which upon walking in, garners this sense of "Small & Successful Store." However, upon venturing further into the store, I'm immediately surrounded by a variety of succulent foods, some imported from Italy and most made in the store itself. The store hosts a number of Italian restaurants and is constituted of dining rooms surrounded by bothersome, but inescapable noise. The wait staff was friendly, however, and even though I did not eat there, I would predict that their food would be absolutely dulcet and pleasurable as the tables were full and the customers looked rather satisfied. The crowds, especially on weekends, are quite bothersome, but hey - it's NYC so to put it simply, expect the masses to cover you as you try to find the optimal restaurant to eat at. Waiting times are long, but as aforementioned, the menu hosts a good amount of delicious goods. Also, I would highly recommend the gelato and cafe italiano area of the establishment. I tried their gelatos of a 12-flavor a la carte selection and it is undeniably the best sweet mound of sugar you will find in the Flatiron district. Pair that up with some authentic Italian coffee and you will be satisfied. Just try to snag a table ASAP =)
