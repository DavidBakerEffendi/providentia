I am an ardent fan of Chop Chop Grub Shop. The food is divine and the atmosphere is welcoming. It is a real pleasure to get such interesting and quality food on Nostrand Avenue. The real treats are the sandwiches, which are large and filled with generous portions of meat, fish and vegetables, and you get both a salad AND fries, served on a china plate with real silverware. The other nice things is that the restaurant is frequented by people from the neighborhood, both new residents and longtime residents.
