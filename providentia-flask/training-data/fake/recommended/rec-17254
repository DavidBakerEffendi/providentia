Great food. Great service. Greg was a fantastic. Ordered the jumbo shrimp and sooo good. Definitely coming back anytime I'm in Montclair. I really can't understand the negative reviews. I know the wait is long, but the food and service make up for it. And you have to love the BYOB... So much food for a mediocre bill. It's worth checking out.
