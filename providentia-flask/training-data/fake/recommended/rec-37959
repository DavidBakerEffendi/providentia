A group of South Windsor friends met for dinner at Villa Pizza. It was an impromptu get-together at this Pizza/Lebanese restaurant.  Actually, you'd never know they serve Lebanese food there by looking at the place.  It looks like your standard takeout Pizza place.  But I have never been so surprised by a restaurant for its food and the welcoming nature of the owner (Ali).  We had 8 people with us and sat under a tent on Rt. 5 between a package store and an Indian restaurant.  On this rainy summer Monday night we had one of the best meals.  I'm not sure what some of the dishes were so I included pictures of the feast.  When you get by the look of the restaurant and the plastic dinner wear (but nice real plates), you will be treated to one of the better meals.  He said they do a good lunch business.  I wish the seating inside the restaurant was better.  I hope someday Ali (or Ollie) the owner can expand.  This is a hidden South Windsor flavor gem.  Villa Pizza for Lebanese food.  Who would know?
