I have to say, after seeing this place on DDD, I had pretty high expectations.... And they were certainly met. I was kinda disappointed that they didn't have any of the stuff featured on the show still on the menu, but I know how a good restaurant usually likes to change things up. I had the ribs, which had a great sauce, and were cooked just right. My chick had a free range chicken dish that was also really well made. Presentation was great, especially for a diner. The staff was friendly, even if seeing that many hipsters in one place made me feel old and fat. :) I'd give it 3 1/2 stars normally, but since that's not an option, I'll round up. Definitely worth checking this place out.
