For those of you who visit Taqueria Diana and are elated because you believe you have found 'authentic Mexican food'... You obviously have not had too much authentic Mexican food (more specifically, tacos).  Disclosure: Being a native Californian does not mean you are inherently blessed with a God-given talent for taco-making.  I've definitely had better tacos in my hometown in Orange County, California - I've even had better tacos here in New York City.  The chicken was bland and relatively flavorless (apparently being prepared rotisserie-style automatically makes it good), and the guacamole did not resemble the taste of fresh avocados; rather, it tasted mostly of lime and salt.  The tortillas, while house-made, were soggy and a little chewy/gummy in texture.  The carne asada was grayish and rubbery-looking, and the carnitas had only a slight taste of grease working in their favor.  The pastor was dry and lacked any discernible seasoning.  Overall, each meat lacked a unique and flavorful taste distinguishing it from another, and it was difficult to determine which was the most tolerable.  I do appreciate their effort, though, and they will probably enjoy success as a result of the utter lack of Mexican food/taquerias in New York City, and because many simply do not know the difference between good and mediocre Mexican food.
