I've come here twice, once on a date and once with a friend. I recommend getting a reservation because I haven't been able to swing a wait less than two hours on the weekend. The wait is manageable during the week and there are good places to go nearby to grab a drink like Little Branch. The dishes here are pretty simple, straightforward and highlighted by a few primary flavors. On the appetizer side, I have tried the onion soup and sliders. Both were comfortable and easy, straight down the fairway but not standouts. I have tried three entrees, one of which, the halibut, I have had to get twice. The halibut has a great crisp exterior and rich flavor that combines well with the chive mashed potatoes and lemon creme fraiche which serves as a nice gravy substitute. Most recently I tried a special, red snapper with lobster risotto. My expectations were high having had the halibut and I was not disappointed. The snapper was well cooked and was complemented by the risotto. Lastly, don't let the crispy chicken scare you away, the outside is mildly crunchy and salty but the inside is still very tender and juicy, plus I pretty much like anything that comes with Brussels sprouts. In addition to the food, the service was friendly and ambiance is great. It is cozy but not cramped with a comfortable mildly-rustic feel.
