This place is amazing. Smallish but tastefully decorated. Great coffee served in mugs (not those tiny diner-style coffee cups) and to my delight, soymilk available. There's an entire vegan menu which was a totally incredible surprise, especially in this area. I had a tofu scrambler, which was served to me with delicious rosemary potatoes, black beans, and whole grain toast with vegan margarine. They thought of everything to make a perfect meatless meal and everything was impeccable. My mother is an omnivore, but health conscious, and she had an eggwhite and turkey sausage sandwich on some sort of yummy looking brioche roll. She said it was wonderful. Every veggie was fresh tasting and wonderful (and they used heirloom tomatoes as opposed to cheapo garden variety, A+), potatoes were crisp and non-greasy, beans were nicely spicy! Wonderful vegan fare, even my mother thought it was amazing. It's a delight to find a vegan restaurant in my own backyard, where I wasn't expecting one. The owner was completely charming and took the time to explain how the business started, and new recipes they were launching. I want to come here every Saturday for breakfast...and probably will. They've started serving dinner on weekends, too! Please, veggie, meat-lover, everyone - go give this place a try!
