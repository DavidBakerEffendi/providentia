went here for restaurant week summer '08 - and it was pretty good! the space is big and ceilings are high - it's trendy, and just loud enough to be fun, yet not annoying. we ordered 2 appetizers and 1 entree each - and the appetizers are meant to be shared tapas-style. the hummus and babagounoush were just ok.  babagonoush was def better than the hummus. the falafel was decent - the feta salad was good, calamari was my favorite.  thyme salad was fine. the pitas were warm - but i've had better..not gonna lie. i ordered the black cod as my main entree which was really really delicious.  it was cooked perfectly - and was just the right amount of flaky. for dessert i got their lebanese dessert which was some sort of pudding with bananas and simple syrup - it was ok..not really that great.  the coconut sorbet tasted refreshing and the chocolate candy bar definitely was chocolately and good. i also got a passion fruit drink which was really sweet and good - and definitely stronger than it tasted!   the labne they bring out initially really wasn't that great in my opinion, but maybe i'm just not a fan of labne. service was EXCELLENT! to be honest...i probably won't go here again - b/c there are better places to get middle eastern/lebanese-style food. barbounia is my #1 choice, sorry ilili though i do like their name haha
