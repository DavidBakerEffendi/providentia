Huge disappointment and absolute waste of time. My mom and I brought a friend here at the word of my mom's coworkers, who almost unanimously called it their "favorite new spot in the West Village".  After waiting 45 minutes to an hour for our table, our expectations were high.  The place had to be packed and all the people in front of us had to be taking their time for a reason, right?  Ha. It's too small a space for how much they pack into it (which makes it beyond loud enough, too), and it's waaayy overpriced for what you get.  $24 for two small pieces of chicken with hazelnuts, raisins, capers, and yogurt does not at all seem justified to me.  It was good, but nothing, as some reviewers have said, to write home about by any means. On another note, our experience with the waitress was inexcusable.  She was attentive *enough* until we had our main course.  No problems up until then, but at that point, we were isolated and completely on our own for a good 30-45 minutes as she shot the breeze with a table of people I'm guessing she hadn't seen for at least 3-5 years.  My mom and I walked out (which went completely under the waitress's radar) and our friend, who kindly offered to pay, had to literally stand in front of her and ask for the check for her to do her job.  I don't think the amount of time we had been waiting had even registered with her, and she certainly didn't apologize for it. Ultimately, the waiter sort of provides the experience at a restaurant in my mind, and by that logic, we will under no circumstances be returning to Joseph Leonard.
