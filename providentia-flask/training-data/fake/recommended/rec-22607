Sandwiches are delicious, as is the coffee. It's wonderful to have this much-needed addition to the neighborhood. I'd say my biggest gripe is the baked goods:  I'd like more variety and better selections.  The muffins are sort of generic yogurt muffins you could get anywhere.  If your coffee is Stumptown and your sandwiches are artisanal, why not bake your own muffins or get them from some great place like Blue Sky Bakery?  It doesn't make sense.  And how bout some chocolate chip cookies?   Okay, I'd also like wifi! But now I'm done complaining!  Welcome, Brooklyn Commune.  I wish you much success.  I don't think other reviewers are fair to complain about there being kids there...maybe they should spend more time in their neighborhood where there are many kids.  And they just opened, so I give them a little more time to work out service kinks on busy days.
