Absolutely loved this place! I had seen some other Italian places on Yelp, and had a hard time deciding on which restaurant to eat at in Little Italy. I scoured many reviews, but I got the best overall feel from this place. It's been in business for a very long time, and had a great neighborhood reputation. When we got there, we heard several patrons speaking in Italian, and took that to be a very good sign. The service was a little slow, but I felt like it was intentional bc it wasn't busy. I got the feeling that they wanted you to enjoy everything at a leisurely pace. Our server's name was Marco, and he was great! He made wonderful recommendations for our food, and always made sure we had a drink in front of us. For our appetizer, we had the Caprese. It was delicious! I loved that they used large slices of tomatoes, and the mozarella was really tasty. The peppers they had on the side, added a really nice kick to it. For dinner I had the gnocchi w/vodka sauce, and my husband had their spaghetti. Let me just say that they had the best vodka sauce I have ever had! I am by no mean an Italian restaurant connoisseur, but I have had my fair share. This was definitely homemade and absolutely delicious! My husband's spaghetti was also very yummy. It had a great sauce and the pasta itself was perfect. I wish we would have had room for dessert, but we were stuffed and still had a very long day ahead of us. Next time we will definitely save room, bc I'm sure their desserts are as amazing as their food. I am very much looking forward to coming here again in the, hopefully very near, future!
