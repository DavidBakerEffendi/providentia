Went to see a band here last week...and a group of us went to Happy hour/dinner: We heard they got a new chef! So I noticed that the wings are so much better and bigger/meatier- Huge plus since I love wings Then about and hour later we got dinner: My friends got: Burgers, Mac and cheese, pulled pork, and I got Â Mahi Mahi (it is supposed to be a wrap, but I just got it on a bed of lettuce! Everything was great. I am excited since this neighborhood bar is in my brother's backyard...we will be back much more now!
