Great food and excellent service. My husband and I renewed out vows here July 2013! Amazing staff. They are accommodating , caring , and attentive. The food is wonderful. It is flavorful, and very tasty. My friends and family loved the Landscaping, the restaurant's vibe, and the calming scenery. So worth your money!!!!! We have also had dinner in the dinning room multiple times.... And have had nothing but great service and outstanding food!!!!!
