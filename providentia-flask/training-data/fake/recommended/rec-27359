This place is busy enough to make it rough getting a seat on a weekday. I can't confirm why, but the following are my suspicions: Â  *Bunches of beers on tap *Friendly, easy-breezy waitress *Above average bar food (I had this garlic broccoli side special... I don't know what what they did with it but it was delish / the mussels were okay, too) I wish they had more seats and accepted credit cards... but maybe this is just their way of having one issue fix the other. ;-)
