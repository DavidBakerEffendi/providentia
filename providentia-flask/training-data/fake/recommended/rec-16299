Every night we walk by Vite and we see how packed it is. We finally decided to try it out. It did not disappoint! We had the pork sausages and mozzarella appetizers, and the lamb ragu with pasta. All the dishes were delicious, but the lamb ragu stole the show. Not only was the sauce rich and flavorful, but the lamb was so tender that it melted in our mouths. Also, you could tell that the pasta was made in house and not from a box. I took advantage of their happy hour drink special, which were mojitos, and I was so glad I did because they were amazing.
