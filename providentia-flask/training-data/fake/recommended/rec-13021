What a great place to have dinner with friends! On a Saturday night, we were able to get a table for 7 at 7PM. Even during this time, there wasn't a long wait for anyone who walked in and they were able to seat my party without everyone being there. We started out with fried calamari, moules africana & ahi tuna tartar. The moules & tartar were awesome! Moules or muscles was made with lots of spice and the soup was delicious with the bread! The tartar was fresh and sweet. Best I had in a while! I ordered the kasbah lamb shank with merquez, which is basically a lamb leg with a sausage. Both were excellent! Not gamy and very very tender. The sauce is delicious! I had a piece of the lamb rib (dibi haoussa) and that was very tender as well! & FYI if you check in & order 2 entrees, you get a free dessert!
