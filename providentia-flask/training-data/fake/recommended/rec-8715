What the hell is wrong with Princeton? It's where large wallets and reasonable expectations come to die. Long a lament of the locals, Princeton, in spite of its' fame, wealth and (assumedly) discerning palates, has never celebrated an "oh my God" restaurant. One would think that P'town would feature a bevy of great restaurants - - not so. The mediocrty is baffling, and apparently The Witherspoon Grille got the memo that location and price alone dictates a restaurants' worth. Rather than navel gaze the details, let me say that every steak I've had there tastes like it was pulled out of a Shop-rite cellophane package and cooked with medium heat. They claim USDA Prime cuts - one would have to seach far and wide to find worse tasting (and cooked) Prime steaks. The apps and sides are uninspired, lacking even a moducim of value (or memorability). The most recent visit had us having to open our own wine (it ain't a BYO) and, the Oyster dish that we ordered was dropped onto the table with no explanation as to which was what. Simply, a restaurant charging what they're going for here should train their people better with an understanding that. just because they're in the heart of Princeton they don't need to get one over on their clientelle, which is a Princeton tradition. The second star is for the location and decor alone.
