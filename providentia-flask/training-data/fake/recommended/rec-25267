Nice vibe and nice waiters and waitresses.  Food isn't ridiculously overpriced at $10-$15 for pasta but their other entrees can go a little bit higher like their lamb which is somewhere in the high $20's.  But my god two orders of pasta took at least 25 minutes to cook.  At least when it came it was properly cooked, although still very meh taste-wise.  Quantity is mediocre as well and my stomach was growling again later in the night.  Wine was luke warm too, which was unfortunate.
