Unremarkable food paired with inexperienced service. We were waited on by a combination of a woman who was probably the owner, and a younger waitress. The owner figure was trying to be hospitable, really trying her best, but forgot to bring us silverware. We theorized that she was an owner who had never worked in food service, but wanted to play restaurant. The younger waitress picked up the silverware slack, but looked at me like I was crazy when I asked for sriratcha ketchup, even though it's listed on the menus as a side with a burger. We had two Benedict's that came with under seasoned home fries. My Benedict was a combination of too salty, and had an awkward hard to place odd not quite butter taste in the hollandaise (margarine maybe?). The decor is modern, pleasant, and clean, but also had a lightbulb out in a line of blue lamps over the bar that are the centerpiece of the decor. The meal landed at under $20 per person.
