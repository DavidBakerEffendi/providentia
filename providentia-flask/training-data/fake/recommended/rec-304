This place just needs to be recognized and appreciated for all it has to offer. My bf introduced me to this place abt a yr ago when he took me here for my bday dinner. For some reason we never returned but this past sat we were having a serious sushi craving. We rediscovered this place and just enjoyed our entire dinner experience. The place itself is tiny and I could see it getting crowded very fast but during both of my visits I did not encountered such issue. First of all, the sushi rolls are delicious, fresh, and addicting. On top of that each roll is only $3. With a lengthly hh during the wkends noon-7 and 3:30-7 during the week. I think that it is just amazing to be able to indulge in fresh, yummy sushi for that price! No fear of getting food poisoning. Also, $10 pitcher of beer! Why, yes thank you don't mind if we do take advantage of all these deals. Finally, I just have to add that they have a curtain covering the door in order to prevent the wind from entering every time the door opens. Why am I letting you know this? Keep in mind, the place is fairly small and to consistently have cold air rush in every time the door opens can be so frustrating. I just felt that it was essential for me to let you know that they have their entire business under control. Go check it out!!
