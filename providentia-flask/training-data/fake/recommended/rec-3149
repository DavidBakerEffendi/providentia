Like we say in Spanish: "bueno, bonito, barato" (good, pretty, affordable). I was looking for yet another vegetarian/pescitarian dinner. Gobo (across the street) was closing so my sister and I decided to try this Turkish restaurant. We came without expectations and we were pleasantly surprised! I tried the hummus and the greek salad, I know, nothing really out there, but I was delighted to eat nice salad with super fresh veggies. I guess it's true that you can tell the difference when you have quality food. The hummus was good, and the portion with the bread was generous. It was a very satisfying meal! My sister had the soup of the day, chickpeas soup. This was amazing!!! Have it if you see it available. She also had the crabcakes, good, but not amazing. For drinks: I had Turkish tea and my sister a really nice pinot noir. I am definitely going to come back and try more (bold) dishes!
