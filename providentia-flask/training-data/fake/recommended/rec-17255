Just moving to Bayonne, my wife and I were excited to check this place out. The reviews were awesome and we were hoping to have a similar experience. Unfortunately, the food would barely qualify as mediocre. My wife ordered beef tongue tacos and wasn't impressed by any means. However, in comparison to my burrito, it was gourmet. Burritos shouldn't be that hard, throw some steak, rice, cheese and guacamole into a wrap and that's it. I would choose Chipotle over this place each and every time. Twice the taste, half the price. If this is " real home cooked Mexican food " then I will stick with the frauds.k
