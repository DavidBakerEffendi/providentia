Great neighborhood bar!  I remember walking into this place for the first time a few years ago. Immediately the bartender (Mike) greeted us with kindness and engaged us in conversation.  I ordered the wings (the true Litmus test for a bar) and was blown away. Hands down the best wings in Phila. I've become close friends with many of the employees and people that frequent this great establishment.  To feel unwelcome, not have a good time or not like this place means you're most likely a d-bag and are hated at most places you go to.
