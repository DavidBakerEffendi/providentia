When I'm in South Philly and I want Vietnamese food, Nam Son is my go to place.  Service is quick and friendly.The price is right. The decor is only slightly garish. Parking is easy and I can get a box of Munchkins from across the street for post-dessert dessert. Anyway, the Pho here is very good, they even have a really good Cambodian Kuy Teav (listed on the menu as Hu Tieu Nam Vang).  The hoagies are fantastic - especially the Tofu Bahn Mi (for all the other part-time vegetarians out there) and the charbroiled pork and loc lac are very much worth being bad (again, for the part-time vegetarians).   The only thing that's missing is legit rice paper Cha Gio.  Nam Son, get rid of the wheat paper nonsense and you'll earn your fifth star.
