Was in NY this past weekend - a friend and I stopped here for breakfast on Friday morning. The place was packed and had about an hour and a half/two hour wait... luckily there were two spots at the bar so we were seated immediately! The place is super cute - clean, inviting, warm and cozy. We decided on the biscuit sandwich and a stack of blueberry maple butter pancakes to share. The biscuit was perfect, open faced, with eggs and bacon. The pancakes were UHHHHH-mazing. The syrup was unreal. The pancakes are a must!! Would for sure go back next time I'm in NYC. FYI - cash only!
