The service is fast paced and even though I knew what I wanted to order I felt rushed. Anyway the meat was too dried in my opinion and the bread was kinda chewy hard. I got the provolone cheese and that was not melted all the way, my idea of a cheesesteak is a sub with hot melty cheese with onions and mushroom. The bread should be warm and chewy too. This place is too hyped up, we waited in line for at least 40 mins. Next time i'm in the area, i'm going to try Pats and Tony Luke.
