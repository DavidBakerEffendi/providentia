Good egg Benedict. The biscuits were buttery and the egg yolk was nice and runny -just the way I likes it. They put a big salad on top that tasted fresh, so fresh it tasted like dirt. Please stop messing up the plates with a pile of dirt salad. The real kicker was my friends pot pie. It was basically chicken soup with a crust put on top. Pies are supposed to be pies! Stop cheating.
