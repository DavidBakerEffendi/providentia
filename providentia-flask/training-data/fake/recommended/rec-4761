After a bit of a wait for a table on a Friday morning, we were shown to our seats, and prepared ourselves to dig in. The casual, classic breakfast cafe look & feel at Penelope, reflects through to the menu of simple, no none sense breakfast selections. While not vast in choice, less is more here, with each dish fantastically executed and served to you just minutes after placing your order. The breakfast sandwich with eggs and bacon was spectacular, the eggs rich and creamy, and the bacon smoky, and crisp. My Wife, was taken to her culinary happy place, selecting the pumpkin waffle with apple butter & clearing every square inch of her plate. Simple, delicious, and highly recommended. The perfect place to start your day, with the most important meal of the day. -SZ
