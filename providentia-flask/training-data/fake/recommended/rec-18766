Like a trip to Alsace without the airfare! This little sliver of a spot in Yorkville is the real deal. And I'm speaking as someone who became addicted to tarte flamb√©e in Strasbourg, France, where I ate it every day of my vacation. These guys really know what they are doing! Nowhere else in NYC achieves the perfect balance of lardons/creme fraiche/onions/crispy crust quite as correctly as they do here. In short: Sweet service, amazing Alsatian food, casual, friendly, plus properly weird Euro-art on the walls that transports you straight to France.
