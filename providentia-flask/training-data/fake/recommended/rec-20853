Best pho in Jersey City. They use fresh noodles which makes a huge difference in the quality of the pho. They also make some mean shakes (am a fan of the avocado shake myself). Sure, it's not a fine dining experience but it's a great hole in the wall Vietnamese place if you're picky about your Vietnamese food. Miles above any other Vietnamese place in Jersey City. Totally with the trek. Spring rolls are crispy and hot. Flavors are good. Bun bo hue is decent - I can only compare to my mother-in-law's bun bo hue which is out of this world. This is also pretty decent!
