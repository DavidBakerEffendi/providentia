An NYC institution. I've had cart food from Queens to UK and Morocco and this Halal Guys ranks among the best. This much deliciousness for this price just packed on for your enjoyment? Is this possible? This must be a dream. Â  If you aren't eating here late night you're missing out. Tender, delicious, spicy, saucy, goodness.
