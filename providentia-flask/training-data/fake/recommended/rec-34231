I guess not everyone understands what Tapas are. Tapas are, and always will be, very small. The point is for you to get maximum flavor in one bite, quality not quantity. I came here yesterday around 9:30 pm with a friend after we left an event, and we were looking to eat something light so we wouldn't be super full so late at night. Since this place is right around the corner from my apartment I decided to give it a shot. All I can say is WOW. The second we walked in, the friendliest staff came to serve us, the were quick, and very polite. My friend and I ordered 4 plates to share, the yucca gnocchi, trio croquettes, tomato poppers, and the trio tar tare (OMG THE BEST!) and for dessert we had the rosemary creme brule. Everything was so delicious and filled with flavor. The atmosphere is great, and I'm definitely becoming a regular
