Staff friendly, food underwhelming.   Maybe it's just because I had the best meal of my life in Chicago at the Girl and the Goat recently, but the food here was lacking significant flavor and seasoning.  When I pull out the salt and pepper, I consider that a problem. I want the chef not to pander to the lacking taste buds of the masses, but to what he/she knows is amazing.   1. Took reservations, was greeted by everyone.  Nice. 2. Server recommended a Cabernet for my husband - delicious.   3. Server hadn't tasted either 2 entrees I was debating (I wanted her opinion).  I think it's sad when the servers are telling me "what's popular" not what is the best, b/c they don't know. 4. Appetizer, pork belly, corn soup, salad.  Needed salt - everything needed flavor.  Expected more with the pork belly.  :( 5. I had the scallops, good but I was still lacking excitement from the other foods.  And really, is it that hard to make a grilled scallop?  The corn, crab pastry on my plate had good texture - no taste.  And it was 4 scallops, so don't expect a plateful.  Get a variety of food if you go.  We were stuffed. 6.  Hubby had the filet on the bone.  It tasted meaty and was cooked perfectly.  I'm not sure if it warranted $50... Nice staff, spent $200 with tip.  Won't be recommending.  Sorry loyalists.  The best part of the meal was the chocolate desert and sour rolls with sea salt butter.  Letdown.
