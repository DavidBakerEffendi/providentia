Note: Not as veg friendly as you'd expect!!! Otherwise, great.  Best gazpacho I've ever had in my life.  Amazing chicken also.  And decent beer selection.  And not a long wait even on a busy night. So, the veg problem--  I'd expect at a farm to table type of place, they'd at least have a couple of veg entrees and apps.  But they had like, one veg app and no veg entrees, instead they just threw a pile of veggies on a plate and called it an entree.  I dunno.  That needs work. But otherwise, yeah, awesome.
