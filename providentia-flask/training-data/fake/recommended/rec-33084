I grew up eating Cuban food cooked by mu Abuela and my mother so I have really high standards when it comes to Cuban restaurants. This place met, and exceeded those expectations! My mom said when she was growing up they used to go eat there all the time. Listen, mi Abuela does not eat at any restaurants. Ever. So the fact that she used to go here on the regular was enough to sell me. We went for my moms birthday and they really go nuts when singing to whoevers birthday it is! Would be embarrassing for somebody who doesn't like the be the center of attention but it was a lot of fun. My fianc√© and I had the picadillo and the bistec empanizado and shared. Both were delicious and the closest to my grandmothers I have ever had. I also sampled my dad's ropa vieja and my mother got the bistec rincon criollo. Both, especially the ropa vieja where amazing. Highly recommended restaurant!
