Still the best steak sandwich at a semi fast food place in Jersey.  It's a rib-eye and it's awesome.  Get some onion rings on the side and you're good to go.  Everyone says their burgers are great too. Their breakfast is good too, but I wish they would teach the Mexican gents cooking in the A.M. what corned beef hash is.... because they supposedly make their own....but my corned beef "hash" was a bunch of corned beef cut up and mixed with way too much home  fries.... served on top of home fries.  A real disappointment when there's so much potential.   Hot dogs..... TERRIBLE.  Definitely stick with Hot Grill or Ruts Hutt.... this thing was a mushy cold Oscar Meyer on a saggy bun.  Don't do it. The service is great and they seem to make that extra effort to make sure your food is packaged properly if taking to go.
