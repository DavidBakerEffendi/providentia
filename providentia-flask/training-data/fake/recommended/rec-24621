Beautiful day in the city so I decided to walk to walk across the BK Bridge and act like a tourist. Took a couple pics on our way across to BK for some Pizza by Grimaldi. Learned about this pizza shop after watching a program on Chicago and New York pizza on the Travel channel. The pizza looked amazing so I had to go to this place. (I have a couple other ones aswell to visit) We knew we had arrived at this place after we saw a long ass line. We then go on lline aswell. People kept leaving because they were tired of waiting. Very excited at this point as we were getting closer and closer to the door. People were coming out stuffed. We were waiting for a third party by the time we reached the door. They kept skipping us because they were lookin for partis of two. The person finally arrived and we made our way in. First thougt was "wow! This place is small". You look around and you see old pictures of famous people who have visited the pizza shop aswell as regular people who are fans. You also have italian music playing which makes this a very authenic place. We ordered two pies. A plane mozzarela and basil pie and a pepperoni, sausage, roasted peppers and sun dried tomatos. I must say the best pizza I ever had. The toppings were so fresh. Never had anything like it. I used a knife and fork just so that I can take my time eating each slice. Nice and hot with a great aroma. Service is great aswell. Very attentive The pizza took 30mins to come out but it was worth it. Waited an hour online for the chance to eat Grimaldi's pizza but worth every min. Just sad that now that I kow what the pizaa taste like im gonna have to wait in a long ass line to get my craving over with.
