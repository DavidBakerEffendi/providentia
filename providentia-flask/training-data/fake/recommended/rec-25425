Don't know what the rave is all about. Very disappointed in the food. The wonton noodle soup was a big letdown, broth was very greasy, noodles weren't fresh like they were cooked from instant noodles. Throw in some black pepper would have improved the bland broth. The salt pepper spicy pork chops were decent which is why this review is 2 stars instead of 1. If it was just fried pork chops, it's 4 stars, but where's the pepper? Where's the spice? You taste the chile pepper in just one spot on each chops and no black pepper at all. Huge let down but too crazy hungry to complain to them about it. We won't be coming back here again, there are far better places nearby.
