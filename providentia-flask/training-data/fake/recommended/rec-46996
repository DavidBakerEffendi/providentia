Absolutely Delicious Roast Pork Sandwiches There's a reason why the line wraps around in Reading Terminals on the weekends. Heck, I was in line on Sun at 11:30 and there were about 15 people in front of me. I usually get the Roast Pork or Brisket Sandwich along with the Broccoli Rabe. If you love cheese, get the sharp provolone which goes well with the meats. They take credit card and have a counter which to eat. However, don't expect to find a seat during busy times as it can get crazy. Definitely one of the places you should check out in Philadelphia
