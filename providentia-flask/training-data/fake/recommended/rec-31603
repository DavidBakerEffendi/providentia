This is like your run of the mill Tex Mex place. It kinda reminds me of a privately owned Chili's kind of joint but with one thing separating it from the chains: A pretty solid tap beer selection! This review is on just the beer, sitting at the bar. I have never eaten here nor at a table so I can not comment on that. As far as the service at the bar goes it was very attentive. The bartender was a pretty nice dude. He had the mets game on the tube and was very accommodating on letting me try different beers. I went with an Allagash White, which is similar to blue moon or hoegardeen. It is a Belgian white wheat beer which I find very refreshing and one of the best representative of the style, waaaaaaaay better then blue moon!!! Def worth a try if u see on tap and like that style of beer. It is also a great starter beer!!! Anyway I found that it tasted clean and fresh, meaning the taps are kept clean. My friend went with an oatmeal stout which he commented tasted good but tasted weak, no fault of the bar lol. As far as environment goes, I really liked Music playlist which was playing. Mostly late 80s and early 90s hip hop. Awesome if you are into old school hip hop and not the commercial garbage playing over the airwaves today. The crowd seemed to be a mix of grad students that live in the area that go to the various Universities in the area. All in all a decent crowd, a decent vibe at the bar, cool music and great beer. All in all a chill experience. I doubt I would come here to eat but def would come back for a beer if I am ever in the area.
