Tasty is the Apple of hand pulled noodle places in NYC. I love the rough, hole-in-the-wall feel of Lan Zhou hand pulled noodle over on E. Broadway...they make the noodles on a table right in front of you and so on. But Tasty has got several things going for it. A friendly young woman works there and sets a warm tone that matches the feel-good branding they are using. Like Apple, Tasty is easy. The menu is very clear and simple. You can chose from a list of hand-pulled noodles with different meats or a variety of other kinds of noodles with the same meats. I suspect there are other things available if you ask. I had the veggie hand-pulled noodles. There is nothing vegetarian about the light meat broth. I think I liked the noodles better than Lan Zhou hand pulled noodle on E Broadway. More and fresher veggies, and thinner, more consistent noodle sizes. The Lan Zhou hand pulled noodles on E. Broadway has a bit richer broth. Tasty also seems to make their own hot-pepper oil which was great. Every dish is between 4-7 dollars. 5 stars using a proprietary weighted noodle ranking system.
