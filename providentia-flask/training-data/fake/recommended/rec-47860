this warehousey venue successfully, if improbably, combines a microbrewery, a pool-table-equipped lounge, a brick oven pizza restaurant, and a grandly-lighted cavernous dance floor. the tuesday night weekly gay party attracts a motley boy-boy, girl-girl crew of yalies, a&f clones (the shoppers, if not the "models"), and ghetto fabulous types. the dj-spun music in the front room is a refreshing departure from the standard connecticut gay bar fare, with obscure new wave, double dutch hip-hop, and artsy rock in rotation. those wanting a more formulaic, boom-boom-boom kind of sound will find it on the aforementioned dance floor, where an adjacent bar serves impossibly cheap drinks until 11 (n.b., you'll pay full freight at the front-room bar no matter what the hour).
