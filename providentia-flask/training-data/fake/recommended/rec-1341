The quality of the food was a lovely surprise, at it is much better than I had expected.  The vegan offerings are delicious and substantial, and they use whole food substances, NOT FAKE  "meats".   The service is also en point, and their beer and cider selection is impressive, delicious and all are brewed in Philadelphia.  I love consuming locally produced food and beverages, and Johnny Brenda's manages this with most of their foods as well. I haven't been to JB's for a show yet, but I plan to when Martha Graham Cracker performs there.
