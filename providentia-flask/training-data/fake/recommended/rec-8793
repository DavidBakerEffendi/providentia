This place never fails for brunch. I can't even count how many times I've been here. Being a lover of all things pumpkin, my go-to dish is their heavenly pumpkin pancakes. The yogurt sauce it comes with is delicious, there's not even a need for syrup. When I'm in a savory mood, the Tunisian eggs or Malawach always hit the spot. The hummus is also a must for an appetizer. The best part about this place is the unbeatable prices. It truly is one of the most delicious AND affordable NYC brunch spots.
