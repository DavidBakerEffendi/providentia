Room service... What room service? No, the other room service! The place is awesome. As a first timer, I ordered Room Service signature pad thai. It was worth the try, but I shall stick to basic spicy basil noodles next time. The drinks... It's been a while since I had a drink served in a 24 oz glass. And, yes, that is a plus. Chandelier in the center of the room is impressively cool. The place is bright, but not uncomfortably. Service is attentive, maybe, a bit too attentive.
