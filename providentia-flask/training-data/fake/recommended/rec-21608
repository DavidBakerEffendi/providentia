I love this place but frequently end up deleting my own reviews out of shame over my own writing. Sigh. So, I'll keep it short and sweet. These are very tolerant (really, I'm ridiculous), all around lovely & talented folks. Excellent food and drinks, cozy, unpretentious space - just perfect. I've very recently moved to this neighborhood and have been here far too often... and consumed an obscene amount of their oyster shooters, vodka clubs and deviled eggs - a boundless sea of delicious deviled eggs. I also broke nearly two decades of meatless living on their medium rare filet and duck breast. Those dishes were that tempting to me at the time - and that delicious to sample off of other people's plates. Totally made me understand barely cooked meat where I'd been baffled before. I don't think I'll ever go full steam omnivore. It's just not for my palette, but pretty much everything I've had at EGG is fantastic regardless. If I ever change my mind again, I'm heading here - where they will bring out my vodka club, deviled eggs and oyster shooters (vodka/hot sauce/lil'baby oysters) before I can even say, "Hello".
