AMAZING!  This is just one of many words I would use to describe this fine restaurant.  This place was a last minute recommendation by a friend and it did not disappoint.  The décor and ambience was very nice.  I had called ahead for a lunch reservation and once we arrived we were promptly seated.  We started off with a round of drinks from the specialty cocktail menu.  I ordered the Fresh Meadow, which has gin, St.Germain, mint, cucumber, and ginger.  The drink was DELCIOUS!  We ordered the following appetizers:  Jalapeno Hommus, Lamb Meatballs, & Garlic/Cilantro Shrimp.  Each one of these dishes was scrumptious and perfectly flavored.  We decided to order from the price fix lunch menu which includes once side and one main entrée.  I am a huge lamb fan and was excited that Ilili had such a variety of dishes with lamb.  After going back and forth between what to order I decided on the Braised Lamb Shank sandwich.  I would not regret this choice!  The lamb was perfectly cooked and flavored.  All the components of the sandwich went perfectly together.   As a side I got the Phoenician Fries which were wonderful and creative.  Everyone else was equally satisfied with their dishes as well.  I have tried many Mediterranean restaurants and this is one of the best.  From the ambience, to service, to food this place gets 5 stars.  I will definitely recommend and visit this place again in the future!
