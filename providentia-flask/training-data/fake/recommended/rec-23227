Randomly stopped in here one night and plopped down at the sushi bar not having a clue of what was to come.  Ordered the sushi sampler thinking, "hey there should be something good on there". I was wrong, very, very wrong... Every single piece of sushi was perfect.  Absolutely fantastic.  Hands down the best salmon I have ever had.  It turns out they have some special process for preparing the salmon where it gets run through rice vinegar then marinated for a specific period of time, some other stuff too, probably magic I would guess.   I came back a week later and had a similarly awesome experience, verifying that my first experience wasn't just a fluke or just an empty stomach phenomenon.  Can't imagine going elsewhere from now on.
