Met a dear old childhood friend here for a dinner meeting the other night. Although the food, vibe and service were all good, I walked out of there hungrier than when I walked in.  Even after dropping $130.00 on the meal for two with limited booze. Yakitori just isn't my thing.  Give me sushi instead.
