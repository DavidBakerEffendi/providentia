good beers, but nothing special as they are among the most popular german varieties. food was less special. the spaetzle and red cabbage were very good though. the pretzel was not. i did not try a burger so can't comment there. cool space. i wouldn't even think of it on a weekend as i see people lining up to get in...to a bar???
