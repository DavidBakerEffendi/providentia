I eat here more than I care to admit.  Breakfast, brunch, lunch, snacks, dinner, late night - you name it.  It does get to be a little crowded and noisy, and most days you're either sitting on top of someone else or waiting for someone to squeeze by your table and knock something over on you...whatever.  Food's always been consistent when I'm there, and the servers have always been nice enough to point out which wine to avoid because it's been sitting out a little too long.  While I'm out west, it's Bouchon (Keller), but every time I'm back east, it's Balthazar.
