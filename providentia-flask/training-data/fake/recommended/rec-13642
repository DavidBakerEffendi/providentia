This is an American diner serving up American portions, so bear that in mind. That said, the quality of the food is quite good--as one reviewer said, it is what it is--a diner, but friends, diners were not all created equal. Jimmy's doesn't serve you dry burgers, overcooked bacon, or stale bread or questionable anythings in your food. In fact, their menu is fun--clearly thought went into creating it--and their execution is reliable, too. And when I go to a diner, that's what I need--yummy-sounding options to pick from, and food that does not disappoint.
