I've had this a couple times now and I'm amazed by how consistent the taste is. Get it to go or to stay -- doesn't matter. The place is extremely cool. In fact, my BF and I had a mixed up order on our tab, and the people there took it off the bill completely for the mixup! Stand up folks. Beef is a standard and you cannot go wrong with it. Flavorful, crunchy on the outside and they're not cheap with the fillings. That goes all around. They make the empanadas from either wheat or corn -- both are good. The Viagra (shrimp, scallop and crab inside) is plump, juicy and just damn delicious. The cheese steak is cheesy and juicy! The one thing they didn't have on the menu when we went was the Zapiekanka (sauteed mushroms/onions over a baguette with brie -- sounds tasty, right?), and that was because they usually get the baguettes fresh from the shop down the street and they unexpectedly closed. I can't fault them terribly for maintaining their standards. My bit of advice: don't bother with the desserts. The rice pudding too sweet for my taste. The dessert PATTIES however (same style as the rest of the empanadas) are pretty good. If drinking in restaurant, get a pitcher of sangria. Unexpectedly, the white wine sangria was good! Lastly, the prices.... CHEAP! These things are filling, so for the measly price range of $1.75 to $2.75, you can eat without breaking the wallet. Oh! I forgot... they have dailys specials too... sadly, they ran out of oxtail soup. Man, Â I haven't had that in YEARS. Maybe next time. Honestly, there's no reason why you shouldn't go here. None at all. :D
