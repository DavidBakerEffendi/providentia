I always liked Halcyon, but I'm driven to write this review based on a private 50th birthday party I hosted there last night.  It was absolutely wonderful.  The entire night went flawlessly.  Completely professionally managed from start to finish.  The bar was impressively well stocked and the service was friendly and attentive.  The passed appetizers were delicious.  The DJ played a terrific mix.  Often with events like this I wind up disappointed on some count, but not this one.  I was impressed - and so were my guests.  I would definitely host another party here.
