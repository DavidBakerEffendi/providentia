Came here to celebrate a recent grad and it happened to be her favorite restaurant! I can see why. Their mojitos and sangrias really are delicious. I had a coconut mojito and it was unlike anything I have ever had! Made my lunch before I even received my plate. I got sample a lot of dishes and everything tasted amazing! I would definitely recommend!
