I've eaten here plenty of times (back when it was S&H) -- the lunch special was too good to be true!  Huge servings of kabob along with two pilafs and a cabbage salad.  I decided to venture back there today. I ordered the chicken adana kabob lunch special with the hummus as my appetizer. Let's start with the good:  the chicken was absolutely delicious.  It's flavorful, tender, and a nice portion.   That's it.  On to the not-so-good: You no longer get two sides of different rice.  You now receive one big-ass size of plain, boring pilaf.  Awful.  Simply awful.  It's undercooked -- almost crunchy -- and the only flavors they knew how to utilize was butter and salt -- in uneven amounts.   The cabbage salad was simply too bitter to enjoy.   The hummus.  I can't express my disappointment enough.  Boring.  So bland and tasteless.  Even the pita was awful -- too doughy to enjoy. To top it off, I ordered online and went to pick it up.  I experience a 10-minute wait for the terrible food after giving ample time for it to have been prepared.  Worse yet, while I was waiting outside, the server came out and brought the food.  I was honest and told her I had not paid yet even though she thought I had.  I paid her and when I went inside, I asked for an extra pita since there was a lot of hummus and only one pita.  She brought back a pita for me but not until after the boy handling my money charged me a dollar for it.  A DOLLAR...FOR A PITA. What a waste of a dollar.  Actually, what a waste of a $11 for the entire meal. Save your money.
