The place has a trattoria feel to it and you can feel its a family owned business. The production is minimal because the food speaks for itself. Gnocchi is not my thing, but when I eat at Mr Joes, it's perfect. Â Silky and not overly heavy on the palate is a nice change from the carb bombs served around the corner. The wine is a bonus for sure.
