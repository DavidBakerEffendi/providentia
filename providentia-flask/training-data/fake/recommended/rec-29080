I stumbled across this place when I was standing in a 30-minute line for Dinic's, when someone working at Beck's asked my friends and I if we wanted a sample of gator. Not only was the gator cooked perfectly, but the sauce was to die for. Way to win over some customers! This Cajun grub is as good as it gets outside of New Orleans. The fried mac & cheese balls in creole sauce are a personal favorite! The muffalettas are huge and also delicious. Anything with gator in it is good, especially the gumbo. A personal favorite is actually the vegetarian po boy, which has fried eggplant, melty ooey-gooey cheese, and an assortment of sauteed vegetables. Another favorite is the bread pudding. It has the best cinnamon flavor and comes with raisins and sliced pear bakes into it. Given the crowds that can line up outside of this place, food comes out pretty quickly. The staff members are always super friendly, no matter how busy they are. This is definitely worth a visit if you're in Reading Terminal!!
