Walk into a cloud of chocolate around 9:40 only to be told without a reservation it would be an hour wait. The hostess told me there maybe a spot at the bar. There wasn't. I looked on open table and wow there were many slots. I booked the 10:00 slot and went up to the hostess who seated us in two minutes.   As they were still turning away customers we had our dessert and was out the door by 10:30.  Dessert was good however customer service could be better.
