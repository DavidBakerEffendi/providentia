Any place that serves steak tar tar (complete with raw egg) without killing people gets an automatic 2 stars right off the bat. Vin et Fleurs' tar tar was incredible, fresh, perfectly seasoned, and with a great presentation (quail egg still in half of its shell for you to pour on). Even if the rest of the meal was only so so, this place would have gotten 4 stars on that basis alone. But the rest of the meal was good too. We visited for brunch, and I had a tough time deciding between breakfast or lunch. Finally settled on lunch (based mostly on the above-mentioned tar tar). The menu was a nice mix of classic bistro and more modern dishes with a french twist. The Kobe beef hotdog was tasty, with extra points for originality. The staff was friendly. The wine and beer selection was okay too. Â  Don't let the douchey interior design keep you away. This place is a keeper.
