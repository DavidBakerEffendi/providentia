Great food and great atmosphere in a small place. Been here twice so far. First time I went was just on a hunch. I was pleasantly surprised by not only the delicious lemonade but the veggie omelet that I would say was better than good, though not great. What really made me come back was the friendly waitress and wonderful ambiance. I returned with my wife and ate some of her bacon, scrambled eggs and grits. Yummy. What really made me a believer, however, was their Cubano sandwich. Juicy roast pork along with some kinda spicy mayo made my tongue's day. That, along with their homemade Dominican hot sauce and side of sweet platanos, left me full and satisfied. Will come again. End of story.
