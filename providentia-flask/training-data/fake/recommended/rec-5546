Ugh. I think this place might be the only Mexican in Bloomfield, otherwise I can't imagine why it does so well. Food is decent. Not amazing, but solidly good. Prices, however, are about 25%-35% higher than they are at any other Mexican place I have ever been to. Portion sizes are also about 5%-10% smaller. The drinks are also expensive, unless you happen to be able to get one of the very limited specials. Thanks, but I'll pass.
