WORST service EVER!!! Every single time I've gone (at least 4)!!! I love dive bars with great food and want so bad to love this place but I cannot stand the rude and inattentive staff/girls!!! I have waited as little as 20 mins to order and as long as 1hour!!!!! REALLY???? I had to remind several girls that I was waiting at my table to order drinks several times!!! They went to other tables next to me but would NOT come to mine!!! Finally had to go to bar myself...then waited to order food for another 45 mins before I finally got RUDE and demanded they put my food order in...that was last time there. I'm shocked there are so many good reviews and not more mention about the horrendous service...everyone I know hates the service there!!I
