This review is for the lounge. Lame. I came here with my best friend while on vacation thanks to the recommendation of a bouncer at another lame club we spent two minutes at. Crowd looked and acted as if this was a high-school homecoming dance; fashion sense of patrons turned me off also...looked like they just woke up and threw any old thing on...men were BLECH! Best part about this place was the music. The DJ was so good I felt horrible he had to waste his talent at this trash. Majority of the men who were at the club the night I went were 5'5 and under. Bathroom looks like a waste facility and there is no soap.
