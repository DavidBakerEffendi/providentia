Um... where else would you expect a grief counselor to go when on a business trip and strolling through the night life of a new city?  Haha! I saw this sign - Eulogy Belgian Tavern - and could not resist. Inside, I continued to be grateful for this "Sign from above".  Chris, my bartender, was pleasant, helpful, friendly, and when I needed a recommendation for a decent dark ale when Guinness was not available -he did not disappoint.  Old Rasputin Imperial Stout - on tap for $6.50.  This was just how I like them - dark, strong, frothy, molasses tasting (am I talking about beer?  I forgot for a second) beer.  Chris served it in a brandy glass for me.  So interesting.   They had tons of interesting beers and wines available.  The atmosphere was relaxed, laid back, casual, and the bar adorned with dark wood.  I could see a classic Irish or Belgian repast or eulogy being done well in this place. After a few and some great conversation, I headed back to my part of the city (again on the SUBWAY... OH MY GOD how I love public transportation) to meet up with a colleague. I would definitely recommend the Eulogy Belgian Tavern.
