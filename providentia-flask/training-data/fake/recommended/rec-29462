I risked being late for my flight back home to eat a steak here, and it was worth it! I've been eating here since I was a kid.  I didn't know that they changed management; everything was still good and Carol was still behind the counter. not much has changed.  On my FB page you'll see a picture of what a real steak looks like. Real steaks, Amoroso rolls...it gets no better.Best steak in Philly which means it's the best in the U.S.
