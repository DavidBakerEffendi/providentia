Went there on a Sunday night so it was not very crowded. Ordered food to go and it took 40 minutes!! 40 minutes for 3 orders seems excessive to me especially when you aren't busy. Then to top off the long wait our order was incorrect. We let them know but they did not fix it..just apologized. The food was decent but based on that being my first visit there I wouldn't go back. The food wasn't so good that it made up for the poor service. Too bad because it's close to home.
