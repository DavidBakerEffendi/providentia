When my friend and I went into the cute little shop (adorable design), we had made it just before the rush. I got 4 macarons at $2.75 each I believe and my friend got a box of 6. We left the store as there isn't a dining/sitting area there - the line at this point was almost out the door! - and my friend later discovered that they had given her the wrong box (which was surprising because their method seems foolproof), but we didn't go back since we had already walked so far. The customer service as mentioned by other reviewers is very robotic and quite cold, which I think contradicts the store's cute set-up, and takes away from the experience. Overall, the macarons are okay. They are very airy (almost too airy if you ask me), and the filling was just alright. The raspberry macaron had something like jelly or jam inside that was nothing special. I probably wouldn't go back to LaDuree; I don't quite think their macarons are worth $2.75 each + poor customer service.
