This place knows how to mix up flavors you would have never thought to combine! We randomly came across this place this weekend and ended up coming back for seconds a few days later because I was so curious about the rest of the menu. I LOVED the teen wolf felafel wrap! - all of their wraps are made on the spot... the dough is cooked in front of you and are gourmet!  I also had the howling wrap - So good! - it was almost like a chicken shawarma  with melon and other great flavors! Surprisingly the chocolate basil milkshake was also very tasty! We also tried the carnivorous delight but after having the other two amazing ones this was not a favorite....and the I wasn't impressed with the side of beet salad. The guy serving us on Friday night was funny (in a good way) and I really wanted to jump into the swinging chairs but they were all taken ::sad face::
