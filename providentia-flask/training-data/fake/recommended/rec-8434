So I've been here a couple of times now and I think I can review it correctly. Firstly they won't seat you if you don't have your party there, which is good and bad, since I was only waiting for one person, I didn't see why they wouldn't just seat me, but whatever. The place is cute and if you can don't sit in the sets against the wall. Opt for the highboy seating or the bar because you will be in EVERYONE's conversation. I mean, really. I actually need to plan to go out with this person again because we were only a few inches away from the other people sitting next to us. It kind of seemed like they were trying to really pack people in. If they got rid of two tables it would be way more comfortable. That being said, the food is good, it's a little weird because a lot of things are a la carte when there should be an option to make a platter. I even saw a diner's platter that had so much stuff and was mad the server didn't offer that to me. Meh. I've had the enchiladas, quesadillas, churros, rice and beans and guac. The Jaimaca juice (sorrel) is good as well. In all the dishes were pretty good, not amazing (I'm from Chicago where Mexican food is king!) The service is ok. The music was waaaay too loud ( the servers kept going back and forth, turning music up and down) and once again the tables are just too close. I'd come back, just wouldn't make it my first place to go to for Mexican.
