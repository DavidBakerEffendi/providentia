Just..amazing. It is quite an experience here.  You'll never see a salad bar like this one, that is for sure. You sit there with your red or green disk indicating to keep the food coming or not and you have these servers bring over 16 (I believe) different types of meat.  You definitely won't leave hungry.   It is expensive but it is worth every dime.  It is a beautiful place in a great location.  cannot ask for better than that!
