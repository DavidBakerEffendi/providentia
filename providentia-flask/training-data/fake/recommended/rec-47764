Best thai food in New Haven. You must try the fried duck with the thai rice. This place is the most romantic little nook in New Haven. They fold the napkins into swans and they even make origami out of the paper on the straws --they look like little roses. This restaurant pays a lot of attention to detail --nothing goes unnoticed. Everything about this place is amazing --ambience, service and the food.
