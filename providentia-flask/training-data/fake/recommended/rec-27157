Delicious food! The chicken, rice, and beans were delicious and you get a lot of food for the price.  The ladies working there are really nice.  My friend who is originally from the Dominican Republic had a great time chatting with (who I think was) the owner.  Oh, and the sweet plantains were amazing!  When I go to NYC again, I'm definitely coming back.
