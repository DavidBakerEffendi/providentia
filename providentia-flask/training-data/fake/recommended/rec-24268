I had a terrible experience here just this morning. My grandparents were in town today, and I suggested we go to the Green Eggs Cafe for a late brunch.  I asked the hostess how long the wait would be for a group of five and she quoted me 20-25 minutes.  After waiting outside in the cold for about 10 minutes or so, I finally asked if there was a place to sit down.  (I had noticed that their original waiting area was now filled with dining tables).  She pointed out a side waiting room, and about 15 other cold people followed our party into the warm waiting room.  I guess the hostesses didn't feel the need to tell anyone about their new waiting area. After about 35 minutes of waiting, I went back outside to check on the status of our table.  She said that two large tables were finishing and about to get their check, she quoted another 10-15 minutes.  As I went back into the waiting area, I noticed a group of 6 waiting. Another 15 minutes pass, and I go back outside AGAIN to see whats going on.  Just as I'm asking, the table of six that came AFTER us was just getting seated.  When I inquired about the "second" table that was finishing up their meals, she said she didn't know what I was talking about, and that there was no other table. At this point, we had waited for about an hour with two elderly grandparents.  I went up once again to inquire about our table, and at this point the hostess had a major attitude.  She raised her voice and was claiming that this wasn't her fault and she couldn't help us.  We were so frustrated by this point that we left and had a wonderful brunch at Hawthorne's cafe! Overall, the two teenage hostesses were extremely rude and unhelpful.  I've worked as a hostess at a busy restaurant before, and the hosting staff is the first experience you have in a restaurant.  If you can't have a friendly attitude, it isn't the job for you. If the service inside is anything like the hosting service, I recommend that everyone walk right by this place.
