We walked in & looked for someone to greet us. We didn't experience hospitality. To add..this carried on as both of our plates  were never properly placed appropriately on the table. We weren't even given sm. plates for our bread starters. Instead our bus boy was the one who serviced us the ENTIRE time while our waitress drank a drink the majority of the time. We tipped her but please remove the tip from the slim waitress from Friday night and give it to your bus boy. He was really helpful! THANK GOD!  Food was great! We'll go back but we may just go to the bar instead to eat.
