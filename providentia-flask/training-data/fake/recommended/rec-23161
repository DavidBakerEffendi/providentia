Ate here before heading the the Halloween attraction "Field of Terror." Food was great.  We got a mix of breakfast like French toast (crunchy and plain) omelettes and I got the Gorgonzola roast beef sandwhich, which I highly recommend. Bread was delicious.   Definitely more of a gourmet type dinner.   Priced reasonably and even had some craft brews on the menu.    We all agreed we would definitely go back if in the area again.
