This is my second time trying their food. I reaffirm my opinion that it's just okay. The meat is a bit on the greasy side. And $9.50 for one cheese is not exactly cheap. There are many other places in Philadelphia I found to serve the same food, only tastier. I think this is just an example of good marketing; a combination of food network and rivalry resulting in a tourist attraction. Cash only.
