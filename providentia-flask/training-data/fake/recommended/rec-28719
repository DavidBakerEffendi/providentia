A friend and I had brunch here on Saturday around 11am. There was a wait for tables outside, but plenty of room inside to be seated immediately. It was definitely busier when we left. The good: The service was prompt and courteous. The so-so: The food was tasty, but nothing special. The not good: There are no substitutions, which is annoying - particularly for people with food allergies, like me. (The no-substitution rule did make it easier to decide what to order.) Overall, A-OK.
