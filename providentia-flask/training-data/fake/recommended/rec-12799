Great beer bar/pub in midtown. There are so many beers on tap and a little wall suggesting what to get for those who aren't familiar with craft beers. The food was good. Fries were amazing, beef sliders were pretty good. I heard the lamb sliders were delicious but I didn't get to try them. The service was good, all waitresses/bartenders were friendly and helpful. Great place to hang if you find yourself in midtown. I'll be back.
