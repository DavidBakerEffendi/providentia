I'm not a fan of this place. If you have a large group, they won't seat you unless every single person is there (even if you have 11 of the 12 people and say you'll order for that 12th person, so as not to hold anything up). Owner is rude and unhelpful. while the food is fine, there are tons of great, authentic, Mexican restaurants in Philly, with better service.
