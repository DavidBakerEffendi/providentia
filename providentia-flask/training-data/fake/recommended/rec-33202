Brought my son here on a sunday morning.   Place was packed.  Got lucky and took to seats at the window.  I got the chicken and wafles. They were amazing.  I loved it.  My son got the  huevos rancheros. He was very impressed. A nine year old. Now grant it this boy has a very eclectic taste, but says even more that he loved it.  Can't wait to go back.
