The tasting menu is by far the best dinner I have ever had. The dishes were presented as pieces of art and were delectably original. I was skeptical of an avocado mousse for dessert, but it was delicious, Â light and fresh. The entire experience had me giddy from the first bite to the last. The service is hands down the best, and I cannot wait to go back.
