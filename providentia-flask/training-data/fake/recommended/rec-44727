Came in with some girlfriends a couple weeks ago, and I loved it. They'd all been there before and are obsessed with it, and now I can see why! The tables are a little cramped, but that just reminds me even more of the trattoria my dad and I used to eat at when we lived on La Maddalena. The setting is very intimate, but also has a nice community feel to it. I had the pasta special (can't remember now what it was, since it was a while ago), and it was delicious. We left reluctantly when they were closing up for the night, but it's definitely the kind of place where we could sit and just chill for ages - very European.
