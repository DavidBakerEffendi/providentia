I'd been here before several times in my pre-Yelp days.  I didn't have any specific memories of Ichiban, so it was nice to drop in again in my Yelp era.  It's not amazing Korean food, and it's harder for me to be excited on its merely being Korean, because living in Cheshire, I have great alternative options in Hamden and East Haven.  The banchan are also uninspiring.   That being said, there is a wealth of options on the menu, my jae yuk gui tasted pretty good, enough to conjure memories of my time in the DC metro area (the pork was a wee bit tougher than I would've liked).  Several of my friends got jjigaes, and they smelled delicious-- thinking that's what I'll try next time.  I left with a good feeling about the place; strong authentic flavors... One of my friends got some sushi; one look at the disheveled California Roll confirmed my suspicions.  This is not a Japanese restaurant AT ALL; it only has sushi because in a state without a dense population of Asians, purely Korean restaurants fear they won't survive without the widely acknowledged, widely accepted, and highly profitable California Roll (and its Japanese relatives). Fear not Ichiban-- word will continue spreading about your Korean food prowess.
