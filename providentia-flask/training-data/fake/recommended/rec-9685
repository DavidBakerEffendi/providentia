The food here was ok. Peruvian food has always been a favorite. However tonight my boyfriend and I went to Pio Pio, and I was not impressed. The place itself was very nice. Waitstaff friendly as well. We both got the lomo saltado. I've had better at Patria in Rahway, New Jersey, way better. Enough said.
