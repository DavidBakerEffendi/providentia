Ended up here before a shopping trip around Montclair and I was not disappointed. I shared curry puffs with the BFF and I had pad thai while she had pad see ewe. Both were delicious. Oh! And if you come in during lunch time, they serve Tom Yum soup or salad. We both got the soup. YUM!! When we came in, we were immediately seated and our water glasses filled. The waiter took a bit of time (alot of time actually) to take our order but that was ok. I'm guessing they're more laid back on service, but it gave us time to talk. Decor was very Thai inspired but the ceilings looked terrible. Other than that, I would come back.
