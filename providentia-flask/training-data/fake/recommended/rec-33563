I really don't understand what's the hype with this place. I came here on a random weekday, like a Wednesday or Thursday night and the wait was an hour long. I was fine with the wait, wondered around St Marks and came back in an hour. There was literally no sense of customer service with the waitress quickly coming to you to get your order and never to be seen again. The ramen was slightly better than average, but not really worth the wait time or the price. The pork buns were good, but again, nothing outstanding. The whole time I felt like it was a food court rather than a restaurant due to the lack of service and at the same time it felt like they were eyeing you to leave because of everyone else waiting outside.
