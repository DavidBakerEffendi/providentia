You're screwed, a friend told me when I said it's my first Ramen experience. Ever. Nothing is going to taste as good. I must agree - the whole experience was extra-ordinary, first due to the fact I glided past the (huge huge) line since friends have been waiting inside, then - due to the bowl I got. The appetizers (squid, vegetarian buns) were fresh and good, but the classic Ramen was a true revelation - comforting, flavorful, and I HIGHLY recommend to add the soft-boiled egg, it's fantastic. The atmosphere is somewhat a Ramen shrine - darkness, yelling, fire, people gulping the soup religiously , it's all very surreal but wonderful at the same time. I don't see why 5 stars are not in order.
