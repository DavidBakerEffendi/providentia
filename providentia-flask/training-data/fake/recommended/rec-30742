Wait time - none for a party of 2 Time - 8:30pm/Monday Truffle burger - on point Manly burger - a little salty * Love how its cooked. Perfectly med-rare Truffle fries - yum if you love shoe string fries Truffle salad - amazing Fried pickles - different they arent chip sized FYI I would of rated this higher, however it just doesn't taste as good here as it did in LA.
