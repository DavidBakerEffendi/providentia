I have been going here for my egg noodle dishes since 1999. Very authentic. Unquestionably delicious. Can't beat the price. Ambient could be a bit cozier and less bright. The waitstaff are older Chinese men that's been there since the beginning. Extremely friendly and helpful. Please tip them well.
