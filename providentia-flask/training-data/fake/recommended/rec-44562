Grill 21 is my favorite Filipino restaurant!! The food is delicious. I had the tilapia for the first time and it definitely did not let me down. It was not over-fried or under-fried. It was also seasoned wonderfully. I also highly recommend to everyone going to Grill 21to try the liempo. The pieces of grilled pork in combination with the subtle sweet tasting sauce over white rice is equivalent to heaven on a plate. Oh man!! I can't wait to go back. You will never go wrong by ordering the lumpia shanghai. They were fried perfectly each time I have ordered them. The sauce compliments the rolls nicely. It does not dominate or take any flavor away from the actual rolls. Love it!! The service itself is very friendly and accommodating. On the many visits to Grill 21, the waiter greets me and kindly answers any questions I might have about a particular dish. I'm very particular as to what I eat and I appreciate so much the customer service given and the explanations of any dish that might interest me when I eat there. Although I have been there on multiple occasions, it will not stop me from continuing to keep coming back because I will never get sick of their delicious food.
