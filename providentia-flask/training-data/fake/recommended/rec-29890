Excellent place to have a light meal with friends!! Great food -- we particularly enjoyed the Turkish dumplings, goat cheese salad, and braised short ribs -- but everything was delicious and the service was very attentive. Try the flight of wine, paired with your food! Altogether, we had a lovely time here.
