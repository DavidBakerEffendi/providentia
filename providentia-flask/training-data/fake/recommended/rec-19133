U can't go wrong here.  The BBQ is delicious (sandwich or naked) and the price point is just right.  The brisket is my fave and they are totally cool about carving off the fat when I ask for it lean.  The pickled fixings are free and don't forget to load up on sides like the maple pecan sweet potatoes and pomme frites.  The place does get crowded so it's best to try to claim a seat before u line up to order food.  If it seems impossible, don't worry, the friendly staff will help seat u.   FYI- u can purchase BBQ by the lb. and each serving is about 1/3 lb.
