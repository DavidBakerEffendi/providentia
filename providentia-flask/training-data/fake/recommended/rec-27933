I really really want to like Sripraphai because I live two blocks down and everyone else seems to love it, but I just can't. Even though I do like a little spice, even the 'mild' is too much for me to handle. In fact, I don't even know if they modify 'mild' or 'medium' because my husband's 'medium' tasted the same. I couldn't enjoy my food both times because it was just too hot. The other problem I have is the food doesn't always taste super fresh and is a little too greasy. I am somewhat of a health nut and even though there is a twelve-page menu, I still have a difficult time finding something that is healthy but doesn't have fish sauce (which I cannot do). I really do love Thai, I do, I do. But maybe it's a little too authentic for me. My husband, on the other hand, loves this place and talks all our friends into going with him. I'll probably have to go again, and I hope it's not a strike three for me. But the prices can't be beat.
