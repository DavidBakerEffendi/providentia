Our 2nd time there & It was just as bad as our 1st since we purchased it through groupon,we said let's give it a 2nd chance,since we have no discount maybe the food would be better..( I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt) If you're going there expecting authentic Cuban cuisine ,Forget about It Nothing-Nada-Zilch!! You're better off going to a small mom & pop hole in a wall restaurant on Bergenline that's 100% authentic Cuban food & people.. Â to finish the night the manager over charged us for a dish we did Not order & the 1st time there same manager dispose of out itemized receipt as if he was hiding something!!!!The only Good thing there was Fabio the waiter which FYI you so don't belong there,they don't deserve you(you get a star) do NOT recommend.....
