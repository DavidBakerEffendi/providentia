How did these fools win a Food Network competition? Because they are masters of presentation, not of flavor! Several times I've purchased the cakes and pastries at Bruno's and they were STALE (had the same problem with the Hylan Blvd and Greenwich Village locations). How can a dessert chef mess up something straight forward as panna cotta? I ordered a large version of their panna cotta (at $20) and it was completely watery! What an embarrassment when I served it to my guests.
