I absolutely adore Owls!!! I come here quite frequently. Â The only downside is how early they close, I wish they stayed open a lot later for my midnight cravings! It is cash only which is a little inconvenient but oh well! Waitresses are usually pretty friendly, usually just rushing around. I'll always love it here!
