For an out of towner, this place was a no-brainer. I've been back every time I have a reason to visit Philly, and I still look forward to it every time. True, they probably cater to mostly to tourists (a lot of them too apparently, the line was ridiculous), but I guess its kind of an institution that you have to come visit. Its like coming to SF and not seeing the gays. C'mon!
