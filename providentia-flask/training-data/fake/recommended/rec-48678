I recently had dinner at UpThai and enjoyed very much the experience. The staff was very attentive. Love the decor, and atmosphere! Cozy enough to be able to have conversation with your dinner partner's. The food delicious! You will find traditional Thai fare as PadThai, curries as well tasty chef signature dishes like the salmon tamarind. I highly recommend!
