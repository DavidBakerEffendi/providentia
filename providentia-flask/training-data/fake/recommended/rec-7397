So beyond tasty! I've been wanting to go here for awhile and was not disappointed at all. Cocktails are tasty and the food is fantastic. We had the fried oyster special, the crispy red curry rice salad, the sizzling sisig (Pig head) and the short ribs. Everything was cooked to perfection! We left feeling full and extremely happy!
