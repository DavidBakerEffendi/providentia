Just thinking about that perfectly round soft and sweet bun, branded with a U, resting gently atop a crispy disk of parmesan makes me water. I ordered the original at the behest of other Yelp reviewers who assured me that if it's my first time, I'll want to start classic. The flavors of the burger - a hand-ground patty made in-house - was so amazing that I completely looked past the fact that the burger I received was extremely rare. I don't mean like medium rare, which is the standard way Umami Burger prepares all of their burgers. I mean like, MOOING in my hands, I-thought-I-might-be-eating-tuna-tartar kind of rare. No matter, it was still extremely delicious. I breathed it in within two bites. Add in thin fries (the perfect kind of fries if you ask me), cheesy tots, and a chill vibe, and you bet I'll be back. Minor gripe: Why didn't the host seat me? Yes, granted, my gf hadn't arrived yet, but there were tons of open 2 seaters available, and there was no wait. I would have been far more pleased if I could wait in the air conditioning and started with a drink in my hand. Next up on the list to try? The milkshake.
