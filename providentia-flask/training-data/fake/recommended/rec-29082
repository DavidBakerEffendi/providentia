Tashan is definitely a good restaurant to enjoy some good food. We ordered their scallop appertizer, calamari app, and butter chicken and salmon filet and three different types of Naan. We enjoyed the different Naana, scallops and butter chicken dish a lot. The calamari dish was ok, however, the salmon dish is a bit salty and nothing special about it. The waiter kept saying that there was only one place where this salmon could be caught and only one tribe was allowed to fish for it so we tried it. We were disappointed but everything else was Â good. We had asked for a pitcher of Sangria but the waiter went to ask the bartender and came back out to tell us that each glass is made with special blends of fruits and so on and was not able to accommodate our request for a pitcher so we ordered a glass each and when we got it there was no fruit in it, we were disappointed and when he asked if we wanted another glass we said no....
