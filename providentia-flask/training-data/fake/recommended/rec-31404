Thanks, Hayama! It is odd to find sushi at the carts and even odder to find actual Japanese people (speaking Japanese, even!) selling sushi in these parts. I have spent a good deal of time in Japan, and grew up in California so my expectations are quite high. As such, I've tended to the consistently tasty Ethiopian food from Lalibela when I am at the carts. Earlier this month I finally gave Hayama a shot. Cheap, tasty, and filling! There were a good number of veggie choices, and the rolls I had were all very tasty. The inari, however, Â wasn't quite as hot. But no matter, I will be a return customer!
