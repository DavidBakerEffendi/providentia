I went here for an anniversary dinner with my boyfriend, and it was really lovely. We got a seat outside, so we could look out over the water. Despite the dinky music that they play (flute covers of Eric Clapton...who chooses this stuff?!), the ambience is lovely. Make sure to stroll around on the patio towards the gazebo afterwards. And take advantage of the Kissing Bridge! ;) As for the food, my boyfriend really enjoyed his filet mignon; it was prepared "rare" correctly! I had the Signature Fra Diavolo pasta, which had a little too much sauce but was generous on the seafood. The scallops in particular were wonderful. We also had the Four Onion soup to share as an appetizer, which was fine - nothing to rave about. I would really recommend sitting outdoors - inside is louder and less romantic!
