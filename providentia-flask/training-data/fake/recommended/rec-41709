The chicken empanada with corn flour is delicious and is one of the empanadas i recommend getting if you only get one. For dessert, the belgium chocolate empanada with bananas is to die for. However, i didn't like the cuban empanada or the broccoli and cheese. The empanadas are decently priced at 3-4 dollars each and the place is pretty clean.
