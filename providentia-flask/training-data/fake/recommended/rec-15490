I finally got to try this place during restaurant week and I'll definitely be back! Come for happy hour - drinks are pretty much half price! "From Beirut with Passion" has to be my favorite...not too sweet...complex flavors...just awesome. I would suggest ordering bunch of dishes and sharing - more fun that way! Marinated octopus & calamari salad, tuna belly, mekanek, date braised beef, awaimat are some of the better dishes.
