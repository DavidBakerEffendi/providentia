Our reservation was at 10 pm. The restaurant was packed and we had to wait about 20 mins.  Giorgio brought us egg plant bruschetta while we waited and offered us desert on the house.  Which added to the fun. The pasta was well cooked and the sauce was delicious. The stuffed chicken was good too!  Cap a delicious meal off with house made tiramisu, great! This place is byob. Be prepared.
