Landmarc is my very favorite restaurant. Ever. If you want to get laid (by me that is) you will take me here. It's contemporary French bistro with some Italian influences. The wine program truly sets it apart. Large list of full and half bottles that are barely marked up in price and a knowledgeable staff. (So no paying $50 for a bottle you know costs $20.) Have them leave the list with you so you can marvel at the many options and strategize. I always have a steak (either hangar or skirt) with chimichurri sauce and fries. I say I am going to try a new entree each time but the steak always wins. Landmarc serves a variety of cuts and sauces so you can freely mix and match (hangar, strip, skirt, filet mignon, rib eye, or grilled portobello pairs with green peppercorn, shallot bordelaise, dijonnaise, chimichurri, butter maitre d'hotel, bearnaise). It's like Granimals, but with French food. I also love to share the mussels as an appetizer (with similar sauce pairing options). And then share the dessert sampler (with all 6 menu items). Anyone who knows me knows I hate to share. So not only is Landmarc wonderful, but I grow as a person when I am there. The decor is cool and modern. Upstairs they have a batcave/ VIP room that I have never sat in --- but I aspire. The bar downstairs is small, so if it's crowded you may find yourself moving around to let the staff through. Landmarc only takes reservations for groups of 6 to 10. Â So go early or prepare to wait. Luckily the wait is worth it.
