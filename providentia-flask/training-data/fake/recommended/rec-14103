I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!! I had brunch here, and not only is the food AWESOME but the price makes it even better. I had their brunch special which was $13 and included a nice selection of brunch fare and a choice of 2 beverages (coffee/tea and juice). I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict. There was enough hollondaise sauce to make a girl smile, and a nice thick slice of smoked salmon on each english muffin. My friend had the steak and eggs which was definitely a great twist on the classic steak and eggs. It came with a green sauce which was to die for, Â and the steak was juicy and tender. Just talking about my meal there is making my mouth water. Definitely a must try. I would seriously come back for brunch every weekend!!!
