Actually if i could rate this zero stars, I would. I have traveled and lived all over the world, and consider myself kind of a foodie. I have seen many an episode of Anthony Bourdain and Andy Ricker, and said hey it would be nice to have some cool Thai food in NYC which isn't the equivelant of street food in Thailand; lets give this a whirl. I could not have been more disappointed, the service was a cross between trendy self affected and hipster (odd mix huh!), and the food was over priced crap. I ordered a Thai Sausage dish and mixed veggies, and got one single sausage and a wedge of raw cabbage for $14. Then we ordered another pork dish which was so hot (I'm a massive fan of hot food and have traveled all of India), it had to be sent back. In its place we got a savory pork belly curry, there were 3 pieces, one was 90% fat, one was 60% fat and the 3rd was acceptable. When we asked our waiter if anyone actually was expected to eat the fat he responded, well some people do; oh and that dish was $18 for fat. I was amused when the waiter asked us if we wanted to pay another $3 for a portion of rice to dip in the drippings, I mean curry. All in all a truly annoying experience, we had 2 beers, 2 dishes (if you can call them that) and a sticky rice..... the cost for this wonderful feast $60. Never again! not even with Bill Gates money, oh and Anthony well he should be ashamed of himself for propping this place up.
