Went here for a friend's birthday dinner-- the food is so good! Not to mention, the root beer on tap! I got the honey chicken biscuit sandwich-- AMAZING. The honey on the fried chicken was so delicious, I even ate the rest of it for lunch the next day and it was still just as good. Just a caution: it was an hour wait when we were told 30/45 minutes. We were starving but it was worth waiting for!
