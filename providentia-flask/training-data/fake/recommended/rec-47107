Philadelphia isn't exactly known as a "sushi city," but lately the city of brotherly love has been improving on that. Yes, we've had Morimoto for a while, and yes - it's very, very good... usually. Izumi is on par with some of the better sushi I've had in New York and Los Angeles. The staff is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful, great for small or large parties - I've been here with both, and wonderful location.
