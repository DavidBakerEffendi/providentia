I'm SO pissed I didn't go out at this place! About brunch: the staff is really chill, the drinks are great, and the food is awesomeeeeee! There's also a make-your-own bloody mary bar that a ton of people were doing. Â I tried the western skillet and the french toast, a bellini and sangria (not by myself, obviously)...so good!! I definitely recommend this place for brunch, and I DEFINITELY will be going out here next time I'm around. DO IT!
