So, I feel a little bad giving Umami three stars. I guess there's just part of me that rebels against the $14 burger, unless that burger is $26 and is the Minetta Black Label Burger. So, right off the bat, I'm clearly a little biased. I think what I'm trying to say is this: if I'm paying this much for a burger, I expect it to come with sides, and maybe a white tablecloth. But most people love Umami, and I can see why. It's a Hip Scene. There's always a wait, and that's how people can tell they're going to the right NYC restaurants. Oddly enough, the crowd is a mix of tourists and locals, and I'm curious which guidebook the restaurant is featured in. I has the Truffle Especiale, which is their truffle burger with a fried egg on top. I'm usually in the "fried eggs make everything better" camp, but I don't think that the egg actually added much, so I'd just go with the Truffle Burger. The Manly Fries were definitely a manly stereotype - greasy, cheesy, and bacon-y - but alas, that glorious trifecta of flavors couldn't hide the fact that the fries were on the mushy side. Our waiter was lovely, and people around us seemed to be really enjoying their meals. I think maybe I'm just getting crochety in my old age, but I didn't fall for chic Umami.
