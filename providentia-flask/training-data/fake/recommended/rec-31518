I'm a sucker for a good hot dog and besides cart food, where else can you find them? Jake's Sandwich Board...and guess what? They're deep fried, and put on a bun with french fries, cheese wiz, and fried onions...and all of a sudden its like you're 5 years old again, with cheese dripping everywhere, and you're giddy with excitement from this delicious concoction...top it all off with a birch beer and you're good to go!
