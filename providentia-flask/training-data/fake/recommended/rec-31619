Where do I begin?  I was brought here by someone who took me to the back of the place which looks like a 50s diner with no seating.  He ordered 2 rippers and told me to go crazy.  I asked for 2 hot dots and got two fried pieces of meat in a bun.  I hate relish, but I tried it anyway.  The damn hot dogs are deep fried like french fries!  They're good, I gave it 4 instead of 5 because Gray's Papaya in NYC has the best hot dogs in the world.  I'd say right now these are second place.  The relish is homemade and pretty damn good and tangy.  The mustard is homemade too and has the kick that it should., This place has its own language like in a bad movie.  You ask for a hot dog and you get a lightly fried dog, you ask for a ripper and they are more fried to the point where the skin has cracked, cremators are pretty much burnt dogs but they are still tasty.  The fries are fresh and crispy and I ponder if they are fried together for awesomeness.  This place has an entire menu of fried foods that are prices as if it was 1950...but I just got for the dogs.  They're pretty famous too.  If you watch the Food Network you have probably heard of them cause they make the BEST OF fried foods, hot dogs or Americana places LIST every year.    They have a restaurant in the back, but let me clarify.  This is not a date place unless you're both wearing ripped jeans and singing to Springsteen aloud.  This is a place you grab a beer and pig the fuck out with your friends.
