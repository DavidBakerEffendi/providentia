I generally don't prefer Korean food, but I tag along when my friends want to go for Korean. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried the soondubu/tofu stew here. I wasn't expecting to love it as much as I did. My only issue is that this place was super busy so we waited a while to be seated. That's nothing to stop me from coming back though - I'm definitely going to beg my friends to hit this place up again if I have any cravings.
