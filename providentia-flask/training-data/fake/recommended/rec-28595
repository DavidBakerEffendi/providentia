This is a one-stop cafeteria-style restaurant with something for everyone who is health conscious--coffee, gluten-free baked goods, smoothies, juices, salads, soups, and hot prepared foods.  I like the bowls, because you can mix and match a variety of grains, vegetables, and meats.  I like to get the quinoa, root veggie mash, beef, and mushrooms with added toppings of shallots and hot sauce, but honestly all of their prepared foods look delicious.  The prices are not cheap but they are not out of reach especially considering the food is organic, non-GMO, and the meats are from free-range or grass-fed animals.  It is definitely cheaper than the Whole Foods hot and cold bars.  Also, if you get your food to stay you get a real ceramic bowl, water glass, and flatware, instead of disposable plates, cups, and forks.     Unfortunately, i have to deduct points for the ambience which is grating.  The first floor is spacious, and I don't find myself crowded or pushed around as I travel from station to station which is a plus.  Upstairs, however, while I have never had difficulty finding seating, it is rather dark and they play music which I don't find soothing or relaxing during a healthy meal.  The first time I went they were playing pounding techno music and the second time it was 80s electronica.  The lighting and the music just seem out of place in a health-food cafeteria.  Maybe they don't want people to linger for too long.  I certainly don't.
