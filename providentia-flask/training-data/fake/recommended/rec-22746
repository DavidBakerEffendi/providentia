Just an update to my review from a few years back, Goldburgers has only gotten better and better! The tacos and sliders they do for specials with pork belly and pork jowl are literally some of the absolute BEST things I have ever eaten. Keep going Goldburgers...maybe also expand and add a huge craft beer menu to truely become the best place on earth :) (I realize that this would require a new location :o\ )
