Sassafras is a bar that I've been going to for about 5 years, and am never disappointed. The staff has always been very friendly, and I can always expect a good bite and a well made cocktail no matter who is at the bar or in the kitchen. The menu leans more American than in the days that I started going, but the quality has not changed. The music has only gotten better with time, as live jazz was only on Tuesdays before. Now there are a handful of acts rotating throughout the week, and they all sound great and add to the classic early-20th century vibe. If you like a place that has a definite style, though quiet and unspoken, Sassafras is the place to go. Not long after your first trip they'll even know what you're drinking.
