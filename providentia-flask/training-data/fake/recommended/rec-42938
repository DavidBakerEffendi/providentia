Another INCREDIBLE MEAL. Truly outstanding. Seeing it was a Sunday of a long weekend we were nervous that they would not be able to accommodate us. However open table never fails. I cant' stress enough how romantic this place is. The decor really lives up to the venues name. We started with the lamb merguez (sausage) sliders. Neither one of us being overly eager about lamb, we were not expecting the best lamb experience. These nicely portioned buggers were exploding with flavor and juice, the lamb was out of this world, it came with tzatziki, feta and cucumber.  These were followed by the beet salad with goat's cheese, horseradish crème and hazelnuts.  We both agreed the horseradish creme gave it a wasabi like kick, it was delish.  I opted for the grilled scottish salmon with creamed leeks, shiitake, balsamic and crispy onions. It was outstanding. Not too heavy, but loaded on flavor. The salmon perfectly crisp on the outside, and lightly pink on the inside. We sipped on french cider as we ate and drooled and ate some more and drooled some more. I'm now hungry again... Ps: coffees here are frothy and yummy.
