My favorite cheesesteak place in all of Philly. No doubt. I drove 40 minutes there and back to just get Dalessandros. WAAY better than pats or Gino's. Outside seating is pleasant and the tight inside seating adds a nice family feel. Holds nostalgic memory of going with my brother when he had an apartment there. 10/10
