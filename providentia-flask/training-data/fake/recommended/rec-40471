Excellent empanadas, flawless fillings, perfectly fried to a delicate crisp. They could be bigger or cheaper, but they couldn't taste any better. They are perfection in a crispy shell. The ricotta and spinach was my favorite. The beef was excellent. I prefer flour empanadas, but I tried one of the corn type just to try it, and it was the best corn empanada I ever had. It's a tiny place with seating for maybe 6 to 8 at most, so best if you are prepared to take it out. Also, it can get crowded and maybe you could call in your order before you get there. Must be easier that standing around for 10 minutes. Also, the place was very clean and didn't have the 'greasy smell' that many fried food places have. I loved it. Then I went to get some lemon ice at the Corona Ice King. What a great day, :). Check it out! Here's their menu.
