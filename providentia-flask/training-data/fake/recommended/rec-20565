If you don't mind excruciatingly slow service, then I'd certainly recommend this gem.  We had to flag down the waitress/busboy so many times.  Subtract a whole star for the service.  Many reviews did point out this negative aspect. Food wise, it's one of the best Turkish/Mediterranean places I've tried.  So flavorful and nicely presented. When my wife was living in Germany for 4 years, she ate mostly Turkish food.  She can vouch for the quality of food here.
