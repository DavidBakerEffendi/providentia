I dont want to even give this place a star. Went with my bf on valentines day and when we walked in no one greeted us or seated us. So we sat ourselves and waited about 5 to 10 mins and no one came to our table. Meanwhile the table next to us was asked if they needed anything about 10 times. It wasn't even crowded and no one paid attention to us which was really weird since it was Valentines day and the place wasnt crowded. Also the family that came after us was greeted and seated with a menu in a matter of seconds. I will NEVER EVER return to this place ever again.
