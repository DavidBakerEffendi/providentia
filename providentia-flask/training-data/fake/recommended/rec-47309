Waited 30 minutes in the bitter cold yesterday for brunch and then were jam packed into a crowded table. We were convinced that there was no way the food would be good enough to justify the wait and uncomfortably close quarters, but we were oh-so-wrong. My husband got the Monte Christo sandwich with absolutely perfect thin, garlic seasoned french fries. I got the banana french toast and it was pure bliss. Will definitely come back to enjoy one of their outdoor tables in warmer weather!
