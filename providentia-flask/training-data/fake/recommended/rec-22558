My vegan BFF and I visited Wheated on a Saturday night. It's in her neighborhood and she was excited about a vegan pizza option. (Don't worry - only one of their many pizzas can be veganized! Cheeseheads, calm down!) The host was awesome; we were seated and waited on quickly. As mentioned, my BFF ordered whatever the first pizza on the menu is, sans cheese. I opted for the Bensonhurst. What amused me about their menu was, for the 15-20 pizzas offered, there were only subtle differences between them. For instance, truffle oil; add pancetta; cherry tomato vs. tomato sauce. Although it took a long while to get our pizzas - this might be in part due to the brisk carryout business they seem to be doing - it was worth the wait. The Bensonhurst had a delicious combination of regular (aged?) and fresh mozzarella. Nom. I washed it down with a beer from Blue Point, one of my favorite local breweries. Sadly, I could only finish half my pizza, but I had a delicious dinner at home two days later. All that, and reasonably priced. (Oh: and I guess the reason it's called "Wheated" is the focus on pizza and... was it bourbons behind the bar that were lit?)
