Great food and service, this place sets itself apart from the pack in Prospect Heights. I know a few locals who tagged it as their favorite place by far. Another said the wings were the best he ever had in his decades of living in NYC. Â Brunch is popular albeit crowded. The coffee and Bloody Marys keep me coming back. Sweet outdoor space in the back.
