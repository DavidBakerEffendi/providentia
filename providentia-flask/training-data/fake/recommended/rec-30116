Dark ambience at its finest, with a noise level that tells me this place is hip and buzzing. I came back here for a second time with my bf on a trip to Nyc and made sure to make a reservation here. We were seated immediately and started an intimate dinner. First off was the bread, which was a meal in itself. The standout was the salami baked bread, which our server happily refilled for us when she saw we'd devoured the first bit. Bread came with some olive oil, soft butter and some sort of salsa. I loved the duck &  Foie gras ravioli, which I ordered based on yelp reviews,  and it didn't disappoint one bit! Every last drop of that dark, flavourful sauce was slopped up - don't want to waste that! More than anything I love the vibe here. You feel like you're part of the In Crowd and there's lively conversations everywhere. Will be back!
