tried it because it was famous. it was alright, but not awesome, definitely better than Geno's across the street. if i remember right, Geno's doesn't cut up the meat enough and Pat's did, which did make a difference. had better from my own cousin who live's there. next time i'm in philly, i'll try to find a better steak spot.
