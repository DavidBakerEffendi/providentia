Ok I went with a small group of 4 & was seated immediately no complaints there. Jacqueline is a very nice woman . However, it is very, very small inside which makes it, very loud to the point i almost couldn't hear what the people in front of me were saying. Now to the food: not many selections to choose from the appetizers only mixed green salad and an antipasta platter. The pizzas are about 10 inches so your going to have to order 1 a person. It took at least an hour for the pizza to come out. We were about a bottle and a half of wine in before we were served our pizza. The pizzas were ok nothing crazy i havent had before. I will not be going back there.
