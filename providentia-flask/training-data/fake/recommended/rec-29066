I enjoyed my experience here, as other reviews stated they pack people in so the noise level is high. The food itself was good, I had the organic chicken dish and it was prepared wonderfully. Given this place is on restaurant row and full of tourists I still felt they did a good job with the food. Would I go back? Probably not, I have other Italian places I like that are less crowded and not so touristy.
