Without exaggeration, this place just might have the most uncomfortable chairs in any restaurant I've ever been to.  I imagine the only chair in existence less comfortable would be the electric chair on death row, but only after the current starts flowing and your flesh starts buzzing.  Here you are forced to eat at an incline of roughly 15 degrees, which may help with your spinal stenosis but for the rest of us it's rather off-putting. I think the crostinis and charcuteries are the highlights here, make two courses out of those and then order pastas as entrees or share a main to follow.  Do try the Lardo.  The pastas aren't as strong as those at the other gazillion restaurants by Chef White.  Definitely stay away from the Porchetta unless you want to use the fat saucer to distract someone's rottweiler while you burglarize his house.
