Amazing burger! Bacon was delicious. Wonderful specialty drinks-bloodys and spiked cider. Cute ambiance. Definitely not a place to run and quickly grab a bite being the service was slow. They take their time but the food is that much better for it. Salads are delicious but very small. This restaurant is perfectly simple.
