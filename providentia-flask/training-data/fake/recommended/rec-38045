I was pleasantly surprised by this place...yes, the FOOD is not the most creative but the restaurant certainly is. My husband and I love sushi & use to live down the street from a fish market in Chicago and devour sushi like it's nobody's business. I haven't been to a ton of sushi restaurants in the area, but I'd go back to this one! I love that the plates are color coordinated by price, and you can eat at your leisure. Easy to control how much you want to spend, while trying different kinds of sushi (this place would actually be great for someone wanting to TRY sushi!) Also, I LOVE the little service buttons they have at the table. No more trying to wave down the server for drinks or the bill. Would be curious to go for a happy hour drink sometime...we'll be back!
