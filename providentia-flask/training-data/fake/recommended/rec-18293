If you're looking to waste 10 minutes before a menu gets thrown your way and an additional 35 minutes before your food arrives, then this is the place for you! To be honest, it's quite impressive that a place that only hires one person to wait on 20 is still in business.  It could be due to the food, which was good.  However, when weighed against the lack of service and the time wasted, I think its obvious that there needs to be some management 101 here.  Oh and more employees who have the time to care about the costumers.  I was almost convinced that the lady working the bar and waiting the tables was also the person cooking our food.   Cheers.
