Food was great! Went with around 10 people (occupied 90% of the space) so we ordered a variety of stuff and everything was flavorful with just the right amount of spice. Had enough vegetarian options for my friends which were delicious for once. LOVED the Lychee Martini! Had it not been for the very cramped space I would've rated it higher. If you have a large crowd be sure to arrive well in advance.
