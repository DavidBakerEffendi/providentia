Geno's Steaks-- they're cheesesteaks are just greasy, cheesy, meaty goodness, but honestly not as good as I expected for like an "authentic original." I've had both Geno's and Pat's and I honestly prefer Geno's because I think their steak is a little better, but they're very similar. But it was still a great late night meal!
