I visit NYC's LES every other month from northern Ohio where we have no shortage of fabulous authentic Greek food nearby, but Boubouki has the best spanakopita I have ever eaten.The almond cookies are just perfect specimens and the pear cake is deceptively light. The chocolate chip cookies are fantastic as well, and I'm not even a big fan of chocolate. I won't even try to describe what makes it all taste so good--I can't because I don't have an innate genius for making a recipe prepared by millions taste like nothing you've ever tasted before, and the owner of Boubouki so clearly does. I am perfectly content to eat at Boubouki every day that I am in town. My only regret is the number of times I passed by Boubouki before finally stopping to order.
