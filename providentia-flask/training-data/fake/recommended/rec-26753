Well, DiNic's turn my blue eye black didn't they! I returned here with a co-worker who was eager to try the sandwich with me.  We both plunged for the pulled pork, mine with greens and cheese, his just with cheese.  After STARING at the steaming piles of pork and fresh cheese slices, we finally had our meals after ponying up $8-$9. After having a so-so experience with the roast pork, the pulled pork was like night and day.  The meat is more tender and with greens and cheese, they all compliment each other perfectly.  Whatever sauce they use, I could basically bathe myself in it, and it makes all the difference.  It's not too overwhelming, and accentuates the pork's own flavors.  Don't expect a heavy BBQ sauce by any means. All in all, I'm very impressed, and am happy to have given DiNic's another shot.
