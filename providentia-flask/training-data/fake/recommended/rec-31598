The decor here is great - a really nice place for breakfast/lunch. Really welcoming and just a nice place to look at- super clean too! The food is good. Some dishes are great and others are mediocre. A real gem here is the fresh squeezed juice. I ate here today for lunch and ordered the Aztec turkey burger. The fries were fantastic ! Hand cut and seasoned perfectly. Not too thin and not too thick. The burger itself was pretty good but the bun was awful. An egg bun but really dry, too dense and tasteless. If I ordered this again I would ask for it on a toasted English muffin. My friend ordered the eggs Benedict and that looked delicious. Pancakes also looked good.
