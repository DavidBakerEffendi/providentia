Gosh, I love this place!  My last visit a few days ago was specifically special.  They had one of my favorite brews Troeg's Hopback on hand pump.  Yummy!    Our waitress was super sweet.  The burger was cooked perfectly medium-rare.  All the stars were in line that day. I must admit, it was pretty dead that day - not too many customers.  But I loved it!  I had the place all to myself.  Love that they have hand pumped beer!  Its so delicious.  And I dislike ice cold beer.  The temperature of the hand pumped beer is perfecto.
