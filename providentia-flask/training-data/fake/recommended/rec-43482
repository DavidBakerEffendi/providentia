We stopped in to McCrossen's Tavern after recommendations that we received from friends. It was a cold, Sunday afternoon and the reception we received from the bartender was equally as cold. The minute we walked in, before we even said a word, the bartender barked that the kitchen was closed. I found the kitchen break surprising on a Sunday afternoon but no big deal.  We ordered an Irish coffee and the bartender hesitated a bit and said, "that's coffee, whiskey, and Bailey's, right?" No, I corrected her and said, "coffee, whiskey, and cream". She said, "Right."  A few minutes later, she came back with a coffee that had whiskey and creamer (creamer that is used for a morning coffee) all mixed together.  We said that it was not an Irish coffee. It also tasted terrible. Irish Coffee is black coffee and whiskey (and sugar) mixed together and the cream (not creamer) is layered (floating) on top. There is a clear line between the dark black coffee and the white cream.  We expected McCrossen's Tavern to be experienced in how to make a popular Irish drink. We were very disappointed with our first and only visit to McCrossen's.
