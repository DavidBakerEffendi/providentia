Ok..this is hard for me because I LOVED the food but the service was lacking in so many ways. First of all, I didn't like that its a brunch place and no refills for coffee..SAY WHAT?! Also our server was not attentive at all..we had to chase her down but when it came down to getting the check she was super quick. It felt like she just wanted us out so they could sit more people. I get that you want to make money but please treat your customers right. Food..which I loved. Eggs Benedict Blackstone. Huge portion and super delicious! I would come back here if it wasn't for the shitty service. I just refuse to give business to restaurants with shitty service. Sorry. The only reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because of the food.
