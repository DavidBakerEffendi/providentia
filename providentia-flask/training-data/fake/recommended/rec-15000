We really enjoy Lucky 13. From the outside it may look like a dive or tattoo parlor, but the inside is really cool. Neat Schmidt's of phila. Memorabilia & other old school stuff lines the shelves. Head banger music posters line the walls. Excellent Juke box. Always a good selection of craft beers on tap. The most surprising thing about this bar is the menu. The food is awesome, as good as any gastro-pub anywhere. The food selections are diverse Enough to satisfy almost any taste. They have everything from Meatloaf to really good vegan dishes. Check out the Ace Of Spades sandwich, quite possibly the best vegan sandwich in Philly. The staff is also great, Clarke who owns the place and also bartends at times is always a pleasure. My wife and I always make a point to stop in on Saturdays in the late afternoon to see Katharine who bartends Sat afternoons. She too is always a pleasure to visit. A really fun neighborhood pub.
