Fresh. Fresh. And fresh. We have the opportunity to visit Zinna's twice each year - once on the way and once returning from South FL. They never disappoint us. We're told that Zinna's has their own gardens (some on-premises) from which they harvest main ingredients and spices. Their kitchen is fresh-oriented and achieves wonderful flavors with amazingly low amounts of sodium. Stephani, our server this evening, was perfect in so many ways - and willing to serve us on their stone patio despite temps hovering around 60. The pizza was sweet and heavenly. The bruschetta crunchy, heavily garlicked with an abundance of grilled cherry tomatoes. The risotto contained subtle nutty tones and was delightfully additive-free. Zinna's is a very good thing. We wish we could dine there more often and recommend it to anyone who lives here or is just passing through. Once again, we feel that we received a very good value - and are still talking about the experience this evening.
