The food at Sophie's Cuban is probably one of my favorite eateries out there. I always get the baked chicken with yellow rice and beans. The green sauce is too die for; I can drown the chicken in that sauce. The only thing that sucks is the hours; they are closed saturday and sunday. I'm leaving for college soon and I am trying every possibility to have my stomach fulfilled by Sophie's.
