The place is beautiful,my girlfriend likes there. The food,for me not any special! The service,not bad! But they almost don't wait our appetizer finish,then the main dish came! Â This point I don't like. And also didn't pour us wine And the wine glass is not glasses! The price,be conclusion,not worth it!
