The restaurant was packed on a Friday night so I had high hopes.  The bar scene and place in general was lively, fun, loud, etc...  The appetizers were good, we had the salted cod, meatballs, and a feta with pita.  However, the entrees were not so good.  The lamb shank was actually flavorless and horrible.  The bass filet was okay.  I would try again and order something else....maybe.
