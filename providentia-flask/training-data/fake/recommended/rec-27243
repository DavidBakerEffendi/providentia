My friend and I have been on a quest to find the best Mexican food in NYC. And judging from the nopal tacos that I had here, this is not it. Also had the jalapeño-lime margarita. No balance there. Too limey and too spicy. I only enjoy that combo in my food. The set up is also very uncomfortable. I felt sandwiched-in. My friends enchilada  was ok but definitely not authentic. Other than that the host and bartender were cool.
