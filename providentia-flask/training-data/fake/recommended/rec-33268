Was the pizza good? Yes. Great? No. Very fast service, and we didn't have to wait outside too long, which was a major plus. We got two pizzas, one plain, one with mushrooms. Both pizzas were very fresh with good quality ingredients, but they had very little flavor. We had to ask for garlic and Parmesan because the sauce didn't taste seasoned and the mozzarella, although fresh, was very bland for some reason. The mushroom pizza, unfortunately, had a very soggy crust. :( I was definitely unimpressed by Grimaldis. I laude their use of fresh ingredients, but their pizzas were pretty ho-hum in the flavor department. I recommend Fascati's up on Henry Street.
