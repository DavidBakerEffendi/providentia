This is one of the places I HAVE to eat at when I'm in NYC.   1)  great steaks and frites 2) cheap and grand wine list - ask Miles to hook you up with his bottle of choice for the night.  His bar is quite the scene and great for conversation with other diners waiting to be seated. 3) even cheaper desserts.  At $3/ plate, what do you mean I can't have just 3? I often walk away as a very happy, drunken overstuffed camper.
