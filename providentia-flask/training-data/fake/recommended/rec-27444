I love the ambience (crystal chandeliers, crown molding, trendy waiters, hip music)!  This place really encapsulates the intimate, trendy "NYC" feel that many people imagine.   The food has always been consistently delicious.  There's really nothing that I've tried here that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed, and the portions are quite large! Some notable items: the chicken satay appetizer, the mojitos, the pad see ew and specialty seafood pad thai (wrapped in the egg white omlette).  All the desserts are gorgeous and taste great as well. I also dig the stylish bartenders/hosts and the waiters are always attentive and friendly. Room Service has always been a great go-to spot for a quick, inexpensive, tasty meal in a beautiful atmosphere.
