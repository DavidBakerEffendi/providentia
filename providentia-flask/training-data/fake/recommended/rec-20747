Stumbled across Cubana Social as we were wandering through Williamsburg. Loved the space. Perfect to enjoy dinner, drinks and music on a summer evening. Our table ordered the Lechon Asado, The Chiquita, The Cubano, and Ropa Vieja. The Lechon was amazing. 8-hour roasted pork, garlic citrus mojo, organic black beans and rice, plantain chips. Ridiculously tender pork with a tangy citrus flavor. Slow cooked to perfection. Just thinking about this this pork makes me so hungry. My husband is half Cuban and very familiar with classic Cuban dishes. The Ropa Vieja made him a very happy man. Well done, Cubana Social!
