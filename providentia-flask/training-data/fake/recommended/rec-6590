There is nothing I didn't love about this place. Thomas was our server and did a great job making my daughter feel at home and comfortable with an up scale dining experience. The Veal Carpaccio rocked and the warm Buffalo Mozzarella and bacon appetizer was fantastic. My daughter had the ravioli and I had the Gnocchi. We really enjoyed the experience, I would eat here anytime. We wrapped the dinner with cappuccino and sorbet. We ate there before going to a show so they helped time things so we had plenty of time to get down to the Theater District.
