Everyone relax about the spaghetti. I read so many reviews about their spaghetti dish - from reviews on the Food Network to the number of reviews online. I went the other night and it was just ok.  The dish was sort of heavy and from the number of people raving about it I thought it was going to be amazing. I have been to other restaurants that specialize in pasta and I can honestly say that it was just ok. If you want amazing pasta go to Vetri in Philly. Until you have eaten there you havent experienced pasta. I was anticipating pasta dishes like that at Scarpetta. On the other hand, their creamy polenta and braised short rib appetizers were absolutely amazing.  I cant give enough praise of those two dishes.  They were worth the visit. It was by far the best thing we ate. It was a nice restaurant, overall good food, but the reviews of the spaghetti entree are way out of touch. I definitely recommend the restaurant but dont waste your dish on getting spaghetti.
