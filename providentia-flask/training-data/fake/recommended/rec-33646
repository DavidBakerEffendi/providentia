I am conflicted and confused about this place.  They make one of the best cappuccinos i've had.  And frankly that's all I've had from this place.  As I was walking out the door, smiling to myself at how well the coffee in my hand was crafted, I then see the inspection grade of "C" posted in a very indiscreet window by the entrance.  This obviously means the health inspector found something fishy going on here in terms of cleanliness.  but what the heck, I went back the next week to try it again.  Sure enough, the cappuccino was fantastic...but i then I watched as the barista wiped the milk steamer wand with a cloth that looked like it hadn't been washed in a month.  Seriously?
