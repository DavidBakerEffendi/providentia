Was really looking forward to eating here after reading all of the reviews. The ambience was great- hip, casual, comfortable. The service was also very good. We ordered calamari and kale salad for appetizers. Calamari was rubbery (usually not a good sign!) but kale salad was unique. Ordered the short ribs and wished I ordered the chicken instead. Very fatty and taste was bland. The Italian wine, Valpolicella Classico, was fruity with a hint of plum. Very enjoyable on a warm summer night.
