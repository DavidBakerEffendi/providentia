Great beer, great grilled cheese, and great service. Relax.  No pretense here.  What you see is what you get. More of a corner bar than a bistro. Very inexpensive for NYC. All different kinds of people, which is always a big plus in my book. Supposedly, they make the best burger in the city. I don't even eat hamburgers, and I love this place.
