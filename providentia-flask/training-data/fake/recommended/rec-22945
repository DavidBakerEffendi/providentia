We live right down the street from this restaurant and happened upon it by chance.  I've been twice, and both times have been very impressed.  The ambiance is sweet - sort of like a small place you'd find in Trastevere in Rome. The Brussel Sprout and Pancetta pizza is delicious, as is the lasagna, beet salad, and the meatballs.  I plan to be back often.
