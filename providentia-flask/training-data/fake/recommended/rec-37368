I cant say enough about this little cafe in the heart of Bensonhurst, it opened a couple of month's now and my family and I are obsessed we have been there the last five saturday's and ordered delivery yesterday.. The Panini's are delicious, the bread is by far the best i have had, the desert's are yummy.. i just love this little corner cafe, I have suggested it to many friends and neighbor's and they love it... the service is a bit slow, and i wish they had some sides like fries or grilled vegy's , but it's new and they will get there, the server's are polite and friendly, I highly recommend this place.
