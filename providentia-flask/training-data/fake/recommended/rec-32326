I go there around noon with my coworkers on weekdays. We never have to wait to be seated. They bring the food literally five minutes after you order - it's so fast. The medium pho is the smallest size and it's huge - hard to finish. The broth is addictive. I feel feverish and exhausted when I put down my spoon. I fall into a lunch coma.
