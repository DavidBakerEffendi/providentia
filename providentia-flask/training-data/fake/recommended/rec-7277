One of my favorite restaurants in Paris is called Little Breizh, or Briezh Cafe. They serve buckwheat crepes and fancy hard cider. When I found that Pates et Tradiciones served savory buckwheat crepes, Little Breizh is what I had in mind and LB is what I got. We ordered the foie gras plate to start and he had the Parisienne plate while I got the Normande ($12). The Normande was rockin. Tender, moist chicken in a rich, creamy white wine sauce with mushrooms. It was heaven. The arugula side salad was fine but couldve used a little something. My boyfriend liked his just fine. The restaurant is really small but wonderful to look at. The only downside is they seem to be more accommodating of even numbered parties. We were warned that we may have to share our table with someone else but that didn't happen. Tables are limited, it would be worth asking if they take reservations but I don't think they do. No cocktails or any sort of fancy drinks, but maybe a glass of wine on their little deck would be worth it. The only downside is that the meal wasn't as filling as we're expecting because the portions were a little small. Either way, we can't wait to go back to eat the rest of the menu!
