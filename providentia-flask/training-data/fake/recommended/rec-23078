I have been going to this diner for 15 years (since I was 4 and ordered grilled cheese every time) It has changed so much but is still so delicious. Let me just say the service is always great and the food is always great. I have NEVER been disappointed. They are far more expensive than ever which is why I don't give them 5 stars. They are not the typical cheap diner. Prepare to spend as much as $23 an entree.
