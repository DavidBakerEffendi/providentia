Make a reservation or be prepared to wait for delicious true AYCE hot pot. For $22, you get to choose your own broth - they have a good selection, but it's always good to go with the regular flavor - and lots of meats and veggies. There are a few choice meats/seafoods that require an upcharge, but the selection included in the AYCE is pretty extensive - it even includes crab! They have a fun sauce selection too, so feel free to go crazy! It's a great place to go with a group of 6 or so - if you get lucky, you'll sit at one of the tables where every gets their own personal pot, so your broth and toppings aren't mixing with everyone elses. At the tables where you share one pot, they do have dividers at the pots, so you can at least make sure to keep your food separate from other people.
