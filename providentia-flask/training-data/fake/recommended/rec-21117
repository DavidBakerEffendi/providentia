My wife and I finally tried out C+M and enjoyed it very much. The service from Dan and Jason were excellent. Wines were good. The menu is a bit of a free-for-all but everything was fresh. Loved the salads and the steak frites. Sorbets were also a wonderful touch. On first glance we'd suggest sticking with the bistro - the dining room feels a bit formal.
