I have been to Plan B three times since it opened a short time ago and I am very impressed with the look of the bar and restaurant. They have spent some serious cash on the interior and it shows! The meat quality is very good, some of the best I have had, it is tender and flavorful. The service at the bar is very good, and the draught beer selection is diverse and constantly changing. The only issue that I have with Plan B is the poor location of their TVs, the screens are blocked by the light fixtures. Overall, a great place to get your meat fix!
