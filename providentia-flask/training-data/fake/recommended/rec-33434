A reasonably great dining experience has been marred by a credit card debacle - I split a recent bill 50/50 with my date only to find that I had been charged both the half AND the full amount. I called to query, and the lady said that they 'accidentally' put the full amount through on my card first and that it would be refunded [my statement still says 'processing']. In the meantime, I'm down an extra $89!! And as consolation she said "oh we must get 10 of these calls a day." So fix the system?! Stop it! There was no ill-intent behind the faulty transaction, but it's a seriously annoying slip up for anyone watching their pennies. Otherwise, it's a pleasant neighborhood spot to eat; the ambiance, sparkling bathroom, and live Spanish guitar all add a little something. It's not the most powerful punch of 'Mediterranean' flavors around, but the dishes are interesting enough to make up for that. Just watch the card swipe after you go!
