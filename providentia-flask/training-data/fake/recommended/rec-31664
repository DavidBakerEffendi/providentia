we order from this place once a week for the past couple of years.   it's THAT good.  i haven't found a comparable place in the area.  aside from the constantly great sushi, they're always friendly (to the point where they noticed my fresh haircut - one which my husband didn't!), very helpful and have brown rice as an option (score!).  love this place and the fact that it's always packed, no matter when i show up, says A LOT.  plus, BYOB.  need i say more!  definitely high on my list.
