Hmm.. I didn't actually get a shake here I went here for lunch with some coworkers and tried the shake shack burger. I got the small sized burger. The bun was soggy and their specialty sauce was sort of salty -- they said it would be hot but eh. After you stand in line and give your order, they give you one of those buzzers that let you know when your order is ready to be picked up from the front. Went on a Friday during lunch break and it was packed, you couldn't get a seat inside but we sat outside (in January so I guess that's why seats were open). The inside of the place isnt dirty or anything, just too jammed to be comfortable. My review may be a little biased ( I didn't actually get a shake and I don't like greasy fast food) so I might update later if try it again.
