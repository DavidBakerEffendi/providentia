I hate to sound like a broken record, but I gotta concur with my fellas: Vietnam Cafe knows what's up. Cute decor? Check. BYOB? Bam. Super friendly, speedy service? Yep. Delicious food which never disappoints? Â Oooooh, yessssss. Reasonably priced? Uh-huh. Great view of the overweight crazy-curler lady who talks to herself while walking up and down the block in hot pink knee-highs? Hell to the yeah. Sure, it's cozy, but it seems like everyone else there knows what a sweet little gem this place is. Which means they're my kind of people. Way to go, Vietnam. And sorry about that whole war thing.
