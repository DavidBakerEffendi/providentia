Had Brunch their over the weekend. The eggs Benedict are amazing! My finance had the quesadilla salad with chicken and loved it as well. Both split a pitcher of blood orange margaritas very good. My only problem was how close the seating is you are literally right next to other people, not much breathing room. If you don't mind that then its very worth it. The waitress was great too!
