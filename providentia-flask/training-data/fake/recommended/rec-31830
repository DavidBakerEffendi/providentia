West Windsor, which has a high population of Chinese, finally has a decent Chinese restaurant, albeit with some downsides. First of all, it serves both American Chinese (think General Tso's, Sweet and Sour, etc) as well as more authentic Chinese.  As far as I can tell (without ordering), their American Chinese stuff is basically strip mall quality, but their more authentic dishes IMHO are a cut above.  This is validated by the number of Asian locals who have made this one of their Go-To places, esp. for lunch. Note: it's a bit crowded and loud, which is the mark of a good place :) Some items we've ordered and really liked: * Mongolian Lamb (a special that always seems to be available) * Cumin Beef (unusual and really nice!) * Whole fish prepared with bean sauce (smallish, but good) * Spicy beef noodle soup (fairly typical, but nice) The Dim Sum we've personally found to be only OK, but acknowledge others really like their pork soup dumplings etc. As far as service and attitude: think NYC Chinatown both in terms of food quality and service variability. They do a brisk take-out business, which is reliable. This is an independent review. I have no relationship to this restaurant, nor to the best of my knowledge, know anyone who works there.
