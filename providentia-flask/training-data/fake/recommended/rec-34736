Ok, so this has been rated over 2000 times, I think that says something. I'm not going to go into too much detail, because I feel like its already been said. I will say this though, If you're into chicken shawarma/donair/ gyro as a go-to option the chicken platter (well any platter) from the 53rd and 6th Halal Cart  never disappoints. 2000 people have vouched for this. Quick tips. Check your streets there a lot of  false "halal guys" out there. (good food, but not the halal you are looking for) Lines are long (because its good) but move fast. The portions are (extremely) generous Those who like some heat (everyone's idea of hot is different) go w/ the red sauce Those who don't like a little heat go plain or with the white sauce Enjoy!
