Great value for salads and fruit cups, haven't tried the smoothies BUT the stir fry is good just seems to be more geared towards health and the sauces just arent as flavorful as your typical asian restaurant. Screen ordering system is efficient, except if you want to make one change you have to hit cancel and restart your order from the beginning. Comparable to sweet green or hipcityveg. Much better quality than salad works and large selection of salad toppings and dressings
