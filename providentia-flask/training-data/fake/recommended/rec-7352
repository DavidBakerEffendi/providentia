I ABSOLUTELY love eating brunch here. I ordered the Millet Pancakes (platter), almost 2 consecutive Saturdays. I call it a platter cuz it comes with a little beet salad sprinkled with a little goat cheese AND 3 pcs of chicken-pistachio sausage. This dish is a perfect combination of savory & sweet. I LUV that homemade chicken-pistachio sausage, its unique ingredients, unique taste from a blend of spices. The Millet Pancakes are AMAZING. It's slightly savory, but can be sweetened with a drop of maple syrup. SO DELICIOUS. I found it to be "whole grain goodness". Lastly, the beet salad rounds out the entire dish. It's amazing how they pair vegetables INTO your breakfast. ps. I ordered the Pumpkin Pancakes. Reviews weren't lying. That cinnamon yogurt topped on the pancakes makes a lovely marriage. YUMMY. I was thinking, maybe the chef could layer the yogurt between each pancake. Thanks Cafe Orlin for providing a healthful breakfast dish (Millet Pancakes $12 or 13).
