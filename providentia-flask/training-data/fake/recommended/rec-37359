Came for lunch with my Hubbs and 3yr old diva - sat outside so she can run around without getting in anyones way.  She loved it! I had the smoked salmon panini and my husband the prociutto pesto - AMAZING!  Fresh, hearty, and oh so delicious.   The waiter was so friendly and catered to our little girl - danced with her, talked to her, and brought her a perfectly made grilled cheese sandwich.   We spent almost 2 hours there without being rushed with a bill or harassed to order more food.  It was great!  Will be back this weekend - and the next - and the next...
