I am totally a fan.  When I arrived, it was for the earlier part of dinner, around 6 on a Saturday.  The place hadn't yet filled up, and because I was on the other side of the street, I completely overshot.  It has a small entrance a few steps down, but once you're inside, you feel all warm and cozy.  In any case, a friend who knows the hood picked the spot, and I was very pleased.  We had white asparagus for a starter, wish they gave us more.  The portions were just right, but on the smaller side for someone with a large appetite.  I had the spaghetti with octopus, which was quite flavorful, but had a bit too much oil for me.  My friend had the hake, which was delicious and perfectly fork tender, and the broth was really great... I wanted to steal his dish.  As a side, we had brussels srouts, which you must try.  There were figs mixed in, it blew my mind a little.  The decor is really country-kitchen-like, with wreaths and little birds and a fun treatment with spackle on the walls.  Yes, I was admiring the walls as well.  Service was excellent and friendly.  Definitely will visit again.
