As far as the food goes, I enjoyed the steak and fried onions with Spanish rice, plantains, and beans. The steak had just the right amount of juice and the beans were flavorful without being too salty. However, service is a whole different story. When my boyfriend and I arrived, we were seated immediately but had to wait fifteen minutes to order. In the meantime, I noticed that people who arrived later than we did were serviced before we were. I let it slide because they were obviously very busy. Our server wasn't rude but seeing how it was practically a full house for the restaurant, there wasn't exactly time for niceties and polite small chat. The preparation of the food took another ten minutes. What ruined this for me, though, was a piece of plastic amidst my onions. Listen, I'm not picky when it comes to cuisines. In fact, I'd love to try as many as possible. But there's one thing I ask for and that's no inedible items accidentally placed in my food. Thinking it was one of the fried onions, I tried to chew on it. I spit it out and laid it out on a napkin. Continuing with the day's theme of waiting around, it was another ten minutes of waiting for a server to come around to our table so I could point it out. My dish and the piece of plastic was taken away and it was perhaps another five minutes before another plate of the same entree was given to me. I don't hold the saying "The customer is always right" to any value but it was quite disappointing when, despite the plastic incident, I was still charged full price for my dish. Being that there were many people and I had received a new plate, I didn't want to make a huge deal about it. What would work better, or worse in some cases unfortunately, was that tax and tip were already included in the check. The food was good. Unfortunately, I don't think I'd come back after what happened.
