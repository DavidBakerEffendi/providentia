So, sorry to those who feel the need to complain about Hometown's location and decrease the stars in their review as a result. Maybe great things are worth a little effort? Ride a bike, take a walk.... Maybe you should move closer? I would LOVE to live near this place and make it my main source of nourishment, community and entertainment. I could live on Hometown's cornbread alone; THE best I have ever had. What a great place and cool staff (Love you Jill!). There's quite a few bbq places around these days and all seem to fall short on either their style or their side dishes, it's about time there's one that gets it all just right - plus great music and a fun spacious layout. Thanks Hometown, looking forward to many good times ahead!
