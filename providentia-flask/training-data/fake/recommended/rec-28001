As a fairly new Upper East side resident, this restaurant has become my go to Thai spot. I've been here for both lunch and dinner, and take out on occasion - the food never disappoints. The place itself is super cute, with colorful lanterns hanging from the ceiling and jungle like foliage. It's never incredibly crowded, which surprises me considering how consistently good it is! The lunch special is absolutely worth it!! For $9 dollars you get a salad (ginger dressing is extra fantastic), a choice of dumplings or crab rolls (yum) and an entree. Plenty of food!! My go tos at this point are the chicken panang curry and the chicken peanut sauce stir fry. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! I also highly recommend the wing appetizers. Side note, I can't tell you how many times my water glass was refilled. They're definitely on their A game. Bottom line - great food, great atmosphere. This place is always a treat, no matter the time of day!
