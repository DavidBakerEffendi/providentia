The portions were huge and super filling. I really wish they had more than a small plate avocado salad with the order. I did come with a huge party. It seemed very popular and crowded, a bit overrated. The green sauce was amazing but the tostones was extremely dry and bland with a questionable sauce. We ordered a chef platter for desert but most of it tasted the same nothing special and not worth the price. Overall it was a positive experience, good for large groups and big eaters.
