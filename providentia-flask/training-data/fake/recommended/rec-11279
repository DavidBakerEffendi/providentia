If you work in University City or frequent 30th st station, this is a great location! They have awesome happy hour specials. The food's pretty good, considering it's standard bar fair. I've gone here for lunch as well, and the waitress was great--she brought our check out with the food as she knew we were on a time constraint. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood!
