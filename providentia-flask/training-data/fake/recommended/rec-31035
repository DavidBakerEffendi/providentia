5 stars for its perfection as an old-school neighborhood bar. Super-friendly staff. The menu was always a little limited for me because I don't eat meat, but they've recently expanded their offerings and it's gotten way more veg-friendly. The one thing they lacked was outside seating, but they recently built a deck and now they have outdoor tables.
