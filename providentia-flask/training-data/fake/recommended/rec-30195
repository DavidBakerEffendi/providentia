Quarters there are close, but, you have a warm and simple environment with a handful of communal benched tables. It's the perfect place for a delicious, affordable meal with all fresh and local products.Â  I ordered their Coogee sandwich (portobello mushroom, avocado, zucchini, tomato, baby spinach and red pepper sauce). This was super tasty. The bread is grilled, giving it a nice crispness and char marks on the outside, and a softness inside. The vegetables are generously portioned in the sandwich, with bold flavors from the marinated portobello, the red pepper sauce, and the contrasting textures from the crunch of the zucchini to the creaminess of the avocado.
