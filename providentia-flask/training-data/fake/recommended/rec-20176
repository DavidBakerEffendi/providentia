Delicious! I have no cause to complain, really tasty food and really large portions of it. High quality ingredients with a really good sense of how flavors blend. (Oh god, goat cheese salad with pistachios, beets, and braised pears? Please please please do it again.) It gets busy around brunch time but everyone is personable, friendly, and efficient.They get extra points for not rushing us out and turning the table even though they had quite a crowd. Word to the wise: brunch is CASH ONLY.
