My partner and I ate at Oaxaca for our anniversary dinner. We chose this restaurant in particular because I had a 20 percent off coupon from NuRide. Our waiter was both personable and attentive thoughout the meal. We appreciated the level of customer service he provided. The drinks (I ordered the mojito and my girlfriend got a mango margarita) were quite good, probably the best part of the meal. However, compared to the price of the food, the drinks were a bit expensive ($12 and $10, respectively). To be fair, the drinks were pretty strong. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable either. I ordered the fish ceviche, a baja fish taco, Â and a carne asada taco. My girlfriend got a (very large) burrito with chicken. Again, the food was fine, but not amazing. For an appetizer, she and I shared chips with salsa. Of all the food we ate, the chips were probably the best. They had great flavor. In the middle of our meal, a homeless person wandered into the restaurant and began asking different tables for money and/or food. Though New Haven has a large population of homeless individuals and neither me nor my girlfriend have a problem with them, it was rather surprising (and not in a good way) to have one come up to our table in the middle of our meal and start asking us for things. Perhaps needless to say, we spent the majority of the remainder of the meal talking about the issues surrounding homelessness in urban areas. Additionally, the manager seemed to be trying to push us out quicker than we were ready to go because he wanted to seat another party that had made reservations. (The waiter confirmed that that was the case: "My boss is trying to free up tables for reservations.") I'm sure that running a restaurant and trying to please all customers is difficult, but perhaps there may have been a better way of going about it. In all, I think the restaurant is good enough to recommend.
