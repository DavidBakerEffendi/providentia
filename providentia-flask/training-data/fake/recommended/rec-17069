My Mom recently moved to Montclair so I surprised her with a visit on sunday afternoon and we decided to go here. The atmosphere is really cool and exciting. Definitely not a place for anyone who is bothered by loud music because the place gets loud. The only downfall was walking through the restaurant. It was jam packed inside and out.. there isnt much room to get by which was kind of annoying. The food is outstanding. I had the shredded beef "ropa veija". Everyone at my table enjoyed their food. The pitchers of drinks are good but a rip off since theyre $15 with barely any liquor. Definitely bring a bottle of wine to spice it up and get your moneys worth. Overall this was a great place and I will be returning soon!
