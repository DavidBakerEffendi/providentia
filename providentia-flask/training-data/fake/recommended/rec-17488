By far the best Rodizio Restaurant I have ever been to.  This place will definitely break your wallet but like I said in other reviews, you just have to treat yourself sometimes.  The Caipirihas are amazing, a bit expensive but they are made with the good Cachaca.  The quality of meats is pretty incredible, they have every cut you can think of, or hope for.  Perfect place for a date, or lunch with a FEW friends.  Don't go in a big group or this meal will easily go over $1,000, unless someone else is paying...lol...  The decor is also pretty impressive.  Their Wine Cellar is something any restaurant will envy...  Enjoy...
