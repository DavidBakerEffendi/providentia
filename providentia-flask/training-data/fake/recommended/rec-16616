Yum! Not sure I'd wait for hours, but since my friends and I were seated immediately on Sunday afternoon, it was more than worth it. I had the green salad (keep reading..), manly burger, tempura onion rings, fried pickles, and truffle fries. The Manly Burger was so flavorful, a juicy red cut of beef, with just the right amount of crispiness from the onion straws. I am not sure that I actually got the "umami" experience from that, since it was just a very good bacon cheeseburger, but I would definitely recommend it, or maybe try the actual umami burger next time. All the friends I was with also had Manly burgers, so we weren't able to sample. The truffle fries and fried pickles were both some of the best we have had. They also have one of my favorite beers, Six Point Sweet Action, so cheers to that!
