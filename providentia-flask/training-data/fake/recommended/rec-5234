Food is pretty good. My eggs were slightly overcooked and bacon a little undercooked, but my brother's pancakes were delicious! Fluffy but not too fluffy. My hash browns were a little crispy, which is how I like them. Everyone was friendly to me. It's a cute little place, and I'll definitely be back at some point.
