Excellent experience, the ambience Is fun, a little loud but you can still hear people on your table. The service was great. The menu is seasonal and is based on what is in season so you may not find what we ordered but I will give my input anyway :) we were a party of 3 and ordered the following: The shaved asparagus salad - beautiful mix of crunch and lemony nutty pecorino goodness The wild mushroom bruschetta - the perfect marriage of the creamy cheese with the beautifully marinated wild mushrooms on a toasted piece of bread goodness The delicate squash gnocchi - Oh my goodness, I wanted to order 2 more JUST for me. What a dish. Simple but oh so good. No other comments. MUST ORDER. The risotto with apples - yummy but nothing to remember The goat cheese tortellini with walnut sauce - wonderful mix of flavors Pollo al forno Â - wasn't as crazy about it to be honest ! Potatoes with pecorino and rosemary - wow! The little pieces of fried potatoes were sooooo yummy! All I can say is enjoy - lovely restaurant all in all :)
