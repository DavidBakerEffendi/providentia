I'm always hesitant to dole out great recos to local gems, but this place deserves an inflow of business. The food is so authentic, delicious, well-priced and homey. The service is down-to-earth. Â They take the extra mile from the owner down. The atmosphere is everything you'd want. Really happy to have them in the 'hood.
