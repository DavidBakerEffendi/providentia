Salty balls? Keep it traditional. When I opted for the spicy pork and brown gravy balls at the meatball shop with polenta and spinach I was picturing something a little different all around, except the spinach was pretty standard. The gravy was more clear and had a snot like consistency and the pork meatball had good spice but I couldn't tell if is was too salty or just meant to be that way with the spice. The polenta was watery with a gritty texture. Anyway, next time I try I would go for more traditional beef with red sauce.
