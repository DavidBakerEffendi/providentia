I dine at a different Japanese place in Midtown east once a week for lunch, and Sakagura is as good as it gets.  I ordered a special with herring and soba, and the herring was fresh and fishy in that herring way, and the soba was as good as the specialty places around here.  The miso soup was excellent, in the top 10 miso soups I've had, and the sushi was almost as good as the top sushi places in town.  All in all a great experience. And then I went in for the izakaya.  Even better.  If there's a better izakaya in NYC, I haven't found it yet.  I could go here every week and be happy.  The dishes are varied, flavorful, and quite inexpensive The decor is memorable, with the underground den of sake adding flavor to the experience.  As others have commented, it's quite a trip into the underbelly of a office building to get there, but to be honest that just adds to the charm. Unfortunately, I have no sophistication when it comes to Sake, but I am told it is excellent.
