The food overall was fairly good and seemed mostly fresh. The service however was some of the worst I've ever gotten anywhere. I'm going to say that it was reminiscent of the soup Nazi. In a pinch I guess I would go back again because the food was okay but set your expectations very low for how you're going to be treated.
