It's good. Honestly, I think it's overrated because most of the places in Princeton are merely OK. My parents and I used to go here regularly when it was new... back then it was great, and not nearly as crowded. Today it's so noisy and crowded that I often question why we don't just buy some of their fish from next door and eat at home... which we actually do more often now.
