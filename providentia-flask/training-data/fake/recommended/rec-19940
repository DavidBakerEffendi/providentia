The dinner was great; fried chicken, greens, Mac n cheese, and fried green tomatoes. I was impressed with the crunch of the chicken and the spice. The place is small and intimate the service was horrible. Had to go to the bar to get ice for our ice water and napkins. Had the service been better it would have made the experience that much better. I plan on going back just because the food was good. I'll just remember that it takes an hour to get food so have a snack before.
