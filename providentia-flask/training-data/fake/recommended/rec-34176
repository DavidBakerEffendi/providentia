I must say, Williamsburg has the best restaurants in ALL 5 boroughs. However, XIXA(and Traif-sister restaurant) exceed all expectations. The chef here is creative, imaginative and knows how to make unlikely ingredients work. The wait staff is super cool and beyond accommodating. I can eat everything on the menu. We are adventurous eaters this place will give you that. It is beyond one up from any restaurant we've been to. We have been to top Michelin restaurants. Guys, this is the place to be! Last, get the drinks!!! Watch the mixologist at he bar as she makes the drinks. It's a work of art! Â Come here and try it all.
