what is the hype over this place? If this is one of the best places that food network can showcase in New Jersey, then New Jersey should be embarrassed...for yet another reason. My boyfriend and I had passed this diner many times going to the Petco in the next lot but never had stopped in for a bite.  Don't walk by on a sunny day without some dark glasses - it is overally reflective, even for a diner.  Still, if Guy Fieri of "diners, drive-in, and dives" made the trip, it had to have something good, right? Big disappointment.  I ordered the Mediterranean salad (grilled veggies, fresh mozzarella, grilled chicken, on arugula) and my bf order the open face steak sandwich.   On appearance - 4 out of 10 My fresh mozzarella were cut so small that they looked like tiny pieces of toilet tissue that a novice shaver had torn and set aside to stop the flow of blood on his face.  I'm not a baby, mozzarella balls don't pose as a choking hazzard for me.   My grilled chicken pieces were also small although to be fair, there was plenty of it.  But they had the distinctive pale "painted on" grill marks of the oven roasted chicken at Subways.  Show me some black char to let me know that this chicken suffered a little to get on my plate.   On Taste-4 out of 10 Bland.  Chicken and veggies were both entirely under seasoned.  I poured tabasco sauce over it in an attempt get some flavor and even had to dip my chicken in ketchup.  My boyfriend also said his steak was bland.   Service- 3 out of 10 Never refilled my water.  I guess they figured the food was so bland that there wasn't a need for another neutral element. Not great, wouldn't try again
