Pleasantly surprised by this one. These fried little pizzas are a taste sensation and the warm kale salad with breadcrumbs is a delight.   The room is teeny without much seating, so that can be problematic.   Service is friendly. Music is good. Two thumbs up to this lovely addition to the neighborhood.
