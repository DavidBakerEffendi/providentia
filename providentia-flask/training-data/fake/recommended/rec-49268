This place is great for hibachi but I wouldn't get to excited about the sushi. Me and my girl went around 5:30 Friday wasn't to busy staff kept the glasses filled with water it had a real cool ambience. The problem was simply the sushi, its skimp on rice and not filling.try some place like sushi mizu and you can really appreciate the sushi rice and the freshness of the face. This place gives you so little rice toy can see the seaweed from the side and it barely keeps the roll together. I spent 41.50 on rolls and me and my girlfriend still were hungry and she's a size 3 and I'm 6'2 250 pounds. Stick to take-out if you want a roll or two
