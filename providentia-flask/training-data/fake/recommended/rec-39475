I got the burger medium rare with mozzarella. WIN. The only thing that could have made it better would be a bit of bearnaise sauce for the fries, but that wouldn't be particularly irish. Great place for small groups but the PERFECT place to go if you just want to sit at the bar by yourself with an excellent burger (that was me). The stools at the bar were a bit awkwardly shaped for someone my height--I'm pretty short. So couldn't quite get comfortable and I left with marks on the backs of my legs. The service was attentive and friendly.
