We were staying in Manhattan but a friend who lives in Williamsburg suggested this place for dinner and it was definitely worth the trip! The place has a very old school American retro charml and was filled with young local fashionistas. The staff were exceptional, in fact our waiter was from Queen Anne in Seattle!! He was very helpful and extremely knowledgeable about the menu. They are known for amazing oysters and although I didn't have any, others at our table did and they cleaned the plate. I had the sea bass because I am crazy for the stuff and it was tres bien, served with really tasty, really juicy veggies :) Lovely jubbly. Very cool vibe. We could do with one of these places in Seattle!
