I came here just before Christmas Eve. This was my second time to the restaurant since August. Once again, a first class experience from start to finish. The resto is warm and chic. The mood is subdued but exciting. The wait staff is intimately knowledgeable with all menu items. Help with the wine choices is readily available and the recommendation I received was bang on. The Chili lobster is exquisite and worth the trip alone. The mains my daughter and I had (a Halibut dish and a scallop dish) were works of art on a plate and simply delicious. The chocolate "ganache thingie" ice cream dessert was sweet decadence. As if the above weren't enough, we had the pleasure of meeting Marc Forgione himself. Like his restaurant, he has an earthy modest side but if you listen to him carefully, he also has a "boyish mischievous" side. Can't wait to come back the next time I'm in town!!!
