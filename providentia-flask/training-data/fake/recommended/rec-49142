Oh my how we love this little restaurant. We ate there every morning on our recent trip to Manhattan. We had the avocado toast breakfast both mornings. So delicious! The olive oil and seasonings were so great and the bread used for the toast was like homemade! I have to try and recreate! Plus the service was wonderful. Everything is so fresh there. The salad served with breakfast was so wonderful, I ate every leaf. Plus like their sister restaurant (Jeffry's Grocery), they serve Stumptown Roasters Hairbender coffee which I now drink every day and order on line after discovering it on our last visit.
