I am a fan. I only had the wings, and frankly, late at night these are really the only things I'll eat. The delivery took an hour but the food was still somewhat warm when it arrived. I was impressed by the wings, they are better than Wingstop wings, if you want to compare. The buffalo sauce is really good, it is light and not soggy like others can be. The lemon pepper is good, you can really taste the pepper. Nice flavor all-around, a little too much on the salt IMO, but not a big deal. They're wings anyway. In Hanover, I would recommend this when you're up late, studying and need some food.
