Solid Italian food, enjoyed by regulars who were probably there for the Grand Opening.   The bar room is a treasure.  The flat-panel TVs represent the only nod to modern times; otherwise, you are in a time capsule from the early 60s.  Just a great place to sit back and have a few.     All of the standard dishes are represented, and they will fill you up right.  I'm a human trash disposal, and I can get at least two meals out of the Fettuccine Bolognese.  The tomato pies are only available during the dinner hours, and are just a slight cut below the best Trenton has (or, sadly, had) to offer.  You will not be disappointed.   Note: Bartenders do not take food orders. They will give you a menu and place setting, and a server will come around to take your order. You will also get two checks, one for bar, one for kitchen. I guess this is the way they did it in 1933. You can avoid this by getting a table in the bar area.
