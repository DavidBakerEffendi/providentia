The folks at this place are the most unprofession people I have come across in USA. I ordered food for delivery...they made me wait for 1 hr only to tell me that they cant deliver the food. And when they called me to say this, I had no other options left but to call for pizza delivery. I m disgusted by the level of unprofessionalism. I would never go back to this resturant. Unreliable, unprofessional.
