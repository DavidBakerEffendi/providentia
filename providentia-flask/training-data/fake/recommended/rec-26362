This is NOT the BDC of LA, which is EXCELLENT and highly recommend.  This place  use to be when it was in its former location on 32nd street but is something else entirely.   We had a kimchee soondubu, jayuk pokem (pork and kimchee) and bulgolgi.  First the soondubu...it barely had any soup in the stew.  My husband got this and when I took a taste, I realized why.  It was burnt at the bottom.  For a soondubu place, that is amateur hour!!  the jayuk pokem LOOKED promising but unfortunately it was doused with sugar, which is a really big problem with many Korean restaurants.  Can't taste the food.  Same with bulgogi, which I never order but did for my 6 year old.  To give you a sense of how sweet the stuff was...when I asked him if he wanted some sauce on the rice, which is really tasty with bulgogi, he said he already had sweet sauce on his meat so didn't need it on his rice.!!!  He really liked it initially (I assume because he was hungry) but after several bites, he stopped eating it.  I think the sweetness got to him.   Am really disappointed because this place use to be really great but now has just dissolved into that of many Manhattan restaurants that sacrifice great food for dumbed down mediocrity because no one seems to care.  I can't understand the dramatic change in the food.  The place was popular before with great food so why change the formula??? If I can give it no stars, I would.
