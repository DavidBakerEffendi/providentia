What a treat!  We were in the mood for Spanish tapas and found this place on  the Time Out New York app.  We were the first people in for brunch on a Sunday, so we sat at the open window seat and enjoyed the sights/sounds of the West Village while dining on olives, octopus, cod, serrano ham, manchego cheese, and sipping on a crisp white.  I felt like I was in a postcard.  Everything was tasty, and there were a dozen other things I could've tried on the menu if I wasn't so full from what we'd ordered already.  A definite find in a neighborhood full of options...
