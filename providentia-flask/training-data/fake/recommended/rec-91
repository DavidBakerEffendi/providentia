In New Jersey, diners are as common as jug handles on the highways... however, very few stand out.  The Broadway Diner is one such place.  Fast and very friendly service. The menu is extensive and the food is quite good.  My favorite item is the roast beef wrap.  The meat is fresh and rare, the Russian dressing is home made, and it never fails to satisfy.  Pair that with their onion rings or disco fries and you are good.  Good. On a Sunday morning, the place is jam packed for breakfast.  The pancakes and French toast are great.  The omelletes are also delicious. A great place to go if you're starting out your day, or ending your night!
