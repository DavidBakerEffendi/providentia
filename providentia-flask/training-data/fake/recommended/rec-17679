Best sushi around! If this restaurant was in Ft. Lee or NY the line would be out the door. Pricey for Totowa, but so worth it. Fish was so fresh and each dish had a unique flavor. If this restaurant was closer to home, I would be there once a week and for special occasions. The restaurant is in a strip mall but is decorated beautifully. Since it's BYOB, the attention is on the food. Best quality and service I've seen in a while. Noodle dishes, seafood entrees and sushi were all amazing. I even enjoyed the dessert. We went with 6 people so we sampled a lot of dishes and each dish was worth the drive. If you're looking for great sushi and superior service, this restaurant is worth the trip. I will frequent this Sushi Fu as often as possible.
