Went here with a large group for lunch, and we were seated immediately. The decor was lovely- the eclectic chandelier in the center of the room was beautiful, as long as the wall decorations. Service was on the slower side, and all the food did not come out at the same time. I got the lunch special- you get a choice of appetizer, along with an entree (you can also choose what kind of meat you want- the price differs depending on what you get). My chicken satay appetizer was cold and tough. Maybe left out for too long? My entree (pad thai with tofu) was pretty good though! Can't complain much, its a good deal for a $7 lunch.
