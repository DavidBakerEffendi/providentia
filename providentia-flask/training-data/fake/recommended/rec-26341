I really enjoyed my dining experience here.. Thanks to a dear friend who brought me here, I got to experience the funnest, coolest, delicious quality food here. Love the fact we sat at the main ingredient table with the chefs right in front of us and cooking what we picked right there and then.  Love the fact they put a selected amount of veggies and meats on ice in front of you and use it til it's sold out.  So fresh and local. The chefs are pretty amazing other than cooking delicious plates Sitting the whollllllle time inside their circle not moving!!  Wow.  impressive.   They hand all dishes to you off their wooden tool, which at the end of night: please do not forget to tip (on that wooden tool)!!!   Creative dining at its best.
