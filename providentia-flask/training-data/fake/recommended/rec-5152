The decor is very nice and the foodcwas decent.  The highlight for me was the pork ribs which literally fell off the bone.  The baked sweet potato was good but the portion should have been more.  They just service half of a sweet potato with butter, brownsugar and sage.  The corn bread was very moist which I kinda disliked was hoping for southern skillet corn bread.  I advice every body to stay away from they singnarure cocktail the "texas two step"....very weak.  It taste like watered down bourbon.  But other than that a nice spot....just need to improve on their drinks.
