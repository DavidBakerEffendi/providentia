Being from the West Coast, I have missed In n Out ever since I moved. So far the Shake Shack has the only burger that can even come close to a taste like In n Out! The burger was delicious and wasn't too large or too small. The concretes are something unique and very tasty, as well. I personally like the Rittenhouse flavor.
