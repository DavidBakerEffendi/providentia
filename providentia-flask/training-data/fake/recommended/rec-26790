We were there on Sunday - and at 11:00AM we got there just before the line started forming.  We decided to try this place because of the  high ratings and good reviews it has received here on Yelp. As far as the Dim Sum goes, it was good.  Just about everything we had was hot and fresh.  Wait staff was friendly and helpful, which is sometimes lacking in other places, especially when the customer is not Asian.   The only thing stopping me from giving them 4 stars is the roast duck we got at the end of our meal.  Someone was bringing it around on a tray, and so we asked for one. We have been to MANY, MANY dim sum restaurants - from NYC to NJ to PA to San Francisco. This plate of what may have been, at the most, 1/4 of a very SMALL roast duck, which was not even very fresh-tasting, was $9.50.  That's absurd!!   We've paid $7.50 for roast duck in other places - and it was MUCH better.  We have never paid anywhere near that much for barely 1/4 of a duck.  We can get 1/2 roast duck for just a little more in Asian markets - and the duck is MUCH fresher. Sadly, since many of the dishes we enjoy are those specialty things from the kitchen, such as roast duck, salt and pepper shrimp, etc, - we won't be back.  Those things are just very overpriced.
