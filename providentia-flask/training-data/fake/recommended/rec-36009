Overall I give it a four. The cod was very good.  I kale salad was good. Eggplant parm  good. Lobster risotto very good. Prickly pear cocktail good. The odd thing was when they brought bread for the table they only brought three pieces and they were four people at our table. when we asked the waitress if we could have more when we had eaten two of the three pieces she took the plate with that one bread left and said she had to take the plate as they were short on dishes. They were only about five other tables occupied in the restaurant. So I thought it was odd.
