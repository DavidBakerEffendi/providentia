Would have given them 4 stars, but the restaurant lacks in quick and efficient service and is cash-only. The food is delightfully flavorful and definitely very filling. Make sure you ask them to adjust the level of spice according to what you can handle. They have a huge variety of dishes available - be warned, you will take a long to time to decide what you want to order!
