Great cafe for a delicate sandwich and excellent coffee.  I tried the signature lobster sandwich which was surprisingly light and fresh.  No funky seafood taste.  They have a small assortment of desserts as well as small plates of pasta (which looked delicious). Very small space but very charming.  I will definitely go back.
