Prix fixe was only $15 here. The food was amazing! (no booze drinks included or even available). Friend and I went halvzies so I had the roast Chicken sandwich and she had the apple pancakes and we split them.  Both meals were great. The service was a bit glacial... Took forever to get our coffee and juice while the table next to us got their drinks almost immediately (we ordered at the same time with the same waitress).  However we got our meals first and they wait a long time for their meal.... Fair enough, bitches!  Great food, slightly slow service, nice atmosphere, and lots of cute gays.
