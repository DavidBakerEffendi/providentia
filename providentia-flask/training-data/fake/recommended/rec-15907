Yum yum yum! The food here is beyond belief. I wish I could list everything I've ever had here as a favorite but if I HAD to choose, my three favorites would be: fried goat cheese with lavender honey, brussle sprouts, and bacon-wrapped dates. The sangria is also delicious and STRONG! The ambiance is super cute. Dimmed lighting with wrap around bannisters so that the upper level looks over the lower level. I also once had to be seated in the room behind the kitchen. I didn't love walking through the kitchen to get there but the room itself was cute! I've been here both for a large group party and for dates and it's great for both. Tapas-style meals makes it great for sharing, but it is also definitely the ambiance for date night. I thought about giving it 5 stars but: it's a tad overpriced, they only take $ or Amex, and it can be difficult to get a reservation. This hasn't stopped me from returning though!
