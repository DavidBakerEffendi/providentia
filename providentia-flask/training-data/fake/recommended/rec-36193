Popped in here for lunch on our day trip to Princeton.  It was bitterly cold outside so the pub looked warm and inviting.  Service was attentive and good but some members of our party were really disappointed in their meal choice.  They both ordered onion soup and Irish lamb stew.  The onion soup was weak and lacking in flavor.  The Irish lamb stew was seriously lacking in lamb (my sister got about 10 carrots, 10 tatties and 1 measly cube of lamb in her big bowl).  It was also served with sweet Irish soda bread which didn't do anything to complement the (lack of) flavor.  I'm from the UK originally and Irish soda bread there is mainly made without the fruit and is more savory and suited to stews and soups.  However, I've noticed since moving to the US that they only make sweet/frutied Irish soda bread.  Lesson learnt.  I'll give the place 3-stars as I was happy with my meal choice..I wasn't that hungry so I ordered an appetizer consisting of spicy carrot hummus, sliced veggies - radishes and cucumber - and warm pita bread.  Apparently, a much better choice than the lamb stew!
