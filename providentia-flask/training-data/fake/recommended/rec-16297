As soon as I walked up to Vite I felt like I was going to have a cozy and comfortable experience and we did. The place has a really rustic and romantic setting. It had only been opened for about 2 weeks when we went so what can you expect? As people who try new venues often, its like all restaurants that just open..it has growing pains but the essentials are in tact. The food, wine and ambience are all solid. We ordered ravioli, rigitoni with veal ragout along with the cornish hen. The ravioli has a ricotta sundried tomato and olive filling and the pasta was def made in house. The cornish hen was so much better than I've had in other places because it was juicy inside with so much flavor and the skin was so crispy and yummy. The food was amazing. Really, really good with welll balanced flavors. Oh the pastas...they come out in little pans as if they were came right off the stove..makes it feel like you are eating at your grandmothers house in Italy. We had to try that popcorn mousse because we were so curious and although we thought it would taste weird it was such an amazing treat! The food took a little while but we were enjoying ourselves and the servers(who currently are the owners all are from Cirprianis) were fun and really happy to have us there.   They also had some great wine suggestions and asked us to try their favorites free of charge to welcome us. Overall..Vite wasn't a place where we need to grab a business card to remember we've been there. We will remember and be back because of the "at home" feeling they give you.   We will be back. These guys know what they are doing it will get better fast.
