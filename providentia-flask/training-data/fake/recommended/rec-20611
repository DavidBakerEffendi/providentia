This place is amazing.  Took my friends here when they came in from out of town and we just rotated drinks.  I had the Moco Loco (hot chocolate with hazelnut and banana) and it was phenomenal.  The vibe is cool--run by hippies like any good coffee shop--music at perfect volume, very laid back atmosphere.  Let us hang around and chat, didn't feel rushed. Try the Peanut Butter Pie!
