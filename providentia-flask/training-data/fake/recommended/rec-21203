I came here for the birthday dinner with my friends and we were able to sample a large number of plates. Just be aware if you make reservations for a big group, they require that you order a minimum of $50 per person. Some of the dishes that I recommend are Ebi Shinjo (fried shrimp ball covered with almonds), Buta Kakuni (Pork Belly, one piece is quite bit and can shared among 2-3 people), Gyutan Yawaraka (Beef tongue...this is really good! Better than the pork belly. Best to eat with rice and use that sauce the beef tongue was cooked it!), Daikon Salad (very light dish. It's very simple but it's actually tasty), Black Sesame Creme Brulee (I dont think I have seen this in other restaurants) and Black Sesame ice cream. The sushi here are also very fresh and good. One of my friend had the cold soba which I thought was only okay. I guess I like to eat my noodles hot. The Ongiri rice balls aren't that special either. The food came at a really slow rate. Sometimes it felt like I was waiting forever for the next course. It might be because they wanted us to order more sake since they make more money on that. The restaurant is location in the basement of an office building, so just be aware of that when you are looking for it.
