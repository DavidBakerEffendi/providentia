So it's been a while since I've given a five star review and I'm more than happy to give Caffe Linda one. I came here on a late weekday afternoon on a whim when the significant other and I couldn't figure out where to eat so we decided to randomly pick a restaurant. Luckily he came across this place on his phone and a picture of the lobster and shrimp (ink?) linguini totally hooked us in. (har, get it? hooked us in? okay.) We split an appetizer and main course: the sea scallops and the black linguini with lobster/shrimp. Holy scallops, the sauce for our appetizer was fantastic. I wanted to dip everything into that sauce: the shrimp, the lobster, the bread, my napkin. Amazing. The black linguini was equally as amazing. Lobster tasted fresh and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. (As were the scallops). I suggest going on a late weekday afternoon because there was no one else in the restaurant and the waiters were all eating their lunches (politely and attentive to us, of course). Service was great and super quick. The prices were definitely more than reasonable as well.
