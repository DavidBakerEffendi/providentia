Her are the components that made me give this 5 stars. 1. Really fabulous service 2. Adorable decor 3. Wonderful prices that were very reasonable 4. Fabulous food...details shortly 5. Good music/air temperature We had the stuffed artichoke. Which was delicious, though slightly messy. We also had the beets(more 3-4 stars), the beans(5 stars) and the Chicken entree(also 5 stars). The chicken was both moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. The onions served with it were especially tasty.
