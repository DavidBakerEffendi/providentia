This is one of my favorite spots in Williamsburg, really the whole city. It's a very straightforward delicious small diner joint. I go here quite regularly (mostly for Brunch) and it never disappoints. They did remove my favorite (The Elvis, which is peanut butter, bacon on a waffle) but they are always nice about making it for me if I ask. Another highly recommended dish is the sausage and biscuits. Just like you would expect from a small-town mom and pop type place. The place is small and there is almost always a wait, but it's worth it. Also... Stumptown Coffee. :)
