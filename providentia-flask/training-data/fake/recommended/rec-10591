Wow! What a great little place! This small and rustic Haitian restaurant made me feel like it wasn't the middle of winter in Montclair NJ. The staff was helpful and attentive. They reduced the spiciness of my friends entree and explained the menu. We had the sampler as an appetizer. Haitian caviar (eggplant on a plantain with some goat cheese on top), spicy fried fritters and spinach empanadas. So so good. I had the shrimp estufee and it was delicious! The place is BYOB. We paired the meal with a Spanish Rioja and it was perfect for cutting the heat. For desert, we had a sweet potato concoction. It looked like pumpernickel bread soaked in a vanilla sauce and vanilla bean ice cream. It was so good. We even met the owner, Ron and he told us all about the place, food and Haiti. Great place!
