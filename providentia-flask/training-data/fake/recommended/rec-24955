I spontaneously stopped in yesterday for some beer and a quick bite. I've heard great things about this place from friends so decided I'd give it a try. I ordered their "surf n turf" burger. Which is a lump crab cake on top of a cheese burger with all the fixin's. It was a fantastic and original offering. Well prepared and tasted great. I really loved it. I also had some of Staten Island's Flagship beer. Loved that as well. The service was top notch. I never had a dry glass and everyone inside is very friendly. You feel welcome when you're there. It was between lunch & dinner so it was a little quiet inside. The owner had time to come out and say hello. Great guy, he actually got me out of a parking ticket and gave me a free slice of pizza (which was also great). I definitely suggest you try it. I will be a regular here.
