What an amazing little gem! We booked a table for 9.45pm, got there on time but had to wait for 3ins before getting a table. Not nice right? But here is why I loves this place: they did everything to make us feel welcomed during our waiting, very professionally and kindly. And then the food...as everybody said, pork chops were delicious, just like anything else we tried. The wine list was also good, we tried a Primitivo from Italy (very nice full bodied red from the south), decently priced. So food is great, atmosphere very cozy and pleasant, service is excellent: we will be back! Thanks for the great experience!
