This has become my annual Birthday Dinner spot, mainly because my wife isn't a fan of German food so I only get it once a year.  I look forward to it every year and any time I can sneak over in between.   In short, everything here is fantastic.  I'd suggest anything that comes with home fries on a hot plate.  It comes to the table sizzling and delicious.  I've had the pork, sausage, chicken dishes.  All fantastic. The potato pancakes are incredible as well. This place can not be beaten.  It's one of my favorite places on Staten Island.  If you like German food and beer, look no further.  Yes, this is better then the other German place on the South Shore.....by far! I haven't been there since August (my last Birthday) so I can't get into specifics like other reviews where I've just been, but I had to add mine to the endorsements of Nurnberger.   Great, great, great! PS- Decor is perfect, you can really imagine you are in Germany if you want to.  Service is always excelllent and the beer selection for German/European Brews can not be matched on the Island.  Period.
