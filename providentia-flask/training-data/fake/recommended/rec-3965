A little story behind the name: Char 4 refers to the aging of whiskey in oak barrels. Yup. I definitely don't tell it as well as the waiters. Anyshoes. Wicked awesome whiskey cocktails. They are so good. Boys, bring your dates here (I think my group was not informed that it was date night as we were the only table in there not an annoyingly adorable twosome). They also have terrific appetizers. I was almost tempted to eat only the appetizers. Pork nuggets-good. Lamb pastrami-amazing. Crispy cheese curds-also amazing. A note of caution. Some of the entrees are really big (ribs)... other really small (scallops). They are all very yummy, but if you're hungry. Go with the bigger one, eh?
