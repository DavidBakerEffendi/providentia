I first became a fan of Rex after Philly Mag's Battle of the Burger and it has been on my to-eat list ever since that glorious September evening. We came here for brunch Sunday when they opened at 11. The restaurant's atmosphere was polished and sophisticated and I felt a bit out of place in with my hangover, sweatshirt, and jeans. Â Dining Partner and I both ordered the chicken and waffles benedict. The chicken was crispy, maple-ly, and delicious. The waffles were light and fluffy and the egg was cooked to runny-yolk perfection. I had a side of salad and dining partner had the homefries. We saw at least 6 other chicken and waffle dishes come out to other tables, it's really a hit! We both cleaned our plates. I also ordered an iced tea which I didn't think was too troublesome. Our waiter said the first one he made was a bit weak, so he was brewing a second. It tasted fine, but probably could have used one more teabag. When he asked and I told him this he ended up taking it off the check, and explained they brew each iced tea by hand individually. It wasn't necessary for him to take it off the check since I drank the whole glass, but I appreciated the gesture. I will be back for the burger and fried chicken!
