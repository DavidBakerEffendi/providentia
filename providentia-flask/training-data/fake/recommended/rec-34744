We visited this place in October after a very long (and tiring walk or so they whined) and I wasn't expecting it to be anything fancy. Peter just wanted his flan badly...and Cha-An seasonally serves earl grey flan which we NEVER had the chance to try. We, however, tried their buns/dumplings that are not on the menu online, their signature cha-an toast and the four-course dessert. The buns were okay but the toast, they were PHENOMENAL. I was never that happy about something that looks like a toast because toast is just not my delicious bite ever really. But Cha-an knows how to make it tasty and you just can't tell what they did with it. The tea was mhm, I cannot make a judgement since I switched drink with someone and therefore, I had Chai which didn't flow very well for me. But maybe Peter's oolong was better. I'd say, skip the tea because it's pricy. If you wish, do the tea ceremony for 15 bucks per person. They also serve a lot of other things that you kind of need to be there before 7pm to try (which was not our case so til next time). And if you've been here, don't even think about going to Spot because Cha-An is just so much better in terms of atmosphere and food hands down.
