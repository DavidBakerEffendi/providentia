Lox sandwich on a freshly made garlic bagel. Â Plenty of cream cheese although on one side. Bagel had good garlic flavor and proper chewiness! Also ordered a cranberry walnut muffin and a banana as a snack for my road trip. I'll probably come back tomorrow to try another breakfast sandwich since I'm just across the street at a hotel. The store had a steady line of people coming in - sometime out the door. Seems to be a popular place and for good reason.
