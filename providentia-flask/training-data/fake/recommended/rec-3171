This place recently opened and is absolutely delicious. The owner was kind and personable. You're able to watch your order being prepared and don't forget about the dense/pillowy chocolate chip cookies! Nothing else like it, that I know of, in the neighborhood-which is part of the reason I gave it 5 stars. Great prices :) Suuuper small space fyi.
