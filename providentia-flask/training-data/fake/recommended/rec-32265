No doubt the owners will know exactly who wrote this review bc this is what I order 9 times out of 10.  It's getting to where they just grab the hummus platter, if they are any available, when they see me walk in.  This week I did opt for the egg white sandwich on multigrain, equally fresh and delicious,  and it was big enough to share, but this is about the hummus platter... This is my favorite lunch at Plenty.  Its vegetarian, its fresh, nutritional and satisfying.  The platter consists of cucumber, artichoke, feta cheese, greek olive and roasted peppers.  The chips come with the platter but I pass on them and stick to the fresh, crunchy cucumber, and its a fair trade for one of their delicious desserts which they also make and coffee afterward.  Friends have stated they have the best porchetta sandwich.  Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, its all made with love.  Wifi is available and a few outdoor tables.
