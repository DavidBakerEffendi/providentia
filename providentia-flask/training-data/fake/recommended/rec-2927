As a city dweller, I have a handful of go-to restaurants that I can rely on for a Friday night when I want nothing more than to decompress from work with delicious food in my belly and a quick trip back home. Cedar Point is on that list. The first few times I went, it was a little so-so. But they are a new restaurant and still working out some kinks, and it was REALLY close to home, so I persisted. Then came the day I ordered the seitan veggie wings. I do not exaggerate when I say they blew my mind for a number of reasons. For one, I do not, I repeat DO NOT eat spicy food. Especially buffalo sauce. But some weird restaurant voodoo took hold of me one day and on a whim I ordered them. They burned the everloving hell out of my mouth, but by god were they delicious. They also come with perfectly cooked brussel sprouts that offer a quick and small reprieve from the spicy hot inferno bought on by the wings. Since the first time I had them, I've learned that you can ask for light sauce, or even get the sauce on the side, and it has only made the experience better. Since they make each batch of sauce in-house, sometimes it's spicier than others, and once a waiter was even kind enough to give me some milk when I couldn't take it anymore. Now that they have had some time to get their legs under them, the food, especially veggie entrees, are bangin. I am a huge fan of the "meatball" sub they've had on the specials list a few times, and the BBQ mushroom grilled cheese is very tasty. They always have good craft beers on tap, and I hardly ever have to wait too long for a table. This place is definitely worth a trip, especially if you're on the fence. The wait staff is friendly and willing to make your meal a good experience, and if you're a vegetarian you'll be in heaven with all the options!
