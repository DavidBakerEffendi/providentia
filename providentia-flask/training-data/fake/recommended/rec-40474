i decided to give these guys another chance and they completely ruined it again. Not only are their drivers incredibly rude and make you feel guilty for them walking up to your apartment (isn't that what delivery is?). But they have the world's worst customer service. Long story short the "owner" told me rudely over the phone that it's my fault that they didn't make the pizza the way I ordered it (without blue cheese) and that they are closed now so  there's nothing he can do about it..... Not only was the pizza loaded with blue cheese (something I'm allergic to) but they also forgot to bring my snapple which I paid for. I asked the owner if he was willing to lose a customer of this and he said he has plenty of customers and doesn't care... Is this the type of person you want making the food you eat?  Whether he likes it or not he is in the hospitality industry and treating a customer like that is unacceptable.
