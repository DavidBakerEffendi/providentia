Manhattan special soda...if you have never had one, It is definitely worth a go, especially if you enjoy espresso.  nuff said Boylan's cherry soda...of course ordered two pies- 1st up was the cherry jones-mozzarella cheese, prosciutto di parma, dried bing cherries, gorgonzola cheese, orange blossom honey.  wow!  Amazingly decadent.   Next was the bacon marmalade- red onion, mozzarella, bacon marmalade on top...excellent pie, very unique, and very well rounded.  IMHO, the cherry jones was a tad bit better but boy thats a tough one to decide.   Not your run of the mill NYC pie but if you want to try something extremely unique and not a basic cheese slice that you fold over, give Paulie Gee's a go, I doubt you will be disappointed.
