This evening, I asked for a small gelato. The woman ahead of me got one scoop in a cone. I got one scoop in a cup, and was charged fifty percent more. I pointed out that I was getting less food for more money, but they didn't seem bothered by this. The gelato itself was fine, but no better than what I've had elsewhere. None of the refrigerated bottled drinks have prices listed, though that was also true of the two other small food businesses in Connecticut I visited today. Maybe it's a local thing. Their dry goods are pretty unoriginal--simply what you would find in any grocery store, but much more expensive. I would say that this place might work for those who live nearby and want to get some food quickly, but there is another small market just few blocks away.
