Might as well throw my two cents in because there is so much hype around this place. Think upper manhattan crowd with subpar food. I understand that French cuisine runs at high prices, which isn't where my 2 stars are generating from. I ordered a beet salad and the French onion soup. The beet salad was small and extremely boring. Could be made at home with better quality ingredients. The French onion soup was extremely salty and tasted canned.. So sad I know. Overall my check for those two items came to 40$ without tip. My friend ordered steak and frites, he couldn't eat it after 4 bites due to the saltiness. Not. Worth. It.
