Our wait for a table at Bar was an hour long, roughly twice the length we were told to expect to wait. You'd think this was the start of a bad review. However, the staff at Bar managed our wait with expert customer service. The hostess was doing everything she could (without being rude) to get customers who were done eating and had already paid out of their chairs. We could see her making the effort to get us seated, making the wait less annoying. I figured the long wait was a good sign that this many people couldn't be wrong about the place. For once, I was right. Our table had a view of the kitchen where Bar's pizzas are made. We had a very good view of the cooks putting together all the ingredients for the pizzas. The pizzas at Bar have very thin crusts and probably wouldn't win a pizza beauty pageant were such a ludicrous thing to exist. Do not be deceived by looks. Bar's pizza tastes amazing. The thin crust means you can just eat more of it. That's like a double word score for your stomach! We ordered a mashed potato pizza for the novelty because we have not seen evidence that this recipe has migrated to San Diego eateries. The spud pizza ended up being the best of the pizzas we ordered. I was very impressed. Our waitress was helpful, friendly and calm in the face of a crowded night at the restaurant. Our evening at Bar went smoothly thanks to staff.
