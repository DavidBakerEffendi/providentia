I just planned and celebrated a good friends bachelor party here. The staff and management were so amazing. Ridiculously accommodating and above and beyond hospitable. The venue is fantastic - very tasteful and modern. They prepared a whiskey tasting menu for us and it was so well put together and generous. The food is delicious too! Would Â look for any excuse to go back here - romantic dinner, after-work drinks, catchup with friends,etc. can't say enough good things!
