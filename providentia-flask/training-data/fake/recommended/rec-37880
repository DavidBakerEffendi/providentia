Absolutely fantastic little cafe. I have been here several times, and never left a bit unsatisfied. I can't stress how much I disagree with the negative reviews on here about Ants Pants, because I have had Â consistently excellent meals here. I think it's pretty clear that a lot of the people who are writing negative reviews of this place are like those kids in school you knew who "loved that band before they were big" and now they don't like them because they have a song on the radio. If you loved Ants Pants once, shouldn't you be happy they are having success? Yes, they are busy, and yes, it sometimes takes a while to get a spot. But how can you hold that against them? If you are too cool (read: hipster) to continue to like a place once it's gotten its due recognition, that's your own damn fault and not Ants Pants'. Just plan ahead next time and arrive earlier. Or wait in line like the rest of us. What impresses me, beyond the obviously great food, is the service. Even though Ants Pants is tiny and often crowded, the waitstaff is always attentive and really nice. The vibe of the cafe really is that of a neighborhoody kind of place where you feel like you know everyone there, even if you don't. And the food. Wow, the food. Even if you aren't looking to stuff yourself, you pretty much have to order the sweet potato chips, which are amazing. And contrary to what was said below, I have never felt that they were too soggy or soft.... They are always cooked just right and incredibly tasty. I recommend their scrambles, as they always seem to have some neat combos. All in all, this is a wonderful place to grab some breakfast. It's not particularly expensive (which is good, because it's cash-only), and you will get consistently great food. Ants Pants has become a staple for the periodic visits that I make to Philly.
