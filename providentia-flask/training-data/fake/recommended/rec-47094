Sabrina's lived up to it's reputation! We went on a Thursday morning in July for brunch. No line, no waiting. Staff was friendly, clean bathrooms, creative food. My husband got the salmon burger with sweet potato fries, I ordered the apple cheddar omelet with fresh fruit. I would love to go again, because we had a hard time choosing from all the interesting menu options. Lots of unique daily specials.
