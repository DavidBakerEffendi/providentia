I came here with a friend a couple of times. Their food is pretty good and their service is decent. The food comes out rather quickly so you don't have to wait around all day. Brunch? Sounds good! Never disappointed. The bathrooms are kinda weird in that the sink is communal outside, so you can be as judgmental as you want when someone walks out and doesn't wash their hands in the sink. I do like the bread they give you, warm and yummy. I do like the selection of their menu, you'll never go hungry again! plus its open 24/7, u can't hate that, well on weekends that is.
