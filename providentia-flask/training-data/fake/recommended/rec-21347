Liked it very much.  Blueberry pie with whipped cream was stellar as was the entire dessert menu.  It was so good - oooh I'm dreaming about the crust right now with the freshest most succulent blueberries - that I ate two of them.  I've never ever done that in a restaurant before. Great space & friendly staff.   They were very also very accommodating of our regal pooch who enjoyed an al fresco burger cooked to his exacting standards.   Adding outdoor seating would be a very big plus to the space.
