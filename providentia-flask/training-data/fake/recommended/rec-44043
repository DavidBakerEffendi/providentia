I've been eating here for years so I decided it's time to post a review. From the friendly staff who always have a smile on their face, to the delicious lunch specials that are always consistently great, this place is one of my favorites. Food is served very quickly here, so if you're short on time for lunch this is the perfect spot. I've been in and out in a half hour when I've had to rush back to work for meetings etc. I love the basil chicken, and because I like things spicy, I always ask for chopped Thai green chilis on the side, which they are always happy to provide free of charge. Little things too, like leaving a water pitcher on your table so you never have to wait for a refill, why doesn't everyone do that? Anyway definitely give this place a try, you won't be disappointed.
