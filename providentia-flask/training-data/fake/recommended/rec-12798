This is my first review, but I've always been a foodie--just never thought about reviewing.  Anyways, I went to try this place out with a group of friends after hearing such great things from our Cali friend.  We waited for so long, but that's expected because it's opening day and my group had 12 people.  We split into two tables.  At first, I was skeptical because, hey, how great can a burger be?  But once I took my first bite into my Truffle Burger, I fell in love.  The Garlic Aioli sauce is my favorite and if you get fries/onion rings like we did, GET that sauce!
