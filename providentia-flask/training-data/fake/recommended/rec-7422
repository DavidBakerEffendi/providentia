Nam Nam. One word that is said twice has the same appeal to me as Mahi-Mahi, Couscous and the famous saying about New York City. "The city so nice, they named it twice". This is what I was feeling as I took a bit of my Classic Banh Mi. This is a new spot that just opened up in "East" Wiliamsburg. It's good to have a Banh Mi spot in every neighborhood I go to. The place is very welcoming and with a "feel at home" vibe. There is seating outside if you prefer to smoke or people watch while you eat. Every new place I go to get a Banh Mi, I always go for the classic. I think about if they can't get the classic right. What about all the other sandwiches? I was proven wrong. The bread was warm and toasty and the sandwich was filled with thick cuts of meat. I love how they use pate spread so each bite has some in it. I was really satisfied with the sandwich. For the price of $5 you are seriously stuffed. Too bad I don't live in the area. This will definitely be one of my stops whenever i'm in the area. They have Bubble Tea...
