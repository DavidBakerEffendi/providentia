Umm... what up Serbia! The restaurant was a little quiet when my party entered around 8:30, but an hour later, rockin -- live music, dancing on chairs, suddenly you find yourself snapping and clapping. A transportive experience. I would advocate starting with the traditional bread with "creamy spread", which is like a better, softer version of a bagel & cc, and then move on to some meats. Salads are surprisingly tasty too. If possible, save room for a crepe. Â  Great for groups since they take reservations. A great escape on a cold night.
