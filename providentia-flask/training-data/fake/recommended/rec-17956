One of my favorite places in St. George, oh heck, in the world!  I LOVE this place. The tacos are delicious and stuffed with meat and an unbelievably cheap price.  I can eat three tacos with nopales cactus (one of my favorite things in the world) and be stuffed for less than $10.  On the weekends go for the consome de chivo (goat soup) a little pricey at about $10 but worth every penny.  The stuff is to die for.
