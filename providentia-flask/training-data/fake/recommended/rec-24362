I'm usually a huge fan of The Meatball Shop, but what drove it from a 4 star restaurant to 3-stars is their consistency.  There are times when they hit it out of the ballpark with their risotto and perfectly cooked meatballs.  Then there are times when the meatball are lukewarm and and just doesn't quite hit the spot.  Its still a great establishment, and i do love the rustic/hipster feel of the place.   My favorite meatball is definitely the spicy pork with spicy meat sauce!!!!  Put that on top of some al dente pasta and you got yourself a winner.  Can't go wrong with the simple salad (something about arugula and green apples that just works!)  Their risotto menu changes day to day so keep that in mind when you do order it.  I've had it when it was a solid 9 and when it was a weak 3.  I like to go and experiment with something new everytime I go.  Its part of the fun and what makes The Meatball Shop unique.  Please do come try if out for yourself if you've never been!
