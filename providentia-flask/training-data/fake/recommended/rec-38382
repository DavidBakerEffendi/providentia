Woodbridge Deli should really kick themselves in the ass. What is great food without great service? For the most part the ladies that pick up the phone are rude and nasty. They almost seem annoyed taking your order. In fact, we should be the ones annoyed when placed on a 15 minute hold, but that's the least of our problems at this place. My company and I have had something wrong with our order almost every time. They either charge us double, decide to forget any condiments or toppings we ask for, or flat out forget to place our order all together. When you call to complain about the things they messed up on they have nothing worthy to actually say. "I'm sorry" only works the first time. After the 20th time it kind of gets old. Not that we need a discount or a free meal, but for continued guests you would think they could comp something!! They have absolutely the worse service I have ever witnessed, and its a damn shame because they really do have good food. But I am tired of not getting exactly what I order. What exhausts me most is their ability to not give a shit. Thank you Woodbridge Deli, we will take our stomachs to Roosevelts.
