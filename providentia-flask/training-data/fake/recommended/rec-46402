What a cute little place that's always packed during weekend brunch!! Went here twice on sunday... and told that the wait is at least an hour. ohhh no! we were hungry.. so we went to other place. Finally had a chance to eat here for lunch on weekday.. and we got lucky we were seated immediately! score!! i had the curried chicken salad.. and yummmm it's delicious!! I actually went back the following week with another friend to have dinner there.. and guess what i ordered... YUP curried chicken salad again!! the salad has this crunchy, sweet with some spice hint to it. delicious! I will definitely go back here again!!
