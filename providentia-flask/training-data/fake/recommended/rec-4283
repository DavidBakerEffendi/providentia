One of my favorite spots in the city! Who knew a hotdog restaurant could make me come back over and over again? The owner said he wanted to provide a full meal with fresh ingredients at an affordable price and oh boy did he do that and more! All the ingredients he tops on the hot dogs are fresh and the buns are brought in fresh daily. Â A full meal (hot dog, amazing fries and a drink) will cost you around $8. They have hot dog staples such as the Texas Tommy (chile, cheese, deliciousness) and the Chicago. The owner also has a special every month where he creates his own masterful combination, which turns out surprisingly well! One more plug, it is open until 4am on Fridays and Saturdays! Have a late night craving? Go to Underdogs.
