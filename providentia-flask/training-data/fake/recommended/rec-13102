They had a really good lunch deal that consists of 2 appetizers and 1 entree that ranged from $7-$9. The food is okay and seemed to be more Americanized Thai food. I ordered the drunken noodle with beef and it wasn't spicy even though the dish on the menu says spicy. One of my friends got this pumpkin curry with shrimp dish that she said was really good, which I would like to try if I come back again.
