If you grew up in the New York metro area during the 50s and 60s - and miss your local Italian restaurant - by all means visit Benito One. The food is excellent, and the service superb. The produce used in the bruschetta and salads is fresh, and the home-made pasta dishes are great. The afternoon maitre d', Joe, will take good care of you!
