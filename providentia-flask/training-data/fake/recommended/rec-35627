Russet is a great BYOB.  I came here for restaurant week and was not disappointed.   The ingredients were super fresh, the flavors were very well balanced on the pork shoulder, and the desserts were divine.  I deducted one star for the appetizers on the restaurant week menu being a little underwhelming (the beets and lomo could were good but nothing special).  Service was attentive and not fussy.  The ambiance is on the more romantic side, so this would be a great date place.  In fact, I'm pretty sure the guy sitting behind me was a medical student attempting to woo a pretty gal with trout, wine, and talk of "antibiotics."  If I had to guess, he got lucky after bringing her here. This is definitely a lovely dining establishment, and I'll be back to sample more of the rotating menu.  I wouldn't be surprised if another menu at another time would be worthy of five stars.
