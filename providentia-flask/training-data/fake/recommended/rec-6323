I had like 2 bites of my chicken tagine and already started planning when I could come back. The food quality is high, the cooking technique superb and the unique spices and flavors outstanding! I can't wait to go again. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great meal in that part of town. You can taste the love and sincerity that goes into the food. I am officially a big fan of Ponty!
