I was definitely really excited to eat here, and my friend from college parents had took us out to eat. Just from hearing about the restaurant I knew it was totally chocolate themed so I was really excited to see the menu. It was packed on a Friday and we obviously should have made reservations, but instead we walked around for 45 minutes and waited for a table. Anyway, I wasn't impressed with the actual dinner menu as far as the chocolate theme went. I was expecting it to be more incorporated but don't get me wrong at all, the food was absolutely delicious. The mac and cheese was literally the best I ever had and my friends dad ordered at least 3 chocolate beers which I'm assuming were really good. The dessert was amazing too, pretty pricey but the chocolate is definitely the best and everything was perfect. I would recommend going if you are in the mood for dessert more so then dinner. I'd definitely go back though.
