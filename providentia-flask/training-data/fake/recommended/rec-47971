Everything was SO delicious. We both got the specials. I had lobster with and slightly spicy tomato sauce, and my boyfriend had the veal Osso bucco. Both fantastic and fairly priced. I HIGHLY recommend finishing your meal with the limoncello and/or the chocolate mouse. The wait staff was perfectly attentive and the atmosphere was lovely and intimate.
