Some famous places live up to the hype and are worth the wait - this is one of those places.   Taking crisp and somewhat burnt (which I like) to a whole new level, this may be the best pizza I have ever enjoyed.  We did not have a long time to wait, so we did takeaway. If I ever return to New Haven, this will be on the "must go" list.
