Scared to death while ordering.... ... this is it.  The experience. Thanks for such a lovely, heart clogging, stunning health experience. I think I saw demons and angels for about 20 hours.  I also had a few other local shops to make sure I was getting the best before hitting Pat's, so I might have been hallucinating at that point.
