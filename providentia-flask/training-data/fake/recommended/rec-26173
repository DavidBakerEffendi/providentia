We were totally messed up because of their bad service. We arrived there after midnight yesterday I can't remember exact time. We waited about half an hour, and it was not bad because we knew it was rushed time. I had a flight schedule so I had to be  hurried. After we were seated, the meal was okay, but the service made us fully uncomfortable. We sat around the restroom but one guy told me that I had to use another one in down stairs, but he didn't explain why. That's uncomfortable. The servers didn't see if the customers need something at all. They just served food with frowned faces. That's it. Some customers had to be waited 20 minutes for asking just a glass of water.  Ridiculously, they put tips about 18% automatically without any notices or any explains. Anyway, we are not gonna visit that place again.
