One of my all time favorite restaurants.  I LOVE their shepherd salad, with or without chicken, and the mixed grill is always superb.  If you can wait up to 20 minutes all of their fresh fish is terrific too.  Call ahead on weekends. Bring your own bottle (two liquor stores on Beverwyck Road, close by) and enjoy a superb meal.
