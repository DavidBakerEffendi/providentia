So I got the number from a good friend and my fiance and I went there for a try.  I can say its not the best food I've ever had but just the ambience made the food really good.  My favorites were the uni croquette, fresh oysters and we the pork chop thing.  Since my fiance didn't want to get the tasting menu so I ended up ordering a few items from the tasting menu so that I would be able to try all the best stuff.  Don't get the fruit ice basket/Vegetable Fondue thing, its really not worth your money.   Overall it's a great place to bring a date and impress him/her :) These were what we ordered: Vegetable Fondue - its really not worth it!!!! Uni Croquette - AWESOME STUFF Beef Tartar - it was ok Washu mini burger - it was ok Jamon Cold cuts - my Fiance said it was the best, it reminded him of what he ate in Europe during his last trip Foie Gras Soba - it was really good Pork with a big bone - not sure the name but it was really really good!!
