Okay food. Nothing great really. My grilled calamari arepa came cold. I questioned it and was told "that's how we serve it". Grilled yet cold? Not even lukewarm. Then we got the bill for a table of four. And there was a forced gratuity of 18.5%. I thought that usually applied in nyc to tables of 6 or more. I questioned it. Was told "that's how we do it here". Great explanations all around right?
