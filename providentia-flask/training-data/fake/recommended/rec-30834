The best middle eastern food in all of Philadelphia. Half grocery store and half restaurant. The interior is simple with a few tables and a couple of stools right by the grill. The staff always compliments my appetite because every time I'm there I order a falafel, bitza AND the fries which are served with grilled peppers, onions and tahini. I guess nobody is as greedy as me! The best part about this place is the young lady at the register with the N.A.S(niggas ain't shit) tattoo on her cleavage lol Those of you who are complaining about their falafels being dry were probably served that way on purpose. The staff here is really cool and their "asshole radar" is finely tuned.
