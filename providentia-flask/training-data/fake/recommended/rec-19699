I visited the American retro twice during my visit to New York, each time had different results when it came to service. The first time, the waiter came up and gave us our menus, was attentive to filling up drinks and making nice small talk without being too invasive. The second time the waitress was too preoccupied with people at the bars and didn't give our menus and had to go up to order. She was rude and took a long time to get our drinks. Moving on from the service difference aside, the quantity and quality of food is brilliant for those on a budget when visiting New York City, with the chilli tots a high recommendation. Just make sure that when you do visit, the waiters/waitresses can vary in service.
