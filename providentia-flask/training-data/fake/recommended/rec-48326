Last night, a group of my friends went out to Cafe Steinhof in advance of our 20th year high school reunion (!)...we were looking for a place with great food (we had a couple of food snobs in our crew) but also a relaxed atmosphere and this place hit the spot! We LOVED our meal. I had the smoked trout salad (fabulous) and another favorite at the table was the schnitzel. The service was very friendly. We just really felt at home. If you are looking for a great place for drinks and a lovely meal with a down home vibe, look no further than Steinhof. I rarely write reviews but the night was so nice that I was compelled to. Three cheers for Steinhof!
