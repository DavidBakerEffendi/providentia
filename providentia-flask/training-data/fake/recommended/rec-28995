Order the veal sausage and veal pizza...it is out of this world!  I also stole a slice of my sister's bacon and goat cheese pizza which was also delicious!  I'm not a huge fan of polenta but the owner/manager gave it to us for free so I tried it.  It was pretty tasty.  My only regret was that I didn't get to try more toppings.  I'll definitely be going back to Mama Palma's.
