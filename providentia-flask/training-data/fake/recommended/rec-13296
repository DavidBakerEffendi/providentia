We dropped by during a down time and had an early dinner/late lunch. We expected nothing less then perfection and were not let down. I can see how Danny Meyers rose to such fame as one of the worlds greatest restauranteurs. This place is a diamond. Simple and unbelievably delicious. It is extremely hard to do food from simple humble beginnings. Needless to say they pull it off time and time again. Enjoy!
