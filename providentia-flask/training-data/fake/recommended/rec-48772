Some of the best Thai food I have ever enjoyed.  I had the lunch special for $11.  They had a small fried seafood appetizer roll that was laced in a netlike crust roll, slightly crisp and packed with flavor.  Ginger salad was done well. Red curry with chicken was exception. Highly recommend. Building exterior is a little run down and ugly, but the inside is very classy and quaint.  Will definitely come back.
