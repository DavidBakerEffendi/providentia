And an Oasis it was!! Location, location, RIGHT above the Bedford stop on the L train. I got caught in a thunderstorm. Fung Wah from Boston straight to this literal OASIS, to visit with some seriously special and long lost friends. and loco crazy good food with Aljazeera on the tube. Talk to Roberto. He is this friendly young Mexican dude who learned how to cook Middle Eastern food and will make you a kick ass cafe con leche. (no azucar for me) Freshy authentic affordable terrorist tasty food all on display. We went on the lighter side and got some sexy smoky mellowed out babaganoush and sexy yogourt and herb salad. tasty grape leaves. flat pie adorned with onion, pine nuts, and sumac. Fresh peet. Garlic sensation. I have to say I had a little wierd feeling, like regret and worrying about iraqi children, in my white tummy later digesting all this spice. but it was worth it. I'd hit up the small floursent lit OASIS again and try the beet salad and count some sheep. i am a child of the 90s so the word OASIS to me conjures up fighting Brit brothers and weed smoke but a trip here can really help a new word association. no need to search mirages of food places if you are craving the falaf you appear here in the hipsta hood.
