BRONTE BURGER!!!!!!!!!! Yep, that's the best dish on the menu.  It's served in a ciabatta split in the middle with melted cheese on top of the patty.  What makes this burger special is the sweet chili mayonnaise dressing.  Talk about beef juices getting all mixed up with that sweet, spicy, creamy concoction. YUMMERS!!!!  I usually request for a fried egg to be added to the burger and the burger comes on its own with no french fries (no spuds served at this joint), just a little sprig of salad. Other than that, most of the items in the menu are pretty solid too.  The pasta bowls (spicy sausage rigatoni and pesto spaghetti) are all delicious.  The salads are great too (roast beef salad and roast pumpkin salad). Coffee is done the (what I think is) Aussie way, where it's served up warm and not scaldingly hot. They open pretty early and the simple ciabatta with scrambled eggs etc is a great way to start the day. I love the heavy wooden benches that are inside and also the wooden bench that sits right outside the tiny restaurant's window and the tree that is planted in front of Ruby's. Service is spotty.  The servers can be a bit attitude-y and standoffish and slow.  But the food almost makes up for it and if not, you can always order it to go. Ventilation is terrible in the winter time so you'll come out of Ruby's reeking of your meal.  Summertime, they open up their window and it's so nice to just sit and hang out there for a good meal with a few friends.
