The food was the best I had in a long time.  It was hand made ravioli stuffed with seafood in a great sauce.  My girlfriend had a spinach stuffed ravioli with a citrus sauce which I would not recommend.  The meal was pricey but the atmosphere was nice and the service was good.  Not a place to go to a lot if you're on a budget or in college like myself.
