It was a nice place. The dessert creations were beauitful. The atmosphere was relaxing. But the taste was forgetable, and a little disappointing. It taste like desserts we could've order at any other Japanese restaurant. It was good, just not spectacular. The tea we order was lovely. We were expecting to have tea leaves in the pot, that could be refill later on. Turn out just a pot of tea and no more.
