El Camino Real is my favorite go-to place. Lot's of reviews about it being hit or miss so here are my suggestions to make your experience a "hit". The endless chips & salsa: Their chips are fresh and have a delightful seasoning to them. They're served with two types of salsa, one of which is a little smokey, mmm. Plus, they're endless & merely a buck per person, can't beat it! The Texas Chili: Soo yummy, chunks of meat with a cheesy topping and served with warm flour tortillas. One of my favorite dishes ever. The Mexican Corn: Woah. Now that's good corn. Tip: Cut it off the cob and mix up all the corn, cheese, and crema, makes it easier to eat and you get all of the deliciousness in every bite. Â  Other wonderful items: Fried Pickles, Pig Wings & Bourbon Pecan Pie. Enjoy!!
