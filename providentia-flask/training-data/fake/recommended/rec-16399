I would give it 3 stars, but had a weird experience here tonight and the food was a little cold. I am pretty generous with the stars so take the 2/5 as a red flag here. pros: shepherds salad hummus fresh feta cons: hair in my rice! the yogurt for the kebab tasted like vanilla ( I mentioned this to the wait staff and she said they didn't even have vanilla in the restaurant. My gf and I also asked the couples next to us and they concurred. So, 4 people, two of whom were strangers, all thought the yogurt tasted like vanilla that night...) slow wait staff prob wont come back after that, Hummus place on 2ed takes the UES crown by default.
