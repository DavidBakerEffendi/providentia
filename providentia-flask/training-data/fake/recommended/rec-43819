Duino Duende was suggested to me by a local on the street, so I thought it a nice opportunity to get away from the "downtown" part of Burlington and try something a bit Â less touristy than the stuff on the strip. DD is attached to Radio Bean, which is a cafe or bar or some such. The decor is about what you would expect from such a place -- kind-of a quasi bohemian crossed with industrial and hippy vibe. We were seated right away and I was surprised that it was not too loud (there are seats outside too, which would have been nice had I not spent the entire day outside getting eaten by mosquitos and the sun). The waitperson was friendly and I had a nice, but not great, Manhattan. I ordered the jerk chicken and it was, again, good but not superb. I am tempted to chalk this up to the fact that I am ordering jerk in Vermont, but that's not really an excuse I am comfortable with. It really needed more Scotch bonnets, and the jerk rub itself could have been a little more fresh or at least fresher tasting (I did go at the end of the night, however). The portion was sized appropriately but my companions had smaller portion sizes for about the same price in meal (I think one was an astoundingly small falafel). The price was pretty good, it wasn't super-cheap but it is definitely affordable for a night out. There are lots of veggie options, so that is nice. And the menu seems to be a little on the adventurous side, which is also nice. It's definitely worth checking out.
