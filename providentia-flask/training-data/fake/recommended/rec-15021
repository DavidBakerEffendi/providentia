i wish i could give this 3.5 stars, so i'll just stick with three.  but i bet if you 1) eat meat/fish/dairy and/or 2) are rich, this would be a 4 or maybe even 5 stars restaurant.  a party of nine went here last night for my brother's birthday. i was a little concerned because my sister and i are both vegan and there was nothing vegan on the menu, not surprisingly, but i wanted to celebrate my brother's birthday without burdening the cooks.  i figured most homemade pastas have egg in them, so we just told our server to ask the cook to make us anything they could.  she was extremely accommodating and didn't make us feel like assholes about it--very different than my experience at monsu. we ended up getting the artichoke appetizer without the aoli, and two pasta/marinara/veggie dishes. both simple but pretty tasty.  kinda a bummer you have to pay for olive oil, and they're a little stingy about their bread.  my food was pricey for just vegetables/pasta, but i understand that you're paying for the ~~ambiance~~ more than the food.  overall, it was a nice night, especially because the servers are very sweet and good at what they do.
