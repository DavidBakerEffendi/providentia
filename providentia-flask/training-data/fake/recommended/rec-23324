Came here for restaurant week, the food tasted alright but loved the service and thought the restaurant was so cute! I think it came with 5 courses, unfortunately my salmon tasted fishy and one of the pasta dishes tasted like it was made with canned sauce. My husbands dishes, lamb and octopus appetizer seemed to taste much better. The tiramisu was amazing though, and the portions are huge!
