I had a rather uneven experience here, but I definitely liked it enough to return! A group of friends stopped by for happy hour right when the bar opened at 4pm. The doors were wide open, but the staff was still in their meeting. After about ten minutes, they told us to sit down and they would help us when they were through. I found it a bit odd that a restaurant would serve customers so much later than they officially open, but maybe they don't generally have people show up on time. Our first waitress didn't seem interested to help us. Like, at all. So we were thrilled when a different waiter came over and patiently explained all the $7 wines on the happy hour menu. (The regular wine list is in a tabbed binder and seems intimidating.) He even explained the type of soil that the grapes grow in without sounding condescending or bored. We all ended up trying different types (and liked them all). We also tried the FREE sherry, which wasn't as big a hit since it has a particularly potent taste. We ordered all the discounted bar snacks. When we were there, olives, mozzarella balls, and duck fat bruschetta were on special. They were all delicious, but beware, vegetarians--the mozz is in meat sauce, which is not labeled on the menu. There isn't a lot of other food on the menu, so we went elsewhere for dinner. All in all, I loved the decor and the neighborhood, and I especially loved getting a fancy wine experience with a happy hour discount, but there were a few bumps in the road.
