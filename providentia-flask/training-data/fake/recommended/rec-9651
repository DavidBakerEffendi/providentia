My review is about the Halal Guys on 53rd street and 7th ave. My friends and I come here once a week between classes to get the chicken and lamb rice platter w/ white and bbq sauce. A platter is enough to share between two people! It's cheap and quick (the line is much shorter than the one on 6th ave) I do find that the rice is really bland in comparison to other halal carts (like the one on Nevins street)..so minus one star The veggies are surprisingly fresh and tasty. The amount of meat they give is based on how busy they are. I find that when the line is short they give a lot of meat..but when there's a relatively long line, they give less..it's logical I suppose. WARNING: Their hot sauce is HOT..or maybe I just don't have a tolerance for spicy food lol but it's definitely hotter than other halal carts I've ate at. But still, for $6 it's a lot of food, perfect for broke college students like me lol!
