Overall a really delicious meal. Positives: Kale paella was phenomenal. Cheesecake was very delicious. Actually tasted like cheese as opposed to a mound of sugar I liked the diversity of the tapas-style bar menu. The eggplant dish was particularly delicious, although it would be better if it were served warm instead of room temperature Lots of vegetarian-friendly options Negatives Service was a bit hit-or-miss. While friendly and helpful, one of the waiters knocked and broke a wineglass with some wine left in it and then initially charged us for the wine (although they apologetically removed it, but didn't offer a replacement). Also I'm not sure of the policy to not recommend things from the Bar menu. Temperature of the bar menu dishes. May be intentional but I think they'd taste better if served warm.
