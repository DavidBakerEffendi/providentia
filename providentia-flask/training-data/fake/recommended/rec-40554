I visited Marlow & Sons on a chilly night in mid-February.  We decided to forage in the Williamsburg area and I had heard great things about Marlow & Sons being a good "hipster" experience.  So we decided to check it out. The restaurant itself is quite cozy and small, so we were sitting very close to the people next to us.  It has a very rustic feel to it, with low tables and it's lit by flickering candles. Their food menu is pretty limited, but the choice of dishes are excellent.  The drink menu was definitely more varied (and quite dizzying in its vast number of options!).  I can't even remember specifically what we ordered (beyond a generic salmon and chicken) because it was a few months ago and their menu seems to be seasonal, but the food was quite ambrosial. Service was very friendly and we were left very content.   I would highly recommend Marlow & Sons.  it definitely met the expectations I had for it.  I would also recommend going to the top of the Wythe hotel (also in Williamsburg) after your dinner for a true "hipster" experience.
