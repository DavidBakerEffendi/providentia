I ate here twice last Friday - doubling down on lunch and happy hour beverages/snacks and was pleasantly surprised by the unique approach to Tex-Mex including some items you don't regularly see around these parts. Pros -Food - I had the carnitas burrito for lunch - which was simple, excellent pork wrapped in two soft-warm tortillas. Combined size was way less than a chipotle-style bomb, but was tasty, if a bit light considering what most Gringos think of when they want a burrito. The reason I returned at Happy Hour was to sample some of the appetizer menu items - particularly the fried pickle chips, mexican corn and pig wings - and all were amazing. The pig wing is maybe the best thing I've ever stumbled across - picture a giant chicken wing, only pork, falling off the bone. Pickle chips were predictable delicious especially with a side of special sauce. -Drink Specials - they do have a happy hour and it applied to grand effect on Friday in the fricking heat sipping $5 house margaritas. Great selection of Mexican beers, including a chilada and michilada that both need taste-testing. Â  -Outdoor seating - in the courtyard in the development across the street from the Piazza with nice wooden picnic tables. -Service - special props to the waitress for bringing a tin pie-pan full of ice water for our dog who sat beneath the picnic table at happy hour. Cons -Pricey-ish - the burrito was $10 without any sides save a little pickled salad. Come on now.
