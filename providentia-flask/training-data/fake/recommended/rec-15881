This place is a gem in Forest Hills. The location itself is perfect for meeting up with friends coming in from the city and long island. I had always been a little put off by Station House because I'm not a whiskey person but the beer selection is impressive for a whiskey bar! I came here last night with a small group for the first time after wasting money at The Flying Pig... should've just come here instead. The music selection is awesome and helped keep up the overall happy vibe of this place. It's not your average hole in the wall pub. It's got class but doesn't come with the stuck up attitude some similar places in the city have. My only hang up was that the service was a bit slow.  It took 20 minutes to bring out our food. I know it takes time to make it but at least drop by our table to check in! We ordered the Poutine which was perfect in every way. So perfect, we put in another order for them because it was devoured within minutes of arriving at our table. The pretzel with chili was tasty and dangerously addicting. The overall crowd is hip and diverse. It's my new go-to spot for the summer.  ... and even after that. This place is sure to be around for a long while!
