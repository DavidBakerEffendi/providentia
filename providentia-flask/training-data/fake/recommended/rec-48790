I was randomly looking for a thai place to eat in ues, and up Thai managed to pop up on yelp. My bf lived in Thailand for a little bit and is well acquainted with Thai food. Long story short - he loves this place, and goes so far to say that it reminds him of Thai street food. The krapowkai is his all time favorite. The ambience in the restaurant is phenomenal. Its cozy and the Turkish lamps in the dining area give the place a warm glow. The small attention to detail is apparent when they were decorating this place. The staff is very courteous as well, no complaints there.
