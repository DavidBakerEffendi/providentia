Just stumbled across this place with my buddy while I was visiting NJ. I loved this place right when I walked in and felt like I was in someones home kitchen. They pretty much greeted us with some of the best Mozzarella I've ever had. They must have seen me coming cause the Mozz in Jersey is another thing that I visit for. My buddy and I split the Chicken Cutlet sand. with arugula and tomato. Lets start with the bread...fresh italian roll was nice, chicken was perfect and they put just the right amount of balsamic and oil. We had them add mozz on the sand. which topped it all of nice. While we were enjoying the food out front the owner Frank came and brought us some of the freshly made meat sauce out with bread....this must have been what I smelt upon walking in cause it tasted like something grandma would make. This place was just awesome. Great food great people running the place. I know I'll be back for more cause I'm sitting here looking at the menu and eating some of the mozz that I brought home with me and kicking myself for not getting some of the meat sauce to take home too.
