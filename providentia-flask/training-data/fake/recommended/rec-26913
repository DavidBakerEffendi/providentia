YUM!!! What a great place to come for some delicious food in a cozy and quaint eatery. The prices were so fabulous for the quality of service and food you are getting. The service was awesome and friendly, the wine was great and...can we talk about their mushroom soup?? OMG. Ridiculous. Can't wait to come back!
