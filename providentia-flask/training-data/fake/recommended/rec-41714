By far one of the most authentic Mexican fare you can get outside of Mexico! The space is small and there always seems to be quite a wait when you choose to dine in. I have taken to showing up for take out, because if you call for a delivery you will get your feelings hurt. They rarely answer the phone and the one time we got through, our 40 minute wait for food ended up as the delivery of the wrong order! The food is just that good... so the negative mishaps of the past do not overshadow the satisfaction of the meal... I will continue to support this place... although last week (6/6/14) it appears that another Mexican option opened around the corner... wondering if they can top them... Chavela's down the block is no competition if you ask me...
