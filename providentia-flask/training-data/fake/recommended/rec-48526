Consensus... Fries were awesome. The rest of the meal... Well, let's just say we didn't go away hungry but it was beyter than ok. Mostly bar food, but we opened with a Brie appetizer the was very good. My wife thought her Portabello mushroom was good but average. My parents rueben was good excelent.  My burger?  Well, let's just say it was a little dry but probably due to ordering it medium   Altogether it is probably a great drinking place and with decent food. You won't go hungry.
