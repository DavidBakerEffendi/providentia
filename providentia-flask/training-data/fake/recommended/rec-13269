Came here this past weekend for a friend's birthday dinner. Huge party. Food was okay but the rating is dented by the rude and unprofessional service. I ordered the sesame tofu and chicken pumpkin curry. Sesame tofu was tasty. Slice of tofu with a black and white sesame crust, crispy and crunchy. Sweet and sour sauce accompanied the tofu with crushed peanuts. The chicken pumpkin curry was tasty but after a couple of bites, became much too sweet. Mentioned in a couple of other reviews too. I also tasted a friend's pad thai and it was similarly too sweet so it seems like it's pervasive in the offerings. Cool it kids, not trying to get diabetes (yet, I have too many bakeries to eat through). I expected more heat from the curry too. We felt extremely rushed throughout the meal. Service was very quick to clean and clear our plates after we took our last bites. After we paid the check, our server, unabashedly and with no shame, asked us to leave. Smart of them to ask after we gave the tip but so much for courtesy and good customer service. Mediocre food (unless you really have a hankering for overly sweet Thai food) and poor service. Salvaged by good looking people and cute decor.
