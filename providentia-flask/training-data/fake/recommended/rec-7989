I've never been here for a show, so I'm just rating this based on the bar/their food. Cool, hipster-ish atmosphere.  Good bar, and plenty of places to sit.  Never felt cramped on days that I went there.  The food I've had there has been pretty good; I had a root vegetable stew that was really good during a weekend afternoon, and some fries with drinks another time -- both were tasty and reasonably priced. Again, I can't judge it for its shows, but as a bar, it's a good place.
