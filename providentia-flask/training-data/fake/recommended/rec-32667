Considered how stingy I am with my Yelp stars, this place well earned them.  Decor:  Dark, romantic.  Service:  friendly bartender and waitress.  Food:  excellent green peppers, potato gravas, huevos, and squid in ink w/ rice.  Good sangria.  What I liked about the tapas is they're not the usual suspects.   I'd definitely go back but do not recommend for large groups.  About 30min wait for a table for 2 on a Friday night around 8pm (probably a longer wait if it weren't for the presidential debate)
