Been to this place twice and it keeps me wanting more. The mussels, anything chorizo, and croquetas are delicious. Service has always been pretty good and the beer selection is what is to be expected of a Spanish place (Estrella). Only had the Sangria once and that was during happy hour (pitcher seemed watered downed). I must come on a Thursday or Saturday - I believe they have flamenco dancing.
