This restaurant would have had all 5 glorious stars, and then some, if it weren't for a few things which I'll mention up front:  Cash only kinda sucks if you're not prepared... I should have done my research--luckily there was an ATM nearby.  We were seated outside which was nice, but at the end of the night I felt like the waiters had forgotten about us completely since we were the last people out there.  Once we flagged our gal down, she then gave us the wrong bill.  Lastly--if you're going to go, head there suuuper early and put your name in for a table and then plan to sit somewhere else and sip cocktails (which is always nice...), that way you're not caught off guard from the wait.  Overall--these things aren't terrible, but they're good to know before dining here. That being said, the food is faaaaaaaaaaaaaaantastic.  Really. Ridiculously. Fantastic.  Love a good BYO, and this place was no exception.  The garlic butter they give you is so good I could eat it with a spoon.  I had the Prosciutto Wrapped Chicken Breast, nom nom nom.  My friends both had the Scallops, and I didn't taste them but my one friend's plate was licked clean so I can't image she was disappointed in any way.   I highly recommend this place for a date or a small dinner party, the seating is limited so a large party would probably wait a long, long time for a table.  This place is a must-try!
