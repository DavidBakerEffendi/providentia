We took advantage of a Blackboard Eats coupon and were here for a late Sunday lunch. Place was pretty empty and we had no problems getting seated. Everyone was really nice - and our waitress was super helpful in picking our wine and she let us try a few before we settled on our selection. the menu is pretty straightforward and simple; we started with the rubirosa salad and we decided to share a pizza (i don't remember the dimensions but even the smaller size is pretty large pizza - so good value!). We did a half-and-half with vodka sauce and pesto and it was pretty good - although we both thought the vodka sauce was better. Only comment would be that the pizza was a little heavy on the sauce, so it was a teeny bit "drippy". the food here was pretty good - but not lifechanging - but the extra star goes for the ambience and friendly staff. definitely worth trying.
