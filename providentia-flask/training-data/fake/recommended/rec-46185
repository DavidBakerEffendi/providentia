I was introduced to this restaurant by a friend at work. A few of us has planned to go sit outside and have beers. She was negative about Geronimo, my go-to outside drinking spot. I thought she was mad. When I looked at Kelly's I thought, "It will be loud and dirty outside. Such a busy intersection!" I was wrong. In the summer, the outside terrace is surrounded by plants and as long as you don't sit right on the Temple Street side, you actually do feel like you are in a park. You can hear the traffic, but you don't feel that you are downtown. I actually had lunch inside for the first time yesterday and it was also really nice. Modern pub-like atmosphere. Lots of wood but no football shirts on the wall. Beyond that, there's the menu (recently redone) which is basic sandwiches made a little funky, my favorite kind of lunch. I had an awesome cajun chicken sandwich. My wife loved her chicken salad sandwich with mozzerella and yucca fries. I was sorely tempted by the crab cake sliders. Actually the whole menu sounded good. Nothing overly exotic, but nothing boring. The beer selection is also great. They did get rid of my Lake Placid beer, but Â there are lots and lots of local beers you've never heard of to try, which is fun. I'm not sure there's much to complain about. It's right next door to the Criterion so it's nice for a lunch and a movie or a beer and snacks after a movie.
