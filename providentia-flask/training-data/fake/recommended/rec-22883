Great restaurant located in the Times Sq. area. Initially made a reservation for 5, but they were willing to accomodate 2 extra people if they showed up. The lighting was dim and it was noisy. Lots of people for a weeknight. Your best bet is to come here with at least 3 people. Family style food. In the end, there were only 5 of us dining so we ordered two entrees. We ordered the fettuccine alfredo and chicken parm. The alfredo was rich and creamy. The chicken parm was made perfectly: thin chicken cutlets with a reasonable amount of breading. Only downside was that the bread that we were served was inconsisten. For me, it was borderline stale, but my other friends really enjoyed it. Some pieces were very crunchy while others were a bit softer. Since we ordered two dishes, the total came up around $60 for 5 people.
