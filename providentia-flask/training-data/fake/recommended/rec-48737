Wow, there sure are a lot of complainers for this place. I have no idea where they ate. My wife and I went to Lombardi's and it was truly superior. Ok, fine, we're tourists. Guilty. But I've had Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn bridge and it was crap compared to this. We had a small pie with pepperoni and meatballs. Both were perfect. The sauce was amazing. The crust and cheese couldn't have been better. It single-handedly redeemed New York style pizza for me, which I thought was nothing special until now. And yes it was more expensive and cash only. Don't care. Worth it. Plus it was Friday night at 8 PM and we only waited ten minutes for a table. Good service, they seemed busy but were attentive. Walking through the kitchen was fun too! Thanks Lombardi's, you really made our trip.
