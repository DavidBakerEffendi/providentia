Ok so my friend's birthday was tonight and everything was great BUT they forgot the candle.  Or maybe we did, not sure because the wine based cocktail I had , um and then another, was really good. It was an aperoll and proseco drink.  I had the calamari special which was excellent.  Fire roasted calamari over a pepper paste.  Excellent andnot too well done,  very tender. Then on to the chicken under brick which was quite good. It was succulent.  Really. Whole branzino was a hit and someone got the stripped bass.   The wait staff was attentive and really nice, but really so young. I mean not one of them had ever even heard o the Poseidon Adventure! Don't ask.  It was the aperol.   There's got to be a morning after....
