This place is located on Court St. in a nice area where all the prisoners are lol. So my boy has been trying to get me to come here for months now. He was saying how it's the best and I would love it yada yada. It's good not the best in my palates op. The ambiance is nice and the people are sorta friendly. They were scooping up my plate to clean before I put my fork down. I would prob return bit it won't be for a while.
