I've had lunch on two different occasions at Balthazar and I loved it.  This is definitely one of the better restaurants in NYC.  The staff is very attentive and they know the menu like the back of their hand.  The food is top notch and ambiance and environment is lively and energetic.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the NYC/ Tri State area.
