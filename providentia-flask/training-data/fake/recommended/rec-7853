PLEASE BE AWARE- White Dog is no longer doing the bottomless brunch drinks. However, my review is from prior to them getting rid of the special. The location is great, the décor is beautiful and the food was outstanding. Couple that with the bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary's and  it was almost perfect. Why not 5 stars - the place was beyond packed, we had reservations made well ahead of time as we were celebrating a birthday with a group of 12 people. We weren't sat until ONE HOUR after our reservation time and unfortunately we didn't get much of an apology or even acknowledgement from the hostess as to how late we were being sat. However, once we got to our table and got our drinks and food -  we were able to forget about the hour wait.  So disappointed they got rid of the bottomless drink special.  But if drink costs / specials aren't your concern - I highly recommend.
