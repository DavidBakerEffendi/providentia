My daughter had her wedding after-party at The Bahche on Aug. 9, and we can't say enough good things about Corina (the events manager), the staff (who are all extremely helpful and friendly), the food (so delicious it disappeared very quickly), and the venue (perfect for dancing inside and relaxing outside). Corina was solicitous and helpful throughout the process and couldn't do enough to make sure everything was perfect. So, we highly recommend The Bahche if you're thinking of a venue for a party in Brooklyn where you want to dance and listen to amplified music or, as in our case, just great loud music from bands with a lot of horns and drums! Bravo, Bahche! Well done!
