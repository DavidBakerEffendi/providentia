I've never been impressed with food from a place that is actually a bar masquerading as a restaurant.   The food was greasy and the 10oz Rib Eye that I ordered with Shrimp Scampi was a tad overcooked when I ordered it rare.  The waitress was bouncy, friendly and efficient.  Not my choice but the kids seemed to enjoy it.
