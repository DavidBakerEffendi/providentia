We enjoyed a very delicious lunch here on our way through the charming borough of Quechee. I opted for the fried fish plate, and was happy with the tender and crispy morsels that arrived. The fish was served with a vinegar based slaw and side of roasted potatoes, and came atop a nice amount of tartar sauce. We also shared the chowder, which was wonderful. The drink of the day was a pink lemonade, and was refreshing and not overly sweet. A companion complained that her chicken was dry and overcooked, but my lunch was delicious. Good service too...quick and friendly.
