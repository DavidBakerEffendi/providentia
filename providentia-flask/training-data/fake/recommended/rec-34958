We met the owner of Montana's Trail House at the Out In The Streets Music & Arts Festival as well as their grand opening during Bushwick Open Studios. We liked it. I'm from down South and the appropriation of middle of nowhere culture has been around for years in many restaurants when I was a kid. So it didn't really bother me much. There is this review in the New York Observer which is incredibly offensive to small businesses as well as the South. They gave the place 0 stars and the review felt kind of cold, a little cruel, as well as snobbish. Majority of the people in the comments section are in agreement that the review is unfair. If you have any free time this weekend, please check out Montana's Trail House in Bushwick. The owner means well and his new business is giving people jobs! What else can I say? Also their banana bread s'mores is amazin ya'll!!
