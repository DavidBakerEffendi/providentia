A 25 minute wait for a no reservation weekend dinner. The first dining area was well lit and looked cramped with as many tables for 4 as they could fit . I was seated near the more dimly lit back section with many cramped tables for 2. Thank goodness for the variety in the bread box to perk up the night! The breaded shrimp was very peppery but otherwise unremarkable. I would not go for the unlimited pasta as it was always a bit overcooked and only mediocre. The desserts were also only OK. Unfortunately the atmosphere and attentive service was the only upside to this night.
