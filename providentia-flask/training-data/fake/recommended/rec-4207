I really would like to give this place 2.5 stars.  Dinner was disappointing - the 1000-layer bread is very tasty, but the entrees were a little bland.  I later went back for the lunch special though and that was satisfying and exceeded my then-lowered expectations.  For under $9, I got a small salad and coconut stir fry with brown rice.
