The main dishes were good, but service was rude and super slow. One waiter was having a bad day and took it out on us. They had 3 waiters.. a woman, tall guy, and shorter guy. The tall guy was professional and courteous. The shorter guy came to our table to take the order. He asked if we had any questions about the menu. I said "yes" and he dropped his shoulders and sighed out loud several times. What the heck? I had young kids with me and asked if they had kids size burrito and if a particular dish was shredded meat or chunks of meat. Those are questions that got him upset? If it wasn't for my kids being with me, I would've walked out immediately. The taller waiter (who was younger) should teach the shorter waiter how to be a professional waiter. The shorter waiter also seemed angry when I asked for a 2nd nacho refill. When he placed it on the table, I thanked him, but he just looked at me and walked away. The shorter waiter soften up a little when it was time for the check. Too late buddy!  I tipped 15% because of the taller waiter's service, otherwise it would've been much lower. The restaurant was crowded, but this is not the only Mexican restaurant in NJ.  I will never be back. Be prepared to wait 30-40 minutes for you dishes to come out.  If you're hungry, you will go through 2-3 rounds of the nachos quickly before the food comes. Salsa was mediocre and guacamole was bad.
