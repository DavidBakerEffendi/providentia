As soon as you walk in this place, you know it is something special. The food is amazing here. The wine selection is good. The aroma of the cheese and spanish tapas is truly captivating. One of my favorite tapas places. Â Patatas Bravas are really good. The shrimp tapas is so good. The whole menu is appetizing.
