Great tacos, pretty good prices on food (less good on drinks), but disinterested staff. Overall a pretty good taqueria that competes with nearby Gueros and Taqueria de los Muertos for my business. It's a little more upscale than the other two, but it has higher prices too. However, it has a pretty wide variety of food (for a taqueria) including some pretty delicious breakfast offerings, flautas, dips / appetizers, and a full bar. It's a rather flexible restaurant - equally good at a few tacos for a cheap and filling dinner or a casual date place with reasonably good cocktails. However, it doesn't get the fifth start because it doesn't do enough to distinguish itself from its competitors.
