Have to say I was singularly unimpressed.  The wine list was good, but everything we ordered was out.   Oh it was the last one or oh she just finished that.  There is a good list of juices on the menu, but they were out of all but cranberry.  On to the main course..they were out of the first choice.  They were out of black tea and brought green instead thinking we would not notice.  The charcutrie and cheese plate were fine, but really this is overrated and 'well it is friday'was not a great excuse.
