Had a couple friends from out of town visiting and really wanted to go to Little Italy.  We came here for lunch on a Saturday.  It was busy but there was no wait. They had a lunch menu which basically consisted of the same items as the dinner menu but in smaller portions.  While the portions are smaller, they are still plenty big! The food was delicious! We couldn't get enough of it and because it was so good kept eating until we felt like we were going to burst. The staff was very friendly & the service was quick. I have no complaints I will definitely come back here next time I want to come to Little Italy
