I just adore Pierre Loti Midtown. The staff has mastered the art of being attentive, without being intrusive. They are courteous, well-informed, and thoughtful. Their recommendations for wine pairings are always good. The food is fresh, simple, and plentiful. The filet mignon makes me weak at the knees.
