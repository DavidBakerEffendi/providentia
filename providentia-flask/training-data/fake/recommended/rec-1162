Tried this place out on new years day. I liked their beer list and the variety of food. My boyfriend tried the pulled pork sandwich, which he has mentioned several time since then. I definitely plan on trying this next time we go. I had the egg, potato, and broccoli rabe sandwich which was GIGANTIC (definitely a good thing--I was able to take half home for lunch the following day). If sardines are your thing, they have $2 sardine sandwich. The only downside for me was the location...the surrounding area seemed a bit sketchy (then again, it was dark out, so I could be wrong).
