This place is a "must" if you're doing a large group dinner.  We ordered the Bo Ssam Dinner (Pork Shoulder) and it did not disappoint in quality or quantity. We were 4 guys and 4 girls, and everyone was HUNGRY (like Texas Hungry, not NY Hungry).  I was concerned that it wouldn't be enough food, but we had some left over if you can believe it.   The atmosphere is great because it's bench seating, and the attire is casual, so you can really stretch out and have a great time.  No frou frou BS here. Service was also top notch, very attentive to every request. Going back with a group soon!
