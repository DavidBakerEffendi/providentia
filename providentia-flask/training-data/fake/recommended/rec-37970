One of Montclair's hidden treasures.  Our whole family loves this warm, unpretentious restaurant and are always happy eating and simply being there.  As mentioned in other reviews, Joey, the owner, is a lovely person and his genuineness is expressed both in the atmosphere and the food he makes. Joey's is the exact opposite of the sleek, trendy Thai restaurants of the kind now taking over in NYC, and the food is excellent.  I'm partial to the chicken basil, which can be wickedly hot, and due to that partiality tend to miss out on much of the menu myself.  Joey tends to use a lot of eggplant and bamboo shoot in his vegetable mixture; some of my children tend to work around that, but I like it.  Soups and appetizers are superb.  Others in my group love the duck and fish basil, and the green and jungle curries.
