Good drinks, pleasant atmosphere, lovely backyard. The food is meh. My burger was dry and the sampler tasted like a bunch of prepackaged frozen food dipped in a fryer. The grilled chicken and goat cheese with avocado sandwich would have been better if the focaccia was warm. While I wouldn't order food here, I'd definitely stop by for a beer or three again.
