OK THIS IS MY FAVORITE PLACE IN THE WORLD. French fries are my FAVORITE food and this place takes them to a whole new level.  It is small.  There is hardly any seating.  There is a line out the door around 1am.  BUT IT IS WORTH IT. Their fries are thick cut and fried right in front of you.  Their sauce menu is extensive.  My favorites are the smoked eggplant, mango chutney, and truffle aioli.  The fries are served burning hot in a cone, and if you are lucky enough to get a table (it is a rarity) they have holes for you to place them in! I can not end a night in the city without a trip to Pommes Frites.  You will meet some characters.  You will eat good food.  There really is no atmosphere.  You don't need one.  THE FRIES ARE THAT GOOD. What are you waiting for?! Seriously.
