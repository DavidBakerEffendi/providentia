I walked in and just like my wife, we were skeptical.    No japanese or asian eaters?  Night club like environment?   Ramen without fish cake, seaweed or bamboo shoots?  This isn't a ramen place catered to foodies.   This place is a date place for hipsters and non-asians. If you want to get a ramen experience in the US, come to Torrance, CA.   Our worst is is still better than this place (great ramen, anal cooks,  old/young asian and non asian customers, no club experience).
