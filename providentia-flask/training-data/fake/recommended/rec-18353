The food we received was all delicious, and thoughtfully put together. But I'm not sure we'll be returning, because it felt like we paid quite a lot of money for good ideas, and not very much food. We shared the Bronzino (a fish dish for two), and there wasn't a whole lot of Bronzino to share. Presentation and waitstaff were good but very harried. If you're looking for a restaurant with a bustling atmosphere, and going with a lot of wealthy friends, this is a good spot. For an intimate dinner for two? I'd try somewhere else.
