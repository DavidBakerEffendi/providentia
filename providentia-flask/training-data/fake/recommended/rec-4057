Very fresh, very clean and disease (burns hole) free lobsters.  I bought a 1-3/4 for around $14, had it killed (but not cleaned) and sectioned the parts in a sauté pan  of Heineken and organic bacon grease.  It was perfectly red and the meat was absolutely sweet and briny.  I look forward to trying their lobster roll.
