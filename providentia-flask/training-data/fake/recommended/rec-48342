went back for brunch and was pretty disappointed.  the wait was an hour, so we took a few walks around the block, eventually got called and just waited more.  service is still stellar but in general i just feel like i threw my money away. very simple, but if you know how to cook breakfast yourself- just stay at home.  $6 for a single sausage also is just ridiculous.  no matter how posh the pig was - i need more then that. thinking their dinner menu is just better. might be back, might not.
