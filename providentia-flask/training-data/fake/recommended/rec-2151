This is a fun, lively place! They have some unique apps and really yummy entrees. My non-veg friends said the veggie wings taste like the real thing! The menu is vegetarian friendly and the service is great - so are the margaritas. It gets crowded but its a really good time. It is reasonably priced but the portions are ginormo (leftovers yay).
