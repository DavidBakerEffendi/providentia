In a word, spectacular.  My friends took me here for my birthday last week and words cannot express how mouth wateringly (is that a word?) delicious everything was.  We went with our very patient waiter's advice and did the tasting menu, which were about  8 entrees and two desserts.  There were 3 of us and it was more than enough to satisfy us.  Everything from presentation to combination of flavors were amazing and spot on.  A  couple of dishes we had were scallops risotto, tuna tartare on tempura and short rib sliders.  There were all extremely flavorful and just flat out phenomenal - best dining experience I've had in a long time.
