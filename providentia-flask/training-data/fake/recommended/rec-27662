This place is not what it used to be. First of all the sushi rolls now are kind of sloppy and skimp, they don't seem to have professional sushi chefs anymore. And they redid the whole inside with bright pastel green paint and children's chairs. You can still see the stains on the floor from the previous installations. It's kind of strange and quiet in there. They used to have a cool eastern vibe on the inside with nice booths and cool decor, it was actually pleasant to eat it. I'm not sure what happened, or why they changed it, it seems as if there was a split up between business partners or something.
