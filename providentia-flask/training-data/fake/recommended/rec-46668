My 5 stars may be premature, but the veggie wings alone, I think, are going to change my life.  After being a vegetarian for nearly 10 years, I broke down and ate anything and everything I wanted for nearly 2.  After cutting the meat out once again, I found that the only "off limits" thing I really craved were hot wings.  I would actually feel sad when I saw other people eating hot wings because I wanted to be eating hot wings, too.   Now though, I CAN eat them, guilt-free!  I really can't say enough good things about these wings.  They are unbelievably close to the real thing....they are seriously out of this world.   Aside from that, all I have to say is my John Daly was so strong I couldn't finish it, so for the drinkers of the world, you should feel that you're getting your money's worth from the bar.
