I was staying just a few blocks away from here and really bummed because the meeting I was attending had TERRIBLE TERRIBLE food. (Who serves cold cuts?!) Then I found Su Xing House, and ate there for dinner every night I was in town. Great service - super quick, very polite. and the food was amazing and totally affordably priced. I had the scallion pancake and the sesame tofu the first night.  HUGE portions of delicious food. I was bummed that I was staying in a hotel  with note place to reheat the food or I would have taken my leftovers for breakfast the next morning. I also got take out from here to bring back to my room the following night (working while eating is easier at a hotel desk than a dimly lit restaurant), and the food was still super-hot by the time I got back to my room 10-15 minutes after pick up. The fried tofu was still super-crisp, and the sauce was just the same texture/flavorfulness it would have been at the restaurant. If I return to philadelphia, I'll definitely go back.
