The food was decent but the customer service is awful.  Our seating was moved four different times and we waited over 30 mins for the hibachi chef. Extra food was placed on our bill that the hibachi chef claimed he cooked but apologized for not having. (The manager claimed he didn't speak English well, but we understood him perfectly) We literally had to argue to have our bill fixed. The food was decent but for two people the bill was $67!!!!   The two male managers were rude as well as the hostess. I will never be returning.  I am sure this business with with their etiquette and lack of customer service will be gone soon.
