The first time I went to Corner Bistro I didn't know that you were meant to order from the small chalkboards on the wall, and when our server came over about 45 seconds after we'd sat down and asked us what we wanted, I gave him an indignant "Um, we didn't get any MENUS????" and the rest of my party covered their heads in embarrassment and shame.   Now, of course, I know better and I have to say--that is one tasty cheeseburger and those are some seriously crispy fries that I just ordered off the wall like a pro.  Perfectly fat and medium rare patty, crunchy lettuce and pickles, and apparently the fries are cooked in bacon grease?  No wonder I couldn't stop shoveling them into my mouth. The walls and tables at Corner Bistro are completely covered in both penned and carved graffiti, which is something I just love, but only here.  Somehow graffiti in the West Village is different in my mind than graffiti in the East Village--everything seems so old here, I like to romanticize and think that perhaps it was Allen Ginsberg or some such WV heyday icon who did all this carving...unlike in the EV, where I'm quite positive it was just a modern-day punk from St Marks Place.
