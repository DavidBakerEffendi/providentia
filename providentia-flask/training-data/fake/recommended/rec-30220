This place was recommended to us by a woman who works at Merchant's House, and I'm so glad that we took her recommendation. This place is great. The restaurant is cute and cozy, the service is friendly (we never felt rushed), and the food is delicious. Risotto so easily goes wrong, and both risotto dishes at our table were perfect. I only wish I had been hungrier when I ate there -- I would have loved to try the profiteroles.
