Great restaurant excellent food! I had the lamb shank and my husband had the steak. Both dishes were very delicious-lamb was falling off the bone and the steak was nice and tender. The dessert was amazing. That tres leches...so so good! We also order the arborio rice pudding which was great but it couldn't compete and we were stuffed from the delicious meal and the tres leches!
