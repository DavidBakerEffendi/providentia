Overrated, but still very good. I used to live in Manayunk, not far away, so we'd go all the time on the weekends after golfing at the free course (which is right across the street). I can't remember exactly, but there was some type of deal where you get a beer and a cheesesteak for about $8, which isn't bad. Expect long lines and limited seating; I'd recommend doing takeout.
