This restaurant is amazing in every way. The atmosphere is great (except that the tables are so close together you're basically dining with the rest of the people around you), the food is fantastic, AND it's a BYO. Perfect. While all of the meat dishes are exemplary, you have to try the pasta dishes first if you're a newbie. They make all of the pasta in house, and it is excellent. I really can't say anything bad about the food. Another good option, if you're looking for a lighter meal, would be to do the cheese and olive oil flights with bread. Bring in a good bottle of red, and it's an excellent light meal for the weekend. The primary complaint is that it is small, and since it is soooo good and so popular, it can be very difficult to get a table. My recommendation (if trying to get in on Fri or Sat night) would be to stop by early, put your name on the list, and then return after your 2 hour wait. The system is set up so that it will text you when your table is ready, so that's the most convenient way. Also, remember that it is cash ONLY.
