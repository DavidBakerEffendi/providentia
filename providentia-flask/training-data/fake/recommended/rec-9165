I found this place to be a nice stop for a few small bites before dinner or before a night on the town. I would not go there for dinner based on the dishes all being just as tiny as the restaurant. We had about 12 of us on a Friday night and we all cuddled up on the bar because the place was packed. It was fun watching the one chef making everything. The entire staff was great, lively and conversational. One of the best things we ordered was the pate which came in a tiny mason jar. Most of the food was very well made. They had some wonderful wines to choose from and the staff was helpful. It was a great way to start off the night.
