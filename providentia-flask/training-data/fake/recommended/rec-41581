I ordered a Cuban sandwich which was totally inedible. The meat was dry. There was no mustard. I complained to the manager who pulled my sandwich apart with his bare hands and said there was nothing wrong with it. I could not eat it if I wanted to at this point. The manager also told me I still had to pay for it. My travelling companions had pasta which was adequate. Â  One ate what she was given but not what she ordered.There are certainly better places than this available with good food and civil staff. These people certainly give Jersey diners a bad name.
