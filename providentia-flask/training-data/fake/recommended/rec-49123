My husband and I wandered down down to Kofte Piyaz for dinner tonight, on a neighbor's advice, and we just loved it. The place is spotless and lovely, with a few cozy tables and a mirrored view of the chef/owner cooking up their homemade treats. The red lentil soup was incredibly fresh - it tasted as though it had been made just for us! I had the kofte, which were perfectly fried and not at all greasy, and just the right balance of aromatic herbs. The owner was incredibly nice and brought us a small sample of the piyaz, the white bean dish which is another specialty. Everything was so fresh, even the homemade lemonade. We finished the meal with baclava, which was also delicious; I'm Greek but I prefer Turkish baclava because it's not overly sweet with honey, but more nutty. This one didn't disappoint! Everything about the place, and the owners, is wonderful. We're so happy to welcome this new gem to the neighborhood and will be back many times, I'm sure.
