As someone who works in Times Square, the 'little bankok' that is 9th ave is rife with choices for Thai. And though usually the super fly interior would suggest 'Terrible food and hyper-cool prices', turns out that this is legit one of the best thai restaurants on the strip (with the exception of Wondee Siam 2 a bit more uptown). The pad thai is awesome, although I would recommend the vegetarian duck over the regular duck if you're going to get duck. The lychee iced tea is steallar as is the thai iced tea. Great lunch special. The wait staff is usually on the dick side, so go in there and lay down the law and you'll have a better experience. If you need a spot to bring a date, LL the cool interior!
