We just found out about Pingala last week and have been looking forward to trying it. First, the location is incredible. It is in an old converted woolen mill and has a beautiful view overlooking the river. The cafe itself has a wonderful mural on one wall and is casual with an outdoor patio. I had the Vermonter, which was spot on. I love how generous they were with the greens on the sandwich, and the flavors were perfect. Apple, nut-based house made Gouda, eggplant bacon - WOW. I love to see some new flavors in the vegan food space. That said, the food here can easily please the palate of anyone, vegan or not.
