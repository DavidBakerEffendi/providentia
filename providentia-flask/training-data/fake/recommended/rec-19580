I was very excited about you, Fare. And then a little bummed about the reviews going into it. Â I was expecting fussy, what with the so heavily emphasized ORGANIC! ARTISNAL! etc and got very yummy straightforward food. Came with a good friend whom I hadn't seen in a while, which may have not been the best plan because it was a little noisy to really catch up, though we were in the center of the dining room, which may have had something to do with it. Service was fine, nothing spectacular. Lovely to have a 1/2 liter wine option for the two of us (the Torrontes was delish). I had the beet salad and crab cake app, my friend the chicken thighs. The highlight was certainly the crab cake - so good. Prices were decent, and the food was satisfying to the palate and the belly. I was pleasantly surprised, and will definitely be back.
