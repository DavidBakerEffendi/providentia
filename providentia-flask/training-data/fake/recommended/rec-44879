I thought this place was wonderful. My partner and I found it on yelp so I am paying it forward. It is the two meals We still reference to this day. I got lamb With goat cheese Gnocchi it was cooked and seasoned Perfectly. My partner got the halibut with corn and Lima bean succotash and it was just amazing. Serve was good and I liked the atmosphere. Worth the wait. Also the meatball app was very good!
