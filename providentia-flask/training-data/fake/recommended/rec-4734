The Hopewell Valley Bistro & Inn is a great place to go for authentic Hungarian dishes made just like Mom would make them (if she was Hungarian, of course)! Heaping portions and great prices add to the rustic charm of this downtown Hopewell restaurant.  You can choose to eat in the bar, regular dining room, or the Starlight Room (which features live jazz on Saturday nights).  Friendly service and a great selection of desserts make this a wonderful place to enjoy with friends and family. The only drawback is that the main menu has a limited number of choices (although, the "specials" list is usually rather large). Here's a link to their website: hopewellvalleybistro.com
