Wedged in the middle of Curry Hill, this place remained hidden to me for almost a year until I finally checked it out. The only reason the 2-hour for a table of 2 wait wasn't as intimidating was that I lived close enough by to go home and wait it out there. Granted, it was Easter Sunday, but don't expect to get weekend brunch at this place without at least a 45-minute wait. No reservations either, unfortunately. I'm happy to say, though, that the wait is totally worth it. This is my favorite brunch spot in the city for a couple of reasons. For one, it has a fantastic pre-fixe, which used to only be $15 but has somehow spiked up to $17 in the last year and half (due to renovations apparently). Either way, it's extremely reasonable for a meal and a drink. (Their apple cider mimosas and penny beer shandys are delish!) The decor is and menu at Penelope is really American country. The food portions are huge, and I've never had a bad experience with service even when it's packed. My ultimately favorite thing about brunch at Penelope is their Farmer's Market Omelette, which you can customize with 3 toppings and comes with a side of potatoes and toast. It's a MASSIVE meal, and well worth the $17.00. As a vegetarian, it makes me so, so happy when a place offers meat alternatives, and Penelope's "fakin' bacon" is PERFECT in the omelette. I literally come back over and over again just for this dish. This is hands-down my favorite brunch spot in the city, and I'd say their lunch and dinner is pretty good also. (Great veggie burger!)
