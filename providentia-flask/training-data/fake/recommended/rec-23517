This is the local Italian restaurant that I will take friends and family to when they visit. Everything we've tried so far has been excellent. Know before you go: this place gets busy. Seriously busy. Don't be surprised to see multiple tables celebrating special occasions. Try a weekend early afternoon or midweek if that bothers you. Pizza here is slightly pricey, but toppings are high-quality and the crust is crispy-chewy and flavorful. If you like white pies, get the Rudi. Garlic cream sauce, fresh mushrooms and spinach with mozzarella and parmesan. I highly recommend asking for fresh lemons to squeeze over the hot pie. The bright lemon flavor cuts through the rich pie and makes the whole thing more delicious. Fried calamari is crispy, not greasy, and the marinara for dipping can be spiked with crushed red pepper to your preference. If only there were tentacles! Entrees are large portions, so assume you will bring home half. Chicken Rustica is a standout. Most come with choice of pasta. Salads are large and full of quality ingredients. Antipasti salad is a full meal with fresh, hot bread and butter. Be sure to read the specials, as they will often have an offbeat fusion item (fried calamari tossed with sweet chili sauce) or a seasonal/limited entree (homemade gnocchi). I've never made it to dessert, but I don't think they are house-made. Skip it and get a homemade scoop of ice cream at Colonia Dairy Maid down the street instead. Wine lovers, take note: BYOB.
