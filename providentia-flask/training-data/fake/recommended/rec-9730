We were seated without reservations. We sat outside since it was a really nice outside. We had sangria which was amazing!!! Then we had ceviche, salad and entree. My ceviche was amazing. The fish was very fresh and the lemon was just the right amount and it was so tasty. It was really filling so I had a bit of the salad but it was really good as well. The service was quick and very good. They spoke Spanish so it was a pleasure speaking to them in Spanish!!!
