Went last night for Hunny's bday after being told at the restaurant down the block that there would be a 3 hour wait. We started with the fresh juice and tequila cocktails then allowed our server to pick us a wine off the extensive list. We opted for the Chef's Tasting menu and everything was amazing. We loved the crab/flan dish, meatballs, ceviche as well as the churros & flan with sorbet we had for dessert. We had so many dishes we lost count and couldn't even touch 2 of them (they're on my counter now). The service was good. All little too fast/slow in spots but overall solid. Everyone was really nice and when they forgot to put a candle in My Love's dessert, our waitress lit one on a plate for us (it was very cute). I'd definitely come again.
