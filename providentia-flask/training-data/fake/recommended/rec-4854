2nd time I've been here. !st time was at their old location on Spruce St. I wasn't  a huge fan by any means, so I didn't have any big expectations, but I have many bottles of wine dying to be enjoyed with a good meal, and Melograno is one of the BYOBs that everyone raves about... Super crowded for a Thursday night with a 40 minute wait. We gave the not effusively friendly hostess our name and number-ha who were we kidding. Luckily Tinto is around the corner and a few sangrias later we realized we were starving. We returned an hour later when half the restaurant had cleared and were readily seated. I love the new decor. Much more spacious that 99% f the BYOBs in the city and its decorated in a warm country style, without being cheesy. The food was delic! I ordered the Tagliatelle with Pork and thought it was fantastic. The serving was large and only $16 for more than enough food with really nice flavors. My friend had the Spaghetti Vongole, which also looked equally delic, and my other friend had the mussels app which seemed to very popular by the looks of other tables nearby. They both polished off their plates and were happy to order dessert. We had the tiramasu, which was slightly disappointing. Too much marscapone with not enough ladyfinger. I actually tasted chunks of chocolate which was just weird, but even  mediocre tiramasu is good, and we polished it off as well. I'll definitely be back!
