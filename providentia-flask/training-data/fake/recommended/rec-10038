Quick tip: Hour and half wait for my most favoritest meal of the week?? FINE.... doh. Full review: So, the wait is effin' ridiculous.  I mean, okay, I can deal with 45 minutes.. an hour fifteen... I'm used to the usual wait at Isabella's, Jane, Sara Beths.. but TWO HOURS is ridiculous. Anyhoo, I stuck it out, and sat my butt on the stoop eagerly waiting for people to walk out - trying to coax the host with my eyeballs every time I heard the cowbells on the door ring, and saw him step out. It never worked. However, I initially was a party of two, but ran into 2 friends, and they accommodated our sudden party of 4 without much of a problem, wahoo! The breakfast food was decent.. actually, it was just regular. The omelette was something I could make at home, the nutella french toast isn't exciting (nutella on anything is delicious. toasted bread is always delicious.).  BUT the FBLT is absolutely delicious. The spread and avocado are such a nice touch, and that bacon is like none other! My smoked salmon poached egg dish was quite yummy as well, but I couldn't stop picking at my mom's FBLT, I would go back just for that. All in all, the wait is too much. I don't mind the crampy nature of the place so much, but the noise level is also pretty ridiculous - I could not hear the person sitting in front of me at all, so our party of 4 had 2 separate conversations the whole time.  The regular brunch items aren't spectacular, but MAN that FBLT stole my heart and taste buds. 1.5 stars, rounded up because of the sandwich points.
