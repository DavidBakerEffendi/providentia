The food is definitely good but nothing out of this world. I do think that the hummus is delicious, but be aware it is sun dried tomato flavored. The souvlaki platters are pretty good but hard to eat. Overall, if you are craving Greek, I think this place is definitely the best in the area. Â I had to knock a star off for bad service on two occasions.
