Fun!! As a vegan, I do agree with the other veggie Yelper who stated that it would have been helpful for them to label if their sauces were veggie friendly.. Not mandatory but helpful. I always research places before I dine and wrote the Hai Street before dining and the General Manager was very quick to respond with this list of veggie friendly options. In case anyone else out there is interested, here is the list.. Obiously, for your main ingredient you would choose the zucchini.. For your sauces you have the option of the following: Black pepper teriyaki, salsa verde, gochujang, ginger miso, and the spicy peanut dressing. Sadly the wasabi guac is NOT vegan, womp womp! But my boyfriend said it is delicious for all of you non vegans! All of the veggie toppings are vegan friendly except the papaya salad, as well as the crunchy toppings. I opted for the zucchini with brown rice and various veggie toppings with the ginger miso sauce. It was very tasty! I left feeling fulfilled. I saw that a lot of people were saying they felt that the portion sizes were small.. We were satisfied but we didn't come on empty. We both also had teas which were delicious as well. We will return to sample different sauces and combos. The staff was friendly and efficient. We came on a Saturday shortly after they opened so we didn't have a problem getting a seat but I could see how this would be an issue if you went during a busy time..
