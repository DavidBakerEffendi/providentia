Best meal I've ever had! Many people have recommended this place to me and to be honest I didn't think it was going to be as good as all the hype. I was wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. It's very pricey but worth every penny. We came here for my best friends birthday and she's a vegetarian and we were told this place is great for vegetarians and she wasn't disappointed. Â It was very crowded and still the service was phenomenal. I will definitely be returning.
