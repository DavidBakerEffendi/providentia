This isn't a restaurant, it's a family room, a warm, inviting home that awesome aunt, or sister! The lamb with prunes and honey, the tea, the bastille!!!! LOVE Sue, I LOVE her food, and I will return AGAIN AND AGAIN. Her daughter is a great waitress, and I just love this place. Please go and eat like a queen or king! (:
