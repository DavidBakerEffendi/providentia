Hubby & I have purchased food (take-out) from here once. Probably will return, but only at a frequency of 1-3 visits/year - too much pulled pork from this place will surely cause cardiovascular disease. The food was good:  We both got pulled-pork.  Sauce came on the side.  There was a good amount of what I believe was melted lard pooling in the bottom of the styrofoam containers, which solidified some in the fridge (we couldn't eat it all at one sitting but not for lack of trying!).   Hubby's meal came with fries.  By the time we drove the food back to our house they were cool so he only ate 1/2 of them, but that's probably for the best considering the lard as described above.
