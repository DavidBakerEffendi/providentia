I have had every kind of pizza imaginable. I have had horrible convenient lunchtime Korean-owned Italian restaurant pizza, I have had regrettable slices that were purchased in a drunken haze, I have had forgettable slices of I-don't-even-recall-what-was-on-it pizza, and I have had some incredibly tasty addiction-inducing pizzas. Above all, regardless of how shitty or great the pizza is, I always eat my pizza with meat on it. In fact, I only eat pizza with meat on it. Lo and behold, on my first trip to New York, my boyfriend orders me two slices of the regular Di Fara signature pie with cheese and basil sprinkled on top. This was a napkin-twisting moment for me. Pizza with no meat? GETOUTTAHERE. FORGETABOUTIT. PEPPERONIFORLIFE. We waited in a small line outside the shop before it opened. Once in, the ordering process was quick. Five slices came to us, just like that. The slices are visually unremarkable. They just look like your average pizza. Maybe this is why a disgruntled man bitched about having to pay $5 for the slice. Then he ate it and immediately STFU. The crust is subtly salted and perfectly crisp on the edge, chewy in the middle. The sauce is thick and savory, with chunks of sweet and mellow Roma tomatoes. The cheese has a bite to the creaminess that envelops the bits of basil sprinkled on top. The entire slice is drizzled with olive oil. All of these things combined made me forget all about my fascination with pizza meat. This here is truly a slice of heaven.
