Grew up on the whole ICB. Italian cheeseburger.   Anytime I hit the area I goto the one in Orange.  The last time I went I had the ICB without the CB.  I used a couple of morningstar veggie burgers as an experiment.  It worked!  Just like I remember except no meat.   It's been years since I've eaten red meat so I'm glad it worked out.  My wife had the chef salad and it was just as good as she remembered.  The first one she had was about 20 yrs ago when we dated!  For a spot to have that type of longevity and consistency with taste it's no wonder they are still I'm business!  Sandwiches is the best!  Oh by the the new spot looks good
