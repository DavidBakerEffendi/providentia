Things I love about Red Hook Lobster -There was parking right in front of the place, thank you for being red hook and not...cobble hill -The staff was really good with giving us recommendations, there needed to be a strategy on how we can fit as much good food in our stomachs as possible. -My Maine Lobster roll $16 - so fresh. Lobster was cooked perfectly. -Lobster mac and cheese was sooo rich, I couldn't eat more than 5 bites. For those 5 bites, it was heavenly. But one more I would have had cardiac arrest. Not worth the $12 unless you're splitting it with a bunch of people. -Did those fries come with our order? Things that could have been done better: -I thought I would like the Connecticut roll more (butter always wins, no?). The flavor was better but many of the lobster claw meat was very tough. -Corn could have used more butter
