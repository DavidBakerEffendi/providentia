The service may be lousy, but at least the food is only average and the drinks are overpriced. The Yankee Doodle Tap Room -- or "The Nass" as it's known among the student body and alumni -- reeks with tradition and nostalgia, and that may merit a visit.  That said, the quality of service and food hearkens back to a time when The Nass was the only game in town, and there are myriad better places to eat and drink that have cropped up in the past 30 years that are vastly superior and more friendly. Favorite two stories -- one night a group of us placed an order.  We were continually assured by our server that "the food will be right out."  An hour later, same server confesses that the kitchen printer broke, and our order never made it to the cooks.  One might expect a visit by the manager with an apology and an offer for a drink or a dessert on the house, right? Not here. More recently, my friend and I ordered two of the same brand of single malt scotch, one neat, the other "with a little bit of ice" (his words).   Neat scotch:  $12  Scotch with two ice cubes:  $14.  I asked the server, who shrugged her shoulders and said "that just the way it is here." Worth a visit.  Once.
