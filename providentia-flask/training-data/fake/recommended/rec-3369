LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! I have gotten some good things from here with my boyfriend and they have yet to disappoint. I love their crepes! I have had the La Normande and the La Curry Chicken. The latter was soooooo fricken delicious! The La Normande was really good too but the curry was much more to my liking. I love curry so if you love curry too, try it. My bf has gotten the mustard chicken penne and the La Chocolat crepe. WHOA! That penne dish is sooooo good!!! It was kind of small but the bang in that thing. Whoa man! The choco crepe was good but note to self: if driving home and it is a far distance, it will get cold and it won't be as delicious...Yea. Can't comment on that too much but while cold, it was pretty good. The chocolate is very tasty and the almonds were a good touch. Just try to eat it while it's hot!
