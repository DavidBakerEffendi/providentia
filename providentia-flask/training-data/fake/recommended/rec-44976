Worth the wait. The atmosphere takes you out of the city and into a cozy, countryside best friend's kitchen. The food is comforting and yummy, the staff is friendly and the cost is reasonable. On my last trip, I had the seasonal birthday cake dessert, complete with a lit candle and an off-cycle wish. Just darling.
