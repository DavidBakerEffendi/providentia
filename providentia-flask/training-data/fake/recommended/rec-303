Believe the hype, it's excellent. Do not get delivery or takeout. The time it takes to walk it back home or for the delivery Â guy to bring it to you takes away some of its gooey, ooey, mozzarella magic. The first time I ate here, it was an evening where I had been on the go all day and needed a solid meal and a few or three glasses of wine. Lombardi's hit the spot and then some. Go ahead, order the large and be "those people". You'll be so glad you did. You'll either leave stuffed and happy or have a slice for breakfast, either way will satisfy. Disclaimer- this is the thin crust, coal oven baked type of pizza. Real mozzarella. Small diameter pepperoni. Know what you're getting into. Clam pie is legit too. Only thing that annoys me is that it's cash only. Just bring $40 with you and you'll get over that quickly.
