I brought my team here for lunch today and everybody loved it! I got the turkey sandwich that was SO great.  The perfect ratio of meat to bread (I like meat!).  My team members are raving about the Italian Stallion and the Prosciutto sandwich.  Everybody was impressed by the home made, high quality meats and toppings.
