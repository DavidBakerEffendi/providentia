This is one of my favorite places to eat in Philadelphia. The burgers are always delicious. My friends and I have ordered a wide range of toppings but I would definitely say the fried egg is worth it. The mixed drinks are also spectacular- the Ginger Rodgers is a favorite. The wait can be long, but Rittenhouse Square Park is close and is good to hang out in.
