I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!! Took my husband here for his birthday this past January .The food was great. We were seated immediately. The staff was friendly and attentive. Didn't have time to grab up a bottle of wine from home (BYOB) but no worries ,the delicious Sangria sufficed.... On returning here with friends bottleSSS in hand :) seating was not so prompt. But in all fairness it was a Friday night. We waited about 30 minutes to be seated. I spent my time anticipating utilizing the outdoor seating. I can't wait till it warms up to experience this place inside and out!!!
