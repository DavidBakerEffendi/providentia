As a Texas gal I have a guacamole  craving that is very hard to satisfy, even  the fancy pants places in NYC do not get it right. These men have conquered my heart. They toast the cheese on the tortilla prior to slopping on the goodies...perfection! Not only is the food yummy, but the staff is hot and the beer is cheap. They have also set a standard that more establishments in NYC should take heed and follow suite by being conscience of  environmental impact.The furniture in the place is all recycled from a barn and they use green-ware and compost their goods. I am in love. I recommend not going alone, one person waits in line while the other has to hover over people getting up to get a spot. ps they are vegetarian friendly as well..even vegan but they use chicken stock for the rice.
