Everything is perfect! Starting from the hostess , (that was friendly when we had to reschedule our reservation) to the server, that explained how the dish was cooked. The food... Excellent! Iys refreshing to see a menu with very few items but all perfect and thoughtful. Thaaaaanks! I'll definetly go back.
