All I can say about this place is wow.... You would never know it just from driving by, but this is amazing. It is very small with only a few tables. It's a BYOB and seems like reservations are really needed, at least on a Friday. We started with a special. It was mussels and calamari in a red sauce. This was the best part of the meal. The sauce was a spicy cilantro red sauce. The mussels and calamari were perfectly cooked. For the main course, we had the mixed grill, a ribeye and the salmon. Everything was very good. The mixed grill is a great combination of different choices, all of it was great. My one and only complaint about this place was that there was only one waiter for the entire place. They really need another one or two. The food was good enough to get me to come back, even with the sometimes slow service.
