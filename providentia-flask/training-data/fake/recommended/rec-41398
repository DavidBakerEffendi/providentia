From what I understand, this place is an institution.  At one point in time, this was THE (emphasis on the word THE) place to go to.  And it was said it's because people on the street can't see in through the windows, so you had your privacy when eating/drinking/schmoozing. That being said, I will admit, for the first time in a public forum, that being a resident of the Philadelphia-area for almost 10 years, I have never had a Philly cheesesteak.  Never been to Pat's, never been to Geno's, never been anywhere else to try this Philadelphia staple food.  I've never had an interest.  Oh, I know all about them, but a cheesesteak doesn't sound too appetizing to me.  That was until I saw the CHICKEN cheesesteak on the menu here at the Happy Rooster. Okay, okay you can stop booing me now for turning my back on the steak cheesesteak, not everyone is going to like everything, and I know I've never even TRIED one before, but the meat looks gross.  That's just me and my opinion and I'm sticking to it.  This may change at some point in time, but for now, no thanks. Getting back to my chicken cheesesteak lunch.  The chicken was soft, not overcooked, the cheese was melty, gooey good. But what did it for me were the onions.  This place knows how to caramelize an onion.  They weren't burnt, they weren't too soft, they were perfect.  And there weren't too many of them on the sandwich to overwhelm the other flavors. The presentation was nice, the fries were crunchy and it made for a good lunch. It was kitschy and whimsical and a place that I would stop by again and try something else off of their menu.  Maybe if they added a beef cheesesteak...
