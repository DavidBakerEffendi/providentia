Very solid BBQ with great atmosphere. The fried green tomatoes and pulled pork were amazing. The sweet tea was great, not too sweet and you could still taste the tea. The brisket and ribs were decent, but a little dry for my taste. The hostess wasn't the nicest, but the waitress was very pleasant. This restaurant is quite large, huge for BBQ standards. When a restaurant is this large, its hard to nail it every time. This place is good for solid food and a good time. If you want the absolute best BBQ in the area, try Fette Sau.
