First, the food at this place is great. Comfort food at its best. The brussels sprouts and mac and cheese were great, as was my burger. That said, this place's bar is definitely lacking (easy to improve). I got an old fashioned served to me in a mason jar. The other thing that REALLY needs improvement is the setup and the decor. It's broken up very strangely, and the decor is not very New York. Pictures of produce on the wall made me feel like I was in the mid-west.
