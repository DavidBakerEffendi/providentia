Wow, wow, wow!!  Run, don't walk---wait, fly!---to this fabulous space of fabulousity!! The whole energy is awesome.  Sip a lychee martini while the orchestral music of the food starts playing.  Our overture was the paneer.  Yay!.  We moved on (enough w/ the music metaphor...let's get down to business!) to scallops...yum.  Then zucchini hummus pizza.  And ended w/ burger.  Each topping the other--only each was untoppable (a rare occurrence in the Village!). Great prices and, as others have said, just the sweetest folks serving you.
