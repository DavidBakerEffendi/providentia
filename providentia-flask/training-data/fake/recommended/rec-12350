the food is outstanding. its almost as though i cat really come up with the right words to describe the outstanding dinner that we had. we were seated immediately at the best table in the restaurant (from corner in the window) upon arriving for our 7pm reservation. service was quick and the specials were plentiful. our appetizers were great. mussels marinara, baked clams, and friend calamari. any italian restaurant afficianado knows that calamari is good way to judge a restaurant. this calamari passed the test. it was lightly friend and nowhere near rubber-bandy. dinner was 2 veal parms, chicken marsala, and rigatoni a la vodka. all were outstanding and huge. nothing was leftover. my husband and i have declared this the best restaurant in little italy and definitely will return. i cant wait.
