when I'm hungry..I don't wait ..for anybody or anything as time passes I get increasingly irritable and someone you wouldn't want to be around me until somebody has fed me... so you would think by the time I finished waiting an hour to get in to Penelope for brunch that nothing could have pulled me out of my misery.. BUT YOU WOULD BE WRONG bwahahahaha seriously this place had some killer french toast filled with nutella (?!) and I couldn't even finish the three large slices that came on my plate. We got a side of sausage which was a nice sweet savory slightly salty piece. The homefries were also really good. Armin had bacon and the salmon with poached eggs. Everything came out super fast and even with the crowds, the waitress was attentive. As Helena H. suggests it isn't great for large parties and it seems like you will get a seat faster if you keep your group down to a sexy twosome. I think that most will find that it is worth the wait. p.s. while waiting outside they offered coffee to those waiting for one of their coveted seats.
