Went here for someone's birthday. Super busy. Food portions were small yet pricey. Needed a couple Narragansett's to get me through the night which set me back $15 bucks...then again...it's Â in the west Hartford center. Biggest complaint was the DJ they had. I can understand having a DJ in aplace like this, But when it's louder than the AC/DC concert I went to.....in a resturant, I knew this wasn't the place for me....
