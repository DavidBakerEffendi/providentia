I will preface this by saying this poor review is not a reflection of the entire restaurant but of the embarassing attitude of the bar tender.  We were a party of 4 stopping in for drinks and desserts and I will say we had great service from the beginning from our server Nichole.  Onne of our orders was the Mexican hot chocolate but with a shot of kahlua.  When the order arrived, I tried it and didn't think it tasted like it had the chili powder or kahlua in it.  The other people at the table tried it as well and confirmed.  When our server came over to check on us, I let her know and she went to the bartender to replace the drink. Our table was 6 feet from the bar and we could hear the bartender berate the server and then claim that it was the correct drink.  He kept going on and on about the exact 2 oz of kahlua in it.  We heard everything. It was so unprofessional and absolutely rude. When the correct drink came out, it was overloaded with chili powder. I wouldn't send it back or complain again because I didn't want to hear this guy go off once more.  If a drink wasn't made correctly there is no need  to have a tantrum that a 3 year old would throw judgment at.
