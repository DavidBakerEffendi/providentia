Would really like to give it 3 and 1/2 stars if I could.  Plusses:  Great choices.  Authenticity.  Reasonably priced for the area.  Atmosphere, which includes the handsome Irish waiter!  Minuses:  salsa garnish on my swordfish was a little bland and husband's portion size on Irish stew was a bit small. Hit of the evening was the "Apple Love" desert.  We shared it and it was delicious, not too heavy.  Eat early here to avoid a crowd and then walk the waterfront for exercise. Would return again.
