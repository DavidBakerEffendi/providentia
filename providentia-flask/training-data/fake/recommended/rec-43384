Just an update - they now take reservations on sun-thurs which is a big plus. Went there twice this month and first time we had grilled octupus full of sand. The waitress were excellent and immediately took it away. She then came back later and said the kitchen said it is normal. I think NOT! Crazy about the spinach, crispy crawfish, egg bacon salat! Yummy The jalepeno lime shrimps are also excellent. Also had the buffalo shrimps both times. First time amazing. Second time overly sweet and not spicy at all. A big disappointment. Generally the quality varies a little too much but still no better seafood in town
