The service here was sub par. Other tables were being pandered to by our waiter, while we had to beg for refills from other waiters and barely got so much as a follow up on how we liked our entr√©es. My sister ordered a salad that she didn't enjoy and barely ate. She told the waiter this, and instead of comping the meal (after she ordered another dish), he charged full price. I love French brasseries, having lived in France. The warm goat cheese tart was mediocre, at best, and was room temperature. Given all the rave reviews about the restaurant I thought that I couldn't go wrong with ordering a steak frites. False. I was not impressed by the quality of the steak. Nor the smug looks on the waiters' faces. Get over yourself, good bye. I will not be returning. I wish that I could hop into a Delorean to save myself the wasted time and money.
