When my friend Kelvin told me that we were going to Carmine's for "family-style" Italian food, all I could think about was Marlon Brando's character Uncle Carmine from 'The Freshman.'  If you haven't seen the movie think Vito Corleone from 'The Godfather' -- only less horses head, and more Komodo dragon.   Although the servings are large and served family-style, I would in no way categorize this restaurant as family-style Italian in the sense that it is either authentic or home-style.  But in terms of being a fun place to bring your family or large group of friends, Carmine's is true to its word.   Everything here is over-sized and incredibly dramatic.  From the billboard menus to the serving sizes and plates.  The wait staff, too, is larger than life with their serving skills and flair.   For appetizers we had the stuffed artichokes seasoned with parsley, oregano, garlic, olive oil, and Romano cheese.  They were broiled instead of baked, rendering the leaves smokey and yet still fragrant and juicy.  The breading on them was a little heavy for my taste, but once sliced into, went very well with the interior artichoke hearts.   For our entree we had the Rigatoni Country Style with sausage, prosciutto, broccoli, onions, and cannelloni beans.  A rich and hearty combination, it was served in a lighter sauce of simple olive oil and garlic.  Although I probably would have preferred broccolini to broccoli and my pasta a bit more al dente, together the ingredients complimented each other quite well.  For its price, however, I would have expected a bit more.  Then again, it is Time Square and not a little hole-in-the-wall outside of Chinatown where Uncle Carmine sits in the back drinking Italian Espresso.  It's not everything you'd hope it would be, but it's still good.
