The Venice is a great local spot for good beer on tap and a great pizza Pie. i have been going to the Venice to get their pizza for a long time now and their Bar pie is second to none.  its thin its crispy and its so flavorful.  The atmosphere is like Cheers everyone knows everyone and they are all friendly inside.  There is live entertainment there mostly every week and its a good time.  If you are in Bayonne and searching for pizza stop at the Venice and you will not be disappointed.   Their burgers are huge and very tasty.
