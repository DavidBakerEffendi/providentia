I have been here several times since we moved to the neighborhood and overall I would call it a solid joint. There is always a wait when you arrive but they generally move after than how long they tell you the wait is. The down side to this is that your meal is also rushed because they have a high volume of customers to please. I can only speak for the ramen as I haven't ordered many other items off the menu, but it is really fantastic and always hits the spot. The spicy miso ramen is the bomb. Avoid the vegetable ramen unless you want floating chunks of avocado and wilted lettuce in your soup. As long as you stick with the originals, you can't go wrong and this place always attracts a robust crowd. It's definitely staying in the rotation of regular neighborhood go to's.
