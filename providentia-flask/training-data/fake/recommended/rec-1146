When a fellow margarita-loving friend came to visit, I knew I had to take her to El Vez. I tried to make reservations day-of, but as it was a Saturday night they were booked. Â I was told the wait would likely be 45 minutes, but when we arrived around 5 we were seated right away - perhaps because we beat the dinner rush, but I'll take it. We had the guac, of course, and I was surprised to see the mahi-mahi tacos - my favorite - seemed to have been lowered in price. I'll take it!
