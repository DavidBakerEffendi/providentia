Walked in here on a rainy 4th of July. Pleasant well lit atmosphere, southern oldies playing on the speakers, waitstaff is a mother daughter combo, friendly texan vibe. Ordered a fried chicken biscuit with fried green tomatoes and ranch and bacon with a prickly pear lemonade. Food came quickly and was eaten even quicker. Breading on the chicken was flavorful and the meat was very tender. The biscuit was flaky, the ranch certainly not from the bottle. great slaw as well. I will be back for sure!
