I went here a couple of months ago. This was the first time I had a Philly cheese steak in Philly! Â When I went, it was like 20 degrees (FREEZING). I approached the window and starred at the menu (the only variety was cheese). The guy who was taking my order knew I was obviously out of town because I was freezing my butt off; he asked me where I was from and I responded the OC. He's like whoa and just gave me a bunch of stickers and pens. COOL! So then I ordered a Philly whiz cheese steak. Boy do they make it fast! You have to eat it right away or it gets cold fast and won't taste as good. I had a good experience here. Oh yeah, Geno's all decked out in Patriotism, I had a good laugh reading some of the signs.
