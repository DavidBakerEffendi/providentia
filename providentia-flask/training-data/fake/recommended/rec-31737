Low key and top shelf.  Went on a busy Friday night...put our names in and went down the street for a drink...hostess came and got us sooner than expected...nice first move.  The staff was attentive and knowledgeable without being too big a part of the experience.  The crowd was chill and the place is nice and dark so we had some privacy. The food is excellent....legitimately. Creative menu with not too many options...highly recommend the fried brussell sprouts, roast chicken, berkshire pork and cake donuts.  Nice beer, wine and cocktail selection...beer and a shot deal was a nice touch.
