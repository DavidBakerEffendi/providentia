Good ambience and friendly staff. Service is a little slow and spotty. Food is uneven in taste. The three cup chicken and Chinese watercress are very good. However, the crabmeat soup dumplings, fried chicken legs etc were very mediocre, bordering on poor. Again this is in New Haven so my expectation for authentic Chinese cuisine may be too high
