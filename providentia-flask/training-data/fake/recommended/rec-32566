here's the deal... the pizza is fine. it's even good. not great, and nothing that i would seek out. my real issue with this place is that seems to be filled with tourists (which is no issue imo). Â this seems to result in the wait staff being unfriendly, inattentive, and rushing you out. it feels a bit like a factory and you are just a widget on an assembly line.
