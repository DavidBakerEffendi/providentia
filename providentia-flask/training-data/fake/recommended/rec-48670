I cannot understand the 4.5-star rating here and am writing my first Yelp review because I felt so misled by a resource I trust. I am not bitter - pleasant, helpful staff was the highlight - seating us before our third person arrived, for instance.  However, our 3 entrées and appetizers were mediocre and ambience had potential but does not quite get there, in part because of the table layout in the back - avoid the central tables. If we had sat somewhere else on a less busy evening (it was a Tuesday) and ordered differently I still do not see how this could be more than a 3- or perhaps 3.5-star place. I theorize that location and relative youth of clientele have something to do with the sterling rating.
