This is a wonderful place for breakfast.  The menu is varied beyond that of a regular diner - catfish and grits, steak, eggs benedict etc.  Everything was very tasty and the portions enormous.  We always take home another breakfast.  The service is attentive, never have to beg for a coffee refill.  They always make you feel welcome
