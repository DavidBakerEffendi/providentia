This is a beautiful little restaurant tucked away in the west village. When we arrived our server brought us through the house and into the back to a truly beautiful garden seating area. There is a glass ceiling like you might find in a greenhouse and there were lots of small stone pots full of flowers set all around. The whole patio had a nice floral aroma that made it seem that much more charming. Dinner was quite good (I tried the linguine alle vongole with clams and agnolotti di spinace which is basically ravioli) - simple and well made. We also had some wonderful wine to go with our meal. The final bill was a little on the steep side but hey it's a nice restaurant in the west village, what do you expect I guess. Overall A+ for the charm, really nice dining experience.
