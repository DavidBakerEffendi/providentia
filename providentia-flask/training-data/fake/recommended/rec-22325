Its starting to get difficult ranking all these fine NYC BBQ eateries.  Hometown does a fantastic job having as diverse and creative a menu as any BBQ place could.  I went on a fantastic Saturday afternoon in June, no line, open tables, always makes the experience seem that much better!   I had the brisket (best i've had), pulled pork (fantastic), spare ribs (fell off the bone and their dry rub is SOOO good you contemplate if adding sauce would take away from the experience), and a beef hot link (not bad, but the least exciting of the other food).  The collared greens had smoked pork shoulder in it and was absolutely amazing.   I'll be back to this establishment soon.  In a land of many BBQ joints, Hometown stands out among the best!
