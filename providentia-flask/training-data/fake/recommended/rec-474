This place is delicious!!! (and bear in mind i'm only reviewing on the basis of one dinner) I ordered the Sukiyaki pot and oh my, was it huge. it couldve fed both of us, no problem, but obviously we didn't know that. The soup was amazingly tasty and i love eating all the vegetables and meat with the rice they provide. One down side was that i couldn't bring it back since it was so delicious. :( but that just means i'll be back much very often! My friend ordered the sushi omakase and it was really fresh and delicious as well. Â I trust her because we both grew up in Asia eating Japanese food like our lives depend on it, and oh my - was this a good find.
