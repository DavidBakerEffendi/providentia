This is a BYOB that doesn't really feel like a BYOB, which may be a good or bad thing. The place is huge, for one thing, and pretty loud, not intimate at all. They take reservations on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, but (judging from the other reviews) you may have a lengthy wait on the days you have time to go. I tried Melograno on a Tuesday night for boyfriend's birthday. The place was pretty packed for a Tuesday, and quite bustling. The waitstaff was very friendly, and when we told her it was our first time she took time to mention some of her favorite dishes. I ended up getting portobello mushrooms stuffed with goat cheese (delicious) and the tartufate--wild mushroom pasta (which included a parpadelle type noodle, long and flat). Both dishes were straightforward and delicious--not pretentious Italian food at all. I'm taking one star off because my boyfriend thought the portions were small. He had the lamb chops--two smallish pieces of roasted lamb with rosemary and a bunch of other spices. I will go back, but it's not on the top of my restaurants-to-return-to list.
