I went once a couple months ago, and loved it so much that I went back another 3 times since.  I also brought my friends (who are getting married) to try it out, and they liked it so much, they asked if they would cater their wedding!  The brussels sprouts are delicious (like everyone says), and I really like their French Onion soup.  My girlfriend (who's a very picky eater, and now my fiancee) loved everything so much that she tried everything!  I mean, she even tried my fish...and she doesn't do seafood.  She hates onions and soggy bread, but really likes the Onion Soup as well (although she leaves all the onions and bread behind).  Overall, a great experience every time.  Also, the staff has always been really friendly.
