We stumbled across this place. We had no intention of eating there until we asked someone sitting outside if we should, they said absolutely so we give a shot. Best decision ever. The pasta was made fresh. The bolognase was some of the best I've ever had and the grilled octopus was unstoppable. This is my first Yelp review ever and I ate there last weekend, that's the kind of impression this place made on me. Also worth noting, I live in Boston. So I'll likely not be back here for quite some time. WOW!
