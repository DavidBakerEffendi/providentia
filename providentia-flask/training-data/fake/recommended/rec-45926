I came here yesterday with a friend with hopes of just getting hot tea and coffee. Instead I got the Avocado Roll and the Spider Roll. Overall the sushi was okay. The Avocado roll was about $3.75 and The Spider Roll was $9.25. I'm a sushi fanatic and I was disappointment when the plain veggie roll tasted better than the Spider Roll.       The establishment itself was very nice! The floors in the dining room were really nice and clean. However there was this very foul fishy odor in the resturant that was really irritating my nose and my overall experience. The bathroom however was messy. The trash can was very full, paper was spilling of the can. So why do I give it 3 stars? Because the food wasn't that great. The resturant odor was foul. The bathroom was messy. The customer service wasn't extraordinary. They only came around when it was time order, bring my food, and bring and take the check.
