Obsessed with the place!!!  Wait is always long but the food is delicious and the manager/owner is so nice that you rarely care about the wait.  Love the food - literally have had one of almost everything on the menu and am never disappointed!  Sangria and prices are excellent too! Highly recommend for a girls night out, date night, when family is in town, etc -- have never brought anyone who didn't immediately love it!
