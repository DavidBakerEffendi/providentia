Still dreaming about yesterday's plate of fried noodle and vegetable topped with duck. The noodles were so delicious that the unexceptional duck could not diminish from it's heaven. Even the knob where the noodles are held when being made was good. A guy near me ordered pan fried dumplings after his bowl of soup. Too bad I wasn't paying attention, because he would have given me one to try. Â Wanted some place other than Joe's Shanghai and this may be it. It's nothing to look at, but I sat facing the noodle maker, so I was entertained.
