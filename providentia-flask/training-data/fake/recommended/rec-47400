I ordered LAMB THREE WAYS tonight, and I'm satisfied with it. The lamb was good and cooked in three different ways. The mashed potato with lamb was pretty tasty.   I also tried my friend's dish, the Thursday classics -- Bass, it's only ok. No surprise. The restaurant is small, no much space.  It did not take reservations and we had to go there and wait for a seat. We had six people for tonight's party and when some of us arrived there first, they did not let us be seated until all of the members arrive.
