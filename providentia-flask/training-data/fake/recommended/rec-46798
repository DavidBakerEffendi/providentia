To preface this review, Kafana is a charming restaurant where the waitress sweetly greets you with a thick accent and offers you water served out of antique milk jugs. However, I think my dining experience has sorely been marred by the fact that I am a poor college student. Through out the night, a friend and I shared cevapi, a roasted red pepper salad and a side of swiss chard with potato. While these dishes were no doubt authentic and tasty, there simply was not enough food (We paid about $15 each too)! When I have the capital, I will definitely return and re-judge!
