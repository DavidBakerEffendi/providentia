A quality bar for those who appreciate good craft beer. The crowd usually seems interesting, educated, and/or approachable if you're a West Philly pseudo-bohemian like me. The bartender and servers are personable and hipster-lovely (in that order), but don't get any ideas. My only gripes: I don't know if it's the decor or what, but the establishment seems to lack *character* and some atmosphere, compared to other "serious about beer" bars. Also, you get no description of all the different craft brews unless you ask. I don't know about you, but I like to pore over a small menu before I order a quality beer; it's hard to figure out on your own what something like "Whimsy Winter Ale" would actually taste like.
