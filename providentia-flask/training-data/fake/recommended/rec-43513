So this is what love at first sight feels like... This place is a teeny, tiny brick building of goodness.  Why am I crushing on it in such a disgusting way?  It could be the extremely decent beer on tap.  It could be their extraordinarily palatable fare.  Maybe it has a little to do with the alternative music they play at a volume that's just loud enough not to be obnoxious.  Their $20 brunch with unlimited bloodys and mimosas definitely helps their cause.  There's just something about the atmosphere that makes me smile big and want to snuggle up to my honey.   Three thumbs up, McCrossen's.  I promise to visit whenever I'm in the neighborhood... ok, and I might make a special trip out of my way, too ;)
