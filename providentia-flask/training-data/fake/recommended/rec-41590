My trusty Yelp app lead me to this marvelous place of Italian goodness. I just loved the set up and the look and feel of the restaurant. It's like you are walking into someone's home. Which is almost correct because it looks like the restaurant was formed from two converted row homes. We showed up with out a reservation which is ok for two people. If you have more than two, call ahead. The service staff is fantastic, I have nothing but praise for them. They know their menus well and provide excellent recommendations when asked. To add to their awesomeness they will also grab the mike and sing a beautiful song to go along with your meal. At least two servers did this while we were there so I'm not sure if all servers do this. The piano guy was really cool too, and really knows how to tickle those ivories. The meal was fantastic, order anything and it will be great. Especially grab some garlic knots I could of just eaten those for my meal and would of been happy in a garlic doughy induced food coma. The price was reasonable for a great meal and wine pairing was superb. My only complaint is the parking which I really can't blame on them since we are in South Philly. Next time I go back I'll definitely grab some pizza to go, everyone here in Yelp continues to rave about it. All in all if you want a great Italian meal with beautiful ambiance, great service, wonderful music at a great price, stop by and enjoy!
