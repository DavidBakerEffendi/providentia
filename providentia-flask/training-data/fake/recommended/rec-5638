Man this place is awesome! I went there when I was visiting some friends in Philly and I was wowed by the food. Â Quite possibly the best crab cakes I have ever had...and I've had some stellar crab cakes at Fisherman's Wharf in SF! I had drinks there too- the "Sourpuss" drink was like Austin Powers: a little weird but still totally groovy :) Food wise we shared the crab cakes and the lobster mashed potatoes and still stole bites off each other's plates. The lobster mac and cheese was pretty awesome as was my seared tuna with a mushroom risotto. My friend's burger was the juiciest burger I have ever had! The bill was a bit steep but for 6 drinks, 2 shared plates, and 3 entrees, $150 including tip is not bad.
