The scallop sashimi was good, the dashi that was poured at the table was flavoursome. Every time I come here, my friends request to get the pork buns. But they're just not that special in my opinion. There's not much flavour in the pork itself, so it really needs the hoisin sauce. Wonder why they give you siracha!
