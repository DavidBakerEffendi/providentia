On a summer rainy day and affording only a couple of hours to spend in Philadelphia I was glad that I was able to find this place. It was within walking distance from the liberty bell and all the other touristy sites. The sandwich was good when I had it at about 4pm....It was greasy and tender. Good but not great. However, fast forward to a couple of hours of driving across the great state of Pennsylvania and I'm in Pittsburgh. I completely forgot i had the sandwich leftovers. It was sooo delicious after the bread had absorbed all the flavors. Yummy.
