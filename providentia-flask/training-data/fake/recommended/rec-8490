For the coffee enthusiast that I am, Â my friend who lives in the neighborhood recommended this place as her top coffee shop so naturally I had to indulge once, twice, three times, daily?! (yes!) My normal Venti Vanilla Black Eye that I used to get a Starbucks is half the price at this joint not to mention you bring your own cup - $1 off the price! Who doesn't like a discount? Coffee is great, staff is attentive and there is plenty of tables and space for strapping in for an afternoon of studying for my PMP certification. Love recommendations and love my coffee!
