Short and sweet: this place makes a freaking fantastic sandwich. We live down the street, and unfortunately, Paesano's has us so hooked, we haven't really tried any other sandwich place in Philly. Honestly I am not sure we're missing out - the Diavolo is as close to perfection in the hot sandwich category as I can currently imagine, and the Daddywad is your quintessential Italian hoagie. The ingredients are quality and the flavors are great. The staff is, as others have noted....colorful. Lately they seem more friendly and welcoming than when we first started going there. I used to find it best to go in knowing what I wanted, cash in hand ready to go, soup-Nazi style, in order to avoid attitude/embarrassment at the hands of the smart-ass cooks. More recently, though, they've been more friendly. If you're a lady, you'll probably get winked at.
