one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. some of the best dishes are: avocado shrimp salad, the tofu in broth, all sushi tacos. ginger margaritas are excellent. the service is always accommodating, and somehow, i never have to wait long, even on a busy saturday night. i would eat her every day if i could.
