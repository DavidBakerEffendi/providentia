Four of us went to Barbuto on Tuesday night.  The restaurant was busy and full of excitement.  It created a fun atmosphere for us.  The menu was very interesting and provided a variety of options.  Two of us had the cauliflower salad (Crudi), which was heavenly.  It is hard to tell how they are able to transform a cauliflower into a tasteful work of art. The flavors of the ingredients mixed together perfectly and the portion was very generous.  One member of our group had the risotto which was prepared with ramps and asparagus. The serving was also very generous and provided plenty to pass around the table.  For our main course we ordered, gemellicon salsiccia, jw chicken, cod (merluzzo arrosto), and pork loin (filletto di maiale).  All of the courses were wonderful with the filletto di maiale and the merluzzo arrosto being standouts. We felt no rush during dinner and our server was attentive and knowledgable about the menu. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.
