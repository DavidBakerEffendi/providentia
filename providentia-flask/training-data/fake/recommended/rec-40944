Sure the food isn't the best ... but this is a Yale STAPLE. Next to Toad's and with it's location, it's hard to find something that doesn't epitomize college life at Yale better than a post Toads night here (beware barfing students). Solid food, drunk or not, and sadly a tad pricey, but try the chicken wings, garlic bread, and assortment of other Italian food. It's not that bad. My all time favorite and staple ... clams and sausage either on red or white sauce. It'll goo off on red, but AGH it's good Â while the white is just as good and stays together. Your preference. Just go here. Cheers.
