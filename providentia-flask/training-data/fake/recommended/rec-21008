Utterly disappointed.  The good first - decor, cute; staff, polite; drinks were pretty good but VERY small!!  Ok, now the bad - the food!!!  It's a classic example of great concept but poor execution, in such, not all the ingredients belong in the plate esp when some overtakes the star of the dish.  Here why we tried: 1). Pork bun - was good but nothing special that you can't get in flushing for. 1/3 the price 2). Uni - no flavor as it was overpowered by the wasabi beans and tofu 3). Sirloin tartar - again can't taste the beef only the gooey white sauce on the bottom 4). Duck liver moose - the cranberry were so sour that it ruins the duck liver flavor profile. Overall, it was a let down as there is major flaws in 3 of the 4 dishes we tried ... We couldn't even bring ourselves to have the main course there... We left. Boo.
