This small restaurant is adjacent to a cheese cellar that keeps approximately 100 cheeses (including Delice de Bourgogne - one of my absolute favorites), spreads, crackers and other such items.  As such, I was expecting the menu to be cheese-heavy.  It wasn't.  The night I was there the specials included sausages, an "on the bone" lamb selection, a lobster salad served with gazpacho, and a melon and nectarine soup.  Outdoors at Caseus is a nice patio while the indoor seating area sports brick walls and lots of dark wood decorated primarily with books on food and cooking, although there is the occasional picture.  The staff is young, hip, and tattooed, but that does not mean they are pretentious or inattentive.  On the contrary, I was at the bar and my bartender/server did an excellent job of keeping me happy, without being intrusive.  Other couples at the bar enjoying the cheese platters were treated to a brief introduction to the cheeses but it wasn't overbearing or preachy, and I enjoyed eavesdropping on the lesson. Although there is only a single beer on tap, the selection of bottled beer is impressive.  I had Trois Pistoles, a delicious dark Belgian ale.  There is an extensive wine list.  The food was mixed - a tart du jour with a puff pastry crust and a cheese filling that included chevre and tomatoes was merely okay.  The crust was light and crisp, but the filling only occasionally had the lovely tart taste of the chevre and the tomatoes were MIA. The greens that it came with were fresh and the dressing was fine.  The stand-outs were the frites - perfect and crisp with a sprinkling of salt and pepper and served with a lemony homemade mayonnaise.  Truly great.  Dessert was also wonderful.  I passed over the pot de creme au chocolat and instead had cookies and milk - giant, warm, soft maple snickerdoodles with cold milk.  Comfort food at its best. The restaurant was busy on Saturday night - I'd recommend reservations otherwise you may wait.
