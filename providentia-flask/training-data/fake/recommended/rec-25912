I had been looking forward to Becco for a long time. Finally the chance arrived but after dining there, the result was not the satisfying experience I thought it would be. Despite a cadre of New York's finest server-savants, a wide (pastaless) menu and a cozy space, the restaurant failed to live up to my own expectations. The only pasta available was bundled in their perennial three-pasta deal, which has become perhaps, the place's dubious hallmark. It always seemed so Olive-Garden to me. Yes, Becco is in the theater district so I suppose it wants/needs to cater to out-of-towners. But with the pedigree and reputation that Ms. Bastianich has, that would seem totally unnecessary. We didn't go for the semolina-trifecta, so I guess that makes us either dilettantes or weight watchers. The appetizers were entirely competent, so you will do fine on your own without a drawn-out description by me. But it is at the entree point where restaurant wars are usually won or lost. At Becco the battle turned out to be at best, a stalemate. My partner ordered the veal chop and I the osso buco. The chop was sizable and was presented nicely but lacked a competent crusting that satisfied, or the tenderness that would compensate for it. The osso bucco as well, lacked the softness usually associated with the dish. I dare say my own approximations of Marcella Hazan's classic recipe turn out better. The desserts, like the appetizers, were absolutely fine and delicious. And so it went, two steps forward, and one step back. It's true that this review is handicapped by being meat-centric, but had any pasta choices been offered singly, other than a third of a mega three-pack, we probably would have gone for at least one. Dining at Becco was not exactly the tarantella I had hoped to be doing at master Bastianichs' odeum, but I'll try a whirl with Felidia next time.
