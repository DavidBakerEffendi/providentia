The food was good but nothing exceptional for the price. Our table was wobbly and the service was slow but our waiter was nice. I would be much more satisfied if my entr√©e was $17-20 instead of $25. The meal was good but I just felt a little underwhelmed overall. Slightly better service or slightly less expensive would have made this a 4 star review.
