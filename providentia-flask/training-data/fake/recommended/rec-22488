Pretty nice place, the German beer selection is excellent.  I usually avoid this guys restaurants because i think they are trendy and overpriced and full of those "trendy" folks that i care not to associate with.   I can't imagine this guy is a fan of German culture, but hey he's jumping on the new German beer Garden fad , which im all for because lets face it the Germans make the best beer, and they know how to have a good time.  I liked the outdoor seating. They had the worlds best lager on draft, Weihenstephaner, after a few of those i forgot about all the annoying hipsters and troft urinal.
