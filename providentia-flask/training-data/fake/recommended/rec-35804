I think I understand the whole point of tapas way better now. Before, I figured it was more or less a fashionable thing that people who make too much money enjoy doing: paying fancy to get several tiny plates of food. Tinto showed me the beauty - it's about savoring the precious flavors - everything is so carefully selected to pair with another thing. Not the most eloquent girl here, but the food was so pretty and it delivered the goods. Too often pretty food doesn't "kiss you back" once it's on your tongue, an example of this would be wedding cakes. Like all the creative energy goes into making a wedding cake pretty, but not a lot of them really seriously taste good, and it's not reallly supposed to matter all that much. We had the brunch, there were four sections of the menu and within each section four or five options. You know when you get Indian food with a bunch of people and you try to order to assemble a grande table of sharable delights? That's the approach you want to take here. Go in with a team of 2 or more people and you can divide and conquer the sweet nectar of the menu. And the waiter - our guy was Thomas, and you'd have to search at least a couple of weeks to find his equal - he was knowledgeable and friendly, relaxing to be around and a straight-talker Â - will enthusiastically share his personal favorites and help architect you up a delight for eyes, soul and palate. I think they have a super fancy pants wine of the month beauty pageant or something, that's nice for the Rittenhouse crowd - but what makes it so nice is they also have french toast or yogurt and granola for that person who needs that to be on the menu. I think Tinto really cares about giving you a pretty, relaxing time in addition to knocking your socks off, culinarily. It's not an easy balance to strike, and you simply can't go wrong with the $25 Sunday brunch.
