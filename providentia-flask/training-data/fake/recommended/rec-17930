Very nice restaurant to take someone to.  The waiters are very nice and professional.  The garlic bread, salad and olives you get as soon as you sit down, is awesome.  My friends and I had these appitizers:  Garlic Schrimp, Calamari and Churizo.  Garlic schrimp was fresh but it could've used MORE garlic.  I'd order it again though.  Churizo was awesome.  A must have.  The calamari, i wasn't crazy about.  It was the LARGE pieces and it was a bit greasy.  I'd pass on this next time.  For the entrees, the Schrimp with rice was awesome.  Special of the day was pork chops.  Definitely worth getting.  Chicken in garlic, which i had, needs some work.  I only got 2 pieces of chicken breast sliced very thin and it didn't have much garlic flavor.  The menu is huge.  Id go back again BUT I have a few other places i'd go to before I go back to Fornos......
