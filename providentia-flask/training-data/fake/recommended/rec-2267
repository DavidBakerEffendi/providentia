Julie Yelp bookmark.. check...  It's a bar and i stopped by on a weekend thinking I would get a brunch like meal in a nice atmosphere....  NOT.. I shoulda read some of the other reviews to realize that this is truly just a dive bar.... The menu consists of 5 or 6 items and it's burgers....  And that's what i really came here for.  So I settled down in the back in one of the hard wood booths that too many peeps have gotten passed out drunk at and went for a chili burger.   The burger was excellent but when you get it chili style it gets smothered and you no longer eat it like a burger.  The bread and burger is topped with a big scoop of chili so then it just kinda becomes a big plateful of chili with a burger in the middle. For the true experience, I would just go with a bistro burger.  It was delicious.  Big and juicy with cheese, lettuce, tomato and bacon.  Not the best burger but high up there.  I can tell that the bar is proud of their burgers so you can't go wrong.   Next time I'll stop by for a few pints, get a bit hungry and tipsy and the burger will be even better.....
