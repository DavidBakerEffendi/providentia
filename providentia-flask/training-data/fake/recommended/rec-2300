Wow, just wow for Ishka!! They have the best Turkey Cheese Burgers.. the cheese steak was okay, and they have spanish fries also, sooo good.. all of u need to give it a try.. the service so awesome, i gave 'em 2 thumbs up for the service and the food. NO wonder they're so busy everytime i went there. I highly recomended this place if you go visit Philly.. xDD
