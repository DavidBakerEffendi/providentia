PROST!!!!!!! First time at the Bier Hall and it was fantastic.  I would recommend coming in smaller groups or get there early, because it may be hard to get a table, no reservations, first come first serve! But let's talk about the beer: It just doesn't get much better than a one liter of Spaten Oktoberfest in a real Spaten beer stein.  A decent selection of German brews on draft, some American beers as well.  What looked to be a half decent bottle list with the Ayinger Doppelbock Celebrator, fantastic! But the food? German food?  How about some delicious bratwurst, massive German soft pretzel, potato salad? Don't forget about the Spetzle and the potato pancakes that come with a little bit of cinnamon apples and sour cream, awesome! Can't want to go back and have a stein of every beer on tap! Oh, look the the Jenga that includes messages from everyone who visits, including an interesting comment about M. Night Shyamalan!
