Hell's Kitchen Lounge lived up to my hype. Even though I was watching a Devils game on a away game day. I had ordered a B-HELL-T and the bacon was perfectly crisp, and crunchy, and the lettuce was fresh, and the chipotle sauce was tasty but I wish there was more of a kick to make it a little like "Hell." The beer I ordered was a pint Blue Ribbon Pabst. It was nice and cold served from the can all for $3. I think I found a real stop by joint for any Devils game event before or after. Service was very helpful and even when I was done drinking water and about to ask for one, my server gave me my water before I could even ask for it. I LOVE HELLS KITCHEN.
