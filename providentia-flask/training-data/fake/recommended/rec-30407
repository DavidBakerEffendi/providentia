The beer selection is absolutely fantastic and the menu with all the info (location, ABV, ratings) is perfect for a beer geek. The beer selection changes constantly and they seem to hold a lot of events. However, the music is too loud, the servers aren't friendly (they look like they are miserable) and are sometimes incompetent (I got charged 2 extra beers that I didn't have). The food is pretty good but a little expensive for what it is (and you wouldn't come here for the food anyway). I found the crowd/ambience a little lacking, but that is probably what you get close to Murray Hill (ie. fratty).
