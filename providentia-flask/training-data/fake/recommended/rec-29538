About 4 months a ago, Chili Szechuan was fresh, new and tasty. Today they're cutting corners with ingredients and customer service. My favorite dishes are now unacceptable. The Orange Chicken is now made with cheap processed orange juice instead of real oranges. The sauce resembles sweet BBQ sauce. Today the Dry Pepper Fish was very greasy. Tip: Skip Chili Szechuan and go to Han Dynasty.
