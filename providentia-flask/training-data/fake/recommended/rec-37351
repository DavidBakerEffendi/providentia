We went here on the second day of summer, so you can imagine it was HOT, our plans to sit outdoors quickly changed when we couldn't take the heat. We had some square pizzas ,calamari and I had the Caesar Salad with chicken. The food was great, the salad portion was big (took home half). The service is slow our waiter, never came over to see if we needed anything, except when we flagged him down. The seats are packed to close to each other , but I guess that's how it is at a family style restaurant. When we arrived at 4pm the place was half packed , by 5:00 pm it was full.
