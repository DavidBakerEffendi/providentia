My husband and I and my daughter stopped for a bite to eat.  We loved it!  It's so refreshing to find a place to eat that's not only tasty but also healthy.  The restaurant is based on four food principles; balanced, nutritious, clean and pure.  It's a small casual place with limited seating.  There are also gluten-free options, which I love!  It would be really nice to have more places like this to eat. We will definitely go back.
