OK, so I've only been here once, but what an awesome experience. Super-duper cheap, awesome food. The 1,000 layer bread is as good as everyone says, and the noodle dish I ordered was outrageously good. Wash it down with an Asian beer. Don't make it to Philly all that often, but I am definitely returning to this place.
