Don't believe the hype. So, in my continued best-cheesesteak quest, Pat's left me wanting.  I've got a list going which makes me legit (please read that sarcasm). To preface, I base this rating simply on a cheesesteak comprised of steak, bread and provolone. And, just to up my scientific validity, I've had a trend of only eating cheesesteaks when I am famished: half in the car and half at home. Pat's was no different.  I had just made my epic return to the gym and hadn't eaten for 7 hours.  So on my way back to my place I swung by Pat's. Plus? No line.  Minus? No line at dinner time can't mean anything good. So I ordered my steak (apparently it is a provey without ... or some jargony phrase like that).  Took it back and began to inhale the first half.  The construction of the sandwich was bread, slices of provolone, and then chopped up meat on top on the provolone.  And I gotta say, the meat was tough, kinda flavorless, and I definitely got a big 'ol chunk of gristle (which is a total dealbreaker for me).  The bread was decent, but I still think that if you're gonna chop your meat, take the time to mix in that cheese (a la Dalessandro's in Manayunk). To top off the mediocrity, this thing was a big f'in greaseball and I now have a grease-stain the size of Texas on my pants (so, make sure your paper is wrapped well around the sandwich if you decide to order one here).  At $8.50 the size was decent, but not the biggest steak on the block (and yes, I am a size queen). At the end of the day, Tony Luke's is still the front runner by a long-shot.
