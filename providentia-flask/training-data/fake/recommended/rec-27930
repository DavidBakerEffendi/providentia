I want to preface this review with the fact that I'm judging this restaurant against its peers, while I'd give Chip Shop 4 stars, that doesn't mean I actually think the Chip Shop has better food than Applewood, it's just that Applewood didn't quite live up to other restaurants in its class. My husband and I ate here for Brooklyn Restuarant Week.  I loved that they used local ingredients and the food was tasty, it just didn't blow me away (except for dessert, but it's not hard to impress me with sugar and cream).   We added an excellent and well priced half bottle of wine and the cheese course to our price fix menu. I was a bit shocked to see some of their fish selections, most of which are loaded with contaminants (edf.org/seafood). I would have thought a restaurant focused on local foods would have considered that, but at least the fish they chose weren't overfished, just full of toxins. I thought that the service was good, and on a cold night this would be an incredibly cozy restaurant to eat at, but if we hadn't gotten the restaurant week discount, I probably would have been more disappointed.  At full price, the cost is comparable to the Chez Panisse Cafe in Berkeley, but the food isn't as refined at Applewood.
