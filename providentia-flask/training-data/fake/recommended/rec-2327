my stomach is on fire!  i should have listen to hundreds of yelpers warning all the newbiers to be easy on the hot sauce.  I thought to myself...how bad could it be?  Oh man, it's still burning as I'm writing this review. I can't think of any better way to spend a $6 meal than this joint's chicken and lamb combo with rice, pita and lettus.  The white sauce is a must and you should go easy on the hot sauce (unless you like feeling miserable).   This combo has your proteins, carbs and vegetables so you feel like you had a balanced meal (though i'm not sure if i really want to know the nutrition facts).  This is an unforgettable dish.  I enjoyed every bite till the end.  If you are visiting NYC, this is a must visit for a late night.  If you are in NYC and you never had it, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?  Since they are open till 4AM, call up few friends and let's get moving.   Few tips: Though the line is always long, don't be discouraged.  It moves fairly quickly.  Bring your own drinks since they don't sell any unless you wanna buy it from the cart 70 feet from this halal cart.
