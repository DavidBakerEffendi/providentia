they use these weird puffy, kind of greasy buns that taste amazing, and overall the burger was really really good. it was a little more expensive than it should have been (especially with the whole "tip your server" thing that was mentioned in another review), but i enjoyed it. maybe they should include fries for that price. i didn't try the fries, but i was full after that burger without them. one of my favorite parts is that they have crayons and paper, so i enjoyed doodling while i was waiting for my food. the walls are sort of like your parents' refrigerator, so a bunch of the drawings get posted. it's neat.
