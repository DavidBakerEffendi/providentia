Tiny place, a dive for sure. Like others have mentioned, not a place for big groups. I won't comment on the cleanliness because there really is no point, and if that makes a difference for you, you probably shouldn't come here. But it is delicious, filling, and cheap. Perfect for a rainy, cold day. I've been here 5 times or so, and have been very happy with my noodles. The same can't be said for the rest of the menu, however. Each time we tried something else off the menu (dumplings, some broccoli dish, etc.) but weren't impressed. Stick with noodles. Definitely a must visit.
