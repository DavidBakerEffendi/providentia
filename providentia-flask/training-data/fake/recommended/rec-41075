I finally tried Umami after 2 foodies convinced me to give it a chance.. Here's my story: Met up with said "foodies" at 3 PM inside and their was no wait. I did notice that when we left about an 1 hour later there was a small delay to get a table. We were seated quickly and our waitress appeared. I do agree with a previous reviewer that I felt a little "rushed". I don't fault them because I've heard about the waits at this chain. I ordered the Classic Umami Burger (shhitake mushrooms, caramelized onions, roasted tomato, paremason kethcup, and umami ketchup). We also all split the sweet potato fries and the cheesy tater tots. 1) The Classic Umami Burger: I enjoyed this, although I would hesitate to call it my favorite burger ever. It was very tasty and the ingredients were meshed just right. I typically am a classic, burger,lettuce,tomato, pickle kind of a guy so this was a fun twist. 2) The sweet potato fries: mixed with the 3 dipping sauces provided by the restaurant they were tasty although nothing amazing. 3) The cheesy tater tots: UNBELIEVABLE. I don't know if I've ever even had tater tots filled with cheese but I would come back here for these alone, do not miss out! The service was efficient and our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu. The total cost was $25 for me after tax + tip so a little bit pricier then your normal stop at burger joint. I would recommend this joint but I would not wait more than 15-20 minutes for it with many interesting other burger spots around the city.
