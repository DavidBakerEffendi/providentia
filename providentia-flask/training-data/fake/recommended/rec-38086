Good local diner. I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs and toast. The hash was incredible, especially for ~$7. Entire menu was reasonably priced, and everyone else's food looked good. Overall, it was a good meal at a typical diner. Side note: I ate here on a Sunday afternoon around 12:30pm, seated and ordered at 12:40pm, and wasn't served until 1:30pm. Definitely more of a wait than you would guess at a local diner.
