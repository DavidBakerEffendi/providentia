Been here only once and was very impressed with the chef cooking right in front of us. Chef was very funny and entertaining. This was a different kind of experience for me. There were 8 of us and spent about $250. So, it's fairly expensive. The food was good but wasn't to die for. I'm giving this place 4 stars because of chef and his style. If you ever dine here, you must order from the chef's menu. Enjoy!!!
