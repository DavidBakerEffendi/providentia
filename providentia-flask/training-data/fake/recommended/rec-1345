I'm not going to say anything other reviewers haven't already mentioned, but the combo of the fiery food, hilarious owner, and attentive staff makes this place one of the best restaurants in Philadelphia. I know the scale for spiciness goes to ten and that it may seem tempting to order above 10, but I promise you it's not worth it: the kitchen will accept your challenge and offer you a dish so spicy you'll embarrass yourself by crying and sweating profusely in front of whomever you're with. Unfortunately, this isn't a lesson I learned until I asked for Dan Dan at a 12...
