What a shit show. The counter girl/server was, well...not the sharpest knife in the drawer, and overwhelmed by tending to the diners (only a few patrons in the place) , but not overwhelmed enough to keep eating from her plate behind the counter and walk around chewing her food. Yep, really. I ordered the beet salad for myself with a Cappuccino, "Gourmet" grilled cheese and berry smoothie for my daughter. After 10 mins of waiting, counter/server girl lets me know no beets. Ok, ordered a different kind of salad. 40 mins go by, and my munchkin is getting antsy, and frankly...so am I. She reassures me it's "coming" and I ask for a glass of water for the 4th time. The owner is there and it appears they may have had a cook not show up. The owner is clearly frustrated and says so, but isn't doing much about the ridiculous wait time, the useless server or getting food out to frustrated diners. Finally....!!!!The "gourmet" grilled cheese arrives!! It was a toasted cheese sandwich with a few stacks of sliced cheese and bacon, and a slice of orange on the plate.whu? $9??! Â I ended up cancelling the salad I ordered because it took so long and just wanted to get out of there at that point. At that moment the salad miraculously appeared (but without the chicken I had ordered on it) and so I took it to go. It was seriously not even edible. Major FAIL, Cafe V. *on ONE positive note, the espresso used in the cappuccino was perfection.
