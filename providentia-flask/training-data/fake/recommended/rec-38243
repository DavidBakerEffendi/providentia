The foh staff were all sitting at the bar drinking when we arrived at 9. We were just getting off the train and called to make sure it was ok that we were coming to eat. Everyone looked annoyed we were even there when we arrived and never came to the table. I had to go to the bar to order. After sitting for 35 minutes we had not received our nachos or tacos... I work in a restaurant and usually they want to get the later tables out quickly to clean down the line apparently not here. The manager comped our tacos for the wait which was nice. Just don't come here if you want to get in and out or if you want any sort of attention. Food was good not great but at least it was hot since I'm assuming it was heating for all 40 minutes
