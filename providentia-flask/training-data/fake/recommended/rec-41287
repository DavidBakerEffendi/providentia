I get a craving for Chuko quite often (Their Kimchee soup is delicious). However I rarely get a chance to eat there since their wait is always ridiculous (always more than 1 hour). Regardless, the food is not entirely the reason why I didn't give this place a good review. Their customer service is sub-par. When I think of the feeling I get from this place, the words "high and mighty" come to my mind. If feels as if because they think they are the best most exclusive ramen in Brooklyn, it's okay for them treat you like you are dispensable rather than making you feel welcome and comfortable. So if you want to wait forever for delicious soup and you want to feel unwelcome and annoyed, I guess Chuko is a good place to eat. :( *Note: This review is not based on a one-time experience. I have eaten here three times.
