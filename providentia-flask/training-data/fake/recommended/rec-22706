I will say that Luna West Hartford is by far the best version of what Luna pizza is then any of the existing locations as of 2013. As family, Alex and Angie continually offer great food and fantastic service. I can say this being a Original Luna customer of over 25 years! Living in Farmington and so used to Luna of Avon/Simsbury, I forgot what Luna should be until I stopped in for a few slices in West Hartford.. Avon needs to get back to the original, thin slice basics! Thin, crispy and sauce to the edge....forget the crust, :) Go, enjoy, be treated and fed as u should....the right way. I know where I'm getting my next pie from!
