We have been to Locanda a handful of times (so hard to get a res, but so worth the wait), and it is always so good. I think I might have broken a record for most ricotta cheese tostinis consumed on Sat night. We also had the crab one, also delicious. Note: don't eat too much of those (or the hot focaccia) or you won't have room for the rest of the meal. We had a bunch of great dishes - the bolognese (amazing), the halibut, the chicken for two and the arugula and beet salads. Love sitting there too, such a casual but nice vibe.
