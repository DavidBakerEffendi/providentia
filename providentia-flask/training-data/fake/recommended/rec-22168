I love Zaroka!  We have been coming to Zaroka for many years now.  It is a top notch Indian restaurant.  The food is always excellent.  Two of my favorite dishes are the Chicken Madras and the Zaroka Kabob.  The atmosphere is one of the best things about Zaroka - it's beautifully decorated.  They have a full bar, and some creative drink specials.  I highly recommend Zaroka!
