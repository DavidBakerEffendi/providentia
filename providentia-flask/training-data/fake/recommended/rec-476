I came here for Brunch on a Sat afternoon.  The food is quite good, I ordered a french toast and my date ordered spinach omelette.  Both were delicious.  I was a bit disappointed about the pitcher of Sangria that I ordered.  It was quite watered down to the point where it tasted like water...Aside from the disappointing Sangria the food,  ambiance, service is good.
