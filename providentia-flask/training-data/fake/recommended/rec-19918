Me and my girlfriends game here on a Friday night for girls night out. We had an absolute blast. Although we had reservation, we could not be seated until our full party was there, even after we told the hostess, our friend was 2 minutes away and just parking the car. They told us not to worry we would be seated when she arrived, but when she did arrive 2 minutes later, they happily said it will be another 30 minutes. This was anmoying needless to say, but Â we were finally seated and were not disappointed. I ordered the Carolina rolls for an appetizer, and the pecan crusted pork chops that were great. Best of all were,our Marti gras drinks!!! I willl definitely be back soon.
