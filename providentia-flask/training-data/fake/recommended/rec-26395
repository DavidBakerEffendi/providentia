Evidently, the upscale soul food restaurant has become somewhat of a trope around Williamsburg, but I would say that Brooklyn Star is above average in the category. The food is obviously prepared with great care, and I love that there are unusual menu options like smoked bone marrow, which was fantastic. The fact that it was served with caramelized onions and salt to cut the sweet, mild fat taste really showed that they knew what they were doing. The ambience is good, but one gripe I have is with the bench style seating arrangement. You might end up on what feels dangerously close to a double date, with you plus another couple at a four-top, and I just don't believe that anyone finds that charming. Even in Texas.
