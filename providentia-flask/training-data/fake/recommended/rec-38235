I went to Lombardi's for the first time with friends and my sister and I have to say it was ok. We ordered the mozzarella, tomato, basil pizza and one sausage and mushroom pizza, and while it was good, it certainly wasn't the best I ever had. And I am all about service, and the service wasn't that great. Though we didn't have to wait, we sat upstairs in an almost empty extra room, to only be moved for a "party of 17" that never came. It was ridiculous. Pizza and service was just ok for me.
