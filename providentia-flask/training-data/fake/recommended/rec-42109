We walked randomly past this place a few times since they opened a few months back and we finally made it there to eat tonight! And now we have a new favorite neighborhood restaurant! We loved everything about this place: the eclectic, yet carefully designed decor, the family owned/family run warm welcome, the food is great and there is nothing else like it in the neighborhood and... it's *cheap*! Don't walk, run to this place!! Wonderful, wonderful!
