This place is awesome! So fun! Who knew Fishtown could be so "cool?!?!" Came here for a quick drink before dinner plans in Center City. I wish we did not have dinner rsvp, because the food here looks painfully amazing (think German comfort food). I will have to come back. Damn you Stephen Starr with your cool restaurants that I always end up eating at. I would give this place 5-stars, but there was no dark stouts on tap at either of the bars. That's a big no-no in my book.
