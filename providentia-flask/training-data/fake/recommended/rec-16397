I'm a fan girl. Some dishes are fabulous, some are okay, but even that is pretty wonderful at the price. It is always clean! My only gripe: why do they bother with male cashiers? The women move at lightning-quick speed and finish checking me out before I've even got my wallet ready. The men are just so slow, and they make the line back up. Let's get real, let the agasshis take cash and hustle folks along to keep the insane lines down. The men can take out the trash.
