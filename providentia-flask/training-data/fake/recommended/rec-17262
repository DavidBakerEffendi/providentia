Great food. Love the soondubu, absolutely great. The ribs are OK - would suggest getting them as an app to share, not as a main course. Taking off 1 star because of the price. Although the food is great, have to say the cost is a little high compared with similar Vietnamese, Korean, and Chinese options. If they would drop their price by $1 a dish, it would be 5 start. But considering the crowds in the place, it doesn't look like they have to. If you don't mind spending a little more, great place!
