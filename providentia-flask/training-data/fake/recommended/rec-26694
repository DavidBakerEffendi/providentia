For starters, I would like to say this place is mediocre at best. If any of you out there are looking for great Mexican with a plethora of drink varieties, I would personally choose Distrito or El Vez (both located in Philadelphia) over Los Catrines Tequilas. I say this primarily for 3 reasons. 1) The former two are far more affordable. 2) The former two have much better Mexican cuisine (taste wise). 3) The former two have a much more upbeat environment. If you're looking to class up dinner, then Tequilas is a better option and also if you're willing to delve further into your pockets. The service was okay, but I was a bit astonished when the waiter didn't warn my husband and I about the size and proportions of the food we ordered. That being said, we have enough food left over to feed a small town in Mexico itself. But you be the judge! Happy taco hunting. :)
