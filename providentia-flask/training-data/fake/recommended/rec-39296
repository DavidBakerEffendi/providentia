After living in Southern California for a while, I've become a bit of a snob when it comes to Mexican food.  There have been a slew of wannabe Mexican and burrito type places that have come and gone.  Or worse still, restaurants with awful food that for some unknown reason continue to operate business. So I was quite pleased when we went to Bueno Y Sano a few nights ago and found the prices decent, the portions generous, and the food really tasty.  I had 2 tacos - a chicken and a steak.  It came with rice and beans.  The rice and beans were only ok, but the tacos were great.  My partner got a chili burrito, which was massive and also tasty.  Our son got a bean and cheese burrito from the kids menu, which was huge for something on a kids menu.  We shared grilled jalapenos, stuffed with cream cheese and mushrooms.  They were ok, not great. Overall, though, I liked this place and will definitely be going back.
