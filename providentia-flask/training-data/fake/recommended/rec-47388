I really like the food here, I really do. But what frustrates me each and every time is the spotty and extremely unfriendly staff that work here.  It doesn't matter that we are plunking down $100 per person, the attitude here seems like they are taking US out for the night instead.  First of all, the bald waiter with the black rimmed plastic glasses must either have horrible eyesight, deaf ears, or generally pretends to not see us when we practically have to wave and shout him down.  Yes, I've walked my bill and change over myself twice, that's how bad it was. The hostess was also incredibly rude when we asked her why we could not sit at an empty and non-reserved table by the window (she practically spat out 'because you are five!'). How dare us waste her one precious space. That's it, we've sampled the menu thoroughly. Never going back again.
