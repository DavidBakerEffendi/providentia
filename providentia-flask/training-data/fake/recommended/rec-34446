This place is seriously OVERPRICED.  If the food were good that would be one thing but it is nothing to rave about.  Their fries are good but that doesn't really impress me.  I paid 15 dollars for a wrap, fries, and a drink which I think it way too much.  The sandwich didn't have any flavor and the chicken in it tasted like it was frozen and then burned.  I gave it a two because of the fries and the place is VERY clean and new.
