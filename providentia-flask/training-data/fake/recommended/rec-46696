This is my first Mama's experience, but I can guarantee it won't be my last. Our building at work is notoriously confusing to delivery people, but my Mama representative arrived quickly via bicycle with a bag of piping hot delicious food. Hopefully we didn't frighten him by descending on the bag like hungry jackal pups. I've already lost track of how many times my coworkers and I have moaned, "omg, this is so good~!" My Falafel craving finally met its match, the latkes were mouth watering, the spinach borekas was beautiful and the pita was the best I've had in years! With generous portions, spot on prices, and delivery (!) Mama's can't be beat. MAOZ who? Next time I'll try them in person for the full experience.
