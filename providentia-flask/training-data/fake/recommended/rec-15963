Firstly, the food is fantastic.  I had the salmon over brussel sprouts and it was probably the best salmon I've ever had - prepared perfectly with a nice crisp on the outside.  Also had the three pasta special that you can add on for $9.  Definitely with the money!  On my night, one of the pastas was a cinnamon pumpkin ravioli...um, where has that been all my life?   Cons: very noisy and jam-packed.  Our waiter was a little snooty and inattentive but one of the managers asked us a few times how our meal was so they made back some points in my book there.  Books up fast!  I made my reservation about 4 days in advance and there went many times left for a table of 4. Summary: make a reservation a week in advance, order the salmon and get the three pasta special for just $9.
