frustrated by the absurdly long line at frank pepe's, we hopped over to modern apizza. got exactly what we wanted, after all: awesome friggin pizza. the veggie pizza was LOADED with delicious veg, and the crust was up to the task of supporting the weight of the veggies. this place is definitely worth a visit.
