$$ not $$$. This is my favorite BYOB in Philly hands down. It's not the absolute best meal I've ever had, but combine the service, price, and ever evolving menu and there is no beating Modo Mio. It's so refreshing to have top level service without the unnecessary fluff. And it's so small and unassuming and always packed that you can even bring your little one without the stares. Definitely the best meal I've had with my kid at the table. I guess my only complaint, if I must, and it only stands out in my head because everything else is always so delicious, is the bread. Eh. I would expect a little more from Modo. But perhaps it is a blessing in disguise to assure there is enough room for the yummy goodness ahead. Definitely make your reservations in advance folks!
