NAtive to the Iberian peninsula I appreciate great spanish cusine. This place takes me from nyc and leaves me feeling like I am in Sevilla for the night enjoying wonderful tapas and beautiful authentic flamenco show. The food, especially the octopus was delicious and cooked to the perfect consistency. Also the chorizo and oxtail were amazing. I have been here about 4 times and will continue being my go to spot for great Tapas.
