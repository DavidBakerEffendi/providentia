Ordered pork chop steak and chicken meal. Everything was drenched in oil the toast ones were soggy. The only thing that was not was the chicken. Reported to grub hub and owner offered 5 dollars back on a 43 dollar order. That's what I tipped his driver. Real Cheap. Do yourself a favor and don't order from here
