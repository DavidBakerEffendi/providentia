A long touchdown drive away from the Meadowlands is this old standby. A local joint with amazing pizza--- at least that's how I remember it. I haven't been to the Park Tavern in well over a decade but over a few beers with an old buddy recently, he asked me when the last time I was there. It had been awhile. So this afternoon, rather than sit in turnpike traffic, I jumped onto Route 3 and was sitting in the NEW Park Tavern about five minutes later. The old, classic circular bar is still intact!  But they cleaned the place up a bit-- more modern look, new booths in the dining room and flat-screen TVs in the bar area. I would've been fine with the more divey Park Tavern but I'm nostalgic that way. It was a bar. A bar that didn't apologize for being a bar first and a restaurant second.  But I came back for  the pizza today. Was it the same thin crust taste of Jersey I longed for all these years? We were seated promptly and ordered a small tossed salad and a large plain pie. The friendly dining staff was all-female but what stood out was they all seemed to be under 20 or over 60. While waiting for our pizza we listened to two of the more seasoned servers discuss Social Security and Medicare-- not your typical bar chatter but this place is unique. After sharing a decent salad our pizza arrived. It looked pretty good but now came the moment of truth. One bite and the disappointment was there. The cheese and sauce were spot on but the crust was way off. It wasn't bad but it wasn't the type of pizza you'll go out of your way for. We enjoyed a few slices, paid our tab and moseyed into the bar. Tonight, much like the Jets offense of the past few years, we had to settle for three (stars).  I'll be back for a beer but not the pizza.
