In America, only restaurants serving cuisine from an Asian country can get away with naming themselves after a river. Would you eat at "Schuylkill Grill" or "Delaware Bistro"? Mekong River is yet another new Vietnamese restaurant in Philadelphia, located in a freshly-built, two-story building near Washington Avenue on Front Street. Right next to a state-of-the-art animal ER. The interior is spacious and cleanly decored. Like its counterpart La Viet on 11th Street, there is a bar with TVs. The friendly server (an owner perhaps?) greeted me as if he already knew me (I've never been there before). So, clearly, I was not the first brown man of similar age to dine at Mekong. Being accustomed to spring rolls the size of my pinky and usually fried, Mekong's rolls were surprisingly fresh, large, full of vegetables, and tasty when dipped in the peanut sauce. For the main course, I had the Tofu with Lemongrass Sauce while friend Steve ordered Pad Thai. The lemongrass flavor was excessively strong, which ruined the meal, even with copious amounts of rice. Steve reportedly "liked" his Pad Thai, which was a surprisingly lukewarm response given he had ridden the Wissahickon Trail for hours earlier in the day. With that amount of exercise, he would have found gravel to be delectable. He must have been distracted by his Russian mail order girlfriend situation. So if you're thinking about exploring the mighty Mekong River, go for a dip -- you might like it. As for me, my next Vietnamese meal will be at La Viet.
