I stopped in here for lunch as I was walking to the bus station to come back to California from New Jersey. What a pleasant find. The Mexican food here is pretty darn good and they have cerveza on tap! The restaurant itself looked as if it's well maintained. The service was exceptional with a friendly staff. I would definitely go back during my next visit to the east coast.
