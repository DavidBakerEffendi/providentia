I went here for dinner on St. Patricks Day with a vegetarian friend. They have a special menu for vegetarians! Very thoughtful. And even though I wanted to devour some delicious beast I decided to be a good friend and go veggie for the evening. The cheddar waffle with shaved brussel sprouts and delicious roasted mushrooms was divine! The waitstaff was super kind, and at the end of the night when we requested a bizarre dessert that wasn't on the menu (Guiness float with pistachio ice cream, in honor of the day), they were really nice and made us a float with a porter they had on draught. I really like the space. It feels like you're eating in someone's lovely living room with tall ceilings, big windows and large farmhouse-y tables. It's a very comforting place to be. I've tried to come for brunch a few times, but all the good reviews have made it next to impossible to get a table. Luckily they'll take your number and call you so you don't have to wait on the sidewalk.
