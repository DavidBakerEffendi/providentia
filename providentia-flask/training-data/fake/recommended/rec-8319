Wow, I was definitely surprised by the quality and variety of food here. The menu is extensive and the online ordering makes everything so easy! I have tried other Indian cuisine deliveries and honestly...none have been as impressive as Gandhi Indian Restaurant. The chicken masala was smooth and the chunks of meat were tender and large. Delivery was courteous and the time estimate they gave us was accurate. The price isn't "cheap" but it's definitely reasonable for the perfect blend of spices you get along with the generous portions or sauces and naan. The coconut naan thing was so good! One is enough for three people if you're eating it as a dessert. One thing though...if you get the mango lassi, it is a bit heavy on the cardamom. My boyfriend loved it, I thought it was too much...so to each their own.
