Always wanted to try this place, so I went for lunch today.  Good sandwich.  Too bad the size of the steak was very, very, very small.  I felt like I was eating a mini cheesesteak.  Now I am still hungry and have to go find something else to eat.  Not worth $9.  Not even close.  You might be able to  get away with charging tourists that, but not me.  NEVER AGAIN.  Rip-off.
