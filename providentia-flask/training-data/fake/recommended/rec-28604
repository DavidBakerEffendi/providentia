I got the sweet potato mash with Moroccan chicken... It was a tad spicy but super tasty and filling. A little steep in price for a bowl, but I'd rather pay a little more for the quality I know I'm getting. Watermelon water was good but not mind blowing. Cocoa figs (packaged) were really yummy treats, albeit pricey. I'm a sucker for chia pudding and Hu's is no exception. Love the extra cinnamon spice on the vanilla chia. Mmm! I'll for sure be back to sample everything else!
