David Chang's food is expensive but I have to say it's really good.  The best deal is his Bo Ssam dinner: a whole pork shoulder, oysters, and unlimited condiments/lettuce/rice.  It's $200 but split among 10 people, it's a pretty nice deal.  Unfortunately, it's only offered during weird hours (5pm or 10pm/11pm) to not mess up the dinner rush since it will take you a while to eat the pork.  If it takes you less than an hour, then you belong in food competitions.  Also, you have to make a reservation online at least 2 days in advance since it takes 6-8 hours to cook the pork so that it's tender.  Warning: you will be stuffed but you'll be happy that you managed to eat everything and tell about it.
