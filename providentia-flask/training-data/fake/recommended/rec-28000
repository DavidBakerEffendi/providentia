Small but lovely little French brunch spot. There was a wait on a Saturday (of course) but the nearby shopping makes it painless. Seated at an itty bitty table along the staircase and next to the bar, we were presented little menus and a little book of drink options. I had the salmon/egg dish, which also arrived on an itty bitty plate. It was delicious and a great option for brunch- I never like anything too heavy. The menu was definitely interesting and I would love to return, donning stripes, red lipstick and flats of course. Bonjour.
