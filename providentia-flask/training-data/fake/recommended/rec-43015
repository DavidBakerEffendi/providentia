I feel horrible because it was two years ago that M and I went to Perilla for a special meal out so I can't do into what every dish was and the nuances of the flavors and all that. I can say that it was one of my top 3 meals in 2007 and made for a wonderful night. The service was excellent and the food was flawless and very inventive. If you haven't been, you're missing out big time.
