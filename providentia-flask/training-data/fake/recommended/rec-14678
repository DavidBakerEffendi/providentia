I had a difficult time deciding how many stars to give, but I think I'll stick with 4.  If there was a 3.5 option, that'd be it.  I love this space - the mirrors, the decoration, everything was spot on. The two of us went for dinner her on Friday, and apparently, that's too early for ilili because we were seated in the side room.  It's almost as if they want to penalize you for coming to the restaurant early rather than give you the prime seats in the main dining room.  Our waitress was very helpful, though I couldn't understand some of the things she was saying due to her accent, but overall, couldn't be happier with her service. We ordered: - Moujadara - Warm Eggplant (you have to order this, my friend who doesn't like eggplants even like it - Octopus (this is a tiny portion - good, but tiny) - Calamari - Bulghur Bin Banadura and for dessert, we had the ilili candy bar (aptly named - a large decadent candy bar of milk chocolate) The highlights were the octopus and the warm eggplant.  I love eggplant, this is definitely one of the best eggplants I've eaten.  My friend who doesn't eat eggplant ate half the dish!  Octopus was delightful, but the calamari was just okay (the oil at the bottom of the plate was delish tho).  Not a fan of the moujjadara, it was cold, and almost felt like it should've been ice cream (it's got the same consistency as green bean ice cream), and the bulghur was that of any other restaurant. Service was great, waitress was attentive, as were all the other servers.  I do have an issue with one of the guys sweeping the room while we were eating.  It wasn't that something had been dropped and needed to be cleaned, it was like they forget to sweep before we got there, and thought it was appropriate to do that while we were dining. Overall, 4 stars for the ambiance, waiter 4 stars, but 3 stars for the hostess seating us in the back room and the wait staff cleaning the place while we were eating.
