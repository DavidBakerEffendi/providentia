This place is not your typical Vietnamese restaurant.  It serves quality over quantity, and I think the extra buck is worth it.  I absolutely love the spring rolls there, it always comes out piping hot and extra crispy.  Some of my friends are disappointed by the small size of the pho dish, but that's what the apps are for!  Fill up on some apps (grilled octopus is very good, too) and then have your way with the pho.  Another plus about this joint is that you can always get add-ons.  For example, I can request for some delicious shrimpies to be tossed into the pho, or request a side of grilled octopus with a broken rice dish.  Vietnam Cafe is a neighborhood gem, and worth the trip to West Philadelphia.
