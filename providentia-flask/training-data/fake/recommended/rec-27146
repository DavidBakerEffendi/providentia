Went to Sotto 13 last night with a good friend for Tapas and Drinks! The ambiance is very trendy with elegant decor and dim lighting. The music that was playing was fun and modern which was great for an after work happy hour meet up. Â The drinks were good and so was the food. Ordered: Garlic & butter roasted snails Cheese Plate Prawns Drinks: Kickin' Olive Pineapple - Lemongrass Margarita It was our servers first night working at Sotto 13 and he seemed like a really cool down to earth server. Had two other people stop by to check up on us and they were really nice as well. I really want to come back and do the $29 Boozy Brunch and also try out the Prosecco Bar
