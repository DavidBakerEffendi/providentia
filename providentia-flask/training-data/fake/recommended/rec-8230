I'm proud to say I was among the very first people who discovered August First - on the day they served up a few snacks several weeks before they were officially open. Hell, I watched them buy their oven and test recipes on Twitter long before that. Jodi and Phil have created that sense of "ownership" among everyone who patronizes August First, and that's part of the magic - it's not just another cafe, it's a place you feel you belong. Add to that the fact that their coffee is outstanding, their breads delectable, their lunches hearty and delicious, and it's a great place to spend your morning. Literally the most critical thing I can think of to say about this place is that it has become almost *too* popular - what started out as a quiet spot to sip coffee has become a community space that is constantly humming with activity. But that's not a bad thing - their success is well-earned, and us early-adopters feel almost like their success is our own. Check it out.
