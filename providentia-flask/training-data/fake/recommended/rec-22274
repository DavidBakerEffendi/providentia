I already reviewed their place at Orange st, so same thing. The one advantage to this new place over the old one is that it's a whole lot larger, so there is no way you won't be able to sit down. Just in case you don't want to go to the Orange st review, here it is: 'After trying their soup at CT's Chowdafest, and seeing their reviews I decided to give them a try even though it was a bit of a long walk in the snow. Well, the 5 star reviews are definitely worth it. The food is served street food style and tastes really flavorful and fresh. I didn't really realize how much food there was in my rice bowl until I was done eating it. A lot. I'd recommend trying as many of the sauces/chutneys as possible, they're all really great. Also look for their specials. One is a crushed samosa with various toppings on top which is, again, interesting (the hot/crispy samosa balanced with the yogurt sauce etc). If you like spicier foods there's also the vindaloo sauce; there's of course mango lassi too as well as masala chai that go well with the food. Also, it's pretty cheap. Amazing food, large quantities and only ~$6-7. It's a bit of a walk from my place but I'll have to come back. The two friends I came with were also amazed at the place, so there's that. The only thing I regret is not having a larger stomach, I wanted to eat more :D.'
