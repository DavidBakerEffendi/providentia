Beyoglu is one of the best restaurants on the upper east side. The service is great, make sure you make a reservation though, because it does get packed. I've tried most of what is on the menu and every time I go, it tastes just as good as the first time. The prices are fair and the amount of food they give you will almost guarantee left-overs. The staff can appear to have an attitude, but the food is so good that it's all worth it.
