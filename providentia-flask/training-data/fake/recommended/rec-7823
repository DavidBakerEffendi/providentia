Perfect way to unwind after a day of walking and hard core museum-ing. At the cafe, you'll find a young, hip (who else can get away with with a white suit and black shirt) pianist playing Chopin waltzes and Mozart sonatas while you sip your coffee. The dessert were fantastic. I highly recommend the Mozarttorte... it has a nice surprising texture.
