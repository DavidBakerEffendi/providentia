This. Place. Is. Incredible. Billed as a Sake Bar, this place serves up some great Japanese bar food at incredibly cheap prices; especially in the Times Square area! Everything is pretty much a sure hit, depending on how comfortable you are with Japanese food.  There's kara age, gyoza, ramen, udon, rice balls, then there's gizzards, natto (fermented soybeans), spicy cod roe (caviar), and yakitori (grilled skewered stuff) - all delicious! Extensive drink menu; Kirin and Sapporo on draft. I've been here countless times and it's always a good time.  And they're open until 3am!  Great for "after-show" snacking. The only critique (which can also be considered good) is they don't take reservations - you have to put your name on the waiting list when you show up.  Wait times can be up to 2 hours at busy dinner times. Best part is you can leave your number, walk around, and they'll call you when your table is almost ready!
