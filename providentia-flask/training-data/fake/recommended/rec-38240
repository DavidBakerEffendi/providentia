Very good health food place.  Be sure to call ahead because they make everything fresh so it takes 10-15 minutes for your meal.  Everything I've had has been delicious.  Can be somewhat pricey depending on which meal and options you pick, but stick to the monthly specials and you've got a healthy, filling, tasty meal for $10 or less.
