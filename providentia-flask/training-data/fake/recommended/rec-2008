3 Stars After having lunch at Jim's (my friend said that's where the locals think is one of the best cheesesteaks), the bar was set at a decent height. Pat's was the first place I tried a Philly Cheesesteak sandwich with Cheese wiz. My whole order was - Wiz Wit (cheese wiz and onions on the sandwich), American Wit (white American cheese w/ onions), and Cheese Fries. From what I had heard about this place, my expectations were low, but they were actually better than I expected. We ate at one of the tables outside, so everything was as fresh as it was gonna be......and I was surprised by 2 things....First, their bread was good, but it wasn't as fresh as Geno's or Jim's. Next, I was surprised that they didn't melt the American cheese....just put two slices down, dumped some warm (not hot) meat and onions on it and gave it to me. Cheese fries were ok, but nothing special. Both sandwiches were good (meat tasted better at Geno's and at Jim's). Service was ehh.
