I can see why so many people love Taim. Their falafel is definitely superior to Maoz, yes I love the topping bar at Maoz, but Taim's falafel are lighter, fluffier, and just all out tastier. All three flavors (original, harissa, roasted red pepper) are well seasoned and just flat out crazy delicious. The falafel are smaller, perfectly crispy on the outside, tender, and fluffy on the inside. So fricking good man. So good. I got the Mixed Falafel Platter. If you've never been here before, and you just want to try all three flavors and you have a big appetite. This dish is your best bet. It comes with three different sauces, all three types of falafel, tabbouleh, cucumber and tomato salad, and a huge schmear of hummus, as well as delicious pita sprinkled with what I'm going to call magic dust. Seriously whatever they sprinkle on that pita makes it so addictive. I will definitely be returning for more.
