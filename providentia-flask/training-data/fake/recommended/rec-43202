Found this jem today. It's self seat, booth or stools, at a counter facing the cook/kitchen. The waitress was friendly and brought large cold waters immediately upon us being seated. Their menu is long but organized which made decision making easy. I ordered the French toast with home fries and a coffee. Home fries came with option peppers and onions. I only ordered onions. My coffee came quickly and was larger and hotter than expected. The food shortly after. My French toast tasted like Christmas. The home fries buttery, crisp, and seasoned with onions. Price was more than reasonable for product. Definitely returning.
