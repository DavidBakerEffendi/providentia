I don't know much about Hungarian food, but I love love love coming to Barbara's for dinner.  I usually order the chicken paprikash with spaetzle, which is delicious.  It's warm and filling comfort food, and I usually have enough left over for lunch the next day.  The atmosphere and the appearance of the food are pretty uninspiring, but if you're looking for a quality meal, there's not much better.
