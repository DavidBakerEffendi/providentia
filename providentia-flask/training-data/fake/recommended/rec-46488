After watching the "newest Iron Chef," I just had to try his restaurant. It was one of the top 5 meals I've had in NYC. Our server, Justin, was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, and helped us make some tough choices (with so much awesomeness on the menu, it was hard to decide what to have). The only SLIGHT disappointment for me, was the lamb meatballs seemed a little dense (tonight was its debut, so I fully expect it will improve as time goes on). That said, they WERE very tasty, and the mint accented pasta accompanying the meatballs was a brilliant stroke. For my main course, the "Chicken Under a Brick" was delightful. This cooking technique provides and incredibly crisp skin, and the chicken itself was moist and incredibly flavorful. I finished off my meal with the Lady's Ashton Chocolate Cake. The texture was light and fluffy, which is a huge improvement over all of the dense flourless chocolate cakes that seem to lurk on so many menus these days. My fellow diners had the Chili Lobster w/ Texas Toast , and a Ricotta ravioli with ramps for apps, and both got high marks. For a main course, a perfectly cooked red snapper and a flat iron steak with an egg on top with broccoli rabe. Overall, this was not an inexpensive meal, but truly worth every penny.
