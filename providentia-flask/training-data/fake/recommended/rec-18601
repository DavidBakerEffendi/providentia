This place is just getting better with age! Settling in to the great space to have a cold beer and one of their amazing sandwiches is now a treat I look forward to on the weekends. You can't go wrong, but the brisket is unbelievable, the collard greens are STUPID DELICIOUS, and the beans are !@$*&%!)$! great.
