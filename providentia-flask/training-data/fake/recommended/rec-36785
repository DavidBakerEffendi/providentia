While visiting my old hometown, my good friend Dava She Wolf insisted on taking me to lunch at this amazing eatery for my birthday. So, my RCTV Exec. Producer/co-host Huge and I struggled with NYC traffic during the afternoon to arrive late for our already re-scheduled reservation, but the staff were super-cool and simply got me pointed in the right direction to the table where Dava was patiently waiting for us. Huge was trying to find parking, so I got to hang for a bit with Dava, whom I must say is one of my dearest friends. She really embodies the true old-school rock 'n' roll spirit, yet knows how to enjoy a good time in a swanky joint. (Check out her band, SHE WOLVES, Â at myspace.com/shewolves) Everything in this place is incredible. The old-style decor, the amazing service, the staff, the china, silverware--the whole bit. It's a bit expensive, but worth it. Oh, did I mention the FOOD is absolutely insanely amazing? We had some fresh seafood appetizers, and this potato thing that rocked, and one or two other things that just were out of this world. Then we had the main course--I had a chicken dish that was simply sublime! But we had eaten so much, I couldn't finish it. Dava was supposed to bring it to me at my B-day Bash later that nite, but forgot. Whatever--the rest was good enough. Then they did the birthday thing, with a killer apple tart dessert and some ice cream--the whole shebang. I got a little choked up. It was sooo good, and so special that I had cool people, a great place and awesome grub to make it one of the best birthday shindigs I've ever had. (and we got to continue the whole vibe later on at Arlene's Grocery, but that's another review). My sincerest thanx to all concerned.
