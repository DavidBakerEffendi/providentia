Great food, AMAZING drinks and really cool ambiance. This is one of my favorite little speakeasies in the West Village, very chill and laid back. The mixologists make drinks you wouldn't even imagine could taste so divine, but they do! Â It's a bit of a tight squeeze on the weekends, but it is NY...and if you're lucky enough to grab one of the coveted pieces of real estate at the bar - it'll definitely be a stop worth making!
