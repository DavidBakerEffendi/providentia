Pizzaaaa. I've been here on two occasions, both times for dinner. Meatballs: good, but not better than my moms. Spinach salad: so good! Could use another handful of greens Arugula pizza: too good. No words. Just too good. Meatball pizza: pretty good, kind of skimpy on the meatball pieces. They have spicy oil that I would recommend requesting for your pizza. It's not very spicy for me, but I'm a spice queen. Their cocktails are very yummy. Rustic ambience. The wait staff is whatever. Nothing to write home about. Fun for a date night. You know, romance and pizza.
