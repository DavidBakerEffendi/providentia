Love Kitchen Zinc! Great atmosphere and lighting. Â Offer of variety of items on the menu. Love their pizzas. Particular on make your own red pies..right amount of spice and flavor in the bacon. Satisfied every time I eat here and will definitely go back. I prefer their pizzas to Modern or even Pepe's. But that's just my choice. Happy hour everday with great prices!
