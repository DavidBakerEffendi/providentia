Got done playing several hours of basketball for the first time in ages. Feeling like I got hit by a train, and dying for some food, a friend suggested we get wraps from some place he knew. I was practically incoherent but I vaguely recall something about fried plantains, raisins, juicy chicken and felafel. I was intrigued. For like $7 I got a huge burrito called the Brothers Grimm that was just flavor upon flavor upon flavor. So good. I wish I still worked in LES. I'd eat here every day. It's that good. Only seating at counters so may not be a good place if you're looking to dine-in with a group but if you decided to do so regardless, I'd be willing to bet you'll be too busy scarfing food down to have a conversation anyway. Can't wait come come back.
