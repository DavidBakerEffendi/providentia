If you're after some tasty ramen in Philly, look no further than Nom Nom ramen. They might not have the widest selection of ramen but what they serve up is reasonably priced and tastes good. I had the shoyu ramen; tasty ramen with very good soft boiled egg which is a must-try! And it came out super quickly. Pork bun is succulent and tender! Â Definitely a good option if you're looking for a quick, non-fussy lunch or dinner.
