this place is in a good location, near some bars I frequent, and open late on weekends. So I went in for some fries the other night. Had hot dogs before, nothin really special, I mean its a hot dog shop... But I heard the fries were good. so I got some and then the owner asked me to leave. I asked why, and then saw an ex's friend. So, I said it was kinda bullshit, since I was minding my own business, and security threw me the hell out. Ok. That's his job and I wasn't trying to fight him. But once outside, I was attacked by two random drunks, the bouncer kinda warded them off after they kicked me and tried to hit me, which was cool, but as I looked up, I saw THE OWNER STANDING OVER ME AND TAKE A SWING AT ME. I guess that speaks for itself, I was on the ground, pushed into the street by security guy and now being attacked by strangers and this skinny bald guy is swinging at me too. Seriously, why did he get involved? I understand kicking people out of places, especially late nights, and I wasn't fighting a 6'2" bouncer, but the OWNER himself trying to blindside me? Don't know what to even call that...
