Saraghina is one of the few restaurants in my quiet part of Bed-Stuy...and thankfully, it's fantastic! Yes, the service can be a bit slow at times...but the food most definitely makes up for it. The staff always tells me when the kitchen is backed up. Today my server brought me a generous- and complimentary- slice of lemon almond cake to apologize for the 20 minute delay in the kitchen and to make sure I didn't starve while waiting. Very thoughtful. The drinks here? Fantastic. The bartender is a great guy, knows his drinks, and uses the best ingredients. I usually drink my liquor straight, but only here do I try their specialty drinks because I know they are made so well. Best dishes? Any of the pizza, the daily salads...honestly, everything I've had here is delicious. I take every out of town guest here because the decor is rustic and charming, and it's always a crowd pleaser.
