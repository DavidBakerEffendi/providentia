Went over the weekend It was ok The service is very good and attentive We did mention we had a birthday about 8 times but it was ignored so we sang happy birthday on our own and used the candle from the table. My food was ok It was sea bass egg battered... It was soft and had a weird taste and was served with mashed and a huge pile if spinach done on a strong olive oil One other thing I tried was the linguine and clams, same olive oil taste and a burnt garlic flavor, they didn't eat the pasta because of this.  Others enjoyed their meals. We enjoyed out company of course and desserts were flawless.   The ahi tuna was done nicely and the salmon. I think I'll try elsewhere My second visit here
