I'm from California & my boyfriend recently moved to Philadelphia.   I've made 5 visits & everytime, I make it a point to go to continentals. It's not only one of my favorite restaurants in Philadelphia, it's one of my top 5 ever.     The place is awesome, the food is great & it's a dress up or dress down...it's awesome. My favorite is the bruschetta. Nothing fancy but it's scrumptious! The signature drinks are great too! The tapas style is interesting & really fun! Highy suggest going here if you're in the area!
