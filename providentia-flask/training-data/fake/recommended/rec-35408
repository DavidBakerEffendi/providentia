Cafe Orlin is not one of those glitzy brunch places that seem to have sprung up all over manhattan...and that is part of the charm. It has a small outdoor area, but other than there is nothing special in terms of ambiance. I would say they serve one of the better coffees compared to other brunch places and the food was, although nothing stood out, just right. Both tasty and the right portion. For brunch, isn't that all we need? Good coffee, comfort food and the laid back atmosphere. I don't know if it is worth the wait though, because sometimes the line can get pretty long. Service can be a bit slow, especially when the place is full. You would think they would have a couple of extra staff on those sunny weekends to fix this problem. One of those places where if you do visit, you won't be disappointed. But also one of those places you don't really crave for.
