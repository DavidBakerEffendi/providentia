Although I'm usually not a huge flatbread fan, this place was exceptional! Not only does this place brew their own beer- Zero gravity- they also do growler fills. Our service was great. Another busy one- be prepared to wait. It's worth it though! We shared a large flatbread- they even let you do half and half on special flatbreads. Do it! Sooooooo good! Everything is farm to table.
