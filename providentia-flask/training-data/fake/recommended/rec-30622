Ehh,  I wouldn't recommend running here. I went for brunch with a friend a couple months ago. There are very limited options in the Bed Stuy area, so I was thrilled to try it. I had the fried chicken (of course) , grilled asparagus and potatoes . It was a good dish,.. not hardly the BEST ever. I haven't tried it since and I live 3 blocks away. My friend had the trout or salmon.. (can't remember) & he kept picking at MY plate. Not that it sucks.. just wasn't spectacular to me. However, the drinks are amazing. Very strong.. just how I like it :) The space was a bit awkward. I felt claustrophobic since the tables have no room between. It was pretty packed when I went on a Sunday.  Cash only - as well. Honestly. There are no options in Bed Stuy, so residents are delighted to have somewhere to go. 5 Stars, in my opinion, is awfully high. Don't go with the same expectations I had.  But try the chicken.. it supposedly is their best dish.
