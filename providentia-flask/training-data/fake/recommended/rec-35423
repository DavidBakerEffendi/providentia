I went for dinner last night around 9pm and since we are a group of 10. We ending up waiting for 1 hour for our table. They spend quite some money to decorate this restaurant. I had been this restaurant in Japan and the way they look in Japan is way more simpler. I order the 1st soup on the menu; it was $13 dollars. In Japan they charge around $10 dollars. But this noodles house can sit a lot of people. When you have a group of ten people. Most likely you might be able to sit in 1 big table together. But I saw most of the 2 people who came in to dine in. They ending up sitting into a big table and share with stranger. If you are looking for a place to sit and chat. I wouldn't recommending this restaurant. Over all their ramen soup; I would really say is the best I had ever had. They also do fried chicken; I like the sauce that they served with it. And I also loved their mentigo on rice. Yummy. I sure will go back to this place as much as I can. But I will try to go sometime that is not as packed as Saturday night.
