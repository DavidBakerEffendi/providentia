Returned to Upstairs for a late dinner Friday night. Our table shared 4 small plates and 2 big plates. -Grilled octopus w/ black beans, tomato and sopressata. Very fresh, tender and juicy, Some of the best octopus I've ever had. The broth like sauce coating the beans with the tomato was very savory and the the crisp bits sopressata were a nice touch. -Toast w/ ricotta and roasted tomato. The ricotta was very creamy and rich on thick slices of grilled bread with a sweet tomato spread on top of the cheese. Was thinking about asking for some red pepper flakes to sprinkle on top but I refrained..next time, next time. -Faro stir fry w/ mushrooms and seasonal root vegetables. The faro is cooked just right, with a little chew to it. The earthy mushrooms and vegetables were a nice touch. -Pork belly w/ egg, salad and smoked cabbage. Pork belly was tender and crisp on the outside. The runny egg was nice with the smoky cabbage and dressed salad greens all adding up to a barbecue kind of flavor (pulled pork w/ coleslaw, smoky, tangy, creamy, etc). It was really good. -Scallops w/ apples, almonds over almond puree. The scallops were seared nicely, perfectly moist and tender. The sweet cooked apples reminded me of a sweet potato or platain but with a softer texture. The almonds added some nice texture and the puree tied it all together. Very unique dish, but very tasty. -Skirt steak w/ chimichurri, salad and barbecue potatoes. The steak was juicy and flavorful. The chimichurri, greens and pickled onions added brightness and acidity contrasting with the crisp fried potatoes dusted with barbecue spices. The potatoes could have used a dipping sauce but were still tasty. Overall, we enjoyed our meal and drinks. Great service, atmosphere and futuristic Japanese toilets- Thumbs up.
