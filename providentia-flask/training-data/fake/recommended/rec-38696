I went to Black Eyed Sally's last night to celebrate a friend's birthday last night. It was my first time visiting, and I was very optimistic. We came in with a group of 18 people for a reservation that had been made in advance, and after 10 minutes of standing around, were seated. I expected everything to take a bit longer because the group was rather large, but I was not prepared for my experience. The food was really quite good. I sampled several dishes from my friends surrounding me at the table, and all were delicious, well-seasoned, and cooked appropriately, so bravo to the kitchen staff. The service, on the other hand, was atrocious. We sat for a very long time before someone came over to take a first drink order. After an excruciatingly long wait, drinks finally arrived, but I still had hope. Every person at the table had finished their drinks (including beers, martinis, etc.) before we even saw our waitress again. By the time the waitress came around to order food, we had been sitting for an hour and a half (not an exaggeration) and only had one drink on the table. The waitress was unfriendly at best, and clearly knew that she would get a gratuity automatically added to the bill and therefore put in zero effort. It's a shame, because had she been more attentive, there were several people in my party who would have been willing to buy more drinks and tip higher. Unfortunately, I've never seen wait staff so terrible.
