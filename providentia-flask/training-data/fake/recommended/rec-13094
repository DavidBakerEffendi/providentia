What a lovely brunch place. It had the prefect combination of ambiance, quality of food, reasonably attentive staff. It was perhaps the time of the day we went that there was no wait but it was real nice to just walk in a nice place and be seated immediately. The portions were perfect for us we didnt really leave much behind and the no refill on coffee was worth it as my husband compared their coffee to the best he has had in Europe. So thats a big compliment. Priced reasonably, portions good, enough vegetarian options that I actually was able to choose what I ate and well seasoned food! Its my pet peeve adding salt and pepper to flavor the food minimally.
