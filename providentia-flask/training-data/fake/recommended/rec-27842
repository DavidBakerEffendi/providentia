I agree with the previous review...AWESOME food, yet prices have gone up and portions have decreased.  Yet still great taste! Also across from where I live, so it has become a staple.  My faves are the churrasco, tostones, maduros and yuca fries.  Also their garlic and green sauces are AMAZING! I always ask for extra and use them again in my cooking. Also if looking for dessert, get the chocolate flourless cake and the cafe con leche :)
