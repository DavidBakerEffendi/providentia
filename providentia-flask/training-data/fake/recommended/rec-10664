My god, we had the plantains - incredible! Everything from the ribs to the sausages were great. Perfect example of a dive restaurant! My only issue would be the few bones I picked out of the chicken quesadilla I ordered; I understand the nature of less processed foods, but that sort of thing is always a star off at least...
