For the past year my boyfriend has been trying to get me to go here. I wasn't sure what Turkish food was so I was hesitant. Last night was his birthday so we went. The outside doesn't look like much, and actually the inside doesn't either. But it was probably the best meal I've had in ages. Absolutely phenomenal. We started with the cold salad appetizer so we could try a few different things... So good. Then I had the mixed chicken grill. The chicken kabob was the best out of the three. Super tender and so full of delicious flavored. Reviewers mentioned the baklava so we ended with that. I thought I had died Â and gone to heaven. Honestly, I cannot wait to go back. The BYOB is nice, especially with no corking fee!
