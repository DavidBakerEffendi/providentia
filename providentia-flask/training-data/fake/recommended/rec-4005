I've passed this spot a few times and finally, at the behest of a former intern who lives nearby, I went there for brunch on a warm November Sunday and it was relatively quiet. We had the funghi pizza and the salad. It was delicious. Not only was our waitress friendly and attentive, she gave my 5 year old some crayons and coloring sheets so she could get her Picasso on, which she did vigorously. My next visit was sans child and we had the margherita pizza with tiramisu (a dessert sent from the heavens) and coffee afterwards. The pizza was just as delicious and the tiramisu was perfect. Again, our waitress was amazing and I'll go back again and again.
