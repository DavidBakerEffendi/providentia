Small, very friendly cafe with the best iced coffee in the neighborhood. I've wavered between Gregory's and Sbux for years. These guys opened a few months ago and shortly after won me over with their excellent iced coffee - with coffee ice cubes! Owner is very friendly, conversational, and gets to know the customer. Check them out, highly recommended.
