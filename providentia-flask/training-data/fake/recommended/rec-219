I had my birthday party here on a Saturday night. The manager that I arranged the party with was so helpful and very flexible. We had about 20 people- all you can eat small plates and unlimited sangria and it was one of the best deals in the city and such a great time. The flamenco show was just the icing on the cake. I have planned and been to many birthdays all over the city and this was one of the best experiences I have had- so easy and no stress involved! I would highly recommend this restaurant
