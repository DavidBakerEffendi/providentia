Definitely too much hype. Not worth 4 stars. Underwhelming food. Standard tuna tartare, basic arugula salad, French fries could have come from Burger King (the Gorgonzola sauce was good but not mind blowing), "mushroom truffle turkey burger" was dry, and could have been made at any deli. Service was okay. Prices are standard, not expensive but too expensive for the quality of the food. If you have any sort of palate or enjoy good food, don't come here. If you're hungry and looking for standard fare that doesn't suck, it's a good option.
