I am writing this review strictly for Seahorse's BRUNCH. I have visited Seahorse over 6 times now for brunch and still have yet to disappoint. The reason I've frequented there so often for brunch is because they have one of the largest brunch menus available (2 large pages).  I love it.  You can find anything from eggs and grits, to eggs Benedict over crab cakes, to Cap'n Crunch french toast (which I still have yet to try), to pork chops, and of course fish tacos. The atmosphere is cutely decorated with a marine theme.  The last 3 times I've went I noticed a lot of families dining there, and more kids then normal, but it was cool. Their food is reasonably priced.  Mason jar Bloody Mary's and fresh lemonade are great, the mimosas are served in flute champagne glasses and are yummy, but a little pricey for the size. Every time I leave I always say to myself, I have to come back for Happy Hour or dinner....Got to make that happen soon! ;)
