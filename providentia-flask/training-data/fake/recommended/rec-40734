I can't say enough about this place. I am completely in love with Sarcone's hoagies. I now live in Boston which is dreadfully sad because I used to live a 3 minute walk from this magical place. However... Every time I go home to visit, Sarcone's is one of the first stops I make. The bread... the fillings... Did I mention the bread? That's really what makes the sandwich although... I say that knowing how amazing everything INSIDE the bread is... One of my favorites is the fresh mozz hoagie. I believe this is a testament to how good the ingredients are because there are really only three in this sandwich: bread, fresh mozz and roasted red peppers. For this to be an excellent hoagie, every single ingredient needs to be at its best... and they always are. Go here. It does not disappoint. Not to mention it's a great slice of south philly. MMMMMMM.
