This is the greatest place ever. Adorable, bustling but not chaotic. Waitress was great, very thoughtful and nice and professional. I saw the owner milling around and he didn't seem like a dick at all. I say this because I worked in restaurants for years and owners often are and yell at their employees. This guy, the grandson of the person who opened this place, I think the waitress said, seemed really nice and helpful. I haven't eaten dinner here but I can tell you that both the pumpkin cheesecake and tiramisu are BOMB. Bee oh em bee bee. We also had mulled wine, which was really tasty although we wished they serve it glasses with wider mouths. The mugs are tall and skinny and a little awkward to drink out of because they get hot. There's jazz in the downstairs room that I didn't know about until I went to the bathroom. WIll definitely go for the jazz next time. It's been crowded both times that I've been there but with pretty mellow people. Some on dates, some tourists and locals but no bro-dawggy frat douche types that I've seen. I moved to NYC in October and this is one of my favorite places so far.
