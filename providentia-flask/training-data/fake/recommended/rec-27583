When my friend Meredith turned me down an alley on the Lower East Side, I thought she was going to knife me or sell me into white slavery. It was a huge relief when she took me to lunch instead. The food at Freeman's is good - simple, yummy, and bountiful. You get a lot of bang for your buck. I could have stopped after the artichoke dip alone. It was warm, cheesy and came with so much bread it made my sandwich irrelevant. But it was still good when it came - the chicken club was well put together and the beer battered fish sandwich was nice and tasty. It could have maybe used a touch of salt though. Overall, it was a great, if somewhat overly hipster (I swear, the guy next to me had giant black plastic glasses - the kind that nerds wear in movies about Williamsburg - stereotypes come true sometimes) lunch.
