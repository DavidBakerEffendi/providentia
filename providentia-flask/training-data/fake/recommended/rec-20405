Buttermilk Channel is a fun restaurant with a really clean and nice smelling bathroom (one of the most important things to this reviewer), my group felt right at home with the really cool decor and the owner, Doug, is a really friendly guy.  I would highly recommend the chicken and waffles, it is excellent.  Also the butternut squash is definitely worth checking out along with the excellent bread pudding for desert.  We also learned that the Buttermilk Channel is the body of water between Governor's Island and Brooklyn, the menu has the depths of the water on the back page.  For people who want to go check out music at the Bell House afterwards, it is only a 15 minute walk across the scenic Gowanus Canal!
