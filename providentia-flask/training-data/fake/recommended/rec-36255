I have been coming here since I was a kid. The staff love making conversation and they're great with the old people. I think this place has a somewhat grimy feeling to it when you first sit down, but I have never seen a cockaroach here. Besides, that feeling automatically disappears once the food arrives (might i add that the service time is perfect?). Definitely my go-to-place if I am in the neighborhood.
