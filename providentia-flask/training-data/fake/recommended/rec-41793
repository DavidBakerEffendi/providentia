guero's tacos beat out neighboring chavelas' tacos by a landslide.  try the shrimp tacos -not only are they one of the fastest ones to come out of the kitchen, they have the perfect blend of crunch and chewiness encased in a sturdy tortilla.  their food is best when eaten IN their tiny dining area.  i've ordered delivery a couple of times and I live a few blocks away and everything arrived cold.  just the nature of taco delivery, i suppose!
