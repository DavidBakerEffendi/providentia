I went here yesterday for the first time and had the best omelette. Dinner has been my meal of choice, so checking out a breakfast/brunch is not necessarily my forte. The food here is absolutely delicious & freshly made! I had a Southwestern omelette with chorizo, cilantro, Monterrey Jack & cheddar cheese inside along with home fries & multigrain toast. Everything on my plate was gone & enjoyed fully! The service was great as well! I definitely will be returning! :-)
