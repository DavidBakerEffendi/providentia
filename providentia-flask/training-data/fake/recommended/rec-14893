Cute little place in the heart of the Old City nightlife on Chestnut St. Some tables outside but its a little too crowded for that. Cool decor inside, although looked semi under construction. Small place, tables close together.. Good service, and its BYOB!! They have some pretty cool different rolls, there was one that was like a fish taco roll, YUM. They also have a sweet potato tempura roll which is what really sold me on it. Id go back.
