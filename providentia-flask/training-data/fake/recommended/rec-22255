Typical inexpensive chain restaurant. I was down in NJ by myself for business and my waitress was very good. The mango peach lemonade slush was very good and had free refills! I had a the Petite Sirloin topped with Langostino Lobster. It wasn't the greatest but it wasn't terrible neither. I finished off my late night dinner with a Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie slice and it hit the spot and was tastier than I expected.
