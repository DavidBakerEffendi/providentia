Let me begin by saying that I did not experience the 1/2 price tapas and happy hour deals that this restaurant offers. As such, one might consider this a "baseline" review and that the score might have been higher had I been offered a 50% discount or free drinks. My first reaction to this place was that it was too cluttered. I respect a restaurant that draws crowds of loyal customers, but Yuca was simply cluttered in the sense that the management decided to fit in more tables that than the space should accommodate. My party and I were shoehorned into a table where we were practically sitting on top of the customers next to us. The food was quite good, actually, but not worth the exorbitant prices. I mean, is it unfair to say that $9 is too expensive for guac and chips? They were good chips! But $9?? No. How about $11 for three tapas-sized chicken tacos (listed as taquitos, but whatever)? It's very rare that I complain about prices, since I always look at a restaurant's menu beforehand, but considering the mediocre service and poor atmosphere, Yuca Bar was just not worth my money. I have no inclination to return.
