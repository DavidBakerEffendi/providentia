Have been wanting to try Becco for a lonnnnnng time.  It was a bit disappointing...  Did the all-you-can-eat pasta dinner w/ salad for $21.95...  What a great deal...  Too bad the food was nothing to shout about... and the atmosphere was touristy and cramped.  Well...  I guess that's to be expected on Restaurant Row!
