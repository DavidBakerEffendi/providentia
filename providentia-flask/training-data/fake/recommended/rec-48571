Oh Tatooed Mom, Tattooed Mom...what an experience you gave me! SSssooo I head over to this spot super late probably like a hour or two before they close. It wasn't crowded, we were quickly seated and handed a menu. The menu was short and too the point. Not many selections so I decided to get a order of wings. Can't go wrong with wings right? Well, they were just ok. Nothing to write home about. They did the job of keeping me fed while I was busy downing Pink Puss's that just seemed to keep coming back to back...well ok ok they kept coming because I kept ordering them cause a sistah was on a mission to drink, drink and drink that night! LOL #missionaccomplished The customer service...LMAO @ the thought. So we get this chick who obviously felt like she was at home chilling and just had to feed her friends because she was just so relaxed that she took the enthusiasm out of the atmosphere of the place. She was no help in helping us decide on what was good. Nor was she in a good mood. It was like "Hey, here's the menu, what do you want??" My friend saw on the menu somewhere that they had Taco's on Tuesday. The menu was so small he asked could he order Taco's and would pay extra and the waitress just gave a flat out cold azz said NO! After that point I knew that I would definitely NOT be ordering anything else...so from that point the drinking commenced even more. On a the note of drinking the Pink Puss was DELICOUS!! Don't ask me what was in it cause I don't remember BUT I think it was Vodka. At any rate, I would definitely have no problem stopping back in just to go to the bar and grab a quick drink but not to eat. I only gave 2 stars because 1 they were open late, had cool d√©cor and the drinks were on point.
