Solid Chinese food - Â I usually order delivery of Hunan beef. Although I have no complains about the food quality (some other Chinese joints cause my stomach to revolt), they tend to forget chopsticks. I keep reminding them every time i call and order, and they always assure me "yes ma'am we will have chopsticks for you". So I open the bag and guess what..."no chopsticks!". And the poor delivery man, when I ask him about chopsticks, just looks very confused and with a broken English says "sorry mo chopsticks"... Ugh fork has to suffice...
