This is the best thing when you dont want fast food, or Kentucky Fried Chicken, or chinese in the area.  Its the closest thing to my home cooking I am going to get and I love the Arroz con Bistec - Steak and Rice.  My sister get the chicken soup and loves it.  I also love the Tres Leche Cake - 3 Milk Cake, its like Angel Food Cake soaked in sweet milk!  Love this place and the prices.
