Love the decor! We ordered takeout and everything was made as specified. I had a bit of a picky order....... Cheeseburger, med-rare no bun extra lettuce. It was huge, juicy, cheesy and perfect!!!! We also ordered the Jamaican Jerk wings and they were good too but very spicy. Service was good, food was good that's what counts right? Â Would have loved to catch the burlesque show ;) Oh and if we were locals we'd totally hit this place up on the regular, tonight was Wednesday- Beer and Bacon night!!!!!!! They had bacon salted fries, bacon pops and bacon cupcakes amongst other delicious sounding bacon delights on the menu.
