Awesome little spot. I took my girl here for her birthday dinner and we both loved it. Granted, it was a Monday so the place wasn't packed, but that said: Service: 5/5: Excellent, warm, welcoming. The server took his time with us to explain dishes, make recommendations, and answer questions.  At one point they brought out an extra dish due to a miscommunication while ordering and when I mentioned it, they immediately apologized and said ti was on the house. Food: 5/5: Everything was flavorful and delicious. We had the - skirt steak: tender, good-sized portion - stewed meatballs: the meatballs and the brandy sauce were each great on their own, amazing together - white asparagus: very soft and tasty, but it only comes with 2 pieces - Spanish octopus in EVOO: AMAZING. They boil the octopus instead of grilling it, giving it a very soft, tender texture (like very tender abolone or scallop, instead of chewy like calamari). It melted like butter in your mouth. - mixed seafood in cider & olive oil: Good dish, but the octopus in this dish was more chewy and similar to the usual texture I expect from octopus - Red sangria: did the trick, was $20 for a pitcher (I think it was a special that night), they also have 4 other flavors Ambience: 4/5: One side has all exposed brick, representative of NYC. The other is painted with a Spanish-themes motif.  Multiple little tables with plenty of elbow room. Good music (mix of spanish guitar and various other sounds with Latin roots, I heard 3 Manu Chao songs during our dinner). Price: 4.5/5:  Not bad, as far as tapas go. All in all, a cute little tapas spot with great food, service, and atmosphere for a very reasonable price in a great location. Will definitely return, I had no complaints.
