Delicious cheesesteaks! Flavorful meat and plenty of melted cheese mixed in with the steak! My favorite cheesesteak in Philly so far! Cheesesteaks were a little on the smaller side but the taste made up for it. Chicken fingers for my kids were made of real chicken tender meat, always my preference! The customer service ALWAYS sucks at these Philly cheesesteak places. I know, I know it's the thing to be rude and expect your customers to DEAL WITH IT cause you're some popular east coast eatery...but seriously Philly...get over yourselves!!!! Because of that I deduct 1 star and will not be back until I try every other cheesesteak place recommended in Philly. See your loss, not mine! Thats why the rest of the world values their customers.
