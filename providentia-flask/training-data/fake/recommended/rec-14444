Pizza was good. I guess I was expecting to be blown away based on the reviews. I'm a native NYC gal so I prefer regular mozzarella cheese as opposed to buffalo mozzarella.  Service was fair. They served my friends pasta dish's ten minutes before the pizza.   The atmosphere was good and the kitschy decor makes it a fun place to take children. I would return!
