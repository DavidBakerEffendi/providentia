Just had Tina's for the first time and it was fantastic! The size of the chef salad was huge and there was no skimping with cheap cold cuts.  My daughter had the stuffed shells - she loved the pasta and the sauce. The filling was a little too wet for her performance but she enjoyed it thoroughly.   Delivery was quick and the food was delivered hot. We will definitely be ordering again.
