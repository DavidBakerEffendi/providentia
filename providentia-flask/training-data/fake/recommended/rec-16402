The ambiance is nice, they have some very good bread (especially their pizza bread) & there were no obnoxious, noisy children (the one kid sitting near us was a polite, well behaved young gentleman) but I was kind of disappointed. My husband had read about how great the chicken parm was here.  I get the menu & there's no chicken parm listed that night despite it being on the website and my husband's report. Instead, I opted for a chicken dish with potatoes, Italian sausage & red peppers in an olive oil and white wine sauce.  I hadn't had this before nor that type of sauce so I decided to try it and see what I thought.  Nothing like trial & error. My food arrives & does not come with a sharp knife for chopping.  The chicken and potato pieces are gigantic.  I am a tiny woman, meaning I have a smaller stomach.  Trying to improvise, I chop up a piece of chicken with my butter knife.  The piece I'm cutting proceeds to fly off my plate, hit my napkin & lands on the floor. After abandoning modesty and just eating these big pieces in bites I'm comfortable with, my husband starts choking on his food.  This freaked me out for a moment.  Once he recovered, he told me the piece of chicken he had in his dish was too big and caused him to choke. Overall, I found the red pepper was great in the sauce but the rest was not as appetizing to me.  For dessert, we had tiramisu (a classic Italian dessert).  It was okay & did have a caramel sauce that had not been part of any other tiramisu I've ever had but was not my all time favorite.  Maybe the chocolate cake would have been better; it did tempt me. Service wasn't an issue at all; this is just more about my feelings and experience with the food.  I might come back if they had chicken parm on the menu that day but I'd need to know before putting in a reservation (another plus; we got in without any problem with our reservation).
