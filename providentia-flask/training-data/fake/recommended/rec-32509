I was certainly impressed. We were fortunate enough to get a table right away on a Sunday! There was only two of us, and I suppose this may have just been a rare stroke of luck. Anyway, the service in general was great. The waiters were very nice and everything was done in a timely manner. The atmosphere of the place is cute and cozy. Our table was practically joined with another couple's table who we didn't know, but it didn't faze us. We are coffee fanatics, so we ordered two double espressos and a small french press. The serving size of the espresso is generous compared to most places and it was delicious! The french press coffee was delicious as well and when mixed together you get the perfect red eye! I find that usually restaurants don't do coffee well, but this place is the exception. The food is delectable as well of course. I had the popeye crepe and my boyfriend had the Sultan. I don't even like Swiss cheese but I loved the crepe. I know, why would I order something with Swiss cheese if I don't like it? Well, I can tell you it didn't matter, the crepe was fabulous. The Sultan appeared to have a generous amount of chicken and my boyfriend loved it. He would give this place 5 stars as well if he had a yelp account.
