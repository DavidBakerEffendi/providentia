Wow, I can't believe anyone dislikes this place.  The neighborhood stinks, the restaurant is closed on random days, the hipster crowd is blasé... But the burger--the burger is AWESOME.  Order a Kobe burger medium rare and add harissa aioli and you'll be set.  The fries are perfect too.  In between steak fries and shoestring fries in size, they come out perfectly cooked and tasty.  I can't speak for the shake (yet), but I'll think about it for the next time.
