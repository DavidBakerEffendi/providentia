Reviewed: 12/30/2009 So apparently my sis and I caught Ippudo's last opening day of the year (they will be closed starting tomorrow and until Jan. 3rd, 2010). After my first dining experience at Ippudo, I don't think I can ever eat my own ramen again.....of course, I am not really comparing apples to apples, haha. The restaurant is creatively decorated -- with dried ramen underlain as tabletop decorations, fancy ramen bowls pinned on the wall, and an open kitchen that allows the cooking aroma to conveniently grab hold of hungry stomachs..this place feels more like a hip night bar than your usual Japanese restaurant. I tried the Akamaru Modern and their "Special Ramen of the Day". Personally, I felt that both bowls tasted pretty similar, but I would prefer the Akamaru Modern due to the tenderness of the pork. Besides the meat, the egg yolk was the next best thing in the bowl: it wasn't too dry and the yolk really soaked up the strong flavor of the broth. The broth on the other hand, was great too, but a little too salty and oily. The greasy after taste was a little too much for me. However, the ramen itself (and probably the most important thing in the bowl) was nice and chewy, and had the perfect thickness. The price is a bit expensive, though - $14 for a bowl of ramen. The Hirata Buns looked great too, but we were too full to try more. Ramen Rating: 3/5
