This restaurant is wonderful. I'm not too sure about why the other reviews are not that great. I'll break this place down for you. Service: This isn't the type of place where you will be served on hand and foot. Its just a mom and her son, sometimes another waiter, that run the place. They are really nice, but mostly just laid back people. They're always walking around, but the environment is lax. This is a REAL Mexican joint. They run it that way. If you're looking for super bubbly waitresses coming up to you every 5 minutes, don't go here. I prefer service this way. Its a little bit slow, but you enjoy it more. Food: Delicious. I wouldn't go here if it wasn't. Its completely authentic. Its hot, spicy, and fresh. All of things you want your Mexican food to be. Their salsa is some of the best. I think if they bottled it and sold it, they would make a killing. The chipotle bbq and jalape√±o peppers with the special cheese on top is one of my favorite dishes period. The chipotle BBQ peppers smell like smokey heaven. You can get pretty much any combination you want - burrito, taco, enchilada. Atmosphere: Laid back. This is like you're going to your friends mom's house, and she's going to cook you a bomb dinner. Nothing fancy, just some good food. I really suggest trying this place. I've been many times, and will return many more.
