small and close quarters... it was PERFECT.  A great spot with yummy small bites.  Very good guac and the mini tacos were spot on.  The hit of the show however was the mix drinks.  I am a wine drinker but even I was blown away by the Margaritas.  The best I have ever had... bar none.  The hot pepper margarita was mind blowing.   A must hit spot.  Check out the little wine bar two doors down while you wait.  Another great little spot.
