After all the raving reviews on this place I knew I had to try it. The food does not disappoint. I had the infamous blueberry pancakes, full of big, fresh blueberries. The maple butter added incredible flavor. I also could not pass up the sugar-cured bacon, after trying died and went to breakfast heaven. I am not a bacon fan by any means, but I have not had such deliciousness since brunch at Shaw's Crab House in Chicago. It was a bit pricey though, $20+ tip for the pancakes, bacon, and juice. The service does leave a bit to be desired. The place is cramped so they shoo you outside to wait for a table. I waited 20 minutes after being told 10 and I'm pretty sure three parties who arrived after me were seated first. But even that wouldn't be enough to keep me from coming back.
