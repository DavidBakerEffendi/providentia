I'd walked past this place numerous times, and it always looked cozy and intimate. When the weather got colder, they put out a sign for mulled wine which is what drew me in when I finally went. My friend and I just went for a pre-dinner drink on a Friday night, but the staff were very friendly, and attentive without making us feel crowded or rushed. We both got mulled wine and sat for an hour or so. We weren't pressured into ordering more which was nice. They topped up our water as needed. The atmosphere is really lovely. Music that's not too loud so you can actually have a conversation, bookshelves with little tchotchkes, wine and christmas wreaths scattered around. Lots of beautiful timber and exposed brick. Just the epitome of NYC, really. As I said, we didn't order food, but the guys sitting next to us had an amazing looking cheese platter with grapes and a basket of crusty bread. They were French, and they polished off all the cheeses so I suspect the food is good. Jadis is charming!
