I visited Philly Feb' of last year, and I decided to stop here (Before I knew about Yelp, sadly) because it's the touristy thing to do. I wasn't impressed, service was decent and I liked the hot sauce and peppers. To be honest, I've had better philly cheese steaks at hole-in-the-walls around the tristate, but I enjoyed the experience. Didn't go to Pat's it was too busy, and it was too cold and windy.
