My friend suggested this place for dinner and after glancing at the website I was impressed and had to eat there.  The Venezuelan cuisine was very impressive.  However, I would have been better served by being more informed about the menu.  The food was amazing, we just ordered way too much of it. The place is decorated like it was still under construction with unfinished plywood walls and no bar.  Seriously, community boards suck.  We luckily got a seat in the back garden where the décor wasn't go oppressive. Between four people we ordered five arepas, three sides, two soups and a combination plate. OMG.  We could hardly eat half of it.  The arepas were deceivingly big and filling.  So my suggestion is to order only two and nothing else. I had the special arepa for the night with pork shoulder, jalapenos, cheese, and fried plantains. Amazing.  The thing was crunchy and sweet and salty and just plain awesome.  I also ordered the soup special for the day which was basically a Venezuelan take on chicken soup with avocado in it.  It was very tasty but perhaps a bit under seasoned.  The Reina Pepiada was a little underwhelming: chicken and avocado salad.  I also ordered the yoyos (fried plantains with cheese in a molasses sauce) and rice and beans for the table.  Those two sides got eaten up but it was a little harder to tuck away the rest of the food. The waitress should have warned us that we were kind of over ordering.  I know this goes against their rules of squeezing the most out of customers but it would have been helpful and probably secured a second visit from us.
