pretty nice restaurant. we went there around 6pm last night,and it wasn't full. but in 10mins, the whole place is filled with people, which is a very good sign. we ordered hashitashi, tempura and zaru soba. everything is good, except one thing made me feel a little uncomfortable. they didn't put the daikon( white radish) in with the wasabi and scallions, which is very unusual, because daikon is such a basic ingredients in Japanese food. Â it should always come with the zaru soba or tempura. they gave it with the tempura, but they didn't give it with our soba noodle. my husband asked for it, and the most unheard thing is the waitress said it will cost you around $1.00. then i was very shocked, but i still want it. then i said sure. it turned out $0.75, but still, they charge you the ingredient is supposed to be included in the dish. overall this place is fine, nothing really specially good or bad.
