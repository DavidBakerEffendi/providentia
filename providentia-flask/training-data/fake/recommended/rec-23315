I usually dislike eating Italian out.  Despite not being Italian myself, I find that I am a competent enough cook that what I make at home usually far outshines the slapped-together fare found at most Italian places.  This place, along with Vetri and Modo Mio, are starting to make me change my mind.  There is no way I could create gnocchi as air light as the ones I had at Ulivo.  Every part of the meal was simple, but outstandingly well prepared by a chef who was a craftsman.  Highly recommend.
