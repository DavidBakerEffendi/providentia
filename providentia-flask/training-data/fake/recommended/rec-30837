This place is amazing!! The grits are fantastic even without any extras added. I got the mushrooms and the soft egg. Best. Decision. Ever. It was the perfect combo. A little on the spicy side but it's a great little kick for your mid morning brunch. Also, the tonics. Spot on perfection. I'd never had one before and asked the guy what they were like. He was wonderfully friendly and helpful (so was the girl helping him work the counter). I got the citrus tonic and it's delicious. Basically, this place is amazing. Everyone needs to eat here!!!
