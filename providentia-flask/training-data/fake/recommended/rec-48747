Go to Balaboosta for excellent food and good people. I went here with my parents for a 6 pm Saturday reservation. We were seated and attended to quickly. We were recommended a nice white wine and the waiter was gracious enough to go through pretty much each menu item. We ended up with hummus and bruschetta for appetizers. The pita was warm and the hummus flavorful. The bruschetta is a large piece of bread with perfectly dressed toppings (we actually thought we'd be getting a smaller shareable app). For entree, I got the chicken under a brick and highly recommend it. The skin was crisped so right and the meat was delicious. It came with a kind of succotash with homemade pesto. I'd definitely come back here. It's great for parents, friends, dates, whatever. Just be sure to make a reservation!
