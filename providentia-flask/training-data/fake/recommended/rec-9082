Don't know why this place has so many good reviews, maybe I just ordered the wrong thing but I won't be going back to try another dish.  Steer clear of the grilled vegetable panino, it is SO bland I thought I would fall asleep from boredom while eating it.  Worse yet, the foccaccia bread was horrible, not toasted on the outside at all and disgustingly gummy inside.
