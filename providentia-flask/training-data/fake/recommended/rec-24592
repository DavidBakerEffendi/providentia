I worked here when it opened.  I am out of the food service industry now and own my own business.   However, I still crave this food as much as any restaurant I worked at including some Michelin starred ones.  I think this one is better than many Michelin restaurants.   Bottom line is the Chef is sooooo good.  And every dish there is prepared so well.  The suckling pig is ridiculous (good).   That being said, working there was very difficult due to issues with management and poor support staff.  I think they broke more glasses than we even used!  Hope they ironed that out.  But that does not effect the food quality one bit.  I hope they stay around forever!!!   Oh, fantastic for groups!!
