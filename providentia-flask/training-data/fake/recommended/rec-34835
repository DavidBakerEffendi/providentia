Market Table definitely has quite ample portions for the quality and taste, and with good-sized appetizers (I had lamb and gnocchi) and filling entrees (I had a seared halibut with squash risotto, the halibut was perfect). However, I was incredibly disappointed with the desserts. Both cakes were dry, and they were served a la mode, with ice cream, to cover for bad cakes, which is not a good strategy at an establishment like this. I'd hire a pastry chef.
