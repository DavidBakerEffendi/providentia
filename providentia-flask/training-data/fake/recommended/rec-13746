I mean, clearly the chandelier is dangerous. . . why else would it be caged in a giant glass box? Whoever designed the interior of Room Service should be applauded for your kooky yet unbelievably captivating ideas-  don't mind if I steal the whole chandelier centerpiece. Or the ceiling of antique mirrors for your birds eye reflection pleasure. Or the grays, whites and stripes that sweep the walls. Room Service is swanky, sexy, no one can contest that. But maybe I enjoyed the decor more than my lunch? Don't get me wrong, the food was good and the price of their lunch special was hard to pass up. I really enjoyed my sesame tofu and the sweet dollop of sauce in the bottom of the bowl. However, I learned my lesson when asking a thai restaurant to make something spicy - Like  my massaman curry with veggie duck. A usually mild curry, I wanted it kicked up a notch . . .  I think they might as well have poured fire into it. It was SO spicy I couldn't even finish it. The veggie duck was fine, but I have had more flavorful elsewhere (see my reivew of TUK TUK in LIC). My friend enjoyed her pad-thai with veggie duck. She knew better to ask for spicy it seems. Room Service glows from the outside at night and you can't help look in, wishing you were dining there with someone special. However, their aesthetic may be more alluring than the food itself.
