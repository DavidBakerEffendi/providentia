Decided to go with a large group of coworkers for dinner during restaurant week.  We got a bottle of red wine and a bottle of white wine.  Prices start in the $40s for white wine and $50s for red wine.  We got each of the starter plates and shared.  Although all the starters were good, standouts were the kale fattoush, moussaka, and falafel.  I shared the bass bil hamod and the acquarello risotto with a friend and both were mouth watering...  super flavorful and cooked really well.  I would definitely order either of them again!  For dessert I tried the lane cheesecake and the ilili candy bar; both were quite good. A few of my coworkers are gluten free and there was some mis-information given about some of the dishes.  Our waitress Jasmine was very accommodating and brought out a few extra dishes that were gluten-free.  They also comped us 2 bottles of wine. Overall the dinner was excellent, service was great, and the restaurant has a hip, relaxed feel.  I would definitely come back, but maybe stick to happy hour or restaurant week since regular dinner prices are quite high.
