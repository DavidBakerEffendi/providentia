Went for breakfast there with 6 people this am for a family breakfast. The staff could not have been nicer and more professional! Food was awesome, timely, well prepared and presented! Prices are very reasonable given the quality and care with which it is prepared! West Coast scramble, poached pear french toast, steak and eggs, chicken and waffles, Nutella stuffed french toast and coffee were all excellent!  We WILL be back!  All aspects of the restaurant are clean and well kept.  Wish I could keep this place a secret but good food and service should be rewarded with more business!
