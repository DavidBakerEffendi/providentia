Cheap, quick and delicious. I love noodle soup, and instead of going to a customary pho place I decided to check out the hand drawn noodles. I got the U Toy With Oyster Sauce and the Lamb Noodle Soup. I've never had U Toy, which was a crunchy green vegetable, slightly weird but didn't taste bad. Warning, you do get a ton of it so plan to share. The lamb noodle soup was delicious, flavor of the broth was fully absorbed by my lamb chunks. Can't complain. The place is quite busy, but the tables turnaround quickly unless you have a large party. Overall, love it!
