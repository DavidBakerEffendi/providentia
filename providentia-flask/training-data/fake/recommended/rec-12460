This place is crazy busy. Food is great service is friendly and good. Be willing to wait. Its usually a much shorter wait than they tell u. I sat at the bar and the girl at the counter was great. I ordered the huevos rancheros and blueberry pancakes. I asked for the eggs first and then the pancakes. The eggs came our super fast and there wa a little wait for the pancakes. They were good but without the toppings (blueberries and butter syrup that tastes like butterscotch) the cakes didnt have much flavor. Look great though. Â Make sure to ask for everything you want by the time your food comes. Chances are you will not see your server after that. The only thing i guess i missed was that this place is cash only. Had to run across the street to an atm.
