OH EM GEE!!  This place is so cute and cozy.. literally.. it's a tight squeeze but so worth rubbing elbows with your neighbor and standing inside a tiny staircase to wait for a table. The wait, was not so bad... and we went on a Saturday at 9am! They have complimentary coffee, too. So, I had to try the Nutella French toast since everyone mentions it. I dont even like French toast. To be honest, I've never had it but I typically can't stand the smell of maple syrup. This, however was TO DIE FOR.  I ordered one just for myself. It was perfect. The syrup is not overly sweet OR mapley. There was just enough Nutella between the bread to not be over powering. My mom had the eggs with asperagus and feta. SO FRESH! So delish. Love the prefix brunch with choice of beverage (adult, or otherwise). Staff was super friendly as well. Sigh.. I wish I lived in NY.
