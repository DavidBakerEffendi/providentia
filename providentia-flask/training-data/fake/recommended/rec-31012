We were seated right away--a pleasant surprise. Everything looked scrumptious as it went by, and we ordered according to what looked good. The blood-orange margaritas are fab! I had two of them, but I felt as though that was enough--my head was singing by the end of the meal. Â The macho nachos were deliciously cheesy. The guac was outstanding. Had the shrimp tacos and orange flan for dessert. The decor is youthful and fun. The atmosphere is casual, and the service was excellent; my waitress was pleasant and attentive throughout the meal. We will definitely go again.
