I've only been here twice, but what good memories from both occasions. The burgers are just....i can't even describe how great they are. Big thick and juicy, just like me. (come on, ya knew that was coming) we have been lucky in that both times that we've come here there haven't been any lines and we just got in instantly. This place and the burgers will suffice for me until i head back out to Cali to In-N-Out.
