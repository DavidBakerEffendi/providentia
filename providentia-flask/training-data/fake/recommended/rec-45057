My boyfriend took me here for my birthday last year. We were late for our reservations because our cab got lost, but they kept our reservation for a while longer. That was quite nice of them. The service was amazing! Our waiter was very attentive and the other wait staff helped to make our experience really great. Eveything was brought out in an expedient manner and all of my cutlery was spotless! I would definitely recommend the grilled char for anyone who likes a light dinner, like myself. =] The atmosphere was classy and clean. The lighting at night is absolutely gorgeous! (ideal for a romantic date =]) Only thing is...very hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for! And cabbies don't always know the streets in the West Village...so beware getting lost!
