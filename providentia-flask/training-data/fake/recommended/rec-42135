Love this place! Its very inviting and the staff is very attentive.  Food is great, I am a huge fan of their penne vodka it has a little spice to it which I love spicy food so I'm in.  Also the lobster raviolis are amazing!  They had a special appetizer "rock shrimp" it was great also this should be on their regular menu because I would order it every time. If you haven't been here, please make a trip because you will not be disappointed...!Enjoy!
