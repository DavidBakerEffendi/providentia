There isn't a shortage of Thai restaurants in Hell's Kitchen - but this one consistently impresses me the most. I usually order take out from here and they are always quick, but I have eaten in the restaurant too where they are friendly and attentive - the food either way is delicious. I recommend the Crab Rangoon and the Pad Thai
