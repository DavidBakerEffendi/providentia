I went here twice: once for brunch, and the other time for late night drinks. The food was very tasty, and reasonably priced. The bloody mary was pretty average. I had a tasty cocktail later in the evening during my second visit, though. Cute atmosphere at a venue that is in a busy neighborhood in park slope. I recommend this place specifically for brunch!
