So if it was possible to give this place no stars I would. So incredibly disappointed. Asked for a calzone small size, was told it only comes in one size which is ginormous. They literally take the dough for a large pie roll it out and throw 1/2 lb of mozzarella and barely any ricotta in it and put it in the oven until exterior is cooked. Raw as could be inside. The pizza is no better no flavor to the sauce and the mozzarella tastes funny. I'm not a chef but I do eat pizza more often then I am willing to admit and this place will definitely never make it on the rotation. Just go to the Dunkin next door and grab a breakfast sandwich you'll be more satisfied.
