This rating is mostly based on the food. The ambience is comfy and relaxing; a good place to grab a drink and then go. The food is very bland - pretty mediocre overall. I came here for the $5.95 lunch special (sounded like a great deal!) and ordered the cheese/jalapeno tamale and chicken taco...nothing seemed very seasoned and there was a complete lack of spice throughout each item. My boyfriend tried the quesadilla which was deep fried (odd) and oily. Margaritas are tasty but can't really taste the booze in it; maybe that's a good thing? You be the judge.
