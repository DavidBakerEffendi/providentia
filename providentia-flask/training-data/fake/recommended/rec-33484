If you want a place with no-frills, but cheap and tasty Vietnamese food, with efficient service, this is the place to go.  The grilled sirloin beef cubes (don't know the dish's actual name) and the beef wrapped in grape leaf appetizer have been consistently good.  Although the pho is not the best I've had, it is tasty and comes in huge bowls.  The grilled chicken on rice is very good too.  Generally, I've found their vegetable dishes good.  If you're a little adventurous, try their fried frog legs.   It's also nice that the waitstaff is generally nice and efficient.
