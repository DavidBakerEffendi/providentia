I give this place 4 stars because the food and atmosphere of the restaurant is fantastic.   It is a little dark to read the menu, but that is what your flashlight is for on your iPhone. I was highly impressed with the service. The waitress and delivery of food was amazing.  Tapas are the way to go - it allows you to at least try so much more on the menu. Sliders/shrimp/calamari must have!
