I was going to write this review earlier but the experience was so awkward that I thought I should wait because time heals all, just not in this case. I say awkward because I was confused from the moment I entered the door. Is this supposed to be an upscale burtuccie's? I can't put my finger on one thing that stood out the most so here is just a few. 1. The waitress had no clue how to explain any part of the menu. We asked if the calamari was fries or sautéed. She said it was kinda fried but definitely not sautéed. When the calamari arrived it was cold and sautéed. We didn't even have to say anything to the waitress she took one look at the calamari and said well this looks different then what we had at training! Ummm.. I bet it does. 2.The pasta was just ok. My wife ordered the ravioli but the waitress told her they ran out last night. Hmmm wasn't this supposed to be home made pasta? Couldn't you just make more that morning? Anyways the dish she finally ordered was ok, but it was warm and cold in the middle. 3. More of a suggestion then a complaint, less antipasti dishes and more simple pizza and pasta choices. I'm sure once they work out the new restaurant kinks this place will be ok. I think they missed the mark with the vision they had for this place.
