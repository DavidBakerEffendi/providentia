One of absolute favorite spots! Great drinks, great food, great atmosphere what else could you ask for?! The red wine sangria brings me back to my days spent in Spain, same exact concoction. Great tapas, chickpea & spinach, mushroom & goat cheese, shrimp w/ garlic, calamari...I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Always have a great time when I go!
