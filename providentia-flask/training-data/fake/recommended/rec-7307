Great falafel.  Tried it for the first time months ago, and still keep going back.  I've brought others, and they go back too. Have the green falafel, choose white or wheat pita, get some spicy sauce on the side, if thats what you fancy.  Just do it.  Thank me later.  Try smoothies if you like that kinda thing too.
