OH Sanfords.... thankfully I made a reservation because even at 2pm there was a wait outside.  If I hadn't been there for the sole fact that it had been recommended, I probably would have turned RIGHT back around after I walked in.  The music was WAY TOO LOUD!  and I'm talking thumping loud.  I felt like I was about to have brunch 'in da club' -- once I got past that and asked a waiter if they could possibly lower the volume (and they were nice enough to do so), I moved on to enjoy my delicious meal. The brunch special gets you a brunch cocktail (plus a free refill), coffee and your meal.  Pretty good deal already.  The food is not your typical diner fare. They take the usuals and bring them up to another level.  I had some sort of veggie frittata and it was just the right amount of greasy. I will definitely be going back for their brunch deal, but better prepared for the scene.
