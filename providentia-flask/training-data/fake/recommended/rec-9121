When the owner comes to your table and asks if there was something wrong because you left one shrimp behind, you know you are at a top notch restaurant.  Food, service and ambiance could not be better.  Definitely one of my new city favorites....location in the heart of soho doesn't hurt either.  Had the oysters + ruby shrimp appetizers then the sea bass.  All delicious!!
