Freaking delicious. Cheapest meal I've had in a long time, I got the chicken wonton soup for around $7. The chicken came in small strips and was ridiculously juicy and flavorful. The broth was incredible, the wontons were pretty decent (I'm not a fan of pork, but these were good), and the noodles were spot on. I was completely satiated after the meal, large portion for the money. Service was quick and cordial. Interior was very decent for a restaurant in Chinatown. Also located close to Columbus Park, so you can always go there and lie on a nice flat rock to even out your food baby.
