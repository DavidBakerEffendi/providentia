For a nice cozy cafe I think this is as good as it can get.  I've been here a couple times and almost everything on the menu taste good.  Coffee is free refill which is good for me.  Service is always great and friendly. I do recommend their brisket burger since it's nice and juicy.  Depending on the days sometimes their bread can be a little bit on the harder side, but all you need is tell them and they replace it! Try to go there early tho or else you will expect like at least 1 hour wait cuz it's a small place.
