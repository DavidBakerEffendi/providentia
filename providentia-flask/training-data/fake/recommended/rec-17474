I have been eating lunch at Sorrento's for years as my office is across the street. The subs are pretty awesome. The baked good are off the charts, especially the deserts. The bad. Sometimes the service is lacking, feels sort of soup Nazi like but not always. Also, I know it's Italian bakery but would it kill them to make whole wheat or multigrain rolls for the sandwiches. They will get 5 stars from me when they start to bake it. For now I will continue to order my subs 2 times per week.
