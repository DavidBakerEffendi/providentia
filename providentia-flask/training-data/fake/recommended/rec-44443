The restaurant from the outside looks nice. The inside of the restaurant has not been updated in a long time unlike the banquet halls which I did not get to see. The restaurant needs to remove some of the wall to wall wood paneling, keep the wooden beams, a lighten up the place with some paint. The place felt a bit dated. The service was nice and friendly. The food was decent. My party just had burgers which were cooked well and homemade. Portions were large. Try the bosco sticks. Its a cross between mozzarella sticks and bread sticks. I'll come back to see what its like in the summer outside.
