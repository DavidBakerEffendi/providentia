hahaha, what a great name for a halal cart, to name it after your street and avenue.  i wonder which genius came up with it.  wow, you people and your imagination. this cart appears to be open throughout the wee hours of the night.  at the late hours, after clubbing, i sometimes hitch a ride with one of my drunk friends, (wait what?) and we'd drive by this place to see a line stretched down to the middle of the block.  i'm talking 4-5AM cause we talkin new york city bitches.   i came here to grab lunch a few times.  if you get here at noon, its just setting up shop and there's no line.  you could get your food right away.  if you come at 1230 or after, then you're just a straight-up fool.  the line is dumb long.  whats that?  you know a secret?  there's an identical cart right across the street you say?  yeah its not a secret, everyone knows about that as well and the line is equally as long.  there's only one secret to this place, come at 12.   as for the food, i've only had chicken and lamb with rice here.  its only $5.  the hot sauce is spicier than other halal carts.  they throw in salad and a couple pieces of pita along with it and the amount of food they give you is massive.  i always have a hard time finishing it.  there are two different experiences whenever i eat here.  your first few bites are great.  you start to contemplate if this is the best halal food you ever had.  a white cloud forms on the side of your head and other carts you have eaten at before pops in that cloud and your finger is tapping your chin.  hmmmmmmmm.  but the more you eat, you start to get a bit sick, stuffed and get the runs.  you remember how great it was at first so you try to capture that feeling back by finishing it.  then you're left feeling stuffed with a bad last impression.   at least that was my take on this cart.  go to queens and eat at sammy's halal on 73rd and bdway.  and find a new name.
