Great food, but annoyances make it a 4 not a 5. 1st visit: They forgot one (of two) dishes but made up for it with a free extra course when we pointed it out. Everything was great. 2nd visit: One dish was barely warm and had to be sent back. Again, very apologetic and good service, but, again not deserving of 5. Get the duck on rice at least once. It's excellent, and I've had it around the world, including in China. Leave out the pricey lettuce though. You can buy one at trader joe if you really want to spend $1 on a few bits of lettuce. The bau (buns) are very good but other places nearby have better.
