Kati Roll is great, both this location and the one on Macdougal, though I personally like this one better.  The concept is brilliant - Indian food, burrito style.  Instead of a tortilla your chicken tikka comes wrapped in a roti but the effect is very much the same.  My personal favorites are Aloo (potato) and Paneer rolls but they have plenty of meat choices, including the unheard of *BEEF* tikka concoction which I am yet to get up the nerve to try.   The rolls are priced between 4 and 5 dollars each with discounts if you get two at a time.  If you end up getting two (one is probably not enough for a meal unless you're 6 years old) it will cost between 7 and 9 dollars.  Some of the rolls are pretty spicey and you will definitely smell of Indian food for a good while afterward but it's well worth it.  The trick my coworkers figured out to combat the curry-breath afterward is to head to the Irish pub next door and do a round of Irish carbombs, which surprisingly enough makes the perfect dessert for a kati roll!  Give it a try next time you're here, you won't regret it!  And nevermind that it's lunch time, don't skip the carbomb!
