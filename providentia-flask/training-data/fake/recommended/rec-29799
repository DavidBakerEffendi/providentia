Went for breakfast, but was not overly convinced. It was a little crowded, and noisy. Being I'm lactose intolerant their menu was a bit difficult maneuvering for Saturday breakfast. After telling me they were out of both types of croissants, I went with just a soy latte and stole bites off my fiances big breakfast platter, which was impressive. Â Proper baked beans, texas toast with real butter (they should have brought jam), thick bacon (a little fatty), scrambled eggs (were a bit watery), and hash brown patties that a spicy kick to them. I noticed they were open until 1am, so maybe I'll go back in the evening for a drink and enjoy it a bit more.
