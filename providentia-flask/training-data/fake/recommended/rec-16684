My fried (but not greasy) whole branzino with dirty rice was a delight: a very fresh fish injected with an herb mixture and stuffed with a well-seasoned basmati rice that was mixed with chunks of tomato and sliced okra (not slimy - don't worry).  The presentation was impressive but the chef brushed the wide rectangular plate from end to end with some type of sauce that made my utensil handles (and therefore my hands) a little messy. Nevertheless, I cleaned my plate so clearly it wasn't that much of a problem. Along with my main course I had a side of macaroni and cheese.  The flavors were zesty and the noodles were nice but this little cast iron clad number could have used a few more minutes in the oven or under a salamander so that it could have been truly fierce in all of its bubbling hot glory. I also tasted the short ribs, which were TEN-DER! The hibiscus sweet tea was refreshing, nicely sweetened and tasted just like sorrel.  In fact, my West Indian massive, I think it was sorrel. Service was friendly and fairly efficient and the atmosphere wasn't bad.  The main part of the house was a little loud so I was glad to be seated on the more intimate and airy indoor/outdoor space in the back. See you soon, SoCo.
