The meal here was to DIE for.  So delicious.  The veal was seriously the best I've ever had.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  And, the chocolate pound cake...SO GOOD.  My co-worker claims that the sea bass he ordered was 'the best he's ever tasted'!  The staff is VERY attentive.  We never even had to ask for a refill on water!  Very impressed by the service, the feel, and the food!  I'm so glad that we bypassed every other restaurant on Mulberry and opted for Pelligrino's!
