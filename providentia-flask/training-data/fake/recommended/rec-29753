Nice place. Their cornbread is hands down the best cornbread I've ever tasted! I can't say much else in terms of their food. I'm sure everything is great but it's a pretty pricey joint. I just stopped in here with friends for some drinks and bar food (mostly because a friend said their cornbread was fantastic) and it's not that kind of bar/restaurant. If you're looking for low key food, this is not the place.
