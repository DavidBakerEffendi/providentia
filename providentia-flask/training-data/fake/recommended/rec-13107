My roommate and I definitely got food poisoning at Sunny And Annie's last night.   I ate with Roommate A at Cocoron. He's fine. I ate Sunny and Annie's for dinner with Roommate B.  We both have food poisoning. I got the Bush, I believe:  lemon chicken, roasted seaweed, mozzarella, cucumbers and jalapenos. I used to love Sunny and Annie's but I won't be going back now.  Can't risk food poisoning, and this may not be the first time.
