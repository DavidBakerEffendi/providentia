Went on a Saturday morning brunch with my coworkers and a friend who came from out of town. Ordered the chicken panini which was AMAZING. Best i've ever had. Also ordered the strawberry banana smoothie which was very good. Ordered a espresso based frozen drink wasn't too much of a fan but the panini's and smoothies are definitely on point. Will be coming back for more! =)
