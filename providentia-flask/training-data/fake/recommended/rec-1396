Nothing but a tourist trap.  First time in Philly and felt we needed to try an authentic Philly cheesesteak.  I've had FAR better ones in MD.  Bread was good but very little meat and cheese.  It's a pain to find parking too on these little narrow streets. Don't waste your time.  Seriously....you reading this....skip it!
