I like the Happy Hour here. It's near home & has good $3 draft beers on tap, along with $5 glasses of house white or red wine & $5 house martinis like a Cosmo, Lemondrop, etc. It also boasts a delicious Cucumber martini. The small plates, which are available on the standard dinner menu, but half priced for smaller portions during Happy Hour, are delicious. My favorite is the Roasted Eggplant Timbale, which has sun-dried tomatoes,spinach, Alouette cheese, marinara & buffalo Mozzarella. Friends & I usually get about 3 plates of different small plates & share. It's a great way to get a little bit of everything . The people who frequent this Happy Hour are a friendly crowd. The bar staff are great & really helpful. What more could I ask for!
