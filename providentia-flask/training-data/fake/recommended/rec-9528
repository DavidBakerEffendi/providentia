The BF took me here for our Friday night dates and I must say props to him for finding a delicious restaurant that I haven't heard of or been to yet! ;) I was always biased against restaurants in Theater District/Restaurant Row only because there are a lot of touristy places with gimmicks and not so great food. This place is definitely none of those things! We started with some delicious and creative drinks. I had the La Pulperia which changes seasonally and my bf a whiskey drink that was infused with berries. They both were very refreshing and had the right amount of alcohol in them! Then we split the lobster taquitos, the pappardelle and the fish ribs. The lobster taquitos are mini crispy tacos that just melt in your mouth. Although I didn't think the amount of lobster warranted the $19 price tag, it was very flavorful and yummy. The pappardelle was outstanding! We loved the handmade pasta and the short ribs had the perfect hint of wine. The fish ribs were very interesting. I've never heard of the dish before. The portion size is very large. The dish came with 4 or 5 slabs of white fish with the bones in smothered in BBQ sauce. The "ribs" were a bit hard to eat as the bones are no where as big as beef or pork ribs so you had to pick them out as you ate the fish. Other than putting in a bit of effort and not looking so graceful (not recommended on a first date!), the fish and BBQ sauce itself was great and worked well together! For dessert we had the chocolate tamale. I wasn't a huge fan as the dessert had a weird grainy texture to it but my bf seemed to like it. The dulce de leche ice cream that it came with was on point. Definitely a great date spot with top notch food! We also got a free shot of tequila to boot! :D
