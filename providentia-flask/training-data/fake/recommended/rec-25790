Tommy DiNic's was the lunch choice in the day trip to Philly.  I got to try the roast beef and roast pork sandwiches.  Great stuff. + Roast beef - the meat is tender and juicy.  Definitely recommended. + Roast Pork - the meat is a little dry for my taste. + Unrolling the wrap reveals a blob of grease and a plain sandwich with green stuff on top, somewhat unpleasing to the eye.  Taking my first bite I learned never to judge a sandwich by its cover. + Happy employees = Happy customers. - Sharp Provolone Cheese - I don't know if it is just me, but the cheese tastes unpleasant and sour, not sharp.  Not recommended. - Semi-long lines - Saturday lunch line wraps around the cover.  I agree with others that the wait is shorter than it looks.  If you're bored, stare at the seated customers and their sandwiches and prepare for your turn soon. - Limited vegetable selection - out of all the vegetables, broccoli, spinach, and rabe are the only 3 available?  Onion, pepper, (insert all other vegetables here) lovers got it bad.  Solution is to walk across the aisle and buy the vegetables at the market.  Perhaps you could buy the veggie and hand it to the cook to add to your sandwich.  I wonder what kind of reaction they would have.
