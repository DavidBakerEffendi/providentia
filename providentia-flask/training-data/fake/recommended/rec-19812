I've been to Buttermilk Channel at least six times.  It's always great. - Food is delicious and a little pricy but worth it. - Cocktails are delicious. - I never felt rushed even though they're always busy. - Kid friendly, high chairs and kids menu (excellent value). - Vegetarian friendly, vegetarian menu available. - Reservations OK for parties of 5+. - Always professional and good servers; doesn't seem "fake fancy" like some places. One negative:  only one bathroom for the whole place, so you might find yourself spending some time in line.
