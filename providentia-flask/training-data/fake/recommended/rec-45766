Unbelievable tapas.  Just love the new plates that get produced every time we are in.  The 8 hour cooked beef cheek is delectable!  The pappardelle is fav.  Foie Gras is gob smacking!  BYOB means you bring the Vino of choice and the rest can only be experienced.  Waiters know their dishes. The brown butter cake is the best way to finish of.  Just get out there as quickly as you can.
