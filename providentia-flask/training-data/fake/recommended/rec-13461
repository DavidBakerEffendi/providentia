So I know thousands of people have already reviewed this, but I just thought I'd add my two cents in. Every time I come to New York, this ends up on my must-visit list. The french toast and Southern Breakfast are absolutely phenomenal - plus you should order a biscuit just for the hell of it because it's that bomb.. Only thing I would say that MAYBE detracts from this place is how small it is and the wait time. Usually I end up waiting at least 40 minutes to an hour. I have to say that the food IS worth it, but my thought is that Clinton St. should just buy out that Thai place next door and call it a day. Swag
