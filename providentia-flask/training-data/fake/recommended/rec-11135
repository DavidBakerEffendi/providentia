How have I never reviewed this place? I'm through here just about twice a week. Almaz is a tiny two-story cafe/restaurant sandwiched between an insurance storefront and a barber's shop. It's run by a wonderful couple and is the sort of quintessential mom/pop place that makes living in a city less alienating. For the most part, I use Almaz as a place to pop in for coffee when I'm on my way somewhere or coming home after a day's work. Hot or cold, their fresh-brewed Ethiopian coffee is absolutely THE best cup of real coffee in Philly. It punts the vaunted La Colombe way, way out of the water and is better than the equally-lauded Blue Bottle coffee served at Pure Fare. Do not put sugar in it. Do not put cream in it. Just drink it and enjoy. (Well, alright, do to it what you must, but at least give it a sip straight up first.) As for food, they have home-made Ethiopian meals (various meats and veggies served on injera) and an American breakfast menu. Breakfast is alright, but the traditional fare is where this place shines--I wish they'd just do away with the eggs and toast and stick to all Ethio all the time! Oh, and there's free wifi. :)
