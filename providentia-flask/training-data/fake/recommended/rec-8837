Finally got in to give it a try.  Best to make reservation but we were able to grab 2 seats at the bar with direct view of the appetizer and dessert stations. Service was friendly, helpful and attentive.  What we had: glass of sparkling wine $8 crostini (choice of 3 for $16) - favas & peas, so refreshing.  smoked trout - very tasty, lamb tartare - very good insalata mista - $12 - mixed green w/ apples, spring vegetables lightly tossed with vinaigrette - so light and refreshing spinosini - $22 - with mussels, ramps, oven roasted tomato - very good spaghetti alla vongole - $20 - very good panna cotta - $12 - good The pasta is a must.  Look forward to returning - will still opt for the bar.
