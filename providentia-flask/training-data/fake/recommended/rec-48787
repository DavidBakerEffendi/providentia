I stumbled on this restaurant during lunch...what a cute little place! The shrimp pad thai was delicious, and lunch prices are great. The chicked pineapple fried rice was also good, but nothing compared to the pad thai. The crab and shrimp roll appetizer was also to die for. Nice and relaxed, great ambiance, Â and the staff was friendly. Cute date spot.
