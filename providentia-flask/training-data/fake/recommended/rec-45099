To sum it up: Zero interest in ever going back. The service and the food both a waste of time & money. Every employee we could see -- our waiter,  the bar tender and the manager...all appeared to have many more important things to do than focus on customer service. Let's see, we watched them make themselves bar drinks it what appeared to be a "who can make the best" competition. They all sampled bottles of wine. And don't get me wrong, all of that is necessary, but my god take care of your customers first. For example, my mom ordered black coffee for brunch (simple enough right?).  Our waiter NEVER came back to offer her a refill in the hour plus we were there. After watching everyone so busy with other jobs at the restaurant, it didn't surprise me at all that all of our food came out cold.  A hamburger, an omelette, and the fried egg w/ grits clearly had been sitting around waiting to be picked up. I think if the food had been good I wouldn't have cared so much about the crappy service but the food just wasn't tasty.
