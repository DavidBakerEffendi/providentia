Pop in for a meal (a very early dinner, which was around 4pm) before catching the train back (this establishment is located across for the 30 Street Train Station) home. Had banger and mash with drinks for my meal, which was good. Liked that the mash had some chuck and thickness to them. The staff was very friendly and nice. Got a kick that the there was a saying in Gallic on the bill. My only complaint was the bathroom. It was in good working order and clean. It was the size of the regular stall. If you are are person under normal size, you will not have an issue. I am not one of these people, so it was a bit of a challenge to get done what I needed to get done.
