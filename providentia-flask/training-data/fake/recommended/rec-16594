Love.Love.Love. Right to the chase-the food was superb!  All split with a friend: started with the zucchini and hummus pizza & the chili pork dumplings.  The pizza was incredible--warm & savory with crushed wasabi peas to add a perfect, spicy crunch!  The pork dumping were delectable--an order came with six or seven which was delightfully surprising--not to mention the fact that they were the most delicious pork dumplings I've ever had!  Next had the cumin eggplant buns.  These were quite good, but I wasn't a fan of how doughy the buns were (although that is probably not a sound complaint, being that buns are doughy).  Finished with the chocolate cupcake which was outstanding (no actual caviar--giant chocolate balls-score!!).   All wine is $25 a bottle and they have a pretty decent selection--we were very happy with the two bottles we downed during dinner.  They also have wine of the week bottles which are $45 each.   *Only warning-it's community seating and quite intimate, so if you're not prepared to sit in close proximity to some strangers (this is NY people), then maybe rethink... *Oh and whoever took my reservation was really annoying--kept putting me on hold and was really flighty--deal with it and go!
