I have never had a bad meal at Chavela's! In fact every meal that I have had at Chavela's is very tasty! I have been to Chavela's for dinner a couple times and each time I enjoyed my meal. I always get 3 tacos. The Carne Enchilada and Bistec are my favorites! They never disappoint so I am now obsessed with them and only order them. I have also had the arroz con leche for dessert a couple times and it's pretty good. My compliant is that it is served cold. womp womp. It would be better warm for sure so ask them to heat it up for you. I once ordered it for take out and the food heated it up a little and it was great! I have also been here for brunch and LOVED it! num, num, num! Their brunch is a $12.00 pre fix! that's right ONLY12.00! Brunch includes sweet bread (it's good), entree, and juice, coffee, or tea. I think that's a great deal! The best part about this deal is that the food is great! My fiance and I both had the Huevos Ahogados (a.k.a. eggs benedict). It was one of the best eggs benedict that we have had! It's served on some sort of thick soft piece of bread with guacamole, chorizo, and jalapeno holandaise sauce. BTW, the jalapeno holandise is NOT spicy at all. I was very happy about this because I don't do spice. It's a good portion size as it comes with mixed greens and potatoes too. PLZZZZZZZZZZ try it! It will improve your weekend! I have also ordered take-out from here and each time it has been yum! The website states that it's cash only but they do take cards. I must add that I don't drink but I have seen the bar tender whipping up some pretty interesting drinks- one drink included jalapenos and the other had beet juice. My fiance said the white sangria is good. My only issue with this restaurant is that the seating is very cramped-ugh-(minus one star) but I still like the environment and choose to be cramped so that I can enjoy their food. This place is affordable and very good so go eat, drink , and be merry!
