I was worried about eating here given some of the recent reviews, but I have to say it was a great experience!   We went on a Wednesday night and had 6:30 reservations, which I'm sure was not nearly as busy as the weekend and all, but we were seated right away, got a great table with plenty of room and the staff was very attentive.  Food was good -- not fantastic, but good.  Good size portions and well prepared.  I had the El Gaucho/Chipotle strip steak which was very good.  Got a side of the coconut rice which was also tasty and we tried the goat cheese fritters, which everyone liked.  I would definitely come here again.
