After being gone from the area for a few years Yama was the #1 place I wanted to go to but feared it wouldn't live up to my memory and I'd be disappointed. I definitely was pleased with the sushi- still as good as I remembered and some of the best I've ever had.  Also, I was surprised at how reasonable their prices are compared to the places in my area.  I anticipated Yama would have jacked their prices up now that they have such a good following.  Overall, the portions are good, the prices are great and the food is excellent.
