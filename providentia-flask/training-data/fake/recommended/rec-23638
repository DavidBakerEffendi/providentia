Can I give this 2.5 stars? My girlfriend and I recently moved in down the street, and were excited for some good diner style breakfast food. While it was nice to sit outside on a beautiful morning, that was definitely the best part of the experience. We were seated right away and everyone was friendly. The coffee came out quickly, but wasn't very good. I was hoping it was just an old pot, but the refill later on was also lacking. Both the omelet and eggs benedict came out luke-warm/room temperature, and were just "meh". Maybe they would have tasted better hot.
