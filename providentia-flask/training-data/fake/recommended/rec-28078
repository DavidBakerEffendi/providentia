Brunch: never thought I'd enjoy a panini so much. It's not your average panini nor your average sandwich. They're rich in taste - savory. I had the Getting Piggy With It. There was a bit of sweetness from the onions to balance the saltiness of the sopressata. The bread was toasted nicely and buttery. I could only eat half- they're huge! The roasted garlic tomato bisque was AMAZING. Wanted to lick the bowl but I would like to think I'm classier than that. Ambience- I sat in the outdoor garden on a spring day. It's quiet and away from street traffic. They space is quaint and rustic. Perfect. Wish there was salad that came with it...or maybe I missed it? Either way, there should be SOME sort of vegetable or greens with the meal.
