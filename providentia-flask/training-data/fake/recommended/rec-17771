the food is okay here, but the cost is extremely high. the salads are okay, but overpriced at $8.50 - the lettuce is either white or brown, and i'm not sure they're using top-quality meats. the last time i went there, they forgot to include the salad dressing that i asked for. overall, not worth the cost - there are better delis close by.
