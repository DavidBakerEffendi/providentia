My boyfriend and I went to Ardesia before a show at Terminal 5.  I think this was a great spot for a pre-show drink and appetizer. The place is cute, typical wine bar ambiance.  They also have an outside area which was lovely on a nice night. The service was great.  We had several people attending to us, so we were always being taken care of.  In a wine bar with a cheese selection I expect the servers to be knowledgeable about both, which they were. We split several small plates and cheese and all were delicious.  My favorite was the Goat's Milk Ricotta Crostini which I highly recommend.
