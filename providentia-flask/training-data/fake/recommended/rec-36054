Aside from Dunkin Donuts this was my first taste of NY, and it was so awesome to not be disappointed! When your server/host/hostess suggest the sangrita, please know there is no BS about it, hands down delish drink!!  I wish I would have gotten this instead of the Lulo Mojito. Cocktails: Sangrita-I choose the red sangria and it was beautifully swirled with a frozen, blended margarita.  Think Lava Flow you would have in Hawaii, but with a South American spin instead.  So refreshing on a warm and balmy Park Slope evening. Lulo Mojito-Meh. I couldn't taste the tropical fruit that was in it AT ALL, it tasted like a slightly more tart regular mojito. Maybe as a margarita the fruit may stand out more?   On the house: Fried Plantain Chips with in house Aji.  Perfect bar snack if you are here for just drinks. Food: Whole Red Snapper-You can never go wrong with a whole (head and all) deep fried snapper!  I substituted the coconut rice it came with yellow rice which was bleh. I should have left it as is with no substitution. I saw everyone from a large birthday party, romantic date night couples, and families with little ones in tow being served with the same level of friendly, welcoming, attentive, and not overly in your face service.
