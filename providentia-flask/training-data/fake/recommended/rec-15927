Great wine bar near work. Â Often come here after for a few glasses of wine with their foodie menu. What I order: Ricotta, Fingerling Bruschetta ~seems so simple but sooo good Bone Marrow / Lardo Bruschetta ~if you like bone marrow or lardo and I do... but you do need to swig some wine to cut the fatty richness. Bev's Famous Pork Blade Steak ~Must order, but can be salty depending on the cook.. I usually ask them to be a bit lighter on the salt "Thin Steak" Dry-aged Creekstone Beef Veal and Ricotta Meatballs ~ok meatballs
