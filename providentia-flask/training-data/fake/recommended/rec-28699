Five-star food, service and atmosphere for both the Paleo (me) and non-Paleo (friend) eater! I had the almond crusted chicken tenders, sweet potato cup with rotisserie pineapple and bacon, and an iced mint tea- they were all very flavorful and well portioned. Â Afterwards, I indulged in the famous chocolate chia seed pudding - so yummy! The toppings were equally as good too! I especially liked the dairy-free coconut whipped cream. The servers were super friendly and knowledgeable, offering samples and recommendations eagerly. You can tell they're just as passionate about the philosophy & food at Hu Kitchen as their patrons are. Grabbed a Salty Chocolate Bar for my trip home - this is by far the best "clean" and non-refined sugar chocolate I've tried so far. Looking forward to returning soon!
