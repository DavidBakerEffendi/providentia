It's really cute and really quaint and the ingredients are all fresh, but there's better food to be had....I thought that the food was missing something flavor-wise - the pastas were really basic and sort of bland. Definitely ask the waiters what they recommend because the dishes that they recommended were definite standouts in our otherwise unremarkable meal...
