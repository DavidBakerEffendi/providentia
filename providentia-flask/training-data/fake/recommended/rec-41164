It's good...for New York. Maybe I sound a little snobby coming from SoCal, but it's greasy! I know Chinese food has a reputation of being so, but this was a little much. Also, not the flavors I was expecting. That said, I appreciated the fact that the noodles were handmade. If you're lucky enough to be sitting by the kitchen, you can hear and watch the master chef at work. I went with a few friends on a not particularly busy night, but had to wait a while, and one if our orders was wrong. I heard the chef and hostess arguing in the back, so there must have been some confusion. But it was worth the wait and would definitely come back knowing what to expect.
