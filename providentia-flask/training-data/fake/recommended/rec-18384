If you like Bareburger in NYC you will love the Philadelphia version. A revamped menu is complete with many vegan and gluten free options - everything still organic.  Sweet potato fries and onion rings are DIVINE.  I also had my burger in a collard green leaf instead of a bun. Recommended for anyone looking for a delicious alternative to pub fare around downtown.
