Hands down my favorite go-to place. They some how seem to make a simple Ceasar Salad a reason for me to keep coming back and you must try the Spicy Tuna Burger....perfection! The Short Rib Burger is delicious as well and you must try the Pigs N A Blanket starter, won't be disappointed! The only drawback is that the main courses don't come with a side, you have to pay separately.
