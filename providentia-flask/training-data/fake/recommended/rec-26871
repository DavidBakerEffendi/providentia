I came for brunch after a salesperson recommended it nearby. There is no real brunch menu, just some eggs. The place is cute and has a nice vibe. The wait staff while I was seated at the bar (4 workers and hardly any patrons) ignored me for 20 minutes. I finally jumped in and said "hey can I see a menu?" They looked at me irritated. Sheesh. The iced tea is good- but they never did refill. (Back to the ignoring patrons part) All of the egg dishes have sausage so I ordered the egg sandwich sans the funky meat. It isn't even as good as I could make at home, and I don't cook. The bread it was on is good - the end. This place needs to adjust the employee attitude badly and needs a far far very better menu for me to ever return.
