We were seated without reservations tonight at 9:10pm.  The space is smaller so reservations are a good thing. We started out with the grilled OCTOPUS with capers which was excellent. Next my wife ordered the seared scallop salad with white beans. Another great choice. Last and the best appetizer people are the grilled SARDINES. Wow! Our waiter Adonis said there were 35 of them yesterday of which he alone ate 9 of them. The sardines were sizable and of course from Greece which is a tough find in the states. They were grilled to perfection. Just add lemon and they fall apart softly in your mouth. For the final courses we had the grilled baby lamb cooked medium rare. Very nice. The pleasant surprise that was my favorite was the short ribs braised in a red wine reduction. It was truly memorable and my favorite entree. Our waiter Adonis was personable and engaging in conversations about greece and the life as it is now over there.  He raved about the fresh seafood of his country and rightly so, and any person fortunate enough to have experienced dining in Greece  will agree that they have one of the best cusines this world has to offer.
