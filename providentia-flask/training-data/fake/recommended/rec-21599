My second trip to Philly and first to the cheesesteak corner between Pat's and Geno's.  Based on the reviews here, I chose to eat at Pat's and I was not disappointed.  I sat down with my mushroom steak with the Whiz smothered atop it and chowed down in touristy anticipation.  Overall, I liked it, but I think I still prefer Jim's steaks.
