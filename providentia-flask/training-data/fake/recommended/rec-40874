I have been living in the neighborhood for one year now, and Chevelas has yet to disappoint me! I am a usual take-out customer; my order usually consists of the pescado tacos and the corn appetizer or side of rice and beans, which are all superb every time! The pescado taco is perfectly fried, with a great slaw. The corn is cooked well, with just enough cheese and sauce topping. The rice and beans are well cooked and seasoned. When I lived across the street, this was a sure fire place for brunch when friends were visiting. Best place for tacos/Mexican in the neighborhood!!
