I hate to say it, but Saraghina let me down this morning. I've eaten dinner here twice before and been very impressed with the pasta and pizza, so I brought by boyfriend here for brunch today expecting to be wowed. No such luck. We ordered eggs florentine and french toast. French toast was fine but not special, and the portion was small for the price. Eggs were downright bad - over cooked, tiny amount of hollandaise sauce, extremely tough bread. At one point I was using to much force to try and cut through it that my hand slipped and slammed my hand into the plate rather painfully. Just no fun to eat. Service was also unforgivably slow. Overall, felt like $40 for two people should've gotten us a nicer meal, especially at a restaurant that executes some of its menu so well. Won't ever be back for brunch. Also, what is up with not taking credit cards? So irritating and bad for customers. Now that I think about it, maybe I won't ever bother going back for dinner either.
