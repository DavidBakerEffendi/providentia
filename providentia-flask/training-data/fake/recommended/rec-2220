This is a great BYO for seafood lovers.  The food is very fresh and always nicely seasoned and flavorful.  I love the crabmeat and guacamole martini appetizer and the bouillabaise.  Even the sweet potato side was seasoned perfectly in a way that brought out the natural flavorin of the entree tha it accompanied.  A great place for dinner if you're in town, especially if you're visiting the university since it's right across the street.
