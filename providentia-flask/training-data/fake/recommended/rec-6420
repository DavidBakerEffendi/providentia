Just tried this place last night and couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it before - from the 1000+ reviews, clearly they've made quite a name for themselves! We split a regular size with "layered" sweet mango chutney (recommended by the very sweet and patient employee who helped us), mexican ketchup and honey mustard mayo. The mango chutney was by far our favorite, followed by the honey mustard mayo - gotta love that sweet/salty combination. We both thought the mexican ketchup was a bit too garlicky though - I could still taste it the next morning despite my (immaculate) dental grooming routine. The fries were incredibly fresh - literally went from the fryer directly into our paper cone. People have mentioned that the fries are like English "chips," short and fat vs. long and skinny, and I have to agree with Matt E. that the Five Guys fries are where it's at. Regardless, we both really enjoyed our snack, although when we got to the bottom, the fries drenched in all 3 sauces was a bit much for me, so I surrendered the cone and let my friend have at it. If you are able to find a place to sit, I'd recommend getting your sauces "on the side" so you don't run into our lil problem.
