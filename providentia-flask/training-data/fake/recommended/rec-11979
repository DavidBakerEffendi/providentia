I really enjoyed my experience at Umami Burger in LA, but I think the first New York location has some kinks to sort out. We showed up at 6:30PM on a Monday night, and there was no wait (by the time we left around 7:45PM, there was an hour wait). I got the special burger (Slash) with shitake mushrooms, avocado, carmelized onions, and house made cheddar. The meat was definitely good and of quality and the overall flavors really worked together, but the bun, especially the bottom, was extremely soggy. The burger fell apart rather quickly. Wasn't overly impressed by the cheesy tots - it wasn't that cheesy and had an odd, overly smooth texture. Truffle fries were pretty addictive though, and the trio of dipping sauces are a delicious and fun touch. The service was a bit of a mess - our neighbors got our orders (and ate them on top of their own!), and when they finally brought out our orders, they accidentally gave us two extra burgers (though honestly, if we could've eaten them, we would have!). I'd certainly go back again but not necessarily in a hurry to do so.
