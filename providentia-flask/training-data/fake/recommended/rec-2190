Ok, I'm from California and so I went to visit this place since my friend lives in Delaware. So when I went to this place, I thought the place would be an easy place to find......NOOOOO!!!!!!! Instead, it's in a place that's like a back alley place with horrible parking and crowded areas.  But, when I went to Geno's, it was lighted up like a Las Vegas strip mall. So, we went to buy some of the sandwiches and we both noticed that there was two windows, each side had different menus: one for the drinks and fries, and the other for the sandwiches.  IMO, I never seen this and literally, I don't like the fact that I have to order from two different windows just to get the drinks. So, noooo!!!.  Anyways, my friend and I order their TWO different types of sandwiches (Pat's by the way have over 20 items on their menu) with the typical three different types of cheese: cheez whiz, provolone, and american. So what to choose!?!?!?!?!?!? I chose the cheesesteak w/ onions and cheez whiz.  My friend orders the same with provolone and cheez whiz and without onions....but the sandwich didn't come with the cheez whiz and it had onions in it (BOOOOOO!!!!).   We didn't want to go back to the counter since the guy making the sandwich and the woman on the cash register looked like they'd want to take a .... well, you know what I mean.  So, we both bring the sandwiches to a table and eat the food.  When I took a bite of that sandwich, I wanted more.  That's why I gave it 2 stars just to be reasonable.  But, the bread was too thick with what little meat they put in it.  So, in my experience, go to Geno's for their overpriced sandwiches and their sandwiches in which you'll taste more of the cheese and the sandwich than the meat that's in it.  I like the sandwich for what it is....but that's all they have to impress.
