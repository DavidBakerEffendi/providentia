Pros: One of the best grilled saba dish ever. Supremely juicy and flavorful. A killer chicken nanba dish that is well fried and saucy. Great sake selection, and a great place to visit for late nights. Cons: Skewers aren't the best, although they get the job done. Sukiyaki udon was a bit too watered down. Bottom Line: Given the range of japanese options available in the immediate vicinity, you can get better skewers at Ootoya and better meat deal at Gyu-kaku. Â  Comparable to: O-taisho.
