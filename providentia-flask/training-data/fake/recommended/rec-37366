Amazing. Places strategically located in the middle of nowhere make life more interesting. A very humble-looking joint, the ordering counter is in a separate entrance from the dining area - Why? I am not too sure. The dining area is very rustic - large wood tables rest in a barely decorated room. No matter, you are not here for the atmosphere, you're here for the lobster. I ordered the Maine-style lobster, given that it was a brisk fall day. The warm lobster pieces were snuggled gently into a toasted, buttery bun. No celery in this version (vs. the Connecticut-style). The lobster pieces were mammoth and aplenty. They didn't cheat me on it at all. Lobster filled my mouth with happiness, as it should. It was was sweet, succulent, juicy, and everything I hoped it to be. The bread was soft and slightly crispy, it contrasted perfectly with the lobster. I almost cried at the first bite. In short, definitely a yes.
