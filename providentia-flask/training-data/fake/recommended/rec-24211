Quaint delicious indian food cafe. We walked into this cafe expecting great food and service and that's exactly what we received. Almost everyone that walked in after us had the same story how they have heard of this well kept gem, yelp! The owner was very friendly and helpful. I let him know I was vegan and immediately he knew what should meet my requirements to make the food friendly. I actually never had chaat before but it sure was delicious. If it is your first time visiting the place then the owner will whip you up with a starter to get you familiar with the cuisine. A meal consisting of mangos, dates, dried cranberries, chickpeas, potatoes, and some other delicious combination of ingredients placed into a meal. You can have this as a salad or a regular meal. The meal was placed on top of fresh spring mix. Normally served with yogurt but he knew not to include it. For meat eaters they had plenty of options to go along with this as well, lamb, chicken, and beef. Don't forget to order one of their lassi drinks as well. They make it with yogurt usually but get it veganized with almond milk. Banana date was just what I needed to satisfy my sweet tooth.
