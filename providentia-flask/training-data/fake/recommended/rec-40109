National Mechanics serves my favorite brunch in Old City -- no wait, my favorite brunch in Philadelphia!  I recently wrote about it at hubpages.com/hub/Top-3-B….  Put simply, the atmosphere is super chill, the brunch drink options are fantastic (MYO bloody mary bar and awesome "him-mosas"), and the Eggs Maryland (eggs benedict with crab cakes) are mouth-watering.  I love it like crazy.  I keep swearing I'll go for drinks and dinner, but I only seem to make it there on Sundays for brunch.  I'll experience their evening-time food eventually...
