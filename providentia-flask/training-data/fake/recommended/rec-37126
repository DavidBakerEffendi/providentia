Have you ever waited over an hour for food and said it was worth it? No...me neither until now.  The best chicken biscuit(mushroom) gravy in my life. Huge portions, and perfect pricing.  Staff was nice and attentive. Oh and best part Seth Rogan and his wife sat at the table next to us!!!!!!!!! I know the wait is a big turn off but once your inside you will get over it and simply enjoy what I think is the best brunch spot in NYC.
