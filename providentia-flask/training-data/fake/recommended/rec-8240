VPB quite possibly serves the best beer in town.  I'm not big on the food here, it's passable bar fare.  But the dining and bar area are well-suited for get togethers or after-show drinks.  It tends to be quite  busy on the weekends and I'm wondering if they'd be better off with a small expansion (maybe upstairs?).  I recommend it to travelers or folks who have no clue where to get good drinks in Burlington.
