I went to Cafe Matisse last night with the owner of Salon Beau Monde in Englewood.  The person who colors my hair at the salon her brother is the owner however, he was not there last night. The service, food and ambiance was excellent.  I loved the way they paired different flavors to tantalize my taste buds.  The garden is really beautiful and would have loved to eat in the garden if there was availability.  I recommend Cafe Matisse for anyone who is looking for an upscale dining experience in NJ ohhhh and no way light on the wallet.
