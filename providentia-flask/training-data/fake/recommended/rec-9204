Unmarked door on random Brooklyn neighborhood block led to a dark mahogany tin ceilinged dimly lit dining room with charming bar and wrap around banquet seating. Drinks were excellent, we had the Hemingway and Southside which were both refreshing. For appetizers, we shared the heirloom tomatoes with sprouts on top, ceviche, and homemade BBQ ribs (half rack St Louis style). Mains we had the monk fish special, lobster special, meatloaf sandwich (beef, pork, veal with homemade tangy BBQ sauce, fried onions on top and pickles) and mac n cheese and mashed potatoes for sides. Everything was tasty and fresh. We were stuffed after that so shared a lemon cake on top of berries. It was the perfect light airy cake to round out the savory meal. Came out to $62/pp including tax and tip. Service was friendly and the waitress knew the menu inside and out. Made great recommendations. Only a quick 7min walk from the Bedford Ave L train. yes, they take Visa and Mastercard!
