I had the grits with soft egg, bacon, and kale pesto. It was OK. I thought the sm portion was fine and more than enough for me.  It was flavorful but the bacon- there were two small pieces of bacon that were very hard.  The iced coffee is nothing to rave about.  The line was long and they did forget my order which made the process even longer.  I think I stood waiting for my food for more than 20 minutes but they were nice about it and gave me a free pastry.  I think I'll try something else next time.
