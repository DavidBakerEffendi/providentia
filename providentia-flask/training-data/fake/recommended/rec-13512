I came here for an early dinner with a pal and I was impressed with the decor - indeed it's so fancy/flashy that it seems a bit out of place for the neighborhood. We were seated quickly and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. I ordered a mango mojito, and while the drinks are a bit pricey, the drink was tall and strong! The food came so quickly after we ordered - literally, between the blink of my eye, our orders were on the table. I usually order pad thai - yes, I know I am boring - but decided this time to order a spicy noodle dish. I also nibbled on some spring rolls, which were nothing spectacular. The standout dish foro me was tasting my friend's curry chicken puff. Oh so delicious! Food and service was great and I would definitely recommend this place for a night out!
