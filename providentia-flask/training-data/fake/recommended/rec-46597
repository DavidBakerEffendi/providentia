Thought we would check out Craig Leban's newest review and it didn't disappoint! Being Indian I am the pickiest of critiques but I do have to say the chaat was on point. And like the previous reviews mentioned, the owner Hassan is super friendly and there to make sure that you enjoy your order. If you don't then he will make you something else until you find something that you do enjoy. The bursting tip box was our clue to the service and food rendered here. The lassis were wonderful, and with the extensive flavors where one can be lost, Hassan will point you in the right direction. Same with the chaats. We will be back to venture into new territory with both the lassis and the chaats. We had an extensive conversation with Hassan and left with the feeling that he pours his passion of cooking into his food, making masalas from scratch (roasting seeds and grinding them himself) instead of buying premade spices because it provides a much higher/fresher quality product. With so much care in his work, how can the end product disappoint?
