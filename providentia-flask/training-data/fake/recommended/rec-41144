This little place is intimate with great service, good food and a quiet restaurant. All a win for a place in the city.  Now, this place is cash only so that is a bit inconvenient especially if you want to go crazy and order up a bunch of things.  So bring a decent amount if cash. We ordered the pear.goat cheese and honey crostini for an appetizer. That was ok to to good.  Then we ordered the lasagna which was fantastic, they make it with burrata and it is rich and flavorful. Then there is a lobster pasta dish which is light and clean flavored. The fish dish was just baked/grilled fish.  The service was warm and nice.
