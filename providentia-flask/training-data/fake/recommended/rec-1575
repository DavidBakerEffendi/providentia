When you walk in you will see there are a ton of seats, both indoor and out, which was perfect for our party, as we started outside and ducked in when it looked like rain. First come, first seated. The outdoor section is really where it's at. At the entrance is a wrap around full bar, and in the back left is a beer only window, while one the right is a food window. After procuring an ample amount of German beer, it was time for some food. They have a simple, but authentic menu. A variety of appetizers and sausages, all reasonably priced, and just two large entrees, Jager Schnitzel and a roasted half chicken. One slight hiccup, was that we ordered the sausage with red cabbage, yet it came with kraut. Not a big deal, but we told the runner about it, and he quickly returned with an entire order of red cabbage. Thank God, after so many places have been failing to correct their mistake, or act like I am lying when I alert them to a mix-up, at this place (where they aren't necessarily expecting a tip) they replaced it with an entire order, no questions asked. Which is exactly the way it should be, everywhere, but places repeatedly get it wrong. The food was all great, but try the spaetzle with gravy. Bangin. The pretzels are awesome (and making me thirsty).
