Operated as an Irish saloon from 1868 to 1968; now a restaurant with an Irish-American menu.  It's worth going here for the history, if not for the food.  Definitely worth going at least once to get the feel of Old New York in Way West Hell's Kitchen. They have the same furnishings and mahogany bar they had almost 140 years ago.  One can sense the ghosts of O.Henry, Damon Runyon and Eugene O'Neill in this place -- or any of their infamous characters.  (I actually have no idea if any of those writers ever stepped foot in the Landmark Tavern, but sitting at the bar, I almost believe they're going to walk in the door any minute.)  I haven't been there in years, but I'm sure they have not changed a bit and doubt  they ever will. thelandmarktavern.org
