Cute little Thai place with good food, great service, and nice atmosphere. My only beef with it were the prices... drinks are pretty pricey. Come here for a date or a group of four... too small for a bigger group. Dimly-lit and not-so-cozy... just a good place for food and then hop off to a nice bar in the area.
