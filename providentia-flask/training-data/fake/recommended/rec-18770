This food is bomb. I only get the stir fried noodles, they're a little greasy but in the way greasy chinese food should be.  They also do a great cucumber appetizer.  Service and cleanliness are as you expect from a hole in the wall restaurant, but it's so worth going to.  Great option for takeout.
