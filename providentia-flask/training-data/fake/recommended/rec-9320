I surprised my wife on our trip to New York by bringing her here. She is Peruvian and grew up eating a lot of the foods that were on the menu at Pio Pio. She said the food was as authentic as she's had, and as fresh as could be. I agree 100%, this was some of the best Peruvian food we've had. The walk up to the restaurant makes you wonder if it is going to be any good, but boy was it good. The atmosphere is cozy, but trendy at the same time. The walls and ceiling in the main dining area are covered by twigs, and the space is illuminated by bare bulb fixtures hanging around the room. The room was very loud as it was packed full and there were several large parties in the room. We had Perucho Tasting appetizer, which includes papita rellena, causita, empanaditas, beef anticucho papita huancaina, tamalito, salsa criolla. All of it was outstanding and super fresh. Their green sauce was nice and subtle with a great spiciness to it. We then split Lomo Saltado for dinner, and again, everything was super fresh and super tasty. The papas were outstanding. We then finished up with a piece of Tres Leches cake. While we were looking forward to Flan, they were out of it, the Tres Leches was outstanding. Probably the best Tres Leches I've ever had. The next time we come to New York, we will definitely be back!
