The place is teeny with very few tables. When they tell you its an hour and 15 minutes wait, don't hesitate to go grab a drink elsewhere, because they really mean it will be longer. The good news is that while there are very few places that still feel like they were worth the wait after a full 2 hours, I'd venture a guess this is one of them. Plus, the little plate of fried chick peas the hostess gave us for our long wait really eased the pain - delicious! The red wine sangria is delectable, and while pricey ($30 per pitcher), you get about 6 glasses out if it. My 2 friends and I split 2 pitchers and I was pretty sauced.... The tapas is sooo yummy. My favorites included the chorizo with chocolate (ohhh godddd sweet and savory goodness!), the fava bean on toast (fresh and yummy), and the sugar snap peas with ham (a special - fresh and flavorful). I would highly recommend the fried custard dessert - it is like balls of fried cheesecake with soaked dried cherries... heaven!! I would recommend going there early or making side plans during the wait, however you should definitely check it out!
