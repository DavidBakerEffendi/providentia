This is by far my favorite Italian place in the city; it might even be my favorite restaurant overall. Although it's cash only and inevitably has a wait for dinner, the food is totally worth it. The mushroom bruschetta app is amazingly delicious. And my three favorite entrees are the gnoochi, the cacio e pepe & the paparadlle. The dishes are super simple, the ingredients are very fresh and the flavors balance unbelievably well with each other. My biggest dilemma going there is always choosing between all of the amazing options.
