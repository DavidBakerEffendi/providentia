Growing up in Arkansas and spending ample time in Memphis, TN, I have high standards for BBQ. I was very impressed with this restaurant's food and customer service. I ordered through Seamless and received a call from an employee who apologized for taking longer than 45 minutes to deliver my order and offered to throw in a couple free drinks to make up for it. How thoughtful! I ordered brisket with red sauce, collard greens and mac and cheese. I will say I've had better brisket in my life, but not in Astoria and definitely not while ordering through Seamless. Their sides, however, were incredible, and the biscuits were dense and golden brown, just how I like them. My only regret was not ordering dessert, although I'm so stuffed I wouldn't have been able to eat it! I'll definitely be making an in person visit soon!
