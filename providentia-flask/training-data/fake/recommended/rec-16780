Excellent! The food is a solid four stars.. Vegetarians keep an eye for the spaghetti sandwich, the coconut club, and the gyro platter. The beer battered kosher dills were so tasty! The service bumps this review to 5 stars. The waiter was extremely attentive and had suggestions that turned out great. He was mentally present, not like a zombie like a lot of waiters.. My friends platter was slightly burned and they made a whole new meal for her after she already ate most of it! This obviously won't happen every time but it was very generous of them. Highly recommended.
