This place is amazing for brunch.  The wait was long for my group of 6 (about 40 minutes) and the restaurant was full.  I ordered the chicken liver with fried eggs (delicious) and my friend enjoyed their dishes (frittata, tomato soup, omlette, etc) as well.  My only complaints are the slow service (due to its popularity) and hidden location (we couldn't find it for 10 minutes even though we were right across the street from it because it's on the lower floor).  I would definitely suggest trying this out!
