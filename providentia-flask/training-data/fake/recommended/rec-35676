Some of the best sushi I've been able to find in the Princeton area... Small place with simple decor, but excellent cuts of sushi. Some of the best eel I've ever had, so if ur an Unagi fan don't let the "Market Price" scare u off... It's worth whatever the market is dictating! Loved the tuna handroll, & always like when u can actually see the fish in a spicy tuna roll. I highly recommend this place if ur like me & are all about good sushi. I had to open my own wine bottle (BYO), & couldn't get take out on valentine's day but I'm over it! Service was friendly enough for me, but place is small... RSVP recommended.
