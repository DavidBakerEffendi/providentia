I got the tea pot which was the most innovative tea pot I have ever seen!  It has no spout, but you simply lift the pot onto your cup and tea flows from a hole near the base of the pot.  A friend of mine even decided to buy one online because she liked it so much.  I got the lemongrass tea and it came with a biscotti as well, with plenty of tea, enough for several cups.  My friends got various hot chocolates and milkshakes and everyone enjoyed it!  I love the presentation of the chocolate boxes and considered getting some as gifts :)
