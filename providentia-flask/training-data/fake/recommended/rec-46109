I want to give major props to the staff at The Mill. They are the epitome of good customer service. Especially, our waitress Nancy. She was extremely on point, knew the menu inside and out and was so receptive to all our questions. All of the courses, from app to dessert we're bright, Â fresh, and packed with flavor. Can't wait to come back to the Mill. Plus, they makes a good stiff martini! My compliments!
