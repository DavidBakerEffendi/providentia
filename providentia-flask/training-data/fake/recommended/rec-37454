Wow, I just don't get it. This place is horrendously over priced for mediocre food. This is the best place to go if you want to get ripped off. After having a bad experience with take-out, we decided to give it one more shot and dine-in. The pizza menu is very limited. The pies are small - they feed one person. The ingredients must cost about 50 cents per pizza, yet they charge $13 and up per pie! The crusts were burnt! A CAN of regular Coke is $2! The ambience is lovely, but that's because they barely touched it since it was Paloma. Still sticking to my original review - save yourself the internal outrage and go across the street to Lulu's.
