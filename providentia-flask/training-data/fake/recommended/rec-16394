The most wonderful meal I've had in a while. We were four people and ordered 12dishes. The food was great. Our waitress Rebecca was great. The wines were great all in all a most delightful evening. Â The seating at the banquettes was the most uncomfortable ever. Please make sure you get chairs. that was the only reason I didn't give 5 stars
