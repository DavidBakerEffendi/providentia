Terrible Management / Great food. I've been calling this place for the past 3 days now trying to get a manager on the phone, but there's never a manager on site. Â I've left messages with my phone number, and no one bothers to care about customers and calling me back. The food was good but I hate places that are poorly managed... it's just a matter of time for this one.
