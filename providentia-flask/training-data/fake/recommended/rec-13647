Times Square is a black hole for good food, since it typically caters to hick tourists from Nowheresville, who don't know the difference between foie gras and grass.  Fortunately for me, Sake Bar Hagi is only a few blocks away from my office and provides me with reasonably priced pitchers of beer, sake, and superior bar grub.  This izakaya has become a happy hour stand-by for me.  It is the kind of place you'd go to with your friends if you want to get sloshed and satisfy your hankering for salty food. But ever since the NY Times and Anthony Bourdain gave Hagi some love, it's gotten so packed, even on weekdays.  If you get there around 6pm though, there's hardly any wait.  Unfortunately, the service can be slow sometimes -- but it's cause they're busy, which is usually a good sign anyway. RECOMMENDED Most of the small plate dishes are cheaper than yo momma.  Get the fried chicken gizzards, yellowtail collar, sea eel tempura, wasabi octopus, beef liver sashimi, okonomiyaki (seafood pancake), takoyaki (octopus balls), fried chicken, soft shell crab, cod roe spaghetti, and of course, some sake to wash it all down with. NOT RECOMMENDED The bacon salad.  It's as lethal as Chris Brown's fists.
