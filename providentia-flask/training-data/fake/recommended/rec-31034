This is a great modern space for lunch/dinner or just having coffee.  I stopped in when it just opened and they had some local UArts students performing which added to the great vibe this place already has.  I've only had coffee and some of the pastries (which have been great) but the menu looks like it has some tasty selections, so I am looking forward to going back.
