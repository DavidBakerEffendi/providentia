I am not a pancake fan. It may seem unnatural to some, but I just never got the big deal about them. Let me tell you though, if I ever do get the craving I am coming here for them. The wait here tends to be long, so I think it was almost brilliant of them to send out little silver dollar pancakes as a sample for the waiting crowd. I was wavering on waiting or just leaving to find another place, and that damned pancake sample made me stay and crave a dish I never order. The place is small and the wait is long, so don't be surprised when they jam your party of 3 into a space meant for 2. Also, don't be surprised when they expect you to order right away. I did take a few stars away for that. It would have been one thing if our server had been nice about it but instead she simply walked up to us wanting to take our order and then rolled her eyes and stalked away when we said we needed a few minutes. The food was worth the wait, but service just made it kind of unpleasant. I didn't think we were a particularly needy table, but requests for ketchup and salt seemed to be outlandish and produced another eye roll fest. Last bit that kind of rankled was her abrupt CASH ONLY snarl when we handed her a credit card. She watched us talking about whose card we would put it on and waited until we handed her the check to snap at us. She was watching us the whole time and could have saved us and herself some time if she could have just informed us as soon as we pulled out our cards. Food good, service bad. If I come back, I guess it would depend on how much I want pancakes that day.
