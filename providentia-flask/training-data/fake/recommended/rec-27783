Dined here with a group of friends this past Thursday. We sat outside and the service was completely chaotic.  We had a reservation but still waited about 10 minutes  to sit down.  We asked three different staff members for water and bread yet still waited 45 minutes for it to arrive at our table.  It was particularly frustrating to watch tables which sat long after us receive bread and water immediately.  Our waiter was completely frenzied and aloof.  We asked to have 3 of the dishes wrapped and only received 2.   As to the food, it was just "okay"...While it certainly is not bad but tastes a bit over-salted and seems to be missing fresh ingredients.
