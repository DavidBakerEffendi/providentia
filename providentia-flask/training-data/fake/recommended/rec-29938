Options galore. It's refreshing to have a huge variety of healthy options at your fingertips and ready in 5-10 minutes. From sandwiches, shakes, pitas, salads, burritos, to rice dishes, I can't imagine that you'd have any difficulty finding an option to meet your diet/taste preferences. Don't plan on eating in, unless you just need a counter or small space to chow down your meal quickly; it's very much a grab-and-go or order delivery type of place. I'm knocking it down a star due to the fact that the timing is always inconsistent. I haven't ordered delivery, but each time I've been to the storefront, my food has been ready almost immediately after the order, and my co-worker's has taken another 5-10 minutes...must be something having to do with the high volume of Seamless orders that are coming through around the same time. Don't miss this spot if you are burned out on the high-carb, low-quality, less-filling other fast food places.
