I have been here at least a hundred times for dinner and/or drinks over the past 5 years. I feel as though I have watched it fluctuate as far as it's food quality is concerned. It's a hit or miss, sometimes it's fantastic and other times, I'm let down. Because of dietary restrictions I feel the menu is quite limiting, wish there were more veg/vegan options, not a place I can frequent as much as I'd like but it definitely hits the spot when my stomach growls and I'm not feeling cooking and washing dishes!
