Never really coming up on Doyers St except to use the post office from time to time, I decided I wanted to try another noodle soup place since Hong Kong Station on Bayard was a big mistake. Plus, I love authentic hand-pulled noodles! Just looking for a cheap, filling afternoon lunch, my boyfriend and I finally went into this small little restaurant on the corner of Doyers and Bowery. I didn't expect that this place be a very makeshift thing, where tables are just placed in each corner of the restaurant with a kitchen in the back. But hey, can't judge a book by its covers until you taste the noodles! It was very cramped of course, but how much room do you really need to have a bowl of noodle soup? I liked how it was sort of self-service: they already have a pitcher of water, seasoning, cilantro, cups, and utensils for you to use. I don't suggest using the cilantro though, because a lot of fruit flies were flying out in the open. I ordered the Beef & Beed Tendon Noodle Soup. My boyfriend got the Beef Tendon Noodle Soup. For the price, the portion was huge and it was filling! It was everything I expected from a good bowl of noodle soup. Fresh, hand-pulled noodles still with the ends attached from where they were split! The food came out quite instantly too, since they already have most of the ingredients ready in the kitchen. A must visit if you are starving and want to spend less than $10 for a good bowl of noodle soup to fill you up in the city!
