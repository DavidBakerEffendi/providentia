Stopped by on a busy night without reservations and they were able to accommodate us with a table in the back. Another table opened up in the front and my bf asked if we could move there. They checked and were able to move us there and they were very gracious about it. Service was impeccable, very attentive. My boyfriend went to the bathroom and someone immediately came over to cover his food to keep it from getting cold. Food was delicious and fresh. Ambiance was lively but I didn't think it was too loud for us. We had a great experience.
