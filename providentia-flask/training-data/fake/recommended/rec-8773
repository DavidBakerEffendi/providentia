Empanada mamas is one my favorite late night hang out spots in NYC. There is also one in Jackson heights, Queens. Before gentrification and zagat ratings set in, this was a cool little dive place full of broke hipsters. Now, all walks of life come here to eat. Conveniently located in the trendy Hell's Kitchen area of nyc, it has become the "it" spot to visit. Obviously, the place lost some of its edgy appeal (thanks gentrification) but the food it's still on point. This is still a starving artist haven because: 1. Open 24 hours 2. It's still cheap as all hell 3. Great sangria 4. It's artist and gay friendly 5. There are 2 bumping clubs next to it. 6. There are attractive people walking in and out. It's major con: the seating. It's tighter than a prudish woman in this place. You are literally sitting on someone's shoulder here. The plus side to this is if you like to ear hustle(aka eavesdropping) like I do, you will listen to a lot of funny, drunk convo from the post party crowd. My recommendations are to get 1. The viagara (a combo of seafood) 2. The mambo italiano 3. The pizza 4. Cuban 5. The Hawaiian. These are my top picks. I promise you won't be disappointed.
