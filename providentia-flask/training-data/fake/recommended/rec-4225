Knock had been recommended to me by a bartender from another place in the neighborhood as a good meal so I checked it out and did indeed find it good.  The wait-staff was friendly and attentive, the decor was modern but warm, and there was a great vibe in the place.  I enjoyed my first visit so much I brought my work team out to dinner this week again.  We all had great meals and found our waiter, Aaron, sociable, attentive, and really added to the whole dining experience.  There was no rushing us out and we ended up staying for several hours talking and enjoying the desserts and coffee.  I thought the prices were moderate when you throw in a glass or two of wine, but it wasn't outrageous or unexpected. I haven't spent anytime in the bar area but it appears bustling with a nice crowd that wasn't too loud but made the space feel alive.  I'll definitely be back.
