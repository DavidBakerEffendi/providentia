Oh my, oh dear.  I had heard of this particular cart from a friend who touted its greatness but I had not had the privilege of experiencing it myself until today.  Oh what a day today is! I had the lamb platter with rice and both the white and hot sauce.  The lamb was so flavorful and juicy and those sauces! I love spicy and that white sauce adds the perfect mild, creamy balance. GIVE ME MORE!  I'll definitely be going out of my way to get to this cart in the future.
