one of my all time favorite restaurants.I first came here with my dad and twin sister when she was checking out FIT 5 years ago. I've been a dozen of times since then, and the maitradi (sp?) still recognizes us and gives us free drinks, and when I first moved to the east village gave me a free dessert to welcome me to the city! besides the stellar service the food is amazing. the fettucini giovanni is a must have if you go there. and try any of their desserts.
