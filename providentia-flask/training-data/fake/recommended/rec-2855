Red meat. It's back in my life. And the burger at Rex1516 was fabulous. Onion marmalade and bleu cheese? Hell yeah. I pushed the bacon to the side and jumped right in. Â The roll was so soft. It was homey, just like the atmosphere. Heirloom tomato salad was disappointing. There was probably a 4:1 ratio of red onion: tomato and the cheese was barely there. Would not get this dish again, unless they halved the price. Right now it's $10, which seems outrageous. Service was great and the atmosphere is old timey and cozy. It's a fun dinner spot for sure.
