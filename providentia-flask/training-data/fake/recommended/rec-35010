We visited Banana Leaf tonight after having a bad experience at Erawan. The food was very good. Despite the restaurant being crowded, they were quick and efficient. We ordered the chicken satay and it was very good. We had the Green Curry Seafood and it was excellent. We also ordered the Drunken Noodle which we thoroughly enjoyed. We had Vegetable fried rice that could have used more spices. We also ordered red curry chicken and it was yummy. We did have Malaysian Iced coffee which was delicious. We will definitely be back!
