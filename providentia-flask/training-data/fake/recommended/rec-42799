This was my final stop on a self imposed tour of NYC craft cocktail joints. My girlfriend and I showed up around eleven. We had almost decided not to come because the weather was awful, but were so glad we did. The whole place had a very relaxed but upscale vibe, and though it was a little crowded it wasn't super loud or obnoxious at all. We managed to get a table tucked in the back half, where we (well, I, since she's a vegetarian) enjoyed the hand cut steak tartare. I've had some rough experiences with steak tartare in the past, but I decided to give it a go, and this was DELICIOUS. Service was great, and our Amelia cocktails were even better. I'll definitely be stopping by next time I'm in the city.
