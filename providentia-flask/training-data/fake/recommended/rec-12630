I've been back to Room Service twice since my last review. Once for a bachelorette party and once with my friend. I was surprised they were able to handle a big party of 10 and it was crowded and packed in there because it was a Friday night. They were really busy and couldn't hold the table for us for that long because the party was running late so we had to wait even longer! Boo! Anyways, it was fun and food was good. They were kind of rushing us and the food did come faster than I thought it would like it was ready in the kitchen. When I came with my friend, we were squished in a shared table sitting across from each other at a table of about 8. I didn't like that feeling because that table should be reserved for a big party, not for sharing like that, especially when there are fat people or men sitting next to you taking up even more space! :( Anyways, it is really loud in there. And again, the food came way too fast and suspiciously fast.
