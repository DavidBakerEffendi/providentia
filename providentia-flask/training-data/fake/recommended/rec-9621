This place was a pleasant surprise.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, small store front, but when you walk in, it's a complete surprise how large it is and the atmosphere is very nice.  It's a lot different from their other place in Greenpoint.  So this was definitely a surprise. The food was very good, we had the the ceviche combo app.  Wow, it was 5 types of ceviche, delicious and plentiful.  Our server was also great and super sweet and the bus boys were polite and incredibly efficient.  Overall, my husband and I had a great time and great meal.
