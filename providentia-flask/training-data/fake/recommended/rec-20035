I wanted to see if their hummus was any good, and had also read the rave reviews about their pita. It's also really close to my apt so even though I REALLY wanted the hummus from Beyoglu, we came here instead. I ordered the falafel plate with hummus. Bland, bland, and bland. Disappointment. At least the salad was fresh. The peanut sauce thing tasted funny, the hummus really had no flavor. I kept wanting to add lemon or something to give it SOME kind of flavor, and ended up sprinkling some salt and pepper on it. My sis got the chicken pitza, which was just okay. The mint tea was refreshing, and I liked that there was no wait and the A/C was blasting. The little cornbread honey cake at the end was good, but I probably will not be coming back. Beyoglu, if only you weren't all the way in the UES!
