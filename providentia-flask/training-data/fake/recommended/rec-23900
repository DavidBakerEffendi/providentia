My girlfriend and I have gone to this restaurants other lactation in northern liberties and have always been a huge fan. So when we moved down to south Philly, it was nice to still have the same great food here at Los Caballitos. The fresh Guacamole was fantastic and I got the enchiladas con picadillo de puerco where as my girlfriend had seitan anticuchos with quinoa salad. As for drinks, we tried the tangerine margarita on the rocks. Ample, yet well balanced amount of alcohol with amazing flavor. All in all, this is going to be a new regular restaurant for us.
