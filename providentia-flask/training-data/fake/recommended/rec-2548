This place is dangerous. It's right across the street from my office. Lucky for me, they don't open until 5:30pm. Came here last night after seeing a Broadway show. Every time I come here, I'm never let down. The food is AUTHENTIC Japanese food. Small plate style. And they always have a board full of daily specials. Their sake list is extensive, as well as their mixed Japanese-esque cocktails and shochu/calpico concoctions. I can't remember everything that I've had but here's a few: Kare Age - free range fried chicken fried to perfection tofu nabe w/ ponzu - tofu hot pot w/ shiitake and scallion w/ ponzu dipping sauce oshinko - japanese pickled veggies buta kimuchi - stir fried pork and kimchi yaki udon - pan fried udon w/ brown sauce and chicken edamame - it's cold here. LOVE COLD EDAMAME! chicken skin yakitori - grilled chicken skin tofu steak w/ cheese and teriyaki - omg!!! ~droooool~ Ok... There's more but I can't remember. But who cares? This place is awesome. This is as close to a real underground Japanese bar that you will get in NYC without boarding a plane to Osaka. Stays open till 4am too. A few flat screens that can be seen from every seat in the house that will always be playing some sporting event. And hey, if Anthony Bourdain comes to this place, it must be authentic and good right? RIGHT!
