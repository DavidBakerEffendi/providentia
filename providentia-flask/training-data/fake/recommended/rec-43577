I went to Room Service with a couple of friends for a temporary farewell dinner after hearing raves about their Thai food. Firstly, the giant chandelier was quite the sight. A little tacky but kind of cool. We were seated, and service was pretty much like any other New York restaurant. On my friends recommendation, I ordered the Spicy Basil Noodle and they came right out in 10mins flat. That was pretty amazing. The food was really delicious, not the highest quality of food, but nonetheless so very delicious. And Priced so reasonably. Overall, with the speed, price and taste, I'd give them 4 Stars. P.S. - The restaurant is quite loud and kind of dark, not the ideal place to go on dates or have a conversation. Loud conversations with friends are OK!
