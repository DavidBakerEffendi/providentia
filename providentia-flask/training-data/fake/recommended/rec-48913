Stopped in this afternoon and got some soups for dinner. Every single person in the place seemed like they were in a bad mood and really didn't want to be waiting on us. First off, the soups are expensive. You'll pay about $9.00 for a "regular" size (about 10 oz) soup if you pick anything with seafood in it. The chicken noodle had an odd flavor to it and my child who will eat ANY kind of chicken noodle soup refused to eat it. My wife had the maryland crab soup and found it overly sweet, salty and she couldn't taste any crab at all. I tried the Lobster Bisque, which is touted as the best in the world... It was not. It wasn't bad but not fantastic by any stretch. I think the lobster bisque from Whole Foods was better. (Which could probably Â be said for all three of the soups) I doubt I'll be going back.
