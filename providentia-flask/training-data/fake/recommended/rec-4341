So I avoided long lines by calling in my order.  I love the idea of customized stir fry but went with the sour cherry BBQ and the spicy garlic as is on the menu.  Although a little pricey, I actually think portion sizes are good and fulfilling.  I do however think that while I enjoyed my stir fry it was just short of being great; a lot drier and blander than I expected.  The BBQ was a little too sweet and the spicy garlic had the spice but not enough garlic flavor.  I am confident extra sauce will resolve these issues.
