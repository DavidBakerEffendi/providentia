Come on, SON! This place is all that and a bag of Chumpees. Namean? From the orange and eggshell color scheme to the the incredible Jamaican grapefruit soder (Ting..as in "dis ya' ting mon) The Crate (as we insiders call it) is straight from coolsville by way of Byberry. Fela box sets, Numero group, Wax Poetics, 4 Men with Beards reissh action, what's not to lurv? Besides you get to shoot the breeze with all the cool heads that work and hang at this now essential coffee and vinyl repository. Peeps from Crooklyn are like "dag, this place is ill"...plus cute girls are always wandering around looking all adorable and what not. Do not pass Gogol Bordello, do not collect TARP monies, go directly to this urban oasis and make your mark in Western history.
