I waited for about 20-25 mins for my take out order and when i finally got the bag a roach/beetle/insect crawled up to top. I thought i imagined it so I took all the food to put on the counter and sure enough there was one crawling around and one dead.  With all the 5 star reviews I figured it must be good, but that I wasn't expecting.  First and last time coming to this place
