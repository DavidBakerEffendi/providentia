What a place with great potential. Big space, but this place needs some soul. Music, or art maybe? A rearranging of the furniture? Not really sure what it is missing, it just felt like it was missing the ambiance or an inviting quality. And my first time eating there, met a friendly new face, but my adult grilled cheese was burnt on one side and soggy on the other and the tomato was as tough as gristle. I left feeling like I had been had. $10 down the drain.
