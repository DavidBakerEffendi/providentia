So disappointed! In love with Â Tinto and anything Garces. But there is one bartender.....we stopped by earlier tonight hoping to grab a spot at the bar. A barstool was clearly missing and he refused to accommodate us! Very disappointed that he had no desire to seat us. I expect more from this place. Regardless, the food is to die for and I'm sure we will be back again soon....but won't be venturing upstairs.
