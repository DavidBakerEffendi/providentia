Great brunch, and very friendly service. Â I have gone in several times to assemble a cheese plate and always have found one of the employees (or owners) willing to help me pick a range of cheeses, asking about my likes/dislikes, and letting me taste each one before buying it. This is a great business to have in the neighborhood and I am happy to support them.
