LOve it ! Food is delicioso !!! I never ever in my life had such a tasty aceitunas (olives). Sangria is fruity and refreshing ( I had white mango sangria ) Music is authentic Spanish ( not Latin ) Service is great ( handsome spanish macho , who will help to satisfy any of your culinary desires fast and promptly ) Decor is nice and inviting . Only issue I have - that tables are to wide , so to be able to hear your companion you must seat on same side of table , not in front of each other . Prices are good also )
