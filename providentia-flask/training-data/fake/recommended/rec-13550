After my sister raved about Pomme Frites, I dreamt of the day I could make a visit.  I mean french fries with a variety of different dipping sauces, are you kidding me...?! The line is out the door when we get there.  It's freezing, but we wait, and surprisingly, the line goes by quickly.  The venue itself is tiny--just a counter to order and  maybe three very small tables and a bar area with 4-5 seats. I love that the staff is friendly and work fast.  Love that at the bar/counter there's holes to put the triangle cone full of fries.   The fries are divine!  Just the right amount of crispy and soggy (not burnt, not even the small pieces, and not SUPER greasy).  There are so many different dipping sauces to choose from it's overwhelming.  Nice that there are free ones and that others are just an additional $1.00.  My sister and I settle on mango chutney and curry ketchup especial (curry, raw onions and their special mayo).  For $5.50 (regular sized) my sister and I have a great snack to warm us up before we brave the cold again.  What a deal!
