I went last week for dinner with a bunch of friends.  I was expecting a lot more out of this restaurant.   The lamb sliders tasted funky (and I'm not talking gamey).  The ricotta was creamy and pretty tastey.  There was barely any wild boar in the pasta and Mama's Ravioli is definitely not even close to the ravioli my friend's italian grandmother used to make.  This place needs to step it up...way up.  I give Bobby De Niro a close to zero.
