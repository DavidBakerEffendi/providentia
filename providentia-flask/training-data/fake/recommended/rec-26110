Love this Â place for brunch, late dining on weekends. The brunch prix fixe includes coffee and juice. My favorites are the fritatta and the fresh baked cornettos that you can order for $2.00 and for 25 cents extra, one with a light cream on the inside. The organic wines are delicious and priced well. Music is always cool. The staff are super friendly.
