Read all the great reviews, waited an hour and a half to get in, then waited another forty minutes after sitting down for our large Revolution pizza (essentially chopped up mushrooms with barely discernible caramelized onions).  Pizza was good but we are mystified at the over the top reviews.  Crust wasn't particularly aromatic, bottom of the pizza was slightly soggy.  We liked the rectangle slicing.  Don't think the pizza was worth the lengthy wait.   While we were waiting, we went down the street to Vin wine bar.  Now that was a great place (will review separately!).
