Huge and I mean HUGE Fritattas! Come to this place with an empty stomach. The Ginger Lemonade was refreshing and I might attempt to recreate at home if I can. My friend had one of their quiches that looked good. Selling point at this place, the portions for the price and their homemade ketchup! Yummy, slightly spicy, the perfect compliment to most of their egg dishes and home fries. Go early as seating is hard to find. It's a self sign up wait list and it gets packed pretty early. We lucked out and got there in between shifts so we only waited about 15-20 min for a table.
