One of the best burgers...period. I've passed this place so many times but there was always a line outside. Yesterday , my fianc√© and I passed it and it looked like no line so we took a shot at trying to get in. The menu has a lot of truffle items on the menu so if your a fan of truffles come on in. First off they have REAL soda, not fountain but the Mexican bottled Sprite, coke, fanta and all. The skinny fries are better than McDonalds. Yes, I said that. They come with. 4 dipping sauces so you don't need to top them if you don't want. Now you might balk at the price of the burger but once you see the ingredients , your getting a great deal. The truffle burgers are by far the best and you do taste that hint of truffle. The bun the use is also slightly sweetened and helps make the high quality beef stand out. The waitress will tell you that it is recommended to have the burger medium rare but it does come out slight more to the medium side. Presentation is fantastic and they brand every bun with their logo. It's a nice little touch. The burgers may look small but they are packed with flavor and you will be full. Have a vegetarian friend or a non-beef eating friend? No problem! There are actually 3-4 items for them to choose from. But besides choosing how you want your meat cooked, there are no substitutions. But trust the chefs, they know what they are doing.
