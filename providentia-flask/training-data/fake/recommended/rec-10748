Cute place.  Small menu (which is fine because I have a hard time making up my mind).  Knowledgeable and accommodating wait staff. I was told that the cheeseburger was highly regarded, so that's what I got.  (Even though there were a couple of other things that seemed good). It was cooked the way I asked for it.  Wasn't the best burger I've ever had, but it was good.  The fries were a bit salty. Biggest complaint -   Worst ketchup I have ever tasted.  One of my friends asked about it and was told that they were trying out a couple of home made ketchups....  Hopefully they choose something else.  This one tasted like sweetened tomato apple sauce...  Might want to sneak in a couple packets of Heinz
