I wish I could fall in love with every place as hard as I fell for Diner. My friend Trevor and I were walking Williamsburg, trying to decide on a place to eat. He mentioned a spot that he would frequently bike past but had never been inside of, and though it was a bit of a walk on a cold day, I could not be more grateful for our willingness to trek. The lunch menu was small, which I enjoy, and the ambiance was such a mix of solo lunchers with newspapers, and four-top hung over hipsters, all of whom looked unfazed by their surroundings. Being a Diner virgin, I just sat and took it all in. I usually can't finish a cup of coffee. I'll order one, drink about 2/3rds of the thing, and then realize I'm done. I drank FOUR CUPS here. It was delicious. Our adorable waitress wrote the specials on our table, which had a white piece of paper as a tablecloth, and though they all sounded spectacular, I already knew I wanted a burger. I cannot make this plain enough. This was the best goddamn burger I've ever had in my life. It required time and focus, as art observed usually does. This is not a place to wolf your food. Please be courteous, and love what you're there to do. The experience of eating can be very primal, out of necessity, and simultaneously a completely human experience, something developed and magical. Diner is pure magic. Trevor got the chicken sandwich, and if I hadn't ordered that burger, I would have been really blown away. I had already fallen in love though, the sandwich was nice, really nice, but I was already taken. I saw what other people had ordered- a giant bowl of mussels? A really fresh looking omelet? Damn, how much do I wish I lived in New York?! I'd be there far too often.
