The 5-star rating on Yelp tells it like it is...this place is as good as it gets.  Next time you find yourself in Philadelphia, make sure to go here. You won't be sorry. Don't let the small dining room in the front fool you.  This place is huge -- keep walking past the open kitchen and you'll find plenty of seating choices -- including the bar. Our choices - grill calamari, caprese salad, chicken parm, 4-cheese &mushroom ravioli.  Everything was AMAZING!  The flavors were incredible.  I hear the eggplant parm is very good -- and will definitely try it on my next visit. I also have to rave about the service. Very attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and didn't mind answering our questions. Enjoy!
