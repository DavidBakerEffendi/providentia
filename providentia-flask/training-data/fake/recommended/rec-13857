Wow, these dumplings are as good as I've had anywhere in the states.  The only places I've had dumplings that compare are when I lived in China and Taiwan.  For $8, my partner and I had steamed dumplings, fried dumplings (also know as potstickers), dumpling soup, a sesame seed and chive pancake, and two drinks!  I dont believe any place could get compare to the value that this place has to offer.  More importantly, no place could probably compare to the taste as well.  These are as authentic as they get.  Get there as soon as you can, and I guarantee you'll be back again and again. One more thing, this place is TINY.  Best to get your food to go, and enjoy it at the park, or take their frozen dumplings home, and steam them yourself.
