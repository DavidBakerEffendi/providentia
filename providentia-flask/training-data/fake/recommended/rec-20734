Ever since Umami Burger opened a space in the West Village, flocks of foodies and burger lovers have waited hours just to get a taste of what U.B believes to be umami (which is the savory taste). After my second attempt to get seats at this place, I finally managed to get a spot; It did not take as long as the first time I tried which was like 90 minutes probably because the crowd has died down a bit. The interior consist of two floors and a bar on the first. We were seated and I already knew what I was going to get after skimming their menu weeks beforehand; I just had to wait for my accomplice to choose what she wanted to eat. Service was pretty nice, where this gentleman catered to everything we needed and was easy to approach. The off the menu Cheesy Tots came to the table first and it came with a side of four sauces; They were okay for tator tots and the array of sauces made it even tastier. The burgers came after and I could have hardly waited. I had the Manly Burger and she had the Cali Burger, medium rare of course. The Manly Burger was impeccably good, as I finished it in record time. I also had half of the Cali Burger since she complained to be stuffed from the Cheesy Tots; It was also pretty good but not as fatty and delicious as the Manly Burger. We could have opted for dessert but I think one and a half burgers and some tots were enough to satisfy my cravings. Great place for a burger in the West Village, hopefully the wait will die down completely soon.
