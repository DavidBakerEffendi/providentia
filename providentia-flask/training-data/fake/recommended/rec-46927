Sabrina's is great for brunch. Have been here several times with different groups of people, and everyone has always been pleased with the food. There can be a wait on Saturdays and Sundays, so if you are looking to avoid waiting I'd recommend arriving before 10:30. If you do have to wait, grab coffee at Gleaner's (cash only) around the corner on 9th. The barking chihuahua is delicious and huge! The portions looked large for all meals in the café. Coffee is decent, orange juice is great, décor is cute. Really solid brunch spot.
