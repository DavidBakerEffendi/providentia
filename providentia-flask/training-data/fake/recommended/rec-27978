The food tasted like the first time I heard the Beatles/Pearl Jam/Phish, what have you. All of the dishes were presented very beautifully and tasted fresh. The carrot gazpacho will stay with me for some time. One miss was the squid, it was a bit salty, but you can't win them all. This is a must try.
