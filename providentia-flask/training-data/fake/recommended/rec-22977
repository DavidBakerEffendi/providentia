Well, at the age of 57, I can honestly say that this one of the worst dining experiences that I ever had.  We ordered yakitori and edamame as appetizers.  The yakitori (what little there was of it in any event) was undercooked.  Nothing like raw chicken.  And, the edamame (which I normally love) tasted fishy, like it had been steamed in water used to rinse fish.  After the appetizers were served, we waited forty minutes for our sushi.  When it did not come, I went over to the kitchen to say, never mind-we will just take the check.  The waiter then proceeded to argue with me.  Saying, for example, "I know about fine dining and the appetizer is supposed to come first".   I pointed out that that did not mean he was supposed to wait 40 minutes while we sat there with the (inedible) appetizers.  He wanted to charge me for the sushi which I said we would not pay for as it was not timely served. When I mentioned that the appetizers were also not good, he started to argue about that too because I had not complained before.   It then took another 10 minutes to get the check and they still charged me for the yakitori which we plainly had not eaten. Surreal and horrible experience.  Not surprised, in retrospect, that we were the only customers there.
