After reading reviews about this place being tending to be crowded, we made reservations and arrived around 6pm on a Friday night, which was when they just opened.  We were immediately seated in the U shaped dining room in the back.  The ambience and mood of the restaurant was nice and even had a psychic reader in the front.  The place didn't start getting packed until we were done with dinner, which was around seven-thirty. We ordered: Hand-Cut Steak Tartar - Sauce and other ingredients were mixed at the table. Charcuterie - Good mix of meats, especially the spicy ones.  I was just expecting chicken liver pate, but was pleasantly surprised by the little bit of cheese and various sides that were included. Bone Marrow Poppers - Nice flaky pastry shell, but the bone marrow was a little too oily and the sauce was a bit heavy on the sweet side. Bacon wrapped Lamb Chops - If you love crispy bacon, this is the dish to get.  Since I was more of a fan of soft bacon, I took it apart to get to the lamb, which was really tasty, even without the bacon.
