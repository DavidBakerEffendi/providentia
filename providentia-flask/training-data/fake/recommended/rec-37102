Every time I have brunch at Cafe Orlin it's a sea of beautiful people. Maybe that's why I feel so at home here. I can eat the food of my people, the beautiful people. That being said, the food is equally beautiful.  With an eclectic mix of standard brunch fare with some mediterranean twists, you'll find something to tempt everyone's palette, in fact there is almost too many awesome items to try on the menu!  But be warned, NO SUBSTITUTIONS!  My group had Diane's Breakfast, the Huevos Rancheros and the Poached Eggs over Potato Pancakes!  Each served to perfection.  The food came out quickly, but our server seemed to be new, so the service wasn't out-of-this world, but totally acceptable! I definitely recommend this spot for a brunch, but come early as it can be packed!
