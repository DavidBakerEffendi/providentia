All my life living in Philly and being at the Reading Terminal I had never had the desire to try the roast pork here that is so highly raved about. Not really sure why I caved in and tried it, maybe it was lingering as one of those sandwiches you "must" try. I had high hopes like that ant and the rubber tree, but what I got was a fairly dry, weirdly seasoned pork sandwich. I did get the provolone and I had a hard time trying to distinguish it on the sandwich. I did eat it all, didn't want to waste any of the steeply priced pork (just about $10). I really can not wrap my head around the big deal about the pork. I am happy I was disappointed in a bizarre way, at least I will never wonder, whats the big deal about the pork.
