We checked this place out after reading the reviews on Yelp.  We loved the atmosphere especially the intimate smaller setting, bar up front and the discrete appearance from the outside.  The no credit card policy seemed to catch everyone by surprise but we were aware thanks to Yelp.  The service was good considering the small staff in attendance.  The DJ adds a nice touch, he played a blend of 90s and contemporary songs.  We were a little disappointed with the food (noodles and sauteed veggies) but the prices were ridiculously cheap considering we had 2 appetizers 2 drinks and 2 entrees under $40.  We'll definitely make a return and try the curry and fish dishes next time.
