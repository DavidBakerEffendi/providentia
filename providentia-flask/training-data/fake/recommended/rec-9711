Limited menu which makes it easy to decide. I now see why it's known for their rotisserie! It's delicious. Â It's a typical latin meal. Arroz, Pollo, and Beans. Great portions. Enough for two or three. Their Sangria is really good. The wait time was short. The decor is beautiful. It can get a little loud but being hispanic I'm use to it. Lol It has a family feel to it but also perfect for a date. They have a few around NYC but this is the best one.
