The food = nasty. The cheesecake = delish. All three of us thought our food was nasty. My niece ordered the salmon with grilled veggies and she thought everything tasted funky. My sister had chicken tenders and didn't have anything nice to say about them and we ordered onion rings that had more of a pancake batter then they did breading. So so nasty. Oh.. yeah.. and our server was rude.
