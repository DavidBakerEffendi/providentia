Wow, One of the better meals I've had in a very long time.  Everything was well-prepared and well-presented.  Even the salads were worth raving about.  My favorite was probably the lamb skewers - meat was tender and perfectly medium-rareish cooked.   The waiter knew a lot about the wines, about every dish and was spot on in the service. Definitely plan on getting here early, especially on Friday or Sat night.  We had to wait 1.5 hours at the japanese place next door, but it was WELL worth the wait.
