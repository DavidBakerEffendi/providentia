After reading several glowing Yelp reviews, my boyfriend and I decided to check out Magnolia's for a late breakfast. The wait was about 30 minutes when we arrived at 11:30AM on a Saturday, but bar seating was available immediately, so we went that route.  We started with coffee, mimosas (also available in fun flavors like cranberry and apple cider) and fresh banana bread with cranberry cream cheese.  The other reviewers aren't lying-- the bread is phenomenal, and the coffee was fresh and  hot. For entrees, my boyfriend had Pumpkin Bread French Toast (on special) and I had the Eggs Benedict (served with spinach and tomato). The French Toast was insanely sweet-- in fact way too sweet for my taste, but my boyfriend loved it and said the flavor combination was great. The Eggs Benedict was delicious and made even better with the homemade condiments offered on the side (crushed carrot and garlic hot sauce, anyone?). Our server wasn't the most attentive-- it seemed like she was handling a lot of tables outside of the bar top, but a different server was really funny and helpful. She checked on us constantly, and I wish I would have gotten her name to give kudos where it's due. All in all, great breakfast spot. I'm not a vegetarian or eating gluten free, but the menu is VERY VERY friendly to those trying to cater to that sort of diet. Highly recommended!
