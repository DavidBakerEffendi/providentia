I've been waiting to try Ladurée ever since I started eating macarons! This place always has a decent sized line and so many different, decadent flavors to choose from.  These macarons are SUPER pricey though! It's $21 for a box of six (though the box IS very cute and the macarons are delicious!).   I think this is a great place to visit to try a few of the flavors and take (many) pictures, but it's a bit expensive for me. And to tell the truth, I think Chantal Guillon in SF is comparable or maybe even a little better!
