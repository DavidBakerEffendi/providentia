When you're looking for an apartment in NYC, make sure you not only check the distance to the nearest subway, but also to the nearest Meatball Shop. We're serious. Why it's worth it: You know those times you just really crave balls. Get your mind out of the gutter - I'm not talking about R-rated balls, just some tender, sauce lathered meatballs, over some delicious pasta and topped with shaved parmesan. The Meatball Shop is our go-to spot with visitors and friends... because there are options for everyone. Vibe/layout: This restaurant, no matter the location, is trendy and dimly lit, bumping hip hop through the speakers, serving homemade ice cream sandwiches and creating masterpiece meatballs. Ideal meal/"The Usual": 4 chicken balls with classic tomato sauce ($8) over rigatoni ($5) with family jewels (fried egg; $1) and a chicken pesto meatball slider ($3) F.Y.I.: This restaurant neither takes reservations nor delivers... it's that good.
