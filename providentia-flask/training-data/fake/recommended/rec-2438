Besides the insanely long waits on Friday and Saturday nights, Melograno is perfection defined.  If you haven't had the Papardelle Tartufate, you haven't lived.  I would go there if you haven't, because if you die tomorrow, you are totally f***ed because you will never try the single best pasta dish ever know to humankind (possibly alien-kind as well if any undocumented workers ever dine here).  Honestly there is no describing it.   I have tried many of the other dishes too - the rigatoni with amatriciana sauce and pancetta (very satsifying), the cacio e pepe (didn't care for this one, too peppery, not enough other flavors), the various raviolis always covered in their divine brown butter and sage sauce, and the quail (very succulent, although I didn't care for their polenta).   The Melograno salad is always a great start to the meal with a light and refreshing dressing.  I also really enjoy the fried goat cheese and anchovy appetizer, which is a really dressed-up and grown-up version of one of my childhood favorites.  The ability to bring your own wine is great, and even though the wait is often long, they will take your cell phone number and call you when your table is ready, so you can go get drinks at a nearby bar (try Village Whiskey or Jolly's).   If you haven't eaten here yet and you are reading this right now, stop.  Go now.
