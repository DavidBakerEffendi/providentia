I was looking for something different to celebrate a night out with my husband. We found this little spot in the middle of a residential neighborhood, and fell in love with the unique decor, interesting menu, and eclectic feel. Hands down, the best part of our meal was the appetizer: avocados and tortillas. AMAZING! Not as great was the Anticuchos, recommended if we were in an adventurous mood. That night it was seared cow heart. The server said it was super tender, but we found it to be extra chewy, gristly and cooked unevenly. That's ok, I think the delicious entrees made up for it. We had the fish and steak, both cooked and seasoned to perfection! To top it all off, we tried a couple of the desserts which were fantastic as well. Service towards the end of our meal was slow, and at times non-existent. But overall a very fun place!!
