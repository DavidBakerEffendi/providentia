Consistently being mentioned in "Philly's Top Bars" lists was a good enough reason for us to stop by this bar in Fishtown during PBW. It's bigger than I thought, with a couple of different bar areas and plenty of seating. We sat at the smaller bar area in the middle and reviewed the craft beer chalkboard. I noticed written halfway down the list, "Dogfish Head Black and Red." Never heard of it, but it sounded intriguing. Awesome! Â I wish I could buy it in a four or six pack, but apparently it's a limited edtion draft only. Dang it! We only had one drink and didn't eat, so I'm sure there's more to JBs than we experienced. Next time.
