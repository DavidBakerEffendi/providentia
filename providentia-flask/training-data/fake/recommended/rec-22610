I'm no expert on Chinatown restaurants.  But of all the ones I've been to, this has been the best.  Quick, friendly service.  Clean, neat and decorated with fun giant food posters on the walls.  Comprehensive menu and accurate descriptions.  Great food.  We especially liked the sesame shrimp and the green dumplings (forgot their official name).  I'd definitely recommend it.
