Super cute wine bar in HK, a little bit out of the way but worth the trek. They have a great happy hour until 7 for $2 off glasses of wine. Wine list is easy to navigate, definitely some types you will recognize but some producers that are not mainstream. The deviled eggs were awesome!! Seating is designed for parties of two at the bar but also have a roomier lounge area for bigger groups.
