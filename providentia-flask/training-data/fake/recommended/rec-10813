Our second visit for Brunch was not quite as enjoyable as the first. He had the chef's omelet which was very nice, but the potatoes were mushy, not crisp in any way. I had the grits with shrimp, very creamy and rich, but barely warm. Most outstanding, and not in a good way, is the LOUD music, not the way to ease into the morning. Finally, once your order's placed and delivered, the waitstaff disappears, making remedies difficult.
