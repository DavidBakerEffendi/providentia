I've come here consistently in the past 5 years.  Great place for sushi!  Near the 2,3,4,5,R,A trains.  Restaurant could use an upgrade.  I typically order the sashimi platter, and just love how they put it together.  Their soups are always delicious too.  If you're in the area, and craving sushi - stop by.  You will enjoy the food for sure!
