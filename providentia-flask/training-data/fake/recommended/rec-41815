Gueros is AMAZING!  The nachos are the best nachos EVER!  The delicious, ooey, gooey queso!!!  And don't get me started on the margaritas!!! Real juice, quality Tequila and for the price - cant be beat! The tacos are great - not huge or authentic Mexican but high quality products and always hit the spot!  My faves: fried chicken, shrimp and picadillo! It has become our go-to take out at least twice a week - it's an ADDICTION!   Keep up the delicious food!  So glad it's in the neighborhood - only wish it would be open a little later!
