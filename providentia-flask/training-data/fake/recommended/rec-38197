I have stopped here occasionally over the years.  Quality had gone down noticeably over time, but last month I stopped here after a nearby appointment and ordered the General Tso's chicken.  When I got home I was appalled to find that the chicken was nothing but a huge ball of cornstarch with a tiny fleck of chicken (at least I think it was chicken) at the very center.  I have never seen anything that looked so much like a clear attempt to rip off the customer.  I should have cut a few of the "nuggets" in half and photographed them for this site.  I will not go back again.
