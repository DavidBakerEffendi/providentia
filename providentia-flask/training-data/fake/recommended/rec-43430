I can not think of anything to take a star away for! Everything was just perfect! The best unagi I have ever had, some of the specials I have ever seen, and the spicy lobster was fantastic! Even the music was perfect for a great sushi place. I hate going to a Chinese or sushi or anytype of foreign restaurant and they have R&B music playing! Nooo! This is a sushi place yet should have those really cool Chinese music playing. The iron chef house had perfect music and a great presentation. Â I felt like I was in china or japan, even though I have never been there, it did not feel like America and that is how it should be. This place provided a great lunch at a good price and it gave a great experience to a Texan like myself.
