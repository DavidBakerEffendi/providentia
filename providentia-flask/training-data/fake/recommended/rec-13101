Popular by terms of limited seating. Lovely place. Even lovelier breakfast. Even if you think it is annoying when people do it, you will probably grab your iphone and take a snapshot at the early morning meal you order at Clinton. Very often there seems to be a 2 hr wait. Go shop in SOHO while you wait. I liked everything about this place.
