One of my favorite restaurants in the city. Food is always good and it's never too crowded or too empty. Although I mostly come here for dinner or on the weekends, and I hear lunch can be crazy. Favorite things to order: Chicken rice pot - amazingly good and cheap. I like to sprinkle in some wasabi soy sauce and pepper flakes on top. Mr. Miguels tacos - best taco in the city wow. Must try! Gyoza - 1/2 price on weekends is a steal Special Yellowtail sashimi - just melts in your mouth like perfect sashimi should. and it's a steal! Vegetable tempura - so good we ordered 2 In general, I would say their tapas menu is better than the set menu. Just be careful you don't order too much. A mistake I have made way too often but never really regretted :) Me and my gf came here last weekend and ordered 10 total dishes and a few beers (1/2 price on weekends also!). Sublime.
