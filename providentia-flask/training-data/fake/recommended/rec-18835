My friend and I came here for lunch. Abner's is great because there is parking . Although we have a Chevy suburban which was very difficult to park for such a tight lot. The service is average, but pleasant. Prices are very reasonable for what you get. I got a steak and whiz. I think they put too much whiz on but you can tell them less . I'd probably go for a provolone next time. The rolls are fresh and the steak portion is very generous. This is an old establishment but has an awesome atmosphere and locals. Overall, pretty good place.
