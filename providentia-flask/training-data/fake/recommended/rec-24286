I love this place! i can't say I'm a connoisseur of sushi but everything I've eaten at Izumi has been excellent. The quality of their fish is very high. Try the Avocado Tuna, it is as beautiful as it is delicious. The specialty Maki rolls are lovely and the Miso is perfect. Great prices for the quality and the staff is wonderful especially Meli
