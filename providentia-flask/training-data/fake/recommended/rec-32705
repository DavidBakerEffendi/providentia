I was in Philly for less than 24 hours on a Road Trip from TX to CT. Many restaurants in the area were offering a Halloween Themed menu with 2 tickets to "Terror Behind The Walls". I checked out 8 or 9 menus and this place had the best options, especially since my Travel Buddy was vegetarian. Every bit was tasty and we were sad that we weren't in Philly longer to try their regular menu. This was place was delicious and whoooo their Penn Apple Martinis are string. Gave me enough courage to walk across the street and not bail on the Terror Behind The Walls. Had I bailed I would have regretted it..so thank you Fare for your fare. I Fare thee well!
