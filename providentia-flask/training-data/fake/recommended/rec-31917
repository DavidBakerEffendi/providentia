Great sandwich joint - not terribly familiar with banh mi, but the meat (I tried chicken and pork) is good, everything taste fresh, the bread is crispy, portions large - if you're looking for something filling and still not too heavy, check it out. The flavors are all bright, meat's well-cooked, and you'll leave the shop wanting to come back. Â Pricey (for a sandwich - around $10) but its a big sandwich. Place itself is also great - owners are friendly and welcoming, everything is clean and it has a neighborly feel. I have heard it said from more experienced banh mi-eaters "There is nothing in this banh mi place that leaves me wanting." So, five stars - Certainly worth a visit.
