Finally got a chance to sample the food here at HCV while the kiddies were home for the holiday. I ordered the Corn Chowder. It was good and filling I would have spiced it up a bit  with some pepper and (gasp!) salt. With enough left over for today's lunch I thinned it out a bit added more seasoning and made a great soup.Loved the décor simple, functional easy to keep clean. Succulents on the wall a plus. I will come back to this place again before school is back in session..
