My favorite tapas place in NYC The fried chickpeas was highly recommended here but I BEG TO DIFFER. Other than that, I enjoyed all the items especially the squid ink rice (which is probably the reason why I'm even there). Dishes I've had in order of personal liking... - Squid in ink with rice (sometimes we get 2 servings of this!!!) - Razor clams and cockles - Lamb skewers - Ham croquette - White asparagus - Head on shrimp - Salt cod - Pork loin, piquillo and tetilla baguette sandwich - Octopus terrine - Chorizo with bittersweet choc - Anchovies - Periwinkles (a little difficult to maneuver) and what is tapas without Sangria? The food's so good that you'll hit the 100-dollar mark in no time for a 2-person meal ;p Based on my experience, we often keep the orders going and going and going...
