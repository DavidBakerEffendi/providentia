After the gym we decided to drop by and give this place a try. Had beef noodle soup, the mushroom dumplings, and papaya salad. The food was good, not extraordinary. The service was professional.  The music did seem a bit loud, but it was not overly oppressive.   The prices were reasonable and the portions tended to the small. I would recommend this place as a casual dining spot. Make sure you can wait as there is often  a line   outside.
