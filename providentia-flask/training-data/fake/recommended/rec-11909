I had friends come into town from Long Island just for brunch and then we waited about 30 minutes and  we all agreed it was worth it.  Cute decor in a tiny place but the food really was amazing.... Creative twists on normal brunch foods .. and we all enjoyed each of our meals... and stared at all the delicious looking food on the tables surrounding us.. i will be back..
