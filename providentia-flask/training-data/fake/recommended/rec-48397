If you know or like Eastern European food, you will probably like this place. Don't let the name remind you of the 1 star movie, it's different. Owner is nice, bartenders all seem cool, its mellow and never crowded, and you have the front bar area option or semi-secluded back room with funky artwork on the walls. My favorites are the Halusky (small dumpling type deals with rich melted cheese around it and solid bacon pieces) and this pork goulash dish with their homemade sauerkraut and sauce that might not be on the menu anymore but was KILLER. They have some good Euro beers on tap too. Always clean and neat inside. I go for brunch usually but I think it's relatively the same most other nights.
