We had heard about how great this restaurant was and how difficult to get reservations but we could just walk in and sit at the bar.  We did sit at the bar which was great.  Unfortunately, our bartender was not too knowledgeable about the wines or the meals and she was somewhat blasé about everything. Not too warm or accommodating.  We finally got the attention of another bartender who was quite knowledgeable and described the meals to us with a friendly, warm demeanor.  We ordered oysters which were very fresh then a cheese plate which was great along with wonderful rolls and butter.  Then we shared an eggplant dish as well as a potato dish.  The experience was great.  I would only say that it helps knowing that some of the dishes are eclectic and somewhat small.  It's a dining experience.  Yes, I would go back again.
