This place is crazy good! As a Texas refugee displaced in Syracuse NY I have been seriously missing good taquerias. On a trip to Parsippany NJ this place was suggested and did not disappoint. They have any kind of taco you would like- tripa, lengua, barbacoa, carnitas, pastor- all delicious con cebolla y cilantro AND grilled green onions with crunchy radish. My big Mexican spouse could of closed the place but modestly stopped at eight tacos. The two partners are Peruvian and Mexican. When they bought the place it was a delivery pizza joint and keeping those customers they still do pizza. Since there are a bagillion pizza joints around come for the good stuff and get the seriously spicy enchiladas verdes. We are hitting it up tomorrow for one more tacofest before returning to the barren food wasteland of salt city
