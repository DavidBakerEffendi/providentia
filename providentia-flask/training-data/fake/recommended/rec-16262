We don't commonly leave reviews unless the establishment is exceptional and truly deserves it.    Vite is one of the most authentic Italian restaurant outside of Italy (and we have dined at many Italian restaurants around Europe, Latin America and New York)   They made everything themselves (bread, pasta, sauce and chile spiced olive oil).   The meatballs and the eggplant dishes were my favorite.    Have not tried the pizza but will definitely will next time we are there again.   Inviting and cozy space, friendly staffs and great ambient.
