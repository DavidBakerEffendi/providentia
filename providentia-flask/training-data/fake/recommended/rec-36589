We were seated in the smallest of spaces on a super long table that separated the room. That's pretty much the worst of the best. The pork belly sticky buns taste the way I want heaven to feel. The pork shoulder was delicately sweetened with a lovely mustard sauce. The octopus was good but to me tasted like chicken. So maybe I'm not an octopus fan after all. Â  Service was great, wine was great, food was pretty darn good. If you haven't gone, you should.
