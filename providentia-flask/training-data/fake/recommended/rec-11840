ate here last night with a couple of girlfriends, and it was absolutely delicious.   we had this crostini with chickpeas and caramelized onions with ricotta, and it was seriously the most delicious thing i'd eaten all day.  i would've said all week, except we'd gone to a dinner party the night before where we some amazing shortribs and polenta.  anyway, if that dinner party had been the week before, i would've said the crostini were the most amazing thing i'd eaten all week. it ended up being about $70/ person, so while not the best meal deal in town, it's noteworthy for a special occasion.  or if you're one of those fancy hipsters who don't work but inexplicably are independently wealthy, a place to just go down the street to to grab a bite.
