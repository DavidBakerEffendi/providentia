Who has time to read a huge review. Lemme break it down for you... Exceptional rustic ambiance Lovely attentive staff Savory mozzarella & tomato (w/ avocado) salad Outstanding wine collection Quirky hipster bartender (with scary hearing abilities!) Mind bending white truffle gnocchi- soo good you'll eat it even if you're allergic! Non-snooty, down-to-earth eaters for the Upper East Side? YES! I love it- and I wish I had a 2nd stomach! I'll be baahhhhhk!
