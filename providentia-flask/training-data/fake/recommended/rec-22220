I been here twice and it's on my go-to list if I'm having a Belgian beer craving.  I've been to Belgium and fell in love with their brews during my trip, so every so often I step into a NYC outpost.  BXL has a solid draft selection from the homeland and you cannot go wrong with anything on tap.  I've had their fries and wings which are good and well-prepared.  Service is friendly and prompt.  No happy hour though so you will pay full-price for high quality beers.
