Johnny Brenda's is my favorite bar venue in the whole Philadelphia/NYC Metro area.  This place has great food and (local) beers, as well as restrooms you don't need to be afraid to (if the situation arises) poop in.  The area isn't sketchy and parking is plentiful. R5 Productions often books their over 21 shows here, so JBs gets extra props for that.  The venue area (upstairs) also has a great balcony (with bar).  The venue is roughly the same capacity as the North Star Bar.  JBs hosts artists and bands that could easily sell out much larger venues in NYC.
