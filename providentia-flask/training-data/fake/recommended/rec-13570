Good service and great Mexican food. The Nachos were super delish as well as the fajitas I ordered. I highly recommend ordering the Tres Leches cake, even if you can't fit anymore into your stomach. It was seriously one of the best things I have ever eaten. I'm moving to the area soon and coming back here is one of the first things I will do.
