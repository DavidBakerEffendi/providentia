I stopped in during one of the warmest days of Spring and found that not many people were dining in, which meant that service would be quick. A waiter seated me to a nearby table and served a glass of water. I ordered the Beef Rendang (Curry Beef) with rice and was surprised at how quickly I was served - perhaps 5 minutes had passed before my lunch was on the table in front of me. It was excellent - very tasty and a good sized serving. The beef was very moist and warm, though not as spicy as I hoped. I left sated and I'd definitely return again for a quick weekday lunch and try something different.
