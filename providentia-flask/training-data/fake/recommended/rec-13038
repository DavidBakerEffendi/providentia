So as someone who lives in Greenpoint, I am not a fan of many Greenpoint restaurants. Many of them are overrated. This is not one of those places. The food is delicious. They give you HUGE portions. The Mussels are absolutely amazing. The drinks are well made. They serve Duck pot pie. Good burgers. For brunch, get the pancakes (what my friend got) or the Morrocan Breakfast (what I got). Ok so yes, if you come for brunch it will be crowded and there will be a wait. But that is any DELICIOUS brunch place in NYC. That's how you know the place is good to be honest. So for brunch plan ahead, put your name down and go for a walk in the park. If you go for dinner or drinks there usually isn't a wait. The only thing I will say is that the seating can feel a bit cramped, but I really don't mind once the food comes.
