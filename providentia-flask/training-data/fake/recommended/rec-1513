Great sushi place. I used to live on the same block and would order their take out sushi all the time. However, nothing compares to eating in. The atmosphere is amazing and service is great. The entree's that they offer are delicious, but again, nothing compares to the sushi. They have a great variety of sushi so there is always something new to try. They also have some Japanese beer which I had never tried before coming here and it was very good.
