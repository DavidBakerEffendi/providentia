This place is hard to find in the hided alley but definitely worth of looking for. Went there with a friend for drinks, so we set at the bar. By the way, they have two bars inside. Our lady bartender definitely knew what she was doing and she loves doing this, you can tell this by just watching her making their signature cocktails. We also had artichoke dip - i have not gotten anything better before, so yammy. I will be back just to eat it there again. They have spacious place, several different rooms and second floor too and all decor is so interesting and I loved the crowd and the vibe of that place. I will be back for brunch or dinner!!! Hopefully soon.
