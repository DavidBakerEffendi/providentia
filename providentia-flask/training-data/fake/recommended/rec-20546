Amazing and delicious creative Greek cuisine, at reasonable prices in a very tastefully decorated establishment. The service is good, attentive and fast, their wine list is a good representation of quality Greek wines divided by region and the food is just exquisite. I know it's not everyone's favorite but I particularly enjoyed the ravioli, give it a try. And all that at reasonable prices, as opposed to the ridiculously astronomical prices of most Greek restaurants that i refuse to try out of self-respect for my intelligence. Probably my favorite Greek restaurant in Manhattan.
