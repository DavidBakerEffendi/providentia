Great after work spot - feels more upscale than other bars in the area and has that rustic chic vibe.  This place definitely feels more special than your standard happy hour bar, but thankfully the prices are not any higher.  Dim lighting also makes the space feel more romantic than the norm. The layout makes it a bit challenging to stand by the bar because it's very narrow, but there is plenty of seating in the front and back to compensate for that.  Appetizer choices are pretty good, and lots of good choices that can easily be picked at if you're with a group.
