By far the best italian food in all of manhattan - hands down. The portion size is generous, the staff is friendly and accommodating, and the atmosphere is loud and ALWAYS busy. At first I was worried it would be too costly, but it is worth every penny. ANYTHING on the menu is fantastic, and the special are fantastic. The food is truly a dining experience out of this world. I cannot sing praises to give it justice.
