Say Cheese Philadelphia is one of the new Philly food trucks which is setting up shop down near Temple. Luckily, they were down at Blocktoberfest this past weekend and I had the opportunity to dine on one of their AMAZING GOURMET GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICHES. I had The Standard Issue which included choice of bread, choice of 2 cheeses, choice of sauce, and choice of 2 sides. I had cheddar and pepper jack cheese with horsey mayo and fried onions and spinach....DELICIOUS! The bread was amazing and had 3 large pieces making this a hardy well worth the money sandwich @ $6. If you want some protein, bacon can be added to any grilled cheese. There are also some chicken options which include pesto or buffalo sauce...yum! Overall, the buttery, cheesy good sandwich any stomach will say YES, PLEASE to. Naturally, the lines were crazy at Blocktoberfest, but it is well worth the wait. If you spot this truck def take a stab at one of the grilled cheeses. I think this is an amazing idea for a food truck as WHO DOESN'T LIKE GRILLED CHEESE? Def check it out, the owner is very receptive to your comments, super friendly, and has other menu options coming when they are down at Temple in the next week.
