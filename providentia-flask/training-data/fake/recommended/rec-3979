$2.50 for a falafel sandwich?? Holy tahini sauce! My only complaint is that the falafel I ordered was thrown together in less than 30 seconds and fell apart almost immediately upon unwrapping. I guess when you are trying to herd the amount of traffic Mamoun's generates through the door a little carelessness is bound to happen.
