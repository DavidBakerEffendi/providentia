i ended up ordering hot roast pork sandwich instead of a cheesesteak the pork is worthless very fatty, no flavor at all i dont think they season it right very bland but the fat really pissed me off tried asking for a replacement but they refused probably wont go back by the way my husband didnt like his cheesesteak either, says it was shit guess if your drunk at 3 in the morning this is the place to go its 24 hours
