-galangal lavender soda was excellent -fish dish was best entree -toby's estate coffee based macchiato was amazing -great atmosphere (ie pressed tin wall, refurbished wood bar counter, record player) -van leuwen palm sugar was best ice cream flavor -banana cream pie was best dessert -service was excellent (didn't have reservation, table didn't open up so sat at bar, ultimately got coffees and ice cream comped because of difficulty getting a table)
