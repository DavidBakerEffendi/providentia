I read a few good things about Sanford so I decided to go with my boyfriend after work as we both work around the area, only recently though. I've been going to various restaurants around the area as there are so many!! Anyways, he had to park the car because everyone knows how tough the parking situation is in Astoria! I went in and asked for a table and was immediately told that she couldn't seat me without the other person in my party present. I've actually never encountered this. I told the door attendant that he is parking the car and should be in shortly and 2 tables opened up at that time however I was told again that she cant seat me without the other person present. So I just left. Went somewhere else instead. I don't think I would try going back there again. Not for me. I think if the service starts out that way then I wont be inclined to relax and enjoy.
