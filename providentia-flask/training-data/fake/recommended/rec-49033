I've Â pass this place almost 100 times never thinking to stop in for a quick slice. But I finally did and let me tell you I'm very happy I did. This is a great pit stop after a long drive. The inside is clean, the staff was friendly, and the pizza was very good. They had a large selection of specialty slices. I will most definitely be coming back.
