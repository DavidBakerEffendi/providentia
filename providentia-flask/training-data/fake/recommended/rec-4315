HOLY, HOLY FRACKING HOT DOG! Can I give this place 10stars!?!?! I was in Philly for a couple days and this place is one of the best finds in a long time! You can't go wrong with any of their dogs. ***TIP***Get the french fries with your dog. They are cut and soaked by Underdogs--home made! Who does that? Underdogs does! It's a very time consuming process that a majority of places won't do, but this place is about quality. The owner is so passionate about what he serves. I love this joint! It makes me want to give up sunny Cali for Philly just so I can go to Underdogs on a regular basis. Well done Underdogs! Well done!
