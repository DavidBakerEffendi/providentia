I had my meal to go and even after taking it back to my house the biscuit was still fluffy and dense! Amazing food, truly. Even though Brooklyn has some phenomenal restaurants this small little (well designed) shop easily competes with the big names in the area. I had the ruby, which was awesome.....but the best item on the menu is the green fried tomatoes. My family is from south Carolina and Savannah and the green friend tomatoes are equally as good, if not better, than anything I've had in the south.
