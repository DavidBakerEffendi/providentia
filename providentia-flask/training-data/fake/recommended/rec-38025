I work nearby and frequent Salute for lunch often. I love the shrimp pinchiori and the cheesy garlic bread is to die for. Salute has awesome happy hour and their espresso martini's are delicious. I wish their dinner menu listed the shrimp pinchiori rather than the lobster pinchiori (in excess of $30) - it would make me visit more often. Lunch is definitely the way to go to experience Salute if you're on a budget. My work has events quite often here and the staff are always very accomodating to us in every way.
