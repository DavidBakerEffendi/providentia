I went on a Saturday night and brought a bottle of alcohol. This restaurant is known for its amuses-bouches, so we were serenaded with treats throughout our meal. For appetizer, I ordered the blue crab mac & cheese (it was actually made with orzo). This ended up being a highlight of the meal -- not too cheesy, sweet from the crab, and good texture. For entree, I ordered a mushroom medley (vegetarian). It included a small pot pie. Many of the ingredients are local, including from Clark Park Farmer's Market. This dish was not as tasty as the blue crab mac & cheese. A diner next to us ordered the scallops, which may have been delicious, but looked like a very small portion (2 scallops) for an entree. For dessert, I shared the chocolate plate with my dining companion. It was very substantial for 2 to share. There were about 5 varieties of chocolate, along with vanilla and chocolate ice cream. What I enjoyed more was the French press coffee -- very smooth. I would return to this restaurant. I think it has 4 star potential. I hear that their brunch is good.
