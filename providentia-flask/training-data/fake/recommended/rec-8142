Cute seafood restaurant, off the beaten track.  Tiny place, BYOB, feels very homey.  Good place for a date (with some caveats). Pluses:   Really great food, cooked right in front of you in a tiny open kitchen.  I liked that there was a limited menu, based on what seafood was available.  The cook was very nice (I think he might be the owner?) and obviously cared about serving his customers well.  The place has a neighborhood feel, very cute. Minuses:  I was here for Valentine's day, and the service was slow (2 hours for entree. No joke).  But we didn't have reservations, and it was Valentine's day-- plus, the cook was very apologetic.  So I wanted to give this place a second chance. The second time around, on an ordinary weekday night, the service was much better.  Still, this is not a place to go to if you're in a hurry, or if you're with someone who's picky about fast and attentive service.  It's a very small space, so it can also get crowded. If I came back here, I would come early on a weekday night to avoid the crowds, I would leave a lot of time, and I would bring a bottle of wine (it's BYOB).   The tuna burger was fantastic. All in all, it's a good date place, especially if you enjoy wine, seafood, and leisurely conversation.
