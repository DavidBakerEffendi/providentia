We had dinner at Rat's last night for our daughter's 16th birthday (her choice of restaurants). First of all, we had an AMAZING time. We've been to Rat's several times over the years, but the service we received last night really made it even better. Our server, Jeff, was outstanding. If anyone goes there, please ask for him. He was very patient with us (we ask a lot of questions) and described the appetizers, meals and desserts perfectly. It is definitely worth getting there at least an hour or so early so that you have plenty of time to walk through the Grounds for Sculpture (we only had about 20 minutes, and wished we had more time). From the Â moment we arrived walking through the man-made mist that set the ambiance (very magical!), to the decor of the restaurant, to the lovely grounds, to the interesting menu...the experience was terrific. Wonderful!
