MMMMMM.. love this place!  Food is excellent - I love the pastas and pretty much all of the appetizers (highlights are the dips and the mussels).  Wine selection is great and the waitstaff is extremely helpful in this department when you ask.  I prefer to sit downstairs, since it's a little quieter, but both floors do get pretty busy (as I would expect) on Friday/Saturday nights.  I've never made reservations and always gotten a table in a pretty decent timeframe, but they might be a good idea depending on the night.   Overall - great place for surprisingly affordable (for the neighborhood at least) and satisfying meal.
