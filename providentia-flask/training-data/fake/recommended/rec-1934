Mood Cafe is a lassie and chat based cafe, it's a unique place to chill with friends. In the summer the outdoor seating is great, and fits perfect with the refreshing lassies. Unfortunately the indoor seating is subpar. As far as the food, I've never been disappointed. With all the options, selections, and combinations, along with the fact that you get a little extra lasssie to share with your friends, you can't go wrong with mood cafe! I recommend a rose-honey lassie. There are little sweet chewy pieces at the bottom, and the rose flavor works amazing with yogurt! I would like to visit in the colder months, but I doubt I will be as inclined to go with the indoor seating. If they moved the freezer (space is tight), acquired comfortable/fancy chairs, and put on some fitting music, I might change my mind!
