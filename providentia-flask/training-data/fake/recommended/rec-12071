I had high hopes for Uncle Tony's as it is close to home.  Unfortunately the food did not live up to our expectations. The large pizza was nearly tasteless. It was light on the cheese, we could not taste the red sauce at all and the crust was beyond tough. I don't understand the purpose of all the corn meal on the bottom of the pizza.  It certainly doesn't add to the taste.   The lettuce in the Greek salad was wet, the sliced black olives were canned, and the roasted peppers tasted like they came from a jar.  Not good when other takeouts in the area are using fresh ingredients.   Disappointing...we won't be returning.
