I randomly stopped after craving some good Italian and noting the other yelp reviews. I give the food 5 stars but the service 2 stars. As I decided grab a solo meal I sat at the bar for dinner. The bartender made a great suggestion on the red but failed to mention it was 3x the cost of the other reds listed by the glass also went on complaining about not understanding the big deal about people and reds (among other things). The bartender seemed to have a chip on their shoulder and was somewhere between arrogant and rude. The rest of the waitstaff was very pleasant and passed on a delicious soup tasting, compliments of the chef. It could have been an off night but for the money spent I'd prefer better service.
