If you come here when it's not busy, sit at the bar and get some 5 star service from Mark =) Came here with my boo for late oyster dining and drinks and it wasn't packed at all which made me skeptical on how the experience was going to go.   (Review is based only on bar service and raw bar eats) Super knowledgeable and friendly bartender gave us suggestions and his faves from their oyster menu.  I'm an IPA lover and he also gave me beer suggestions as well.  Victory Seasonal is excellent! Also gave us his top faves from the regular dinner menu, which we will definitely try next time! I like the way that they serve the oysters by providing a slip of paper with the order the oysters are in - Always served clockwise from top to bottom of the list. My faves of the night were the Hollywoods and Shoregasms (YEP THAT'S WHAT I SAID!) Next time we're going to try the crab cakes that weresuggested, and also to come back on a Monday for buck oysters! p.s. Mark if you're reading this, thanks for the fantasy football tips too!!! see ya soon!
