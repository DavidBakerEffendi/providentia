The best beer selection in town (along with Monk's) and the New Orleans menu is a good one. We ordered way too much food, just to see. Cheddar cheese fries with roast beef dirt? - YUM! Only 5 bucks and worth every penny! Fried green tomatoes with spicy remoulade and grilled shrimp. Very good although the shrimp were of the tiny variety, but ok for an appetizer. Again reasonably priced. Roast beef po' boy - terrific, especially with the bread brought in from N O. Gumbo - a little muddy tasting - the sausage was mushy. Not my favorite and didn't finish the cup although I took it home to give another try. Did not try any desserts because we were so full. Will do that next time. They made me fresh lemonade that was outstanding. $1.50 for 2 pints. That alone gets them an extra star. Popcorn with bacon grease? Sounds gross but was so good that I'll be picking up a bag to sneak into the movies. Good juke box but was rather loud. We had to shout across the table to talk and said "what?" all the time. Do yourself a favor and check it out. A welcome addition to the Old City Â restaurant scene. Very reasonable prices, friendly service (although our server kept calling us "guys" which is a pet peeve) and great beer/food = a hit.
