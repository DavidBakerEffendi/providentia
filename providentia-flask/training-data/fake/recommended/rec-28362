"Po-ta-toes. Mash 'em, boil 'em, put 'em in a stew. Po-ta-toes. PO-TA-TOES." Or, fry 'em, salt 'em, put 'em in a cone. PO-TA-TOES. Has anyone else besides me seen Creature Comforts USA? No? Anyway. I had Pommes Frites for the first time in a long time earlier this week. I LOVE me some Pommes Frites. These fries are the perfect freezing cold winter snack. They are crispy on the outside but soft on the inside (and fucking hot, Jesus Christ, so eat them slowly). They seem to be bottomless, so it makes no difference if you eat them alone or share them with a friend. (Or like ten friends, the biggest size is BIG.) And oh... the sauces. The sauces. My personal favorites are the rosemary garlic mayo, the parmesan peppercorn, and the dill lemon mayo. I've never had poutine, but when I try it, it will be at Pommes Frites. I trust them with potatoes and chicken fat. The only complaint I have is that it can get VERY crowded. So the best time to go is late afternoon/early evening, between meals. You can actually get a seat at those times. Actually, wait- forget I said that. Now you'll all go at those times and I'LL never be able to get a seat. Actually, along that line, there is no Pommes Frites at all. I, uh, made it up. Nothing to see here.
