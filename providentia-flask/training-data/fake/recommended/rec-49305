It seems pretty clean "Ben" did not read my review nor understand what the issue that I have with the host who; ignored me, sat a party that arrived after I did before me and then mocked me for requesting that two tables that had been pushed together to make a table for 4 be separated so that two waiting parties of two could be seated.  I suppose I should have expected this from a manager who leaves his restaurant to "run errands" during the busiest part of the day.  It's a pity Atticus does not want my business but two new places opened up on that strip so I'll be OK.
