Yup, this is the real deal.  Dinosaur bbq in walking distance from where I lay my pulled pork-brisket-rotisserie chicken-baked beans-spicy cole slaw, dont forget the motherfuckin coleslaw, stuffed stomach.  You may wait a little bit for a table but by the time you sit down your food is practically waiting for you.  Stuff your face and you won't break the bank.  Mother fucking shit.  Great place, great memories, good drinks, good people.  I probably wont make it through another year on this planet now that dino is in the hood, but fuck it, there are worse ways to go.
