We visited NIXS on a Tuesday evening and the place was relatively busy for that time and day.  We had a wonderful server, Lauren, who was knowledgeable and friendly.  We got a little bit of everything.  Tater Tots, Candied Bacon Deviled Eggs, Short Rib Tacos, Truffle Oil French Fries, Salmon, Sword Fish, Candied Pork Belly, and a few Oysters and Clams from the raw bar.  Everything was good. The Salmon came with Jasmine rice that was a bit under seasoned.  We told our waitress and the manager brought us over a complimentary order of Zeppolles which were great and much appreciated!  NIXS was good - nothing extraordinary though.
