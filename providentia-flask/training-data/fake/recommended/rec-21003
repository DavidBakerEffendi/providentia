Great place in dt Burlington. Loved all the local food options and local brews. We just stopped in for a midday meal- we shared a BLT and the soup/salad combo with the Vermont Cheddar ale. We also had the local cider and rootbeer. Everything was delicious and good sized portions. Staff was very nice and attentive and just really enjoyed the atmosphere- can see why it was so busy at 3pm.
