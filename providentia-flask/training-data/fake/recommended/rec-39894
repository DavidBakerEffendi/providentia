I decided to check out Cafe Orlin because of 3 major components: a.option of beer or tea b.free WiFi c. a hummus recommendation It was 6pm and I was looking for somewhere, aside from my apartment where I can't accomplish any work, to get a paper written. I hadn't decided if I wanted tea or a beer and conveniently they offered both, along with a full bar. I was slightly disappointed that there was no draught beer, as a nice set of taps is the way to this lady's heart. To even my own surprise I ended up with one of their few wines by the glass. The hummus that was recommended to me... for lack of a better word, LSKHDGLKHSD!! it was our of this world. though I thought a little pricey for the amount you get, but I wasn't complaining. It's a cute, dimly candle lit joint, I had passed by before but never gone in. Open all night, friendly staff. Only down side is that most of the tables were too small to fit my laptop and glass of wine at the same time. Once 6.30pm rolls around, the place is packed, but I'm convinced worth the wait. Go solo, take a date, or take a couple friends.
