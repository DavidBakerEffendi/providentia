Oh, Choo Choo. How we love you. Living down the street, most of our takeout meals come from this small place on the corner of Chinatown. And they have never let us down. I've never eaten in the actual restaurant, but the takeout has always been ready in 10 minutes or less. We usually get the Tom Yum soup, which is one of the few dishes with strong Thai flavors and just the right amount of spice. Sometimes I wish that they had a smaller portion, as the current menu option is too big for an appetizer or afternoon snack. Any of the rice/noodle dishes with BBQ pork, lemongrass chicken, or minced shrimp are fantastic. Not a huge fan of the spring rolls, but if you get any of the combo dishes you won't be disappointed. We've gotten the Pad Thai a couple of times, but the flavor/texture is never quite as good as it is at other Thai places in the city. The only other reason for not 5 stars is that the chicken/pork can sometimes be a little on the fattier side. A mouthful of fat overwhelms spices/flavors every time.
