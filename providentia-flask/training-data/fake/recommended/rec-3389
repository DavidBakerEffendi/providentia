I come here often and I always get the same thing. I order the Billie Holiday drink, which Chivon makes perfectly and the Fried CHICKEN. How can you come here and not order at least one piece of fried chicken?! Yes, yes I know they make other things here like grits but the chicken is a must have. It's seasoned to perfection and crispy. I have tried fried chicken from many places but Peaches makes the best.
