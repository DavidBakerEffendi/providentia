Holy Mackerel! This place was amazing! Hubby and I went on a date to this place and we could not have been more pleased. The atmosphere was fabulous and the service stellar...and the food was to die for! I love me some small plates and that is what this place specializes in! I had the shrimp cocktail, crab cakes (some of the best ever), mini fish tacos, calamari and had a yummy captain crunch infused drink for dessert (wha wha WHA???!!)...the drinks were also super amazing..I had something with basil in it which I loved but I cannot remember the name. They also had a great track list of kick ass music playing too. Overall I was super impressed and I will be back many times.
