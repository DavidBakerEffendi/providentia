Well I have to agree with most of the reviews I have read about Brooklyn crab. I just wish I read the reviews before my wife and I ate there. We are food people and if we spend over $100.00 for dinner we don't mind as long as after we leave the restaurant we don't have to go out and eat again because we are still hungry.
