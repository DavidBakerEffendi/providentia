One word about this place....WOW, just WOW. This is my second time coming to Bouley and the experience was awesomeness. Came to see what was the food trend, my mom and i went for the $55 tasting of menu. Everything was great, the servers were super knowledgeable about the menu. The salmon blini was by far my favorite dish, all the flavors went well with each other. The wine selection was superb also. I think i have said enough it looks like all the people that wrote a review before me thinks its an experience to try.
