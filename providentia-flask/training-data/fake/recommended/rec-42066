My best friend recently moved to Brooklyn and has been raving about this restaurant. I was finally able to come visit him this past week for NYE and begged him to take me there. I like the vibe of the restaurant and the food, but the service was HORRIBLE!! I'm convinced that our waitress, Cynthia, just started working at the restaurant that afternoon and had never been a server before. When she brought our menus, a friend and I had questions about some of the dishes. She seemed very uninterested in explaining items to us. WE had to ask to order appetizers and WE had to ask to order our main entrees. There are complimentary banana chips that every table gets and we had to ask her to bring those out. There was a long delay for our main entrees, which can't be blamed on her. But i do fault her for lack of communication. She would walk past our table and not even make eye contact. There was another table near us and we repeatedly saw her walk to them to and ask if they needed anything. She NEVER asked my table if we were ok. When we finally got her attention and asked about our food, she claimed that because we had such a large table our food was delayed. We only had 5 people!! Again, the food was fine but the service was terrible. I would go to this restaurant again but i will run for the hills if Cynthia comes anywhere near my table.
