Solid sports bar. Great wings, decent drink prices. We had a group of 6 of us and the server kept the pitchers coming. We were there on trivia night, we didn't play but it seemed like everyone was having fun. The dude doing trivia was really boring though. He wasn't really selling the "this is a fun activity" thing too well. Just asked questions in a monotone manner. People seemed to enjoy themselves so I guess that's cool.
