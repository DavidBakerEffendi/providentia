I had such great expectations for this place. Let me start by saying that our appetizer (tuna tartare) was great and our entrees were just barely okay. Not really worth mentioning. And the main reason for the 2 stars.. our server(using the term very loosely) Edward. He was just cold. He never once asked us if we liked our meal and only would attend to us if we staredddd him down. I waited quite a while without wine. He only came to ask if I was finished w my $28 dinner. Yeah, thanks 25 minutes later I should be shouldn't I. We spent $140 dollars on dinner and I wish I had spent my money at Giotto or my new fave Scalla De Nonna. Â As a regular at Egan and Sons Montclair n West Orange location, it surprised me to know that you can get better, more attentive service there. It is worth mentioning that the host, the first server to great us, and the bus staff where very friendly. Even the bus boy asked how we were enjoying our meal a few minutes after we got it. I was waiting to tell Edward that we didn't like two of our side dishes but when he eventual graced us with his presence, he didn't even ask. Will never return.
