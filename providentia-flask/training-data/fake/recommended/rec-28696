Places like this is a dime a dozen out in the West Coast. My new mission to search out truly healthy food in NYC! If my job allows me the time to get out of Jersey! Even in the greatest city in the world, its pretty difficult to find a place to eat TRULY healthy. If you are into eating CLEAN, this is the place. I love their quinoa bowls and all the sides they have are great. Only thing is it is extremely expensive. Even for NYC standards!
