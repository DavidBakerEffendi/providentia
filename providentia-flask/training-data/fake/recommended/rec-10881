I chose to have my birthday party at Brooklyn Crab this year and could not have been more impressed.  The staff, led by the manager, James, bent over backwards to make sure that everyone was comfortable and having a great time.  I think they came around to ask me 5-10x if we needed anything throughout the course of the event, not to mention serving up some great seafood and beer.  They also didn't mind when we hung a giant pinata and proceeded to destroy it midway through the party.  Overall, it was wonderful, and I would highly recommend for anyone looking to do an out of the box get together for their next event.
