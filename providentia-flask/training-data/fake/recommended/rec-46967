For Korean food in Philly this is probably one of the better places to go to. The stone pot bibimbap seems to be everyone's favorite, though I was not a particular fan. Traditionally, the egg is given to you raw so that it cooks in the hot pot, but here they normally cook it for you already. The hot sauce was also watered down with too much of the sesame oil mixed it with it. I got the galbi, and it didn't taste too great. However, I shouldn't have expected so much from this place since it's small mom and pop korean food restaurant. The kimchi korean pajeon (pancake) was great! For someone who has never had korean food or not that experienced with it, this is definitely a better place to go than most places in Philly. Also, the menu has a wide variety for people who are nervous about trying. It's tiny, and not really great for crowds.
