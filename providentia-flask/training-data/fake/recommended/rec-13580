Finally made it after 4 near break up fights with my boyfriend who was outraged by and refused to stick around for the 1 hour to hour and a half wait times. We went on a Friday afternoon hoping for a shorter wait-- no chance. 45 minutes. He (thankfully) took a deep breath and agreed to wait....and boy oh boy was it worth it. I ordered the blueberry pancakes and he had the cuban sandwich. The blueberry pancakes are the best I have had and I'm not much of a pancake lover. Luscious, slightly sweet, slightly tangy blueberries infused and covering a stack of three fluffy pancakes, served with a side of maple butter. OH MY GOSH! First bite and you can hear the hymn of angels singing in your head, "Yaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!" Cuban was tasty with homemade slaw and potato chips. If it wasn't for the wait, I'd give Clinton Street Baking Co. 5 stars.
