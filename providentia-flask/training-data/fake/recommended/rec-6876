Delicious cheap Thai food!! Inside is a little bit loud but you will see the kitchen with all the flames -pretty impressive. The outside area is quite and really romantic. I had dinner with a friend at 9:30pm: two big plates of fried rice with shrimp and vegetables, and noodles. Chai teas, and we spent $21! I will definitely go back.
