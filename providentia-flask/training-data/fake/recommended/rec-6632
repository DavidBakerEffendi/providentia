I don't understand this place. Brunch only until 4pm? Why can't I order lunch at 3:15pm? Why are only vegetarian entrees available on the brunch menu? Why wouldn't you offer at least a few alternatives to eggs and waffles like sandwiches and salads on said brunch menu? And why do you feel the need to gob pesto-mayo on the veggie burger? Did you even realize that you should be using a veggie mayo if catering to vegetarian clientele? Way to disappoint, Penelope. I won't be making the mistake of visiting you for brunch again. However, I did enjoy the fries.
