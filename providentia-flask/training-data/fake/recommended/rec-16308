Had the mixed berries parfait $7.50 plus one scoop of green tea ice cream $2. It's on the pricier side but I did enjoy my crepe. I have a sweet tooth so I thought the savory options were quite odd. Berries were pretty fresh but there weren't a lot of them. The ice cream was really good, unlike the green tea icecream from Haagen Daz, it wasn't overly sweet and had that bitter matcha taste to it. Place is kinda tiny, but it's whatever since you could eat it on your way shopping in soho :)
