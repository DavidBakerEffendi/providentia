Their menu is solid (something for almost everyone), and their french fries are yummy... Carafes of wine are well priced (and larger than your avg carafe). This place has become a bit over crowded, but it's still good for brunch and dinner. Â  I kind of have to wonder, id the village is jt's "least favorite" part of town, where is the favorite part of town... Wait, let me guess.. meatpacking...
