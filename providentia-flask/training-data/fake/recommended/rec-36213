Came here without a reservation on a Saturday night so we ended up waiting for a bar table instead of the dining room.  It was pretty chaotic and predatory around the bar so if you don't feel like being pushy you won't be successful.  But again, it was Saturday so this was all expected.  Once we finally sat at the bar it took FOREVER for the bartenders to ask for our drink order.  They were very cavalier and clearly didn't give two shits.  This attitude continued for the next 2 hours where we had to request water, bread, our dishes cleared, silverware, more wine, coffee, the check... 3 stars because the food was delicious! I highly recommend the braised short ribs on Saturdays.  The beet salad was also great.  Not a good wine by the glass selection surprisingly.   I would probably come back to try other things on the menu but not have expectations of attentive service.  I guess I thought that at this price point their bartenders would be, I don't know, good at their job? Bottom line I do think it's worth checking out for dinner.  Oh I came here for brunch once too and sat in the dining room.  My waffles kinda tasted like Eggos but other things looked delicious.  Go but avoid the waffles......
