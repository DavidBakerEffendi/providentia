I am obsessed with everything about Northern Spy Food Co from the people who work there, to their concept, to their delicious vittles. I have been here twice and recommend it to those visiting the city constantly. I really want to try their Sunday Supper sometime, but the two dinners I have had there have been great. Must visit.
