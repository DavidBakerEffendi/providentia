The boyfriend and I have come here a couple times, and the service here is so great that the owner remembered us just from our first visit!  This place has a seasonal menu, so they only serve certain dishes when the ingredients are in season.  The owner also mentioned the menu rotates out every couple months, so that's worth coming back for, too! First time we were here, we ordered the pulled pork sliders, a pizza, the scallops, and the bacon brownie.  EVERYTHING was absolutely delicious!  Personally I thought the scallop dish needed another side to go with it to justify the cost, but the boyfriend was happy.  The second time we visited, we ordered the B4 burger and the pork chop.  The burger is definitely a reason to come visit this place--the meat was perfection.  They have their own special sauce that is worth coming back for.  We had blackberry mojitos too, which were on point. We're definitely coming back.  It's a great go-to place when you're not sure where else to go.  The restaurant is actually pretty big too, so bring everyone!
