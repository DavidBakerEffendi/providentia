I've yet to find a better burger than the Bronte - anywhere. I used to live in NY, and now live in LA which has more rivalries from burgers than it does gangs.  Amongst both cities (and every international city I've been to), I've never experienced a better burger than the Bronte.  Why?  Let's break it down: -The meat is just so juicy and tender.  My mother brought me up ordering my burger's well-done, but if you order anything above medium, you're doing this burger a disservice. -The juice and all else that flows from the meat just happily gets sopped up by the delicious (dare I say) artisan style bun.  One of the most interesting things about this burger is it's shape - it's more like a sandwich than a burger. Long, not round.  And the bread just gives it that soft, but crispy texture to really send this thing over the top. -The accompanying mesculin salad (with an awesome, thick vinaigrette, which is great to dip your bun in if you have any left over from the burger) - the same mesculin leaves (not iceberg, not crappy strips of lettuce) are in the burger as well as fresh cut tomatoes.  Not an ingredient is wasted or of low-quality -The sweet chili sauce. This is what makes it. It's got the slightest kick, but is just full of a tangy sweet sauce that compliments everything so perfectly. I've yet to taste a sauce like this that can even be considered competition. -You can totally get the burger without the cheese, but the cheese just makes it ever so special. I've been coming to this place for years, and it's never been too crowded. Love to bring people here, because it's such a chill environment in a usually busy and touristy part of town.  Fun fact, (as it's an Australian owned, and operated establishment), Nolita (north of Little Italy) has the highest concentration of Australians in Manhattan. I will easily take down this review when my opinion changes, but as of now - this is honestly the best burger I have ever had in my life.  It needs to be consumed.
