First off, I recommend you make a reservation for FDR. Even on a weekday, this place fills up fast. The food was excellent, but on the other hand, we had an extremely uncomfortable outdoor dining experience that prevented us from fully enjoying the meal. If you do end up sitting outside, wear bug spray. We arrived around 7pm and were informed that a table inside wouldn't be available until 8:45pm. Outside was sweltering hot and humid, but we decided to tough it out anyways. Heat is one thing, but mosquitos are another. The first half an hour was fine, but as the sun began to set, the mosquitos came out with a vengeance and by the end of the meal, we had twenty bug bites between us. The service might have just seemed slow since we were literally itching to leave soon after we got the bread. Our server was earnest and happy to answer our questions. The food was five-star delicious. I had the zucchini soup for starters - my only caveat is that the "zucchini" soup tasted suspiciously like pea soup. Luckily I love pea soup, and the guacamole was a refreshing touch. For entr√©es, I had the gnocchi appetizer. It was so good. So good. The gnocchi was tender and pillowy, the corn and crab sweet and summery. Literally the perfect summer dish. The duck was also wonderful, with rich flavor, tender meat, and crispy skin. I look forward to coming here again, next time with a reservation so we can escape the heat and the bugs.
