This place fills up on the weekends but the food is so delicious and reasonably priced. Everything on the menu is good. Don't just get pancakes or french toast, it'll be a missed opportunity to have some real good food. Their coffee is good too (my normal routine is to put my name on the wait list and then go down to the espresso bar on 9th st for iced coffee - wait is long). Also, I'd recommend coming here for dinner, too, as the food is just as amazing and very good prices. Lots of healthy options, too.
