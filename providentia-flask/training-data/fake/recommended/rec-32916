Gorgeous layout with well-crafted food.  My party of 2 got a table without reservations on a Sunday night (in the middle of Center City Restaurant Week). Per previous reviewers, the staff did indeed seem quite jittery.  Based on interactions we witnessed, my guess is that the chef is a bit "Hell's Kitchen"-esque.  We attempted to place our order for drinks and appetizers, but were informed that the chef prefers all the food orders to be placed together and the waitress would give us a few minutes to make our entree decisions.  I completely understand wanting to time our food appropriately, but why would the waitress not simply wait to put in the order for the appetizer when we were ready to order?   The food was very delicious and beautifully served in over-priced small servings.   Ultimately, we will not be back, even for the spicy chocolate dessert ravioli.  The nervous atmosphere made it too much of an effort to enjoy our date night and the food, although delicious, did not justify the price or the atmosphere.
