A large group of us were there and we were seated upstairs in a very quiet area - not too many were there since it was a weekday. I cant speak for what everyone else ate but I had the Bacon Wrapped Monkfish. To start we had a whole bunch of appetizers - I tried the Calamari and the Tempura Shrimp. Â Both were ok... Calamari was a bit chewy and the Tempura Shrimp was just decent. As for the Monkfish I had, it was actually pretty good. I liked that they didn't drench it in some sauce or over spice in anyway. It was just a well cooked monkfish wrapped in bacon that was cooked just right. As for the garnishing, it was artichokes and some other vegies with a creamy sauce. I was a bit disappointed that they didnt have the Halibut Confit on the menu like I saw on the website but oh well - Monkfish wasnt bad. Overall, I would say this place is worth an initial visit but a second visit? - Maaaybe...
