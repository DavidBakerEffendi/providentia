on 2nd thought.....our 2nd time was not so amazing. sitting downstairs was cozy and our waiter was very nice... but the food didnt measure up. and the hostess was very rude. the sangria tastes like cough syrup. the octopus gave us food poisoning. We were both sick all night. the hanger steak.....omg, how badly can you mess up an order?! I ordered medium rare....it was RARE like steak tartare , so I asked to make it med rare, it came out burnt, like I couldn't chew it , it was terrible. My boyfriends was ok, the lamb chop special, but our waiter didnt tell us the price, it was outrageous. so thanks for that. now I would say to only come here for the wine, calamari, sheeps milk dumplings and only if you sit downstairs. make reservations, apparently they hold the good seats for reservations, walk ins get stuck with these crappy seats that seem to be in the waiters way. We've come a 3rd time now, (only bc Vai was closed ) still sucks, my guests did not like the food either. What is up with the hostess'es here ?? Their so rude always! And this time our waiter was a jerk, he rushed us, and obviously pushed us to spend a lot of money. He was obviously annoyed when we didn't want a second drink. With so many restaurants in manhattan, and even the UWS, we most likely will not come back here anymore. Sucks, I wanted to like this place......
