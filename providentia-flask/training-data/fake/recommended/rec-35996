What Momofuku caters for in great food, decent cocktails and a buzzy atmosphere it sadly lacks in good hospitality. I took my boyfriend there as a surprise for his birthday as I heard and read such great things. However, the hostess, Jennifer,was too abrupt and she was more interested in cramming as many people as possible at the bar. We practically had to order within 5 mins of sitting down and then blatantly checked her watch signally us that our time was up. Â  Good food. Poor hostess skills.
