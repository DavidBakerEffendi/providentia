Pure trash served up with some crushed peanuts and surly attitudes.  Our server appeared to be genuinely upset that we came in for lunch and interrupted her spirited sitting-on-her-tuchus session.  Literally, no words were spoken: she motioned for us to go to a table, sat us down, then wordlessly came back to get our order.  I must be really awesomely psychic because I managed to know what she wanted by her just standing at the side of my table while tapping her notepad with a pen til we spoke. But hey why stop there? I went ahead and ordered pad thai which tasted like the bottom of a well traveled yeti's foot, delicately sprinkled over noodles. If you enjoy awkward silences and stunningly flavorless food, I highly recommend penang.
