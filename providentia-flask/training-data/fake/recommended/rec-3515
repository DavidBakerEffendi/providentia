Good lunch hour for quick semi special lunch in the FiDi. The crepes are really well made and it's quite hard to resist getting the savory AND sweet versions on same visit. Have sampled nearly all of them and my best bets are the chicken asparagus and prosciutto di parma ones for the savory, nutella banana (I mean come on) and crepes suzette for the sweet kind. Not doling out 4 stars as it's just a pain to get a seat here. The establishment is connected to another Nordic restaurant and me thinks it's the same owner. Last time I went they actually allowed Crepe fiends to cross-over for some seating, perhaps they should make this the norm especially during daytime.
