We went here on a weeknight and the wait was a 45 minutes, luckily for us it only turned out to only be a 25 minute wait. It went down like this: our waiter was friendly, I ordered the white sangria, truffle fries and turkey burger...Y-U-M! Everything was delicious! Their sauces, especially the spicy ones were the icing on the proverbial cake. They made the meal. There was quite a saga going on in the restaurant while we were there- a mouse had snuck through the front door, was running around Â and scared some people. It was creepy but we understood management was doing all they could, the rodent never made it near the kitchen area, they closed the area where the critter was. I didn't like that management only addressed the issue with certain tables which I didn't think was fair to the rest of us who were cognizant of the issue. I understand not wanting to insight panic but still....
