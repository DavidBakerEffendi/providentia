I've walked by this place, oh, I don't know, 1000 times in my life, and always deferred to the big checkerboard cheesesteak mecca across the street. But this day was different... specifically because it was a Wednesday, I had to eat lunch in 15 minutes or less, and the line at Jim's was inexplicably out the door. In my haste I remembered that Ishkabibble's "invented" the chicken cheesesteak. And besides, chicken's healthier... right? Especially when you slather it in grease, cheese, fried onions and put it on a big roll. So I walked across the street to find the place busy, but in a good way. I ordered the house special, the aformentioned chicken-cheesesteak-with, and the "Gremlin" drink they also claim to their own fame. All told, it was a great decision. The chicken was surprisingly tasty and not dry - I like that they used bigger chunks than the typical chicken cheesesteak, where the meat is shredded up like a regular cheesesteak. Good adaptation to adjust for the type of meat. The cheese was properly melted-in, and the roll had all the necessary substance. The Gremlin was quite refreshing - who know Grape Juice & Lemonade was a good combination?! The place had a good vibe too - on both sides of the counter. I couldn't ask for more out of the place. I'll be back!
