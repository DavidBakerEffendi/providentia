OK I don't eat meat so I am for sure not the best person to review, but having said that I enjoyed some of the sides. My carnivorous companions however were not impressed and made jokes about shooting a pig with a flamethrower or dropping napalm on a cow... I got the impression that they considered the meat overcooked. I guess it is a matter of taste.
