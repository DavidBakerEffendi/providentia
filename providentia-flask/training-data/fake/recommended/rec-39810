Wow, went here this weekend for a Sunday bunch after a hardy party weekend and it absolutely hit the spot.  Great coffee, the guacamole is ridiculously flavorfully delicious, I got the charrasco, it was great, and tried all my friends meals, which pretty much covered the menu, and everything was good.  Plus a great atmosphere.  Left with belly full and a smile on my face.
