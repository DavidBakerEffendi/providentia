I've been coming to Vietnam Restaurant for years, since long before it morphed into a slick upscale eatery. Back in the day, it was just another hole in the wall Vietnamese restaurant. To tell the truth, I kind of miss the hole in the wall place. I really miss the hole in the wall prices. But one thing that has remained constant over the years is the fried spring rolls. They are the best in the world. Seriously, I've been all over the country and I've spent a considerable amount of time in Vietnam and I feel confident that Vietnam Restaurant's spring rolls are the best. Not only that, but the vegetarian rolls are just as good as the meat filled ones. Outside of the spring rolls, the menu can be hit or miss. But who cares? (The writing in Playboy can a little over the top, but I'm not buying the magazine for the articles, now am I?) Just get an order of spring rolls and an order of bun with spring rolls on top and wash it down with a Tiger Beer. Then make a mental note to go running the next day.
