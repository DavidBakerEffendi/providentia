Oh gosh what a mess.  My friend and I went here for Cinco de Mayo yesterday and it was a disaster.  El Camino is a MEXICAN restaurant.  Therefore, it is not unreasonable to think that they should have been adequately prepared to handle the crowd May 5th brings to their establishment.  I don't know, maybe I'm asking too much.  Regardless, the entire staff looked stressed out, and understandably so.  Can't fault them for that.  It was really crowded and (most) people were belligerently drunk. But the food..... oh my goodness, the food was absolutely TERRIBLE.  It has never been that bad there before.  The pico de gallo was under-seasoned and missing any trace of cilantro.  The chips were over-seasoned, but what else is new.  The green salsa tasted like baby food puree.  All things that are typically pre-made, yes?  Yikes.  Our guacamole was underwhelming; it was a paste-like consistency and also (wait for it!) under-seasoned.  Our veggie wings were, I would assume, triple deep fried.  My plate was swimming in wing sauce; my friend's was bone dry.  Seitan jerky if you will.  Neither of us finished even half of our food, and no one on staff noticed. Oh and the drinks.  My friend got a margarita on the rocks with salt; the bartender must have dumped salt into the drink because it tasted like the ocean.  I had a mojito.  It's lime/mint ratio was way off and I took two sips. Not to say I haven't had good meals here, because I have and, normally, I wouldn't base my entire opinion on one (atrocious) experience, but this particular instance was just soooo bad.  Everything failed:  service, atmosphere, food, and drinks.  Really disappointing.
