Had to visit this place after hearing good reviews from several friends of mine. -Overrated. -Overcharged. I tried their pork bun dish and shared three other dishes with friends. Food quality was just alright not impressive at all. I can have much more delicious meals at most of Korean restaurants on 32nd K-town Manhattan or Flushing K-town with half of the price. Considering the price of dishes and the noisy packed atmosphere of this place, I WOULD NOT go back to this place.
