Excellent food and service. It's all about their pasta and I'm not one to typically order pasta (no one makes gnocchi than grandma, except maybe Ulivo).  The only reason we aren't regulars here is the ambience. Beautiful exterior corner building nicely painted in hip but classic color... But it's the inside. It echoes. It's a large space with high ceilings. They need table clothes and big curtains or something to soften it up. I feel like we're in a dining hall when inside. It's lovely food but with their prices I expect ambience to boot.  That's the reason I left off the 4th star. I'd even give it five stars if the prices dropped a dollar or two per dish!
