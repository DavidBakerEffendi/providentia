Ilili- what can I say. I love the tabouli here- I love the warm fluffy pita, I love the warm eggplant appetizer as well as the arnabeet mekle (cauliflower) and I loved my kufta, too. I really love middle eastern/mediterranean food, and I eat it often. I liked that even though this place is upscale and gourmet-ish, my meal still felt very authentic.. I did NOT enjoy the brussel sprouts that were *highly* recommended by my server, it was just a weird dish. I think the problem with it is that it's a hit or miss plate- everyone at my table raved about them. You love them or you hate them as far as I can tell. The downside: The portions are MINISCULE. However, that doesn't take away from the fact that their offerings are delicious and I don't have a single complant whatsoever about the service.
