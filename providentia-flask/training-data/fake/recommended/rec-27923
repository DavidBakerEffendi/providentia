I almost never write reviews but I felt so strongly about Panineria that I had to speak up!The whole experience was a joy. This is the best panini I have had outside of Italy and Mario and all who work there are lovely. I highly recommend going. I had the Paestrum and added arugula. So delicious. Go. Go now. Stop reading. Go eat !
