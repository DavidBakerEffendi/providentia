Although I am Indian and am difficult to please, I really thought this place was going to impress me.  The location in NYC I hear is better as upper saddle river caters more to non-Indian patrons.  CTM was a 2 out of 5.  Pander Sag was boring and the service was under par.  If you really want excellent indian.. Go to mom's or NYC.
