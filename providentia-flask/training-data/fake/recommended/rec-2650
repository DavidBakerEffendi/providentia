I am very disappointed with this place.  I've gone here on a few occasions and the service was not good, they've messed up orders, once they didn't even put my take out order in the computer so we had to wait around, but they've been apologetic for the mistakes.   But my last visit a week and a half ago was the worst.  I called in an order for take out, picked it up and went home.  At that point we realized that one of the wraps was completely wrong, I ordered a Buffalo chicken wrap and was given a BBQ wrap.  I don't like bbq sauce and didn't eat the wrap.  I tried reaching them 3 times (1 call and 2 emails) and haven't gotten a response of any kind AT ALL.  This is horrible customer service, they got my money so that's all they care about.  I will not be going back there ever again.
