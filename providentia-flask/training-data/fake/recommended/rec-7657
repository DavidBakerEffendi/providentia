A dingy place that definitely does not care if they get your business or not. The place need not new customers. Has a faithful following of repeat customers that I see every time I'm in there. My first experience there, the server never actually spoke to me. Came to the table nodded, I ordered, about a minute later my food arrived and he brought me the check. The noodles speak for themselves though. Get the Cambodian noodles for about $5, delicious and the price is next to unbeatable. The place is a little dirty, but it adds to the overall experience. No bells and whistles. You can tell its authentic from the wait staff to the noodles.
