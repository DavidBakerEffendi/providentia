LOVED that they had a sign with directions of how to order a cheesesteak for tourists. My friends and I partook in this Pat's and  Geno's cheesesteak challenge. Between the two, I'd have to say Pat's won it for me.  The meat was seasoned much better and chopped up more (which is how I like it), but the onions were more on the raw side. I left the intersection feeling unsatisfied on this quest to try a real Philly cheesesteak. If you get a chance and are searching for really good cheesesteak, try Jim's Steaks on South St. I enjoyed it MUCH better.
