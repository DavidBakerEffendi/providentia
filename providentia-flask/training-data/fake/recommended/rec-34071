Ladies and gents, we have a winner and it's Do or Dine in Bed-Stuy.  The reviews in the NYTimes and Tasting Table were totally on-point.  This place takes food and service seriously and the vibe is spot-on.  We went last night and the place was packed.  Eating at the bar with the neighborhood folks was a pleasure and the staff/owners were amazing (and cute).  Eggs with baby octopus - amazing.  Chicken with roasted corn - even better.  The AC wasn't super cold, but whatever.  I'm totally supporting this place and you should, too!  Peace out.
