Wasn't the  best Mexican place but wansnt the worst.  1 thing though..  Why isn't there queso fresco or creme on the tostada? If it had that would of been perfect.  The tamales were good.  Sadly my rice was hard and my beans weren't that cooked.  Also I'd say it's a tad over priced.  Other then that the service was good and the atmosphere was nice.  I'd come back but Def try something else.
