Good prices. Veggie burger with chipotle sauce is amazing! The seitan special was really salty- which was unpleasant so ask for no salt! The sweet potato fries are amazing- I didn't really like the table service tonight- I miss the old fashioned way order at the register and then they bring you food- but I guess that way you didn't have to tip so they now make more money
