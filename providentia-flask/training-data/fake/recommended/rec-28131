pros: 1) great food. the chicken sandwich was perfect! and i was told the afton burger was awesome. the fried pickles were pretty good, not as great. the sandwich & burgers dont come with fries or pickles, just fyi 2) great service, very attentive 3) nice vibe in the early evening 4) happy hour....hmm from 5 til 7? i cant remember, too happy of an hour, eh? 5) decent prices cons: 1) gets very packed at night, like seriously. the seating is very close to one another. for the most part, each table is set up like a school cafeteria so its not the most intimate setting 2) the drinks i tried were eh - apple blossom & gin&juice. a little too strong, not enough sweetness for my liking. i like my alcoholic beverages to taste like juice & sneak up on me later! thats the fun of it all! for the most part i liked it. will be going back
