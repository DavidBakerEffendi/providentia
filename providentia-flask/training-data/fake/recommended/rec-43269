Hoagie haven is a legacy in the town of Princeton. It's timeless style is only matched by the creativity of their unique sandwiches. Aside from the creative choices, their traditional hoagies are impeccable and tastefully crafted. Get the buffalo chicken cheese steak, you will not be disappointed! My second favorite would be turkey, lettuce, tomatoes and Mayo. You should also add some buffalo cheese fries to your order! Enjoy (-:
