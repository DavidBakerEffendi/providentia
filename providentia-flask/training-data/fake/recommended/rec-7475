Slurp slurp slurp. That's the only sound you'll hear when you dine here with your buddies. Noodles at it's finest. Try the hand drawn noodles but secretly understand that the shaved noodles offer better texture and mouthfeel to accompany the warm soothing broth and whatever meats suit your fancy. Got the dumplings too and can't say I disliked them. I make this a must-visit each time I'm in Philly. They've expanded the restaurant and you can no longer watch them prepare the noodles but at least seating is no longer an issue.
