Our first visit here was for Valentines day.  I'll start by saying this type of restaurant is not typically one we would seek out.  We have nothing against "fancy" places...it's just not our speed.  But for V-Day we decided to do something different.  That said we felt very comfortable here.  There is a lot of staff, all making sure your visit is perfect.  They seem to have a high tech system of communicating with each other like secret service guys do...ear buds and mini microphones pinned to their lapel...for real.  However silly that sounds, they are successful with it.  The service is outstanding.  But i did wonder if our table was bugged :).  On to the food.  For the holiday they had a price fixed menu.  Everything was standard except you got to choose one of four entrees.  There were 5 courses with an optional wine pairing for each.  All the dishes were absolute exotic works of art.  Beautifully plated with incredible attention to detail.  I've never seen such pretty plates of food.  It's truly a whole different experience.  And everything really did taste as good as it looked.  The portions were perfectly appropriate.  Our appetites were satisfied and there was nothing wasted.  At the end they gave us a valentines gift of chocolates, tea, and a paperwhite bulb.  It was a nice touch!  I would highly recommend this place for a special occasion such as this....although you should be prepared to pay top dollar....it was not cheap.
