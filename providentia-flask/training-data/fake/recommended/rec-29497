Ate here twice during my stay in New Jersey with a friend... Â The place is very popular with the locals. A medium sized establishment where you can dine inside or on the outside deck patios. Many tasty items on their menus and priced reasonably, staff friendly and attentive to your needs, however I would have rated 4 stars but my second outing the waiter failed to bring me my refill as requested, by then I will suffer. Then being forgotten the waiter suddenly remembered and asked if i was still interested in a refill. By then I lost interest and politely said, NO!
