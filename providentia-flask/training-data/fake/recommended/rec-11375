Not just a place to go to see a show. The food here rocks as hard as the music. I don't think there is much to say that hasn't already been said, but the babba ganoush was on special when I was last at JB's. and it was fantastic. We split a bunch of apps, including the Grilled Octopus which was also delicious. You really can't go wrong with the food, beer, and vibe here. Hipsters are in abundance, but there is a pool table. And they can always be scared away by some friendly conversation, rather than mindless competitive rambling about the most obscure Smith's record. Just dont ask for a menu and look like a noob, its on the wall.
