My girlfriend and I stumbled upon this place while walking about the city. We are new to New York and wanted to grab a late-afternoon glass of wine. We immediately fell in love with this place. We each had a delightful Cabernet at happy hour pricing and shared a small cheese plate. The upstairs is a pretty cool artisan cheese shop. Will definitely be back. Â Highly recommend.
