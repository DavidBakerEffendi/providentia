What is wrong with people who gave this place bad reviews? Someone wrote "too flavorful" as a negative rev. Wait what? Since when is flavorful a failing? The dish I thought was delicious, bursting with flavors, an exciting party in my mouth. Mango salad was fresh, with a balance of sweetness and acidity, and of course like the streets of South East Asia- a pungent kick at the end. The strips of grilled chicken that came on top has a macho char, with spices like coriander seed, but then it's so juicy and delicate, perhaps due to having been basted  in a bath of coconut milk. The oyster with mantau was ingenious! Mantau was deep fried gleaming gold, and the sauce wakes you up. Your classic italian oyster dish should be very afraid. Khao soi was ok but not that impressive. That pumpkin soup (forgot the name) was sweet and silky smooth...my mind was quite blown. So perhaps Pig and Khao is not for the faint-tounged. Most definitely not for those who think that it is a Peruvian place. Pig and Khao, perhaps like the chaotic streets of South East Asia, can overwhelm you...the richness of coconut milk everywhere (including the good ole coconut rice) ,the pungent taste of fish sauce, the bird eye chili kick. But with an amazing balancing act by the chef and cooks, these bursts of deliciousness, and an open mind on your end, is a truly decadent experience. Ingenious without losing  the South East Asian authenticity. Thank you for a lovely meal Pig and Khao!
