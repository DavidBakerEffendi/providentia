Three of us went out on a recent Friday evening.  Things started off pretty well as we got a parking spot right across the street on only the second lap around the block.  (Hey, Jay's Bike Shop Owner!  Lighten the hell up and let people use your parking spaces after you close! )   We sat back near the little oyster bar (boney-assed people be warned--those benches are freakin' hard and uncomfortable!) and started with some oysters, which were very fresh, and the cocktail sauce with it was so good that even a cocktail sauce hating guy like myself was using it.  Next we shared an appetizer of fried calamari which was pretty good, if a little on the small side.  I also ordered lobster bisque, but I can't tell you how it was since it was never actually brought to the table. For our entrees, my scallops were a little over-seared on the outside, but still remained tender inside, however the over-searing gave it a burned flavor that really took away from the flavor of the scallops.. The halibut served to my sister-in-law was a little overdone too. It wasn't overdone to make it inedible, but enough to make it less tasty than it could have been.   My sister-in-law is less picky than I am and enjoyed it nevertheless.  My wife's lobster was good and correctly cooked.  The key lime pie for dessert was pretty damned good. The servers seemed a little overwhelmed while we were there, but I got the impression that the place is always busy, so they should either be used to it or they should have more help.  I'm pretty forgiving during rushes, but if this place is as popular as it seems, they ought to have more help.  All that said, we'll probably go back.  The oysters were really good, and we had a good time while we were there, which is pretty much all that really counts in the end. Still, I really wanted that lobster bisque.
