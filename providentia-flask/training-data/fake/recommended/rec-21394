Delilahs at the Reading Terminal use to be my place for years, but because of the declining service and quality of food, I started looking around for another spot, and thank God, Beck's was just opening! Now this is the place that I go to for lunch and tell everyone about!! The shrimp po' boys are so tasty, the jambalaya, the gumbos, bread pudding... everything is great and authentic (husband is from New Orleans). The Â po' boys are filling, but the other dishes could use a little bit more. Usually we split a shrimp po' boy, and then order some jambalaya and then another side dish, then finish it with bread pudding. Also order some root beer from LA., very refreshing!! I love the fact that they have their own counter and seats, it makes it easier to eat here and also watch them make your food. Oh yes, the beignets are only made only certain days, so order them. They are so light and sweet!!
