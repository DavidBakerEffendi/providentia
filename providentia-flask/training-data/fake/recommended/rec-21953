Horrible fake japanese food the chinese need to stick with chinese food . Stop making up phoney japanese dishes . Its an insult to my japanese wife and family we ate there 1 time just to try it horrible they get their fish and food from the chinese market on rte 46 . Horrible the menu isnt even what they actually serve you.
