Absolutely amazing food! Made the 1h15min hike from Harlem to BK totally worth it! One of the best mac n cheese I'e had in my life! Went for brunch... Red velvet waffle and chicken was very yum, and lobster/shrimp grits was divine! No complaints at all about the food. Vibe was cool and laid back. Hostess did take a good 10 minutes to acknowledge my presence when I first arrived, and though I had a reservation, had to wait a little before getting a table. But waitress was great and food was superb!
