Local 44 used to have solid food, if somewhat overpriced for the neighborhood. The various French fry and mac-n-cheese preparations were practically unparalleled, and you always knew that you could find something on the menu that sounded good. In September 2012, Local 44 hired its first executive chef. Based on the results, this appears to have been a move to go a little more upscale and creative with the menu. Instead, it's been a bit of a disaster. Almost every item on the menu has changed since September, as the well-prepared pub food has given way to more conceptual items. Many entrees cater to vegetarians and vegans, which would be fine if it didn't seem to be crowding out the typical pub fare. Worryingly, the menu seems to change almost weekly. I don't think that this is so much a seasonal/fresh ingredients change so much as the executive chef is trying to find the right combination of quirky and accessible. I don't think that he's hit it yet because ironically, that would mean going back to the old menu. As a result of the menu turbulence, I am no longer confident that there will be good food when I go to Local 44. The ambience and the beer selection continue to be fine, but there's no longer a sense of stability in the food. Before the changes, Local 44 was a good option for any given outing in West Philadelphia. However, since the onset of the revolving door menu the only thing that keeps me coming back is the weekly trivia, which is unparalleled in the City of Philadelphia. As the trivia has locked me into Local 44, I hope each week that the owners and the executive chef will return to the original concept of doing normal pub food in a creative, well-executed fashion.
