YUMMY! We were visiting family in NJ and went here with a party of 9 for dinner on a saturday night.  it was PACKED at 7:30 and we didn't sit until about 8-8:15.  But the service once we did have a table was great: quick and on point. let's start with the sangria.  since this place is BYO, they give u the base and you add your own wine.  we got the lemonade one- which is red, by the way- and it was sweet but not overbearing.  very nice. we ordered what seemed like a million tapas, from chicken to beef to seafood.  my favorite was the chicken tapas that was on the bone like a little chicken lollipop! the goat cheese and honey was delicious too. for dinner i ordered the bahama coconut fish with mango salsa.  delicious! not too oily and the mango was fresh and re-freshing.  the coconut rice was so good, too!  i ordered yuca which i can't find back home very often and had that instead of the sweet potato.  a little starchy but a nice side. this place is very loud and i can see why that might be a hindrance to some parties.  i happened to love that when it was someone's birthday, they brought over a drum and had all their waiters singing.  very authentic and cool!
