Yes, it's a tourist trap.  Yes, it's pricey.  Yes, the wait is way too long but guess what?  I still love it.  I've been here countless times.  Enough to finally narrow down the only pizza toppings that do the trick for me and the bf.  That is, a pie with extra fresh mozzarella and meatball.  Any pizza with fresh mozzarella prevails over all others and Lombardi's meatball is like no other.  So soft, so flavorful, mmm getting hungry just thinking about it.
