Awesome meal after a night out.. or even on a normal day! I've been here a ton of times and always get the half and half (half chicken, half lamb). My favorite is the lamb and rice! You can never go wrong with this place! Enjoy! Oh yeah, and I LOVE the white sauce (always get two, if you're on the go!) and be careful with the hot sauce! It's EXTREMELY spicy !!! A few drops are enough for me!
