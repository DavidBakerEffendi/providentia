Small intimate italian place.  Started off with a good bread basket (although honestly, I've never met a bread basket I didn't like), then burrata salad which was great.  I had the strisce which I wish was a bit more al dente.  My friend had the pasta with pesto/gorgonzola sauce which was too rich to eat more than a few bites of.  Food was good, but given all the amazing Italian options in new york, you're really going to have to WOW me.
