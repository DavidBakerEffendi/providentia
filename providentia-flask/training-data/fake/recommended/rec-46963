I'm torn.  Why does this have to be so good, yet so far away?  Impossible love. Famous Original was as close to my perfection as it might get.   It's simple, thin, has a crunch in the crust, and a bite in the cheese. It was actually one of those things where I thought it was awesome while eating it, and now I just feel like there's a void in my life. I may or may not be writing this in my bed, 24 hours after the fact and 3000 miles away. We'll always have that day, Bertie.
