If I could replicate Jean's Cafe all over the country, I would do so in a heartbeat.  I love this little nook on Walnut.   The service is impeccable.  The staff is friendly, caring and kind despite its busy atmosphere.  I cannot STRESS how important service is to me.  And these guys hit the nail on the head. The food is delicious and they have a wide selection of food.  Not to mention how cheap it is! My personal favorite is the chicken parm.  But I also love their breakfast sandwiches.  Hell, I love it all! I'm really hoping they aren't going to get rundown when IHOP opens up next door. This place is great. My ONLY complaint I have is that there is only one Jean's Cafe! :)  What am I to do when I eventually move? *sigh*
