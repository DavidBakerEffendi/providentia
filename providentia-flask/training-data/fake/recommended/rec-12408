The two stars is not because of the wait. In fact, we didn't wait at all because we went for dinner. This was strategic. I called 15 minutes ahead to ask if there was a wait for two, of which there was not. The ambiance at night at Clinton St. Baking is great. It's candlelit and intimate and the two-top tables that make up a majority of the floor are occupied by couples. We were sat immediately, but it was steadily busy. All but one table was occupied, however that sentiment carries less weight when there are 12 tables in a restaurant. I love the biscuits they serve in place of the expected bread basket. Our food came out quickly. I suggested since it was my dining companion's first time that she get the blueberry pancakes. She absolutely loved and devoured them. I should have taken my own advice and stuck with the breakfast for dinner agenda. I ordered the burger with bleu cheese. It was mediocre at best. I requested it be cooked Medium-Rare and it came out Medium-Well/Well. This is always completely demoralizing for me. This goes hand-in-hand with the awful service we had. Had our waitress come over ONCE after the very attentive back-waiter dropped our food this situation could have been rectified. Alecia H. was our waitress on Tuesday, August 19 and she was inattentive, disinterested, and most importantly, not present! For a restaurant as small as this one I should not have to actively look for my waitress. Both me and the person I was dining with work in the food industry and we were actually laughing at how awfully we were being treated. Because we know what it is like to work in service we tried to be understanding, constantly rationalizing our server's blas√© attitude, but when we realized that she was not busy serving other tables, a fact of which we could have dealt with, we started to get angry. Completely inexcusable and intolerable. Will not return.
