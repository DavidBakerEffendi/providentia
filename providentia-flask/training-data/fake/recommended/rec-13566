Bijan is a work in progress, like this review was for the last two weeks. The kitchen was not opened yet, but the regulars and drinks are taking formation. A fireplace and a great elevated couch decorate the entranceway. Dee, this remodeled venue is just craving for more fun times and stories to be had.
