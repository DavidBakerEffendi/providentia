I love this place.  I was always a fan, but once I became regular enough to be treated like a regular it solidified it for me (mostly because the table I like to sit used to be off limits, but now I get to sit there!) They send out a "taste" before your meal, which is so lovely, and quite honestly a treat that has been forgotten by most every other place in NYC ever. Servers are slightly quiet but always so sweet and accommodating.  The ambiance is endearing and cozy while being sharp at the same time.  Their biscuit and jam is delicious, as is the pancake, but my favorite is always the breakfast burrito situation.   Definitely a place to go if you're in the area, quality is always up to par and when it's nice out, their garden is top notch.
