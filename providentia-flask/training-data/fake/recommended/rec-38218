One of my favorite spots in New Haven hands down! Great entrees, awesome wraps and sanwhiches and a fantastic build your own salad! Prices are great and portions are always more than enough. Service is always fantastic and the bucket of homemade chips is always a nice way to start your meal. The atmosphere is very warm and inviting, and makes it a cozy spot to hang out with friends or on a date. Great patio in the summer! The best part? A plate full of Swedish fish served to you with your bill! It always makes me smile before having to pay!
