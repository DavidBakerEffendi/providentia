Umami means "pleasant savory taste." Indeed it was savory. Due to opening week, the wait was close to 3 hours. Good thing we swung by Jinya first for a bowl of ramen to hold us over. The great thing about Umami is that they text you when your table is ready, which allows you to hang out in the neighborhood rather than loiter in front of the restaurant. Although the long wait, the food came out really quick. We even got our burgers before our drinks. Service was good, very attentive. I was content with my order, the Original Umami burger but really like my friend's Truffle burger. Hopefully once they open the upstairs seating area the wait won't be so bad. If it is, go play some porno bingo while you wait!
