I have to confess, I did see this place on Man vs. Food. If possible, I had to try this place, my GF and Holly was sweet enough to let me indulge. Went here on a Saturday afternoon. This place was popular already but with TV fame the line was wrapped around the corner. While standing in line, it actually gave us a chance to taste some stuff from Beck's Cafe which is next door. When we finally ordered, I got the pull pork with rabe and the sharp provolone. The sandwich is a nice size. The pork good, not too tender but not dry. The broccoli rabe is a nice touch. Everyone was satisfy with what they got. If you can avoid the weekend, I would because the line is crazy long. But if you're with your home girls, you can entertain each other while you wait. Also, it is a good idea that someone stakes a claim on a table. I too am suspicious of eateries that are over-hype. But this place is decent. The sandwich itself is good, is it worth waiting in line for 30+minutes good, not really. But, worth going at least once.
