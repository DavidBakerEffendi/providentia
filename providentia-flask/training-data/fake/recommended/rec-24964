We ate at Blue for the first time last night and we were not disappointed.  We dined with four of our friends, all of whom had eaten there before.  We ordered a bunch of apps for the table.  The asian wings were definitely my favorite.  For an entree, I had the lamb shank, which was fall-off-the-bone amazing.  It came with a side of cheese risotto, also cooked perfectly.  The drinks were great as well- after a few glasses of white sangria, I was feeling good.  Please note- they do not offer carafes or pitchers of sangria, even if everyone at the table is ordering it.  The wait staff was attentive, which was a feat considering how crowded the restaurant was.  Thumbs up all around.
