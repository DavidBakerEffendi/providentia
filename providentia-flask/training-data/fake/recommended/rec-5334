It loses a star for service and space. To be fair it was a rainy day - but there was no space to wait for our table and it took a very long time to get a drink after we sat down. But everything got better once we got that drink and it ended up being a great dining experience. The food is BOMB. The hot fried chicken is really delicious. Sides are tight. I would highly recommend going here - just don't go with a big group. 4 person party max.
