Came here for brunch on a Saturday in August, hoping to soak up another final outdoor dining experience of the summer. Unfortunately you're overlooking (and hearing) the East Side Highway, but if you can get past the noise (and the funk/fun of neighboring Bellevue) this is a solid outdoor brunch option. Food is reasonably priced and well executed - got the avocado toast which I wanted to essentially bathe in (gross, I know) and some mediocre lamb sausages. The boyfriend got a brisket and egg type deal that was pretty fabulous and I kind of wanted for myself. For dessert, go with the roasted caramelized bananas, which are actually listed as a side with brunch, not on the dessert menu. Phenom. Great service and friendly waiters are the icing on this fancy cake. Er, dining experience. Go!
