This was possibly one of the worst meals I've ever experienced. Where to begin?  One member of our party ordered shrimp scampi:  the shrimp was decent enough, but the pasta was literally linguini with butter. There was no seasoning, no flavor at all. She asked me to taste to see and it was terrible.  My cousin ordered chicken murphy, It was pretty much chicken with brown gravy. The broccoli and cavatelli had muted flavor and the greens were chewy. I had mushroom linguini and a "stick" about a quarter inch in length was lodged in my gum while chewing. The owner came and excused it was a mushroom stem!  Really?  Every person in the party of 8 left their food.  We went to the Pilgrim Diner for coffee and dessert.  On the way out we cautioned three people from entering and to their good fortune, they took our advice.  I would never go back. On a positive note, the waitress was very nice and did a good job.  Oddly the TV in the dining room was tuned to a cooking channel which only made us jealous for good food.
