Service is on the slower side but definitely worth the wait. Staff is extremely polite and attentive to your needs. I added the seaweed to my rice and it was worth the extra dollar in my opinion. Not really salty but it added quite a different taste to pain white rice. Depending on what you get it pairs quite well. Â  The wait can get long so if you want to try it, I'd go early and sit at the counter and watch the kitchen while waiting.
