I really really liked this place. Of course it`s a little pricey but what can you expect from a restaurant on a boat? The decor is beautiful and oldfashioned and gorgeous view out of the window doesn`t let you forget where you are. The entrees were also excellent, small but excellent :) I like how in this kind of places you don`t have to decide if you want mashed potato with brown gravy or baby carrots for your sides, it all comes with garnish the chef thinks is the best. The place is obviously popular but not overcrowded.
