what!  they've been open for almost two years and i just discovered this place today. who knew!? a great cafe for breakfast/lunch (although i do understand they also serve dinner some nights), with a fantastic menu.  i love that many of their dishes have some traditional italian ingredients (adding broccoli rabe to sandwiches, etc.), so i tried the ricotta pancakes and they were excellent.  i heard that they served meatballs and the owner, cynthia, joked that hers were amazing.  being italian (and priding myself on MY amazing meatballs), i take that kind of comment seriously.  so she asked a patron sitting nearby and he said hers were an 11, "off the charts".  generously, she even sent over a plate for us try, and yeah, i hate to admit, but they were THAT GOOD! the owners are incredibly lovely, the staff all sweet and attentive, the cafe beautifully  done.  they've earned themselves two new loyal customers.  we'll be back.  so should you.
