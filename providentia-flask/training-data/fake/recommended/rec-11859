Ok I had an amazing meal here yesterday! Obviously had to do the all you can eat pasta situation, there was some sort of pumpkin ravioli which was incredible, a basic spaghetti with tomato and basil, which was good, and then a rigatoni bolognese which was to die for. Literally one of the tastiest things Ive ever consumed. The ambiance is cute, we sat in the back room there is a sky light, has a very open feel. The service was great, everything was just simple and fresh. Would go again for sure. It is worth getting stuck in times square for....
