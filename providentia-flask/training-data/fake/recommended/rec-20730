The squid ink pasta was absolutely delicious. The portions aren't huge, but they should leave you being content. I also loved the thin crusts and different toppings for the pizzas. A note about the da mikele pizza - its prosciutto topping is extremely salty. The ambience here feels very warm and comforting. Good for large group reservations. The waitresses are a bit blunt- they seem to be in a rush all the time- but they're not unkind. This place definitely had some of the better Italian food that I've had in New York, and the prices are very reasonable for the quality of food and the neighborhood. Can't wait to come back!
