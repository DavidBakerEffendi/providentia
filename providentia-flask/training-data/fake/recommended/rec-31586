I'm probably biased because I lived in NY for most of my life & know what good Italian food is like. Bruno's is not it. The food, portions & service have gotten progressively worse in the last 5 years. The owners & adorable waitresses are great; but everything else leaves so much to be desired. The chicken parm hero is served on French bread!! The chicken cutlet is pancake thin & the sauce is worse than Ragu. Adding insult to my chicken parm injury is I actually called back!! The 1st time I was left on hold for 13 minutes. I should've known. Now I know I'll pay the $13 to go through the tunnel. Sorry Bruno's- I miss good Italian food.
