Mediocre food and mediocre service. Â This place has potential, its in a laid back neighborhood with a very friendly vibe. And since its 10 or so minutes to Cortelyou Rd., its the only major restaurant around the New Kirk/Foster area. But the service is inconsistent, varying from crappy to decent. The food is ok, nothing spectacular but highly overpriced. They are not a good spot to go to if you are vegetarian, they have a veggie burger, their only salad consists of greens, apple and pecan and that is about it. You are not able to substitute sides without a big freaking hassle, depending on your server and the mood of the owner. Overall this place should realize it is competing with Groupon and the likes and should amp up its customer service and food quality.
