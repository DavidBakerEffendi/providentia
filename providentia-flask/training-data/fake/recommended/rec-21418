I found this place last minute because the place I wanted to go to was closed on Mondays. I mostly picked this place because they have alot of avocados on the menu. This is such a cute place, well decorated and made it feel like you were home. The service was excellent. The cashier and the waiter was super nice and friendly and was very attentive! So you walk in the door, and you walk to the counter, order your food and then they will give you a number. You get to pick your own seat and they will bring your food to you! There is a big board with the menu in the front for you to look at. I had the avocado blt with a side of fries. OMG the sandwich was HUGE! I paid 14$ and it was so worth it, I could only eat a small half. The bread was delicious! The bacon was cooked a little too much, so it was hard and it was hard to bite into the sandwich, but it could also be that I couldn't fit the whole thing in my mouth anyway. The avocado was really good, it was like not mushy like alot of places. My friend had a hot chocolate and miles burger. She finished the whole thing. She liked it. She even said that it wasn't greasy than it looked. (Might just be how the bread looks). I'd totally go back here. In fact, I'm bringing my boyfriend back. :)
