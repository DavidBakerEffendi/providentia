iExcelente! El Diablito is a great casual, family-run business. Everyone who works there is very kind and eager to please. The dine-in service is terrific and the delivery is fast and comes with a smile. The homemade horchata is delicious, a bit sweet but that's how I like it. I have tried nearly everything on the menu (except the breakfast items) and have enjoyed them all. The quesadilla is one of my favorites but it is smaller than the other items despite being at the same price point. Note: The paper menus have the preparations on the left side (tacocs, tortas, quesadillas, enchiladas, huaraches, burritos) and the styles on the right side (chicken, al pastor, shrimp, vegetarian, etc.) For some reason the enchiladas list chicken in the descripton but it must be a mistake because they can definitely prepare the enchiladas any style. The veggie ones are quite good and filling too! I hope they expand their salsa choices. What they have is good but I'd like something more tomato-based and chunky as an option as well. Pro-tip: If you download the Belly app (or, just DL then save to Passbook in iphone), you can check-in in the restaurant and save up points for perks like free food.
