Food - I was really looking forward to visiting Pat's Steaks for a really long time and finally had the time to come around to trying. But boyyy was I wrong and will never return again. The bread wasn't anything great, the meat was dry and overall the sandwich was dry. The only thing saving it was the condiments. However I do have to admit that the jalapeno was delicious - not what I even came there for though. Price - Honestly, I felt like I didn't get what I paid for. The portions weren't all that big and it didn't even taste great. Service - The utmost worst service I have ever received. The lady at the window started with a stare that almost felt like she was staring down my soul and then proceed to have the most horrible attitude ever when asking us what we wanted our Philly Cheese Steak. This is the main reason why this spot does not deserve anything more than a 1 star. NOT GOING TO RETURN!
