Philly Cheesesteak Hunt 2/3 This is the best Cheesesteak I have ever had. Juicy and tender. But interestingly, not greasy AT ALL. It is definitely a LOCAL HANGOUT. I went in on a Sunday afternoon and the place was wall to wall. It is a pretty small place but the traffic moved in and out yet it remained crowded. I know this because I dined at the bar and watched people shuffle in for take out orders and stand patiently for an open seat. They offers three different types of peppers that are made in house and their pickles are too. They also provided a self serve container for jalepeno peppers. The place sells various sodas, teas and gourmet bottled sodas. There are no side items like fries or onion rings. If you need more than the sandwich, you will have to settle for chips or bring some in. My sandwich and Boylan Orange soda were $11.55 before tip. Unlike other reviews, I did not feel rushed at the counter at all, but I would feel bad if I were just goofing off ignoring the growls of the stomachs behind me or the drool on the little kids faces. C'mon, you had your turn at the table, give them their chance!
