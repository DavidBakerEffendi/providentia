The building is a little sketchy and is in desperate need of updating, but when have I stopped a building from trying their food.  Best Subs sits at the end of a row of commercial establishments and if it can survive it's neighbors I wanted to know why.  The staff was wonderful and recommended I try the monthly special of North Country Brisket and the owner/cook/etc suggested I had it Reuben style.  I think I could rival a sumo wrestler on food quantity and opted to have the sub which was about 6" of a loaf of Italian bread packed full of goodness.  After eating my sub I talked to the owner for a few minutes to learn about the history of the restaurant.  It was once a Subway and from the looks of it has never been updated (or possibly cleaned).  I read another review about the fries and thought my next sub I would request it to be in the style of  Primanti Brothers. However, after talking to the owner about his fries they sounded boring and not a focus of the business.  If you're looking for a good deli sub stop by and you'll leave full.  If you aren't a fan of out dated dirty eateries just get it to go or eat with a paper bag over your head.
