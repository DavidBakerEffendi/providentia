Just had the pleasure of sampling some things from the new fall menu and chef Todd knocks it out of the park again! We've been to the restaurant several times the service is Â always outstanding (thanks Chris) they understand & can explain the menu. We started out with the Polenta duck confit and the crab cakes both were very satisfying. For the main we had the salmon & the pork chop. I can't say how the salmon was ( my wife loved it) because I was so engrossed with the chop. We've had desserts in the past and they were home made and also very good. For the quality of the ingredients the presentation & the creativity this place is very reasonable. I come down from 172 on the gsp right past Ridgewood where you can spend a lot more & get a lot less
