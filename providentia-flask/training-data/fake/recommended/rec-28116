Probably our favorite, go too, spot in Astoria. It sets the bar for all the hip new restaurants opening in the neighborhood. always consistent, always great. the little sister of the Penrose, on the upper east side, never disappoints. Haven't had a full dinner here but I know the food is great. I Enjoyed the cheese plate and wish I had ordered the grilled cheese sandwich-it looks amazing. ..and If you don't know about the pickles by now- you have a bigger problem. Very nice cocktails and beers on tap...all available at Astoria prices. Highly recommend this place to anybody. Don't read any further reviews! Just go straight there.
