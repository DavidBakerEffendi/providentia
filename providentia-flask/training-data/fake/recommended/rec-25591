Oh, another late-night experience.  Bayonne used to have five diners, and this was not the best one (that was Tops, midtown, and they screwed you big time, Mike).  Still, after the town changed and new crowds came and went, the Broadway Diner survived and thrived.  Very good food, that gastronomicon of a menu, and very good to great service.  Lots of cops coming in and out means it's pretty well covered for security; the fact that some eat here off-duty (and pay!) means it's good food.
