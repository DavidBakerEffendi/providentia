Long my favorite, my go-to place for several years, I'm somewhat disappointed lately. Some of the very best items on the menu -  the Moroccan veggie burger and patty melt - are GONE. Please being them back, guys!! Plus, on 4th of July, they were out of their signature dessert  by 6:30. Sad!!  BUT we had their blueberry scones this morning (take out) and they were perfect!
