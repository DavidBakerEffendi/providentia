I was wandering around the neighborhood and decided to stop in for dinner. I'm very glad I did! The servers were very attentive and friendly. I ordered a pork and kimchi soup (I'm a big fan of Korean food), and the flavors were tasty, but I think I'll order something more light next time. The broth was quite rich and filling. As an appetizer, I also ordered the grilled sliced duck. I wouldn't order this again, as the slices were not very warm and didn't have much of a grilled flavor. Overall, I left satisfied and I'd definitely come back!
