Dinner was a complete joy at this authentic Szechuan Chinese restaurant. A very adventuresome yet unthreatening menu yielded a slew of enticing offerings. The hot & sour seafood soup was outstanding and was enough to feed the whole table. The menu was extensive and the flame-accompanied grill pot came to the table loaded with red peppers and intense spices. I had the pork ribs and would like to return to try the beef. Some of the less adventuresome of our party thoroughly enjoyed the "American-styled" Chinese selections including chicken with the broccoli and sesame chicken. We definitely recommend this restaurant for its selection, menu, and price.
