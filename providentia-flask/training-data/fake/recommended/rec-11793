WOW... WOW... WOW! All of the rave reviews about this cart are LEGIT.  Out of all of the times I've visited NYC, I've never had this actual well-known cart and opted for the imitation carts instead -- and I'll never settle for anything less than this cart again! After calling it an early night (for NYC standards) at 1AM, a friend suggested to take us here.  In the freezing, below 20 degree weather, there was already a line.  People were eating outside and in their cars.  I wanted to get the best of both worlds, so I tried the gyro and chicken combo over rice.  Like other reviewers mentioned, the white sauce is AMAZING.  I also got the hot sauce, which was a lot spicier than I thought it would be... but it was still good. For only $6, you get a piping hot container of succulent meat over rice.  This is a must try if you're ever in NYC!
