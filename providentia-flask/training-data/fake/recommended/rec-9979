I like to compare this place to or other hand-pulled noodles local (Lam Zhou). Love that Tasty is closer to the subways. Love that this is closer to me! Love that one chef is in the back (where you can see him) pulling the noodles. Miss that there is no thlapping of dough on a metal table. Where is the noisy food making? Love the al dente chew of the noodles. Miss the heartiness of the broth. (Do not miss the MSG in the broth). Miss the generosity of beef tendon in order. (Appreciate the risk of ordering beef and getting soft beef slices and tender tendon slices) Thanks Tasty! I choo choo choose you!
