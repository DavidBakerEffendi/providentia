Took an exit off the I-95 on my way to Cape Cod to stop by Frank Pepe's, and I'm glad I did. The white clam pizza here is absolutely slamming, with fresh briny clams and a crispy crust. I wouldn't get a large though, it can be a little overpowering. We split a medium with 4 people and that was the perfect amount. The red pies are only ok, but they're definitely serviceable. The line was huge when we left but service is brisk.
