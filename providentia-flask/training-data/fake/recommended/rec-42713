Have to do the obligatory review of the Halal Guys. Everything you need to know you have prbly already heard but I'd love to throw in some tips. My go-to order which you will not be displeased with is: half chicken half lamb with rice and make sure to get the onions and peppers/veges they have there, adds a perfect amount of crunch! Pita of course and then for the sauce everyone is different, but I like to go with a little hot, good amount of bbq, and LOTS of white sauce. Absolutely delicious. I have walked six avenues in the pouring rain just to end my night with some chicken and rice. I have found myself here at 5 AM after a rave with nothing else on my mind but finishing off the night with some white sauce (not that kind tho). Location on 14th is just as good, don't make a schlep if you don't have to.
