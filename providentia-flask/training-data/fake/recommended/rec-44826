I dined at The Little Owl with my family on a recent trip to NYC and had a great experience. The intimacy of the space and friendly, professional staff added to the ambiance and made for a special evening.  Highlights from the meal were the pork chop and the steak.  Incredible seasoning, juiciness, and texture. We also enjoyed the flavors in the summer vegetable side dish, but felt the green beans were a little over cooked.  Two things keep me from giving five stars (and I would actually go with 3.5 if that were an option): The bread they served at the beginning of the meal was stale and dry, and the deserts were a great disappointment.  While I realize that we didn't pay for the bread, I feel that everything that goes on the table should reflect the best efforts of the restaurant, and this had all the appeal of three day old supermarket italian bread. We passed on appetizers to save room for dessert and I wouldn't recommend that strategy here.  One dessert consisted of fried dough with a strong baking soda flavor on a plate of Nutella and the other was a small half peach with a scoop of ice cream. Overall though I will return to The Little Owl for that unforgettable steak.
