I give this place 4.5 out of 5 stars because the food was delicious but the portions were a bit too small for the price. Â I understand it's more expensive because of quality in terms of ingredients and taste, but I still think the portions could have been slightly bigger. Another reason why it's not 5 stars is because it's very crowded, small, and the chairs are stylish but are like blocks of wood so there is no place to put/hang your coat and purse. I thoroughly enjoyed the steamed buns (pork bun). I liked it so much I placed another order after finishing the other dishes we had first ordered. The second was just as good as the first too; I appreciate the consistency! Next time I'm in the area, I will definitely be back here for the steamed buns. My second favorite of the night was the "spicy pork sausage & rice cakes." I really liked how the rice cakes were a little crispy on the outside and had the right amount of chewiness on the inside, and the flavors of the dish melded together perfectly! It was also very beautiful as you can see in my video review. It was the first time I tried raw oysters, the royal miyagi oysters. It tasted good, but it was not amazing but I think that's just because I'm not used to raw oysters. The Shanghai noodle was mediocre, I didn't like the creaminess in that dish, it sorta clashed with the other ingredients, but it wasn't bad. The veal in the the veal sweetbreads dish was delicious, the morsels were moist and tasty.
