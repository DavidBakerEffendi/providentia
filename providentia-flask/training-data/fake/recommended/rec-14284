Pork broth. Herbal broth is definitely along the medicinal route. (I'm sure it's good for you but my tongue is not having it). This place is not super big, but it's nice enough and it's open until very late. Lots of kids hanging out here late night, so just know that it might get a little loud. Otherwise, I'm coming back!
