After reading about what a great Italian spot this was, even rivaling places in Manhattan, we finally decided to try it & brought a new friend. What a disappointing experience. (An embarrassment as well, since I recommended the place.) It was like a choreographed production line. The specials, which were recited, were so numerous that you forgot 80% of them - a board would be a better way to communicate. The descriptions of the food did sound like the pairings of ingredients would be very tasty... Again, disappointing. The food presentation was boring & monochromatic. The taste was at best, meh. They clearly wanted the table as we were not really allowed to linger. The dessert list was put down & within 5 minutes our waiter wanted to take our order. We just wanted to finish our 2nd bottle of Â wine before deciding. I won't say it was the worst meal we ever had, but for all the hype, there are MUCH better places to dine.
