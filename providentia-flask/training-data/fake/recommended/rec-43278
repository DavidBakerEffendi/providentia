We stood in line for about 15 minutes and it was so worth the wait!  A gentleman behind us recommended that we split a couple of sandwiches, so we did!  I ordered the Mac Daddy (beef, cheese, fries, hot sauce, and mac n cheese) and the Phat Lady (steak, cheese, fries, mozzarella sticks and ketchup.)  My friend ordered the Sanchez (chicken was great but little bland compared to the other sandwiches.  She also ordered the Shrimp po boy hoagie, which i didn't get to try because we were so full after the second sandwich!  She didn't get to try my Phat Lady but yes, it was all that!  definitely don't recommend eating here on a regular basis unless you are college age (which I'm not!) and/or are an athlete who can burn off the calories efficiently.  Oh, and like most places in downtown Princeton, they only take cash!!
