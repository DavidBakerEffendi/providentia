Well, the service and the quality were sorely lacking here tonight.  We ordered 2 nachos and 1 carne asada.  We got the carne asada and one nacho.  When I asked if they had forgotten the other one, I was met with total incomprehension, a smile and a nod.  I reminded the person who had taken my order that I was due another order of nachos and she said they were coming and called the next person to pick up their order.  I explained that the entire order should have come together and she just blinked at me. So, hen I attempt to et my carne asada and the meat is tough and nearly impossible to chew. When they first opened the service was much better be he food palatable. Skip this place.
