After hearing from friends and reading about it in previous reviews, I decided to stop by to try this amazing burger.  I walked in and 2 hostesses had just stepped away from the front.  One went to the back, while the other was seating 4 gentlemen and was flirting with them for a good 10 mins. before ever acknowledging that there were 3 of us waiting at the front, (which happened to be right next to their table).  Not the best opening impression.  After finally being seated, it took awhile just to get a server to take the order.  The burger came out quick but I was left un-impressed with what was placed in front of me.  It was a tidy looking burger that just tasted ok.  Nothing special about it.  Big disappointment.
