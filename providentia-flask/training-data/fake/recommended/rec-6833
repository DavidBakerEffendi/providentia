My husband I had a wonderful meal here.  First of all, unlike most Brooklyn restaurants, they take reservations. (We are so tired of trying to go out only to be told there is a 60-90 minute wait.) The service was very attentive and warm, without being stuffy or obtrusive. And the food! We ordered the cabbage with miatake mushrooms and boar belly bacon, the borsa vuota with chestnuts, spinach and mushrooms, the chuck steak with chanterelles,  and the chocolate cake. Everything was delicious and special. We really felt there were some unique flavors happening, without any weirdness for its own sake. They also brought out an amuse bouche of whipped fennel with mint oil. I love going to a restaurant and getting this kind of bonus taste. Plus I could have eaten a giant bowl of it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the music. While I like going out and dancing to bass thumping hip hop and is punk definitely on my running playlist, it's not what I want at dinner. I'm am not suggesting they should be playing chamber music, but something more chill would be an improvement.
