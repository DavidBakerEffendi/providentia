This place is great. I had been wanting to go here for some time and I finally made the trip tonight, getting some coworkers to make the trip from our office in Dumbo with me. Service: 5 stars. We were seated immediately, checked on enough, and were treated great. One of us asked the server to surprise him with a drink of her choice, not specifying even what type of drink he wanted. She came back with a great tequila cocktail that had recently been moved off the menu, but was a favorite of regulars. He was satisfied. Atmosphere: 5 stars. I expected the place to be a bit funky, but it felt more fine dining than 'gonzo' as I had heard it described on more than one occasion. Food: 5 stars. Everything was prepared well, tasted great, and was presented thoughtfully and tastefully. We started with the nippon nachos and the foie gras donut and then had the duck, chicken and waffles, steak, and the Chimichanga Xacuti. We all tasted each others dishes and literally everything was perfect. It was 10 great, silent minutes that felt like an hour. I hope Do or Dine is very successful. They've really done something special. Go here soon, before it gets too popular to walk in and get a table on a weeknight.
