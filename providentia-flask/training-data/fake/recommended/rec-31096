I was treated to lunch here today, and it was wonderful.  We shared several appetizers and several pizzas, and everything was fantastic.  The pizzas tasted PERFECT -- the tomato sauce was bright and flavorful and not too heavy, the cheese was delicious, and the crust was exactly right -- crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, blistered and lightly charred.  They use the best and most flavorful ingredients, and even the standard-sounding pepperoni pizza was amazing -- smoky, spicy, just right. I wish we'd saved room for dessert -- they have a bunch of great-looking options. It's a bit on the expensive side, but it's definitely worth it.  If I lived in Philly, I'd go to this place all the time.  They know their stuff.
