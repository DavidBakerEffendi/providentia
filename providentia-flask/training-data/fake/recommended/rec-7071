They've got decent burgers but it's oily and greasy. Â I couldn't hold onto the burger without having pieces falling out. It's really yummy but not very healthy. The breakroom fries are good and very heavy so just one order is a bit of an overkill. I hear the tacos are highly rated, I guess I'll try it in the future after recovering from all this fatty fried food.
