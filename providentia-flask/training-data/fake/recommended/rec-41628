I'm reviewing the take out front only.   I live in South Philly and order out for dinner an embarrassing 3 times a week or more.  Franco & Luigi's is part of my life, at least weekly. The square tomato pie, penne vodka, and baked ziti are my staples.  The pasta dishes are excellent, sandwiches are great, and pizza is the best in South Philly.   The tomato pie has a great flavor, but is sometimes undercooked, especially if you order delivery. That's the only reason it gets 4 stars.  When it's cooked long enough, I'm in heaven.
