Maybe it is all the hype and maybe my expectations were out of alignment but I felt seriously let down by dinner at Applewood. The service was very good and the decor, very inviting.  The wine list was good and we were very pleased with both the selection and with our choice. Unfortunately when it comes to the food, we found the appetizers to be pretty bland and lacking in any imagination, taste or lasting impression. The entrees were equally bland and boring.  The food quality is high but I can go to the market, purchase high quality product and heat it up with no effort.  The prices at Applewood are definitely on the more expensive side, especially for Brooklyn, so I'd like a little more imaginative flavor and taste for my money.   The desserts, while better than the entrees, were just really just "okay." Perhaps it was an off evening or we ordered the wrong dishes but I didn't feel Applewood was worth the trip and certainly not worth the price.
