My mom and I came to El Vez on our last night in Philly. We'd tried to walk in a few nights before and there was, of course, a huge wait, so we made a reservation. The only one we could get was 8:15pm, but when we arrived it wasn't even that crowded. Definitely fairly full, but no wait. We were first given a table inside but when my mom requested we move outside, they were very accommodating and found us a place right away. We really, really wanted to try the guacamole after reading about it in all the reviews, but... for the price and there only being two of us, we just couldn't justify it. Instead, we opted for the chips & salsa. We just did the regular salsa, which came with a pico de gallo, a red salsa, and a green salsa (which was my favorite - very mild and a bit cilantro-y!). The chips were really good, too: just salty enough. I ordered the black bean enchiladas for my entree, as did my mom. I asked for mine to come without the onions, which they said was fine. However, when it arrived, there were onions galore. I wasn't going to say anything, but my mom did... and our server was very apologetic and actually comped the dish, which was really nice. Even with the onions, the enchiladas were really good - not too spicy, but had a little kick, and the cheese was delicious. Service was pretty attentive, the cost was decent, and the food was good. The ambiance is fun and the decor is interesting, so it's definitely a fun little place!
