I had a birthday party here last year and the service was excellent and super accommodating. The group trickled in a little past the time I had reserved the space for. The roti canai was so freaking good we were licking the plates clean. We did it family style so we got to try a lot of different things. The menu is extensive, but luckily we got to try all the good dishes. Go here, explore and experiment with all the different dishes they have here.
