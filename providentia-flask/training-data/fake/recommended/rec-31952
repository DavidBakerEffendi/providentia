To the Newest Member of the Blue State Community: You use space effectively, and have large tables easy to fit multiple people who start off as strangers. Your drinks, after a brief adjustment period, are now on par with the Wall St. location -- and still superior to the York St. location. Your music is generally more muted and understated than either. (Today you had on a jazz mix with the late, great cornettist Nat Adderley). You don't air-condition the heck of your space, for which I am grateful.  Not all of us want to walk in in T-shirt weather and feel like we need to bring along a sweater. You have several photos displayed of the coffee harvesting process, and pictures of some great latte art by your baristas.  (Of course, you also have up the bloody burlap coffee sacks that I hate hanging over my head at Wall St.!). For these reasons, I am a fan of you. I still think you could improve your efficiency and line-up process, as when you get crowded, you get crowded beyond compare, since there are NO other decent coffee choices down here. But you're pretty awesome, and I think we can be friends. -K
