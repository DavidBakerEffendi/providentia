i come here once a week to get my sashimi fix fish is fresh and you get 12 pieces of sashimi in the regular order for 16 dollars! last night i went back and actually had 14 pieces for the same price. :D my bf and i were starving yesterday so we had the seaweed salad, fried duck roll, he had the bento box (17 dollars for salad, dumplings, soup, and 2 mains! he chose the sashimi and tempura combo)..wait we also had the sashimi regular (because i must have my own order) AND a nigori sake. happy fatties. staff is friendly nand always recommending specials. the tables around us all order really pretty rolls but i'm on a low carb diet and prefer straight up fish but i hear good things about their lobster roll.
