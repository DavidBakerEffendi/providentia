I've heard so much about Ippudo and I waited an hour and fifteen minutes to be seated, so I think my expectations were just a bit high. I ordered the modern ramen with eggs and pork belly. I'm not saying it wasn't good...it actually tasted great, but it didn't wow me away either. What I didn't like was that it only came with two pieces of pork loin! I'm sorry, but as much as I love noodles...I need some meat in there too. Luckily I ordered pork belly to add to it. I know they have a spicy paste for an additional $2, but my friends told me they didn't like the flavor of it, so I didn't want to waste money on it. I love spicy ramen though...so maybe that's another reason why it wasn't anything special to me. I'd definitely come eat here again, but I don't think I'd wait more than 30 minutes for it. The service was great though! I loved the atmosphere and staff.
