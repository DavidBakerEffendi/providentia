The best I can say is that it was terrible. The wait was mis-represented, the drinks were over- priced, the music was so loud you could barely hear one another, and the food was incompletely prepared and some items were not served. It was a completely miserable experience. The manager was clueless and ignored complaints passed on from his staff.
