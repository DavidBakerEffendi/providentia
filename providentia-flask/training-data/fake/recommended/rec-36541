I've been here at least five times over the course of several years. The food is reliably well conceived and well executed. I've always been very happy with my experiences and would highly recommend. The restaurant design is clean and the service friendly. Obviously there's the celebrity factor of being Top Chef but the atmosphere is low key. I'll be back again.
