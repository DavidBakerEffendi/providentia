3.5 if that was an option. Wow, the food and the ambiance were 10/10. Unfortunately, something happened with our server mid meal and he came by our table to tell us that he had been "sent home" ... from that point on the service slowed down to the to molasses levels. Fortunately, our food still came out quickly (though it took close to half an hour for our plates to be cleared and to get coffee) the table behind us wasn't so lucky and left looking hungry and defeated. It was unfortunate that the service drama had a negative impact on the dinning experience, but hopefully it was a one off thing. PS Even if you don't like horseradish sauce make sure not to skip it with the french dip... that sandwich was delicious.
