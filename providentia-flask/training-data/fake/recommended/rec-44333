Both the cheese ravioli and gnocchi my date had were really well made and tasted great. I loved the menus and the entire decor of the place. Servers were good and everything was brought out fast. Maybe even too fast, I usually go into dinner expecting it to be as much a social affair as a food and sometimes felt rushed by the rate at which the food came out.
