GREAT thai food but HORRIBLE waiters, waitresses and hosts.  I swear, every time I come here, it's like I can't get through to the wait staff.  Trying to ask them to modify anything on the menu (i.e. please don't put dumplings in my soup) is like asking them to part the bleeping Red Sea for me.  Everyone has their own and unique experiences at restaurants, and mine have consistently been bad here (with the wait staff, not the food).  So, I've chosen to give them 4 stars, solely based on the food. Anyways, come here for the food.  Don't expect good service or for the waiters to understand what you want if it's not printed in English on the menu.
