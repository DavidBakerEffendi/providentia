A typical song-dong-bu place nothing special. Health department should visit this place though. One time my friend found a tiny black bug in his noodle soup. The owner is nice enough to offer free meal. Second time, I got a stomach flu after eating -- kept me up all night going and vomiting. Definitely will not go back again.
