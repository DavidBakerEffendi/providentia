I just tried the Italian Stallion for the first time. It was incredible. The size of that sandwich was perfect, the bread is incredible (after all, how can you make a good sandwich with bad bread). I opted for oil and no mayo. The meat was of top quality and really delicious. I would highly recommend and encourage all to try a sandwich.
