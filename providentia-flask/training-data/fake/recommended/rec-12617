Cafe Orlin is my go-to place for breakfast/brunch. On a weekday, there's never a wait and you can pick any table amongst the restaurant's three rooms. Weekends are a different story - crowd dies down around 2-3pm so that might be a good time to come for brunch. The place looks and feels like a cafe. The staff is attentive and super nice - they never rush you out of there so it's perfect if you like to stay and chat. I love the food here - I keep coming back for more! My favorite and usual dish is the eggs benedict with home fries. Always poached perfectly and the home fries are deliciously seasoned. They also make the best french toast and buttermilk pancakes! Other breakfast dishes that I've had and would recommend are huevos rancheros and fried eggs on potato pancake.
