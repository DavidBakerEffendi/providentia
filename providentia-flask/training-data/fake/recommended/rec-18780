Came here for dinner last Saturday with my mom, husband and his buddy for dinner. We had reservations for 8:30PM and only had to wait about 5 minutes before we sat down, indoors by one of the open french doors. The tables are close together but it's not too bad if you need to get up in the middle of your meal. It was a little dark, however, in our corner and we had to ask our server to get us a new candle. I could barely see what I was eating. Also they only gave us three bread rolls when there were four people in our party. They had no problem giving us more bread when we asked. To start I had the beet salad with pistachio encrusted goat cheese. Delicious! Then, the mahi mahi with sweet potato hash. Again very tasty and tender. The white sangria was okay-- I would skip it next time and order a regular glass of wine. Overall the service was acceptable for a busy saturday night in NYC. I would come here again.
