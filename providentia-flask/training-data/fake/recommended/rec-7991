I love this place. See Enid C's review- I share her sentiments! I'd like to add that the water you get when you sit down is Poland Spring, specifically. Tony is the best! He remembered us the second time we went, and is great at recommending dishes to try- he also can suggest just the right portions for your party. For the rice, they only charge if you ask for a certain number of refills on rice with respect to the number of dishes you ordered (not sure what it is). Makes sense; the bold flavors of the dishes can have you asking for refill after refill on rice! One of my favorite dishes is the lemongrass stir fry with beef- remember to ask for it with peanuts if by some chance you aren't asked for your preference! Another vote for the prah-hok kahteeh- it is addictive, and we love it so much we add rice to the bowl when it is down to smidgens of the sauce, so we don't waste one drop. Try any of the soups/stews- each one has unique flavor profiles and is delicious in its own way. One of my personal favorites is especially amazing (can't find it on the online menu right now :( ) and the spices and flavors are multidimensional and straight up magical. The grandma also cooks certain dishes as well, so be sure to ask what grandma makes :)
