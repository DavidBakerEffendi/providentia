I used to live in NYC and when i'd have visitors, I would always take them here. when they return to CA, they are always craving it, and when i'd make my visit back to the Bay, i'd bring some back just to fulfill their cravings! There is a street vendor that tries to pretend they are the original 53rd and 6th cart, but please dont be fooled. Look for the logo!! now that i'm back in CA, i miss the lamb and rice so much!
