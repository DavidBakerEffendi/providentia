We were in Kefi for dinner last week and sincerely I don't think that I repeat ever. It was not a "terrible experience", but it was pretty disappointing overall. The food was nothing special at all and it was totally overpriced. And the waiters were innatentive and we had to struggle every time we needed to call them for some reason. It is not the worst place ever, but I wouldn't recommend it either.
