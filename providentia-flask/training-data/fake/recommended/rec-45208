My boyfriend and me moved to the area recently and decided to try this place today for the first time.  It wasn't what we expected.  We thought it was more like other crepe places are that are quick in and out pick what you want.  We were surprised in a good way.  The service was excellent.  Our server was very friendly.  I ordered a chicken crepe that had ham, cheese lettuce and tomato.  It was very good a huge.  I took about half of it home.  My boyfriend had an eggplant panini which he also loved.  The desert was probably the best part.  We had the dulce de leche crepe.  We thought we weren't going to be able to eat it all, but it was so good we didn't leave any.  Everything was great: the food and the service.  We will definitely be coming back.
