I've been eating here for months and love the food and atmosphere.  I recommended my team of 15 come here for a large team dinner.   Since I've never been with a large group, we didn't realize that they don't seat incomplete parties.  It was raining heavily and we had driven from 45 minutes away so four out of our group of 15 was delayed in traffic. I use to work in a restaurant. The whole point of not allowing incomplete seating is that you increase your table turnover time with people who show up late.  I get it.   When I pressed the issue nicely explaining that it was our fault and that we'd be more than happy to order for our late guests, the mgr got nasty and in my face and told me that if I didn't like it, there was the door and I could see myself out. I would have left but my team really wanted to stay.  I realize being late is our fault but no reason to get nasty about it.
