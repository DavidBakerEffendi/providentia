My boyfriend and I wanted to try a new place, so we stopped by Vermont Pub and Brewery. The beer selection is great - a sampler is available for $6, where you select the six beers you'd like to try from a list.  I'm not a beer person. In fact, I hated beer, until yesterday. The "forbidden fruit" is a delicious, light, raspberry infused beer, that barely tastes like beer.  A definite must try! I had the cajun fried calamari (about $5) and mesclun salad (about $4) with the honey-chili vinaigrette (the only home-made option).  The calamari were really quite awful. It seems like they were poached in oil rather than fried. They were small, soggy and greasy.  The salad was one of typical greens and julienned carrots, and the vinaigrette had a nice hint of spice.  My boyfriend has the top sirloin steak (nicely cooked and flavourful) with salad and steamed broccoli (also nicely cooked). Service was friendly. Overall, a good place to grab a drink or a bite, but the calamari are to be avoided.
