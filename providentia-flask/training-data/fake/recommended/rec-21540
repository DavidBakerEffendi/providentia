Buy the Pina Colada ice cream, then head back to your stoop, add rum and enjoy! I've always been a huge Pop's fan, but was told that I had to get to Italianos because they were the best - and hell, they invented the Gelati! So, last week, my sister was down to visit and she brought over some bacardi, but forgot the pina colada mix. I took this as the perfect opportunity to suggest we head down to the water ice spot I've been dying to try. We picked up a quart of pina colada water ice and it was delicious - with or without the rum! ;) Since then, I think I've been back about 3 more times (yes, in only a week) but it's only open during the summer!! This mom and pop spot has the best water ice I've ever had. If you follow me on foursquare, then you know it's true, I'm going to be the mayor any day now!! Hopefully, being mayor may influence a "margarita" flavor!
