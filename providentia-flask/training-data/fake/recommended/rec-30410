I have had many meals here...and the food has always been very good.  On 6/14/12 we (4) had lunch; I paid with a debit card and left a CASH tip of $20.00 ( 20%) When at home I checked online only to find  an extra $20.00 had been added to my account. I called Cook Shop and was told "oh, the credit card company does that...it will come off your bill in a day or two!!!!"  I, of course, was incensed to be told such a bald faced  lie. The 'manager' not only lied but was obnoxious. Such a response makes me very wary about the integrity of the wait staff, or the management, if in fact, it is their policy to add a 20% tip on cc's without informing the customer ? Del Flynn NYC
