I am lucky enough to get to town during restaurant week and was pleasantly surprised at how fantastic the food was. For restaurant week they offered a three course meal for $25, a fantastic deal. My sald with fennel and local goat cheese was seasoned perfectly. The ricotta gnocchi with some sort of pesto and foraged much rooms sensational and the pairing of Mcallin Dark Angel Stout with the stoud infused chocolate was heavenly perfection.n the staff was accommodating with regards to my wanting extra attention around the extensive beer list. What a fantastic meal.  Farm. Localvore food prepared in a pub?  My prayers have been answered . A tremendously fantastic meal that exceeded my expectations.
