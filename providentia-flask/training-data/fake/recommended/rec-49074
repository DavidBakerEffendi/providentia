Not trying to write a comedic fiction novel but my experience here was hard to believe. 1. We walk in and the hostess awkwardly tells us there are no tables, meanwhile there is a 2-top just a few feet away. She walks away and the busboy points to the table, offering it up. Super strange... 2. The hostess returns 15 minutes later, telling us the waitstaff is backed up and it will be a little while until they can take our order. Yes, you read that write. Not until we get our food, but until they have enough time to actually put the order into the system. She takes our drink order. 3. Half an hour has now passed and no order taken... My date goes to the waitress and asks if he can order. She says she will come to us and grumpily returns to our table. Does not introduce herself simply says "Ok sorry what do you want?" 4. Pizza was very crappy. Thin tortilla like dough with some dry chicken sprinkled on top. Calamari was tasty. Overall, the service was so terrible I would not return. Mindbogglingly frustrating and can't even say the food was worth it.
