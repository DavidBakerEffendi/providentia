Even though we had been warned when we were making our reservation that a large holiday party would be wrapping up when we came in, we still were eager to try Fare. The manager was very attentive in making sure that we were not bothered by the noise and provided some complimentary menu items - it was a very nice gesture! Looking to go light, I ordered the Grilled Octopus starter and the Fare Mixed Greens Salad. The starter was a very generous portion with a lot of octopus - it was also much more like a salad than I had expected. So when my actual salad came out, I was not able to finish it, but I appreciated the freshness and flavors. The miso dressing is tasty, but if you're not going to finish the salad, definitely ask to get it on the side so everything isn't wilted for tomorrow's lunch. I also sampled the Hand Cut Fries - with truffle oil and parmesan, this is a good choice.
