The place is packed on Sunday mornings and requires us to wait, even if we called in ahead of time.The food descriptions have me salivating before I get to the end of the page. They all sound soooo good and I have a difficult time choosing just one item. Looking over at the tables next to me, I see portions big enough to feed a lumber jack. Starving... if it were appropriate, I'd reach over and have a little taste, just enough to calm my hyperactive taste buds. When the food finally comes, I'm armed with my fork and knife ready to strike. I take a bite and... really? It's a disappointment. Edible, yes. Good? Meh. I've definitely experienced better. A friend of mine disliked her breakfast so much she had to send her order back, something she usually refuses to do because she finds it awkward and humiliating. Final answer: been there, done that, and it doesn't live up to the hype.
