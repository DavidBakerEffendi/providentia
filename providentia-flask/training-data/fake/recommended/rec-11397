I've seen Johnny Brenda's go from a semi-hole in the wall, to a bustling concert venue/restaurant.  It was the first place, for me, that made Fishtown a cool place to come to.  There's always a fascinating crowd, and I'm happy they included outdoor seating when weather permits.  I have yet to see a concert but I've heard great things about the set up.  They really stepped it up a notch with the menu being above your normal bar food fare.  I have yet to try a dish I didn't enjoy.
