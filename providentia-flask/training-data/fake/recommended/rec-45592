Split a banana bread to start; the whipped cream was a delicious addition to a pleasantly moist, flavorful banana cake.  Can't go wrong with the fresh strawberry and blackberry.  I love these kinda of breakfasts - start sweet and end savory.  ONTO THE FRITATA!! Not even sure I spelled that correctly, but I digress.  A delicious egg mixture with spinach mushrooms bacon.  A delectable feast wrapped in one.  I loved the way the flavors and the textures were molded perfectly together for a hearty and healthy breakfast.  Some potatoes, a carmelized apple side, and I substituted bread for biscuit - don't hate me, I don't like biscuits! I think my favorite part of Morning Glory is the unexpected atmosphere.  You can watch the cooks, who for the most part look like they just stepped out of the tattoo parlor, but I'll be damned - they KNOW how to cook.  MG serves coffee in tin cups...who does that?! A really sweet throwback.  A patio for you to hang out in while you wait for your table.  Overall, a huge thumbs up of you're in the mood for a solid breakfast Foods good, price is right, and the wait staff is pleasant.
