This trip to NYC, I had ramen at Ippudo, Minca, Momofuku Noodle Bar, Sapporo, and Totto.  Ippudo is the clear standout.  None of the others come close. This is the first time ever that I finished all the noodles and contemplating whether or not to order extra noodles.  I had the Karaka Men ramen and Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri  (cucumber appetizer).  The cucumber was very good, but too salty. Unless you have a large party; most likely you'll have to share a table. Just go early or late during the week to avoid the long wait.
