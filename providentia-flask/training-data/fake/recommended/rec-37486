Came here last Sunday with my hubby and two old HS friends for a small reunion. When we first arrived I put my name on a waiting list due to the small space and large amounts of people. I was told that the wait was going to be 45 minutes to an hour and you can only imagine the look on my face cause those that know me understand how I despise waiting for anything. Fortunately we didn't wait long and were seated with quick and attentive service. I ordered a Shandy to drink which is beer mixed with lemonade and it was quite tasty. To eat I ordered the catfish with cheesy grits and eggs over easy, plus a biscuit with honey cream. My dish was fanfreakintastic! The catfish was fried perfectly and the grits were exactly how they're meant to be and trust me I love grits and am very picky about them. My hubby and one of my friends had the chicken and waffles. I tried my hubby's dish and was impressed with the chicken, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. We then each had a slice of pie. My hubby had the rhubarb pie which had a great buttery,flaky crust and a bit tart, one friend had the s'mores which he loved and my other friend had the apple pie which was also with a buttery,flaky crust and served warm. I had the banana cream pie which was heavenly. Needless to say this place won my heart over and I will keep coming back!
