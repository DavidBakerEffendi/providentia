Decent food and the atmosphere on the boat was nice.  In the end, even with the all things considered, I wouldn't spend the $$$ here again in the future. The food was well below what I would expect from such a place. Plenty of other places nearby to eat with better food at the same price or less.  When we called and asked about bringing our 8 year old son to dinner with us and the dress code, I was assured it wouldn't be a problem.  The meal started well enough, everyone was enjoying the place and the food. However, our dinner went massively wrong when a inebriated couple arrived in the middle of dinner and sat next to us and continued drinking.  By the time our dessert had arrived the elderly woman started complaining about my son and insulting my family for ruining her special time with her man friend.  It was to late in the meal to ask to change seats and we just unhappily tried to finish the dessert and leave.  The manager apologized on our way out having abounded our dessert course and tried to make it better, but our schedule wasn't going to allow his options.  Anyway -- as I said above....I would look elsewhere before coming back to this restaurant.  I had great meals during my trip to Philly, but this was not one of them.
