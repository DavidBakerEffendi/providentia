I come here every time I visit NYC. I love the food, the atmosphere and the service is usually pretty good too. People watching on the patio during brunch is always fun and the brunch options are always tasty. I'd recommend the lime marinated chicken sandwich with fries. The only downside is that the tables are pushed together pretty closely so when it gets crowded you will probably be bumping into people. Other than that it's great.
