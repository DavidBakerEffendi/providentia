Absolutely wonderful experience. I went here on a busy Friday evening during the San Gennaro feast. Walked in, got a table outside, and ordered sangria to drink and pollo scarpariello to eat. The food was delicious, the service was excellent and the sangria was strong. I can't complain whatsoever, and was pleasantly surprised it went so well here on such a busy evening. Would definitely return here again!
