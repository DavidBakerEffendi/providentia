Haven't been here for so long and a sense of nostalgia prompted me to write this review. They've changed their staff quite a lot from what I remembered. Now they seem to be more attentive and polite (at least my waiter was). I had a soon tofu which was not as flavorful as the one I've had in West Hartford, however it has more content. A choice of soup and salad comes with lunch order. The 7 side dishes were appetizing.
