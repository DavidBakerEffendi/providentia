It's rare that you walk into a seafood place and you don't smell anything fishy.  This place is just that.  It's clean and quick.  People forget that fish isn't supposed to smell fishy.  You'll never smell anything fishy in this place.  They pride themselves on fresh rare to find fish.  Plus they serve it simple and done perfectly.  The oysters are excellent.  They shuck them quick and properly.  Sit at the oyster bar and watch their magic.  Plates can get a bit pricey but given that Chilean Sea Bass comes from over 10,000 miles away and onto my plate fresh...I'll pay it.
