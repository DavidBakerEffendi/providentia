Came all the way to brooklyn to try out this restaurant that was featured by anthony bourdain and eddie huang. We tried many dishes and i can say they were all pretty disappointing. Portions were so small for the price. Papaya salad was subpar. I would say the pork belly dish was good but menu listed it came with pork shoulder. No pork shoulder in dish... Desserts were extremely disappointing, especially the pumpkin tapioca cake with sticky rice. Why was the sticky rice soooo salty?? And the pumpkin tapioca was so unbelievably hard. I expected it to be smooth and soft. Quite disappointed. Extra star for the nice ambience.
