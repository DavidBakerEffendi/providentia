I love the Continental Midtown.  I have been their for dinner on several occasions, but just recently visited for lunch.  The food was reasonably priced (for Center City) and the service was both excellent and fast. You can't beat the atmosphere of the Continental Midtown.  It's fun, hip, and an all around good time! Make sure you get dessert!  Yum...
