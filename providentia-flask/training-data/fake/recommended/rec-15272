I have to change my review on Hot Diggity. I previously wrote a not so great review because of my delivery experience. The Manager of the store got in contact with me and explained that the delivery service for hot diggity is NOT run by people who work for hot diggity, it's simply a courier service that they use, and the delivery price is also not something that Hot Diggity made up, it's the service charge from the Courier service. So as I said in my previous review, I recommend eating here if your anywhere in the south street area, great service and great food. I dont believe that they should be judged on something that they are not in control of.
