To be honest, right now, not a huge fan of Mediterranean cuisine.  (Maybe I've had it too much lately)  Overall, I really enjoyed this place.  We were in the upstairs dining area which was not really crowded and though noisy, it didn't have any issues with having to shout to be heard, we could carry on normal conversation without raising our voices. We were here with a group of 7 people and they were able to seat us with only 3 people that arrived.  We ordered and shared several mezes, a salad, and two entrees.  Everything was fresh, properly seasoned/dressed and flavors were all well-balanced and harmonious.  Probably one of the best experiences for this style of food.   I LOVE cacik and their rendition was quite good.  We also had the calf liver and a few other standard meze. The donner kebab wasn't as intricately spiced as some of the better ones I had but it was still very good.  The chicken was also quite good.   I have to agree with other reviewers that the rice pilaf they include was top-notch.   The desserts... all of them were good.  One of the few places where they got the baklava right!  Not too sweet, plenty of pistachio flavor. Nevermind the strange name, they've got good food in a good lively atmosphere and good service at a good reasonable price.  I want to rename it Beyogood.
