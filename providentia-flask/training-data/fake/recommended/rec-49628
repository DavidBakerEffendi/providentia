Having been on my list for years now, I'm glad that I finally made it last night. The ambiance is a bit sterile but the waitstaff was sweet and attentive. Despite the B Rating posted in the window, the Som Tum --  [Green Papaya Salad] was good. It had an authentic level of Thai Chile spice to it and I love the fact that they offer a vegetarian option. In fact, they have and entire menu designated for vegetarians! (...and they seemed to be conscientious of other They were out I the Khanom Krok --  [Coconut Custard Dessert] which was my primary motivation for going. Next time, I'll have to go earlier in the day before they sell out.
