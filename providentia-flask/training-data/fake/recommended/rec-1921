There are sooo many Halal carts in NY, but ths is the most legit cart of all. Being from LA, I'm used to taco trucks. I'm glad that NY has its own unique late-night post-drinking food. Â I wasn't in NY for very long, but I came here 3 nights in a row. The line is pretty long, but it progresses pretty quickly and definitely worth it! Order the chicken+lamb combination and use a lot of white sauce and some hot sauce. I mistakenly thought, "how hot could the hot sauce be? It can't be that hot" I was sweating bullets and I woke up with my stomach burning/hot. I have a good tolerance to spicy and I got owned.... So please people, learn from my mistake.
