I love their burgers!  I usually go for the Monday $5 burger special.  I order the Deck Burger without the mushrooms, onions and tomatoes (not a fan of them), medium.  It always comes out as ordered with a huge side of fries.  The fries are always hot and I always have to get a doggie-bag for half the burger.   My favorite order on other nights is the Toasted Ham & Cheese...always piled high with ham and a generous portion of hot fries. The host, wait staff and bartenders are always pleasant and friendly.  When I let my server know I'm in a hurry, they always bring my food out pretty fast. The only thing I wish they'd do is offer the $5 burger special on other nights as well.  I'd definitely be there a lot more. Whenever I've been there, the many TVs always have some sports event airing and the staff is usually willing to change a TV to a different channel (sports, or course) upon request...especially if you're in a less crowded area of the restaurant. The bar area is to the right and the seating area is to the left.  While the pub is in a good location geographically, the parking situation leaves something to be desired.  Fortunately, I don't have to worry about parking. It's definitely on my list of favorite places.
