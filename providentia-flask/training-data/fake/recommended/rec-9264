Blue Ribbon is a great place to grab a dinner in NYC.   They have great fresh seafood, oysters, lobster etc.  A nice variety of menu items, with flawless execution on most dishes.   The staff is awesome, definetly into food and restaurants.  Lacks most of the snobbyness found in lots of NYC restaurants.
