Stopped by here for lunch and must have hit a non-busy day, since we got a seat right away.  First time here, so went with the traditional with cheese.  I will say that the large is....large!  It was a pretty good pie.  The crust was the best part.  Love the thin crust with a nice crust on the bottom.  It has way too much tomato sauce for my liking and it needed salt in a big way.  Was way to bland for me.  Also wanted more cheese.  Also would have liked a bit more selection of toppings. Overall a good pizza and probably would come back and give it another try.
