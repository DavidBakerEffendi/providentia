When people talk about food in NYC, they talk about gourmet restaurants, and New York style pizza. The opportunity to eat at "the original" pizzeria was just too good to pass up. Â I don't know if it truly is "the original", but it sure made a tasty pie! If you're planning a visit, expect to wait for a few minutes to get a table. The rest of the city seems to know the real deal when they see it so they come out in droves to get some (plus there's all the tourists). The tables are pretty much on top of one another with the way they space people apart, but it works because you don't really talk much once you start eating. I'm not going to try and embellish upon what Lombardi's does well; it's simply pizza, but it's a damp good pizza. The crust is crispy and not too thick, while the cheese and toppings are nicely spaced on top of the pizza. Two main things I noticed throughout the meal: 1. The taste of fresh basil is prominent with each bite, 2. No grease! I attribute the latter to REAL ingredients that aren't laden with fat and oils. It tastes fresh and delicious, just like a pizzeria with such a high reputation should serve.
