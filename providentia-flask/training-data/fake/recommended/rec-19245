I still really want to like this place... I hope we just caught them on a bad night...We were in town for the  Collegiate Rugby Championship- CRC  and Can you believe a bar turning down a rugby family willing to drink the local brews on tap???? Although this place has a great atmosphere with lots of people enjoying the vast beer selection on the patio (which is what drew us in)... its a tad out if the main stream in a part of town that people told me was a bit seedy which the best kinda place to sample the local flavor of a new city (in my opinion)... However the bar tender was extremely rude and very un accommodating and Honestly we felt a bit discriminated against. . For one if my first places I visited my first time to Philly, thankfully it was the exception to this great town. With the many beers on tap during this BEER WEEK the bartender refused to accommodate  us with a beer flight or samples we were willing to pay for... My dad & I (serious beer drinkers) always willing to try local brews wanted to sample the local brews but were not familiar with the local and eclectic brews available... I was really hoping for a better experience... Please let me know if you visit this place and I just caught them on an off night ;which does happen) Cheers
