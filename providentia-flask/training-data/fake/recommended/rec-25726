This place is an absolute gem for a myriad of reasons. So much so that after dining at Kefi my first time, I went back less than a week later with a new friend. First, you will not find many better 'bang-4-a-buck' places in the city. I believe the most expensive entree (including specials) is $22. More than enough food for two people and a bottle (+1 glass) of their medium quality wine (which was divine) came to $100. Second, the food is absolutely out of this world and the service was TOP NOTCH. Our bartender/server helped maximize our experience by educating us about Greek food and wine while leading our culinary exploration through the menu. Listen - if you have a first date and you know he / she is food explorative, you can't lose here. (Just make a reservation if you plan on going after 7pm - this place gets bumpin') Kefi will be my 'Go To' spot for dinner on the UWS.
