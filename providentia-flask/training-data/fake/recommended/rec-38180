Who can go wrong with a place that encompasses all that is bacon? We went there last Saturday and got there at 6. Just 2 of us and there was no wait. I started off with the "Bloody Piggy" which was basically an average Bloody Mary with a slice of bacon in it. Wasn't a bad Bloody Mary but nothing special besides the bacon. For the next round(s) of drinks my husband and I ordered their bourbon and whiskey cocktails which were really great! We started with the bacon tasting. Didn't realize that 1 tasting would come with 2 slices of each different bacon so we ordered 2 tastings which was way too much. But it's bacon so we ate it, duh. Then we each got the grilled cheese that was on the specials board which was fantastic! We usually get 2 different entrees and share but the grilled cheese just sounded so good. We also got the tater tots with bacon salt. They taste just like regular old tater tots to me... Not that there's anything wrong with that... Also, no pop music like some people mentioned in other reviews... oldies and classic rock which I enjoyed. I love the concept, and the prices are reasonable. Oh and duh, great service too. Will definitely be back!
