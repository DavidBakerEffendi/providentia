Went there for brunch today with four other girlfriends.  Had been there three years ago for lunch and remembered it being good but if I'd remembered it being this good I would've gone back much sooner!  The food was fabulous!  We had pretty basic brunch fare, steak and eggs and two eggs breakfast platters but the food was impeccably made, everyone enjoyed their food.  ..clean plates all around the table.  The service was great, not surprising for Brooklyn but worth mentioning for those used to Manhattan attitudes.  The entire wait staff was extremely attentive, even showing up with a cloth a minute after my friend spilled some water from her tea pot.  Overall, a wonderful brunch experience and I will be back very soon to try their lunch/dinner.
