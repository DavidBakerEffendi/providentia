YUMMY! Appetizers (rock shrimp salad and cauliflower soup) were amazing + entrees (hanger steak and game hen).  The infusion of flavors and fresh herbs in the entrees were amazing!! The cocktail-9 Jones-was very light and refreshing-highly recommend it.  We will definitely be frequent visitors to this establishment!!
