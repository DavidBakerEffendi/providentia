I don't know what it is about France that gets liberal pinko East Coast snobs so wet, but this place was doing its damndest to out-French the competition.  It was tiny, packed, and decorated in a way that was pointedly Parisian, if that Parisian had been drunk and homesick.   There were baguettes and nutella fucking everywhere, those faded little maps of Nice and Provence tucked into dusty bookcases, and the walls were adorned with posters of schoolgirls riding bikes and twirling their mustaches I remember from my high school French classroom. We got the crepe orientale and omelette epinard.  The crepe orientale was tasty, but the spinach omelette was underseasoned.  Neither was very filling.  Cash only, which wasn't frustrating at all (it was).  Also, I totally got judged by the French waiter for asking for ketchup.  These tastebuds are American, goddammit.  How am I supposed to know that it's breakfast if it doesn't have ketchup on it? P.S. They don't have ketchup.
