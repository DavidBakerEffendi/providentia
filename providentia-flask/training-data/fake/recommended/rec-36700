Like many, I use to be a huge fan of John's on Bleecker, a place where i partook of many pizza pies with my family. It was the place to go when having just a slice wouldn't do. But then i discovered Lombardi's, and John's has never been the same to me since. As it turns out, when it comes to sharing a pie, i like to go old school... and Lombardi's has so much history you can taste it. The pizza is thin and delicate and reminiscent of an older NY. A small pie is good for 2 people, but get a medium if you're hungry and not planning on having an appetizer. The rest of the menu is good too, but i admittedly have only ordered a thing a two to keep my table busy, and while good, nothing is particularly memorable. If you're hungry and not up for a wait, the best time to go to Lombardi's is on a weeknight, because the weekends always have lines. You can also call ahead and find out what the wait is like. The staff is friendly despite being hugely busy and pulled in all directions.
