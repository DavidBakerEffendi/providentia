Daniel O. is right.  Scannicchio's focuses on traditional Italian food, and they do an excellent job.  If you're looking for trendy food, skip this place and head to Old City. I went here about a year ago for my birthday, and would eat here everyday if possible.  My lamb chop and broccoli rabe was amazing.  My boyfriend stuck with pasta and loved his as well. Overall, this place is terrific.  The waitress was sweet, and everyone was welcoming.
