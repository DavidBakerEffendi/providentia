This is my first time going to a ramen restaurant and it set the bar very high. My favorite thing was the pork buns, so much so that we ordered a second round. I loved the ramen and added an egg to my dish. It really filled me up and had so many great flavors! I was surprised at how rich he dishes were. They have a Brooklyn ale that was created to pair with the ramen. My husband loved the ale but I found it was too much like a Belgian style beer for my tastes. However it did pair well with the ramen and since you can't get the beer anywhere else it is worth the try. The only downside to this place is the hour and a half wait but you can give them your phone number if you want to walk around. We hung out at the bar and ordered a beer and sat on the railing.
