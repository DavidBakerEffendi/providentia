Love the space. Great, airy, Â casual and friendly. Most importantly, the food is fantastic. The salads are so fresh, dressed just right and full of flavor. The tagliolini with speck and mushrooms plus truffle oil is to die for. For reals. Love the meatballs at DM, too! The mussels are wonderful also! Their pizzas are outstanding and most definitely the best in the hood. Hands down. Fra diavola for when you want one with tomato sauce, Da Mikele for when you want no tomato sauce. Both are my top picks. Their sangria is amazing but since it's made fresh, it's not always available. Make sure to ask if they have any - you won't regret it. The bartenders make perfect martinis if you're like me and need an extra extra extra dry one after work. Since everyone working there is Italian and very proud of it, the true Italian tradition of appertivo is what attracts me the most during happy hour. Spreads of food up for grabs with a drink purchase - not only clever but makes me feel like I'm in Italy. So... thank you! :)
