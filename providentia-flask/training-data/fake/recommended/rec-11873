A nice place which is supporting NY local farms, albeit its space is just too packed for being not too intimate with the adjacent dinners. Food was fresh and nicely prepared. I was having the special menu of the night - spring mix salad with artichoke and blue cheese (I could not recall what kind of cheese it is exactly). The market fish was perfectly pan-fried with green beans, radish, cipollini onions, anchovy butter, carrot reduction - simply fresh and excellent - enjoying every bite of it. The wine list was small but enough selection of wine-by-the glass.
