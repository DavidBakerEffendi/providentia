I'm so happy I found this place. It's great for a delicious and affordable dinner. The hummus was to-die-for and the grape leaves were very tasty. I also tried to eggplant special, which was so-so. I would go back in a heartbeat to try the falafel. There was a lot of seating - outside, downstairs, upstairs, two small bars. The place was hopping by 7 p.m. and I didn't want to leave.
