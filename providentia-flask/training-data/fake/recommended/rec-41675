This place is the best. The food is amazing. Try the deluxe scallion pancakes, and USE THE SAUCE. The drumstick or chicken nuggets are both perfect. The entrees are hit and miss, but the hits hit so freaking well. And the misses are generally fine. The service is excellent. They're very friendly and helpful. You'll never have to ask for water. It's reasonably priced, and they even deliver. This is my favorite place in the area, and I'd recommend it to everyone, vegan, veg or omnivores.
