I feel like I am hating on a lot of new places we have been trying. Let me preface this review by saying my husband and I went here on Valentine's Day and it was PACKED. We arrived at 6:15 and waited for about 5 minutes to be acknowledged by a server once the maitre d' sat us. Our server was very nice and told us about the specials. We waited a bit to order. Then we ordered. Bread came out, which consisted of three pieces of foccacia and olive oil. It was delicious - I wish there had been more! Appetizers were amazing: fried polenta, octopus and a half portion of the foie gras ravioli. I am not a fan of foie gras and I loved them! My favorite was the fried polenta, although the citrus kick of the octopus appetizer was delicious. Our entrees took a long, long time to come out. My husband ordered the flat iron steak and I had the pork chop. Both were delicious, it just took so long. I am not sure if this can be attributed to a more leisurely meal for Valentine's Day? We stacked up our plates and the maitre d' was the one to clear them. We saw her do this a lot, which made me feel bad for her. We ordered dessert, sorbet for me and espresso cake for my husband, which took another 10-15 minutes. The thing is, the food was really good. I think I need to give it another chance on a non-holiday to provide an accurate review! Now I feel bad.
