This place was highly recommended by our hotel - I think he was sending everyone here, but like most of Philly, it was overpriced, and the food was OKAY - not that great.  I don't know... I think we would have fared better heading to the Reading terminal and eating a la carte for cheaper.  Anyway, it's okay.
