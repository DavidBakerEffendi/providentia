Great location - decent service - terrible food!  We returned after 5 years and discovered that this restaurant is no longer worthy of our patronage nor yours - trust me!  The fish was far from fresh (tasteless/bland and smelled fishy - a sign of the clear lack of freshness), the scallops were absolutely horrible, and the whole belly clams nearly made me sick upon first bite.  I am a seafood lover and almost always order the fried fisherman's platter; that was a huge mistake here and we were so disappointed by the poor quality of the food.  My wife ordered a simple shrimp and pasta dish, which she despised, and she rarely complains about her food.  The kids meals were merely OK, but that can't make up for our $85 dollar mistake by the lake!
