Just had a bbq chicken sandwich which was pretty tasty.. I did enjoy the sandwich however I am not certain I would get the whole chicken. Though the reviews have been really solid, when the price for a chicken is 50% higher than DiBruno's you know its high..$25 plus tax for a chicken and two sides is a little too much in my opinion..Lower the prices and I will be a return customer for sure
