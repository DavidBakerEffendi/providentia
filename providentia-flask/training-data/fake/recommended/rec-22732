Went for Taste of Hartford Menu. Can't go wrong with this place. Food is always good, portions are always just right to large, and everyone in our dinner party of 8 raved over their food. I got to taste the pork tenderloins (yummy), the flank steak (OMG), the mahi mahi (just right) and I ordered the Murray chicken which was delicious. They have a good wine list...and we tried three great reds: Pinot Noir, Cotes de Rhones and a Cabernet Savignon. Our server, Rafael, was perfect. He even decanted our wine for us. Excellent experience. The nice blond lady who checked in our table was a nice touch. It's good when someone who manages the place makes sure everything is running smoothly.
