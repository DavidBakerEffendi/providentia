Stopped here for lunch when simon pearce was packed and we were starving.  Came in with decent expectations given the yelp reviews.  Unfortunately, what we found was a mediocre pizza joint with pizza that lacked flavor, was too chewy, and overall just not up to snuff.  Add to it that the table were not clean and it was definitely a disappointing lunch.
