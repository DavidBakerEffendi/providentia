Well, it's Cheesesteak boys and girls.  I've had a bunch of cheesesteak all over philly, and my personal preference is Pat's.  I've tried it a couple of different ways, and "wid whiz" is just the way to go.  I am a hot pepper maniac, and I can only take a couple of their peppers.  If you like your subs so crunchy you're cutting up the inside of your mouth, this isn't the place for you.  If you can't tell the different between Steakums and real philly cheesesteak, this place isn't for you.  If you want a whole lot of patience and courtesy during the lunchtime rush, this place isn't for you.  I haven't tried the place across the street, but I've hit up Pat's a bunch of times, I think I may have to try the competition for science's sake.
