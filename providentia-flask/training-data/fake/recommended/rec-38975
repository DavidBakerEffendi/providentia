Amazing food! You can't go wrong! The service is exceptional, the price could not be better. This is one of the best restaurants in Queens. MUST ORDER: BBQ wraps!! Team Salt & Fat: The deserts ought to improve and you would do well with new tables and chairs. Also the pork buns have a bit too much bun! But thank you for the refreshingly great food!
