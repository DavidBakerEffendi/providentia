I have been here too many times to count and each time I leave, I am stuffed and satisfied! Perks- The cozy/ romantic atmosphere, great service, GREAT food, good prices (I think wednesdays are 1/2 off pasta- dont quote me on that though!), easy parking, full bar, sometimes live music (one man show) - what else can you ask for? They also have a little room with one table (for 7/8 ppl) which is nice if you have a bigger group and want a little privacy! Downfalls- honestly, I cant think of any off the top of my head. It is next to Bliss (a club) so perhaps the parking lot fills up on the weekend? It's only a guess Should try this place at least once- you'll be a fan!
