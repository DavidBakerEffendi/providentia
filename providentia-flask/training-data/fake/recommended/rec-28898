My wife and I went here today and were left disappointed. We ordered two shakes and two lazy breakfasts, which come with two sides of our choice. First dodgy sign was that they could not offer poached eggs! How hard is that to do? When the food arrived I did not get either of my chosen sides and the home fries on both plates were cold, so we sent them back and Â eventually received two fresh plates of food. The food itself was not good - my wife's scrambled eggs were dry and tasted nasty. Then when the bill arrived we found they had charged us for one of the sides I should have got with the breakfast, which the manager argued about! She didn't seem to know facts about items on her own menu! All in all very poor service and average food, we both advise you to avoid!
