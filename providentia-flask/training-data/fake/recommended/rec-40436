Shame on this place...ordered hot antipasto dry, over cooked and tasteless .... Eggplant rollentine without ricotta cheese breaded clams ewwww green mussels tasted like the ocean burnt dry stuffed mushrooms ...baked ziti was water from pasta not drained, Ziti topped with sauce and melted mozz again no ricotta cheese never in my life ever had baked ziti that way....it really was Ziti Parm... And no dinner salad??????? I'll never go back
