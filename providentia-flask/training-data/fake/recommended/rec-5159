Didn't realize they do brunch 'til today...  What a solid all around restaurant.  Homey atmosphere.   Did their prix fixe brunch which gave choice between coffee or tea and mimosa or sangria with brunch entree.  It was four of us so we shared 4 main items and a side: Pupusas - 2 little pockets of beans n' cheese with a refreshing purple cabbage slaw on top.   Short rib & eggs - Got the eggs poached and made for a hearty hangover-killing brunch Benedict thing - this was a spicy mix of black beans and chili hollandaise with poached eggs on some baguette type of bread.  Maybe the best thing to hit the table next to the maduros Fish & cracked corn - their fish today was bluefish cooked with crispy skin left on. very fresh n' tasty. cracked corn was basically full kernels of corn that had an interesting consistency. almost like if grits weren't ground?  good dish all and all Maduro was probably the highlight.  It was a plaintain that had been roasted and was still left in its peel.  Really buttery, sweet and served with some crema that made it a great sweet accompaniment to all the savory we had on the table - A DEFINITE MUST FOR ANY RETURN VISIT So all and all, I knew this was a go-to dinner spot for the neighborhood but now we've got a great brunch place with interesting options and no wait whatsoever.  Definitely recommended.
