Ok, so let's figure out the facts here. The place is all of $10 with the buffet and a drink. People who are complaining about quality of food are just silly. If you want quality food, don't come to a buffet. This isn't Vegas where they actually care about buffets and what they put out - it's Hamden. Secondly, the staff barely speaks a lick of English which is actually encouraging because it means that they aren't Americanized. The food was perfectly acceptable but it certainly wasn't anything close to the good sushi and other Asian eateries in the area. (i.e. Hokkaido, Toro, etc.) Again, you're paying $10 for all you can eat. The place is cleaner than many other buffets I've seen in CT. It's not pristine, but it's not too far from. Some of their booths need some help - they're rickety, have holes, or just flat out decompress to about 2 inches when you sit on them. It's startling, but not a deal breaker - you can always default to a table as well. If you're looking just for a quick lunch with some variety and don't feel like having to think too much about anything, visit Pacific. It's not as awful as all these other people suggest if you just keep in mind you aren't getting first class food. If you're looking for something to write home about - my advice - don't look to a buffet.
