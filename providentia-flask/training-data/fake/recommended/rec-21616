I absolutely love this little place! Â The owners are super sweet, this place is named after the owner's wife, Almaz! Get the veggie combo because you get a sample of their very best! The Kitfo (steak tar tar) was amazing too. This is the best Ethiopian in the city, otherwise you have to go out to West Philly and I don't like going way out to those neighborhoods...eeek.
