First off, Erin's right, it's dark. White walls and white furniture don't brighten up a room when the only lights on are the red glow coming from the bar... which by the way made me feel dirty. Why, you ask? This is what I imagine a bordello to look like. The ground floor bar/lounge area is nice, perhaps intimate is the right word for the bar itself. No, I'm just going to say it, it's small. However, the guac with plantain chips are amazing. Black truffles make anything decadent. We didn't really try anything else, just there for some drinks and conversation. I would recommend this place if you have the wallet, and the patience to find the bathroom through the labyritine staircases.
