I felt compelled to write this review while I still have the fresh taste of disappointment in my mouth.  Above came recommended, oh yes.  The ironic part is that not a single person who recommended it actually ate here.  It was always "I hear Above is great!" "They say Above is terrific!" - well, thanks Phantom friends for bupkis.  For $30, I expect a ribeye that is slightly "above" the Trader Joe cut I cook on my grill at home.  It's my favorite cut - if the first one I ever had was from here, I'd never have wanted it again.  Bland, overly-gristly (for what is admittedly supposed to be a fatty cut, but damn), and sad.  Sorry you had to die for that, cow.  My wife's $26 scallops - tiny, rubbery, 6 floating depressed in a modest sea of "meh" risotto.  Plating - meh.  Service - the bread and water servers were sweet and attentive.  Our waiter was Penn Jillette's long-lost brother and was fine.  Our food server pretty much threw our plates at us, which considering what was on them I understand his need to distance himself quickly.  Total bill for 2 with tip - $135.  Why 2 stars?  Our appetizer of wings had some terrific BBQ sauce - and our desert (bread pudding) was great.  No, seriously - it was the saving grace of our meal.  I almost hoisted it above my head Lion-King-style to make myself feel better about what we spent on the meal.  It would have been like dinner and a show.  Our waiter:  "Hope to see you again".  Sure, downstairs in the market, Penn.  The magic is all in the market.
