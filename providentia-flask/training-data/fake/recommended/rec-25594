Solid grade for fast service and attentive staff.  Unfortunately, the bagels are sub-par.  Was that yesterday's bagels? ...becuase they were seriously hard bagels. If you're looking for bagels go to Sammy's where the bagels are great.  Brook Streetmis a deli...better for egg sandwiches in the A.M. which i ordered earlier this week and was pleased with... or maybe got to pick up a lunch sandwich, though I have not tried lunch sandwiches there.  Bottom line is...nice guys who work fast and, unfortunately, have poor bagels. Not a problem for me but FY, no credit cards.
