I love this place. It's my go-to neighborhood restaurant/bar. Drinks are the best in the hood - the bartender is terrific and the custom cocktails are all top-notch. I often come here to eat because the cocktails are so dependably great. The service is also terrific and I have never had a bad experience getting food/drinks on time. Every friend whom I have taken here when visiting me wants to return. I love the menu, particularly the smoked trout salad, the pate and the mussels. The brunch menu has tons of options for someone like me who doesn't like to eat eggs that much - a lot of variety. I will say that I have had a couple of not-great experiences with the food (usually during the week - not on the weekend). Once the potatoes in the trout salad weren't cooked enough, once my mussels came a little too cold and one time I ordered a special but had to send it back because it was overly seasoned (salt must have been added twice or something). Again, anytime I have had a problem, the staff addressed it quickly and professionally. I expect to be coming back here for years.
