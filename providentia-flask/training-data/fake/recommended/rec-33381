Food is always great and very consistent.  Interesting wine list and wines by the glass.  I have spoted many celebrities there, despite the fact that the restaurant has been around for many, many years...  The zucchini appetizer has been on the menu forever and I have it everytime. The only downer is the service, sometimes great, sometimes really bad.  Last night the bartender was plain rude and uninterested.  Some other times really engaging and fun. Despite service inconsistencies, a place I go back on a regular basis, and a must for anyone coming to Manthattan for first time.
