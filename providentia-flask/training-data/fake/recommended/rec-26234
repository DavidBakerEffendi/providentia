Based on the good review, I decided to give them a try since I was a tofu lover. Their side dish were delicious, the kimchi was very authentic. They did give a piece of whole fish to start. We order lunch combo meal, and the portion was so big, not even like lunch. All combo came with a small tofu soup with meat as well. I was amazed by their steam white rice in hot stone pot. Good was great, the service was not attentive. I needed to ask every time when I needed refill my drinks.
