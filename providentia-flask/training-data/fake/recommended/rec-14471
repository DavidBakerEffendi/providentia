The pizza was perfect - exactly what I wanted after a day of walking. The slices are a good size and run about $3 each (my memory isn't exact). For a slice of cheese, a slice of pesto ricotta olive, and a fountain root beer, I ended up paying like $8. The cheese pizza was pretty greasy, but what good slice of pizza isn't? As a bonus, the guy behind the counter was super friendly and when I walked in around 7 on a Friday night, there were plenty of places to sit. It was nice to sit on a stool near the open shop front and watch people go in and out of the cute bars and shops in the neighborhood. It did get crowded by the time I left, but even then the wait for a slice didn't seem to be very long.
