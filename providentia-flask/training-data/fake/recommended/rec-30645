This place resembles a pizza place we ate at in Florence Italy last spring, so points for the memories!  AND, the pizzas we ordered were fantastic!  In Italy, we'd order one per person and each eat a quarter pie, rotating them around the table (4 of us), plus each got an insalata misto.  It was just my husband & me at Tavola on a recent Sunday evening, so we ordered two - viddana, and formaggi - after asking the server how large they are.  Turned out, a bit larger than in Italy - one pie would not have been enough for 2 people, but 2 pies were too much, so I had 3 slices left for lunches during the week, YUM!  Each pie comes in 6 slices. I had the stracciatelle soup - absolutely delicious!  And my husband ordered, what else?!, the mixed greens salad, and that also was like tasting Italy. I ordered a decaf cappuccino for dessert (I'm not so sure it was decaf because I was wide awake most of the night) but I was not pleased with the amount of foam (barely any!) on top.  So that was my own fault, because after a trip through Italy, I'd sworn to not order cappuccino after 10:30 am, like a real Italian (it's a breakfast drink over there). SO - the server was a good-looking young man (but not a kid, maybe in his 30s) and friendly, and not upset when we didn't order any alcoholic beverages. I'd call this, now, our go-to Italian place!
