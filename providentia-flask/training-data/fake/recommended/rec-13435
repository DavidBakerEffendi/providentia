Went with three friends, waited FOREVER. After trying to stick it out for over an hour and half, our grumbling tummies told us to peace out. We checked in and still had 45 min more to wait, I asked if they have take out. OF COURSE they do. Order take out = 10 minutes! 10 minutes! Someone should have given us that memo. We put in our order and took our food over to whole foods, bought drinks and sat upstairs. We don't know if that was good etiquette, but we were starving. Perhaps that's why the food was super delicious. We had pancakes and the spanish breakfast -- definitely a delicious combo. Definitely go! And if you don't want to wait or if it's a gorgeous day for an impromptu picnic or if you want to adventure into whole foods...order to go and get your grub on.
