We had our first meal here, post-movie on Christmas Day. The setting is absolutely gorgeous! We made reservations weeks in advance and arrived exactly on time. We got seated, but were given a table in direct line of the doorway. Every time the door opened we were blasted with cold air. Our server was far less than attentive. I'd say he was completely disinterested. We ordered drinks and food, which were served by others. This is ok and even normal in good restaurants. The food was good. Our issue was that our server never came to our table to check on anything at all the whole time we were there. In fact, while we sat there watching our server walk up and down his service area, we tried to flag him down to order another drink with no success. The table next to us had the same problem. We ended up finishing the meal without drinks, waited another 30 minutes to get our server to bring our check and had to flag down another employee to take our payment.
