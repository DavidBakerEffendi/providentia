If you like a good Jewish deli - Schlesinger's is the place in Center City. I'll never understand the whiners who post on Yelp expecting to be spoon-fed and coddled to their every whim like Momma has apparently done for them, and then upon the slightest reason post nonsensical and unworthy opinions on this site. Schlesingers is the bomb.   Their food is great quality, being exactly what its supposed to be - big, hearty, tasty, and served in a reasonable amount of time.  Its not discount food -  but I don't think our 2 sandwhiches (a turkey burger/fries and a Pastrami on rye with sour kraut)  were overly priced with drinks for a total of $23.00. If you want to spend $3.00 for lunch and be amazed  - go home to your mom. If you want really good Jewish deli in a pleasant atmosphere, try this place out.
