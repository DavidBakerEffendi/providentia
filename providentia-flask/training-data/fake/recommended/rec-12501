This is one of the best, if not THE best, breakfast spots in NYC. We went twice while on vacation in the city, after we were so impressed the first time. The southern breakfast was really good, the cheese grits were perfection. The chicken and waffles were also amazing, the syrup is something serious! After ordering these as our meals, my boyfriend insisted on also ordering an order of the blueberry pancakes after seeing them. Needless to say, everything was incredibly delicious and our waitress made sure that we had everything we wanted before the kitchen closed, it was nice of her to make sure.
