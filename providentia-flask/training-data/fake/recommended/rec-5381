I've been eating here for the last few years but never thought to review it. This is a really fantastic place to eat. I've had breakfast, lunch, and dinner here. All really great. I just recently tried the veggie wings and they were the best I've had yet! I highly suggest trying them if you like wings! They don't use real thick seitan so it gets nice and crispy. I've noticed other places make them a little to thick trying to replicate the shape of wings. My only complaint and that all the food taste pretty salty but hey, it's Mexican!
