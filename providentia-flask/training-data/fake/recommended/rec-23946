I'm giving this a high review because of price & proximity. I love not having to go into Center City for sushi! The rolls on the 3-for-$10 are tiny unless you get handrolls -- it feels like you get more fish. The specialty rolls are great & priced just right. If given the choice between Terryin & Vic's, I'll pick sitting comfortably at a table rather than waiting 20 minutes for a barstool any day.
