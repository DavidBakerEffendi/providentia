Review for RW Summer 2012 The hubby and I dined here tonight. We got to sit outside and enjoyed the beautiful weather and view. Ambiance was perfect. Next, our server, Michael was really great and made our dinner just that much better. Â We started with warm fresh bread, which wasn't anything special, but was good. For our starter we tried the grilled calamari and the oxtail pasta. Hands down the pasta was the winner. The pasta had a nice kick to it. The pasta may have been a little undercooked, but the flavor/sauce was really good so we didn't care. The calamari was nice and light. The greens (the restaurant grows their own produce) were really fresh. For our mains, we had the pork chop and duck. I remember really liking the pork chop the first time I dined here and I liked it even better this time around. Not only juicy, but the peaches and collard greens were perfect with it. The hubby got the duck b/c our server recommended it and he said it was really good, but liked my pork chop better. For dessert, we tried three, the beignets, the panna cotta and the peaches and cream. I've previously tried the beignets and was disappointed, but not this time. They were light and fluffy and went well with the homemade berry preserve/compote. The peaches and cream was good as the peaches were fresh, but I didn't find them that special. The panna cotta on the other was really good and was really good my first time here. Yes, it's on the smaller side, but by the time you are on this course, you might just want a little something. This is a great place to dine even if it's not RW, but coming during RW makes it that much better!
