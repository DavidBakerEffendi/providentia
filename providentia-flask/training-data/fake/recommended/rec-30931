Please order the following: Fried Green Tomatoes Shrimp Appetizer Shrimp and Grits Sweet Tea The restaurant had some really good rice bowls on the original menu, which I believe are now on the sister menu at Peaches.  I have yet to try the fried chicken but will on my next visit.  The 'Likker' menu is tasty and creative.   Enjoy
