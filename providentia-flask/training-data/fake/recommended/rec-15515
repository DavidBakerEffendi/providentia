Very disappointing! We went here because of the over 900 reviews for my bday but when we got there it looked like a recently expanded old tavern. The back of the restaurant looked much better than the front. The dinner choices were limited and skimpy. The waitress recommended the rib dinner. It was awful. It tasted like campbells beef stew! My date ordered the salmon. It looked delicious but it also lacked flavor. I hoped that the dessert would salvage the night but the choices were very unappealing. The service was ok except for towards the end of the evening when our waitress dissapeared for almost half an hour. One good thing was the location. We found a parking spot directly in front of the restaurant.
