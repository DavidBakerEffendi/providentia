An hour wait, but worth it, at least the first time. This is a tasty piece of pizza. The mozzarella cheese compliments the chewy dough and the amazing tomato sauce. Brooklyn made sodas available too. The atmosphere is low key and has a family atmosphere. Warning, there are a lot of tourists that go here.
