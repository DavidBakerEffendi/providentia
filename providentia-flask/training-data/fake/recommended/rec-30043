The food and decor are great.  Had both the Pad Thai and Pad Woon Sen dishes here and really liked them.  Was not a fan of the mango rice dessert but that's just me.  Everything else I had (soup, appetizer) was really tasty.  Their website has some beautiful photos of the decor...it's cutting edge!
