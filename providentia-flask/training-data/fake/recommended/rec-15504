A friend of mine recommended I try almonds brunch So I decided to go over the weekend with a few of my friends. Didn't have a reservation, but the host (who was extremely friendly) got us seated very quickly. Almond has a very upbeat and fun atmosphere and loved how the rotating doors in the front were open to give it a Â very welcoming feel. As we were seated we were immediately greeted by our server Brad. He got us started with some delicious fun mimosas. They have 4 different types including the classic version. We were also served complimentary biscuits with apple butter. I could have just had a plate of those and been completely satisfied. I ended up ordering the almond hash, which i was told is there signature brunch dish. I was not disappointed one bit. The combination of duck confit, potatoes, onions formed into an almost pancake style dish with two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce on it was just an amazing experience. My entire party enjoyed there time at almond and I'll be back to check out dinner.
