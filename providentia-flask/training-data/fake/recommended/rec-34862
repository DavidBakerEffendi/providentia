Wow...consistenly tasty and fantastic food!  I had the opportunity to sample a lamb dish at Harvest in the Square.  i collected a business card and just had to see if they were just as good in person.  I wasn't disappointed!   Well furnished...minimalistic, clean lines, love all the mirrors and glass...very comfortable atmosphere.  I was there for a work lunch and would definitely go back at night for dinner and drinks. For lunch they have 2 pre-fixe options...sandwich or salad with one side for $16 or sandwich or salad with 2 sides and a dessert for $24.  I ended up getting the lamb shank sandwich with fried eggplant...fantasic!!!  For sides, I ordered the hummus and babaganoush...light and tasty pita bread...and for dessert...the "Candy bar"...chocolate, caramel, ganache, crushed pistacios....wonderful!  And perfect when paired with a cappucino! I was impressed with this dining experience and would definitely recommend it to others!
