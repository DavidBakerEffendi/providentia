This place is surprisingly small. Not in a bad way though, it's cozy - but it almost feels a little too cramped, like I didn't have elbow room. And that's saying a lot, considering that is completely empty around 5:30 p.m. on a Thursday night (granted, they had probably just opened). There are some happy hour drink and app specials. The flatbread is discounted $1 off and is good but be warned that it's probably not what you'd expect. It's more like warm pita bread served with a side of bruschetta, but seasoned to taste like pizza. The squash dumplings were everything everyone said they would be. They taste more like ravioli than dumplings, but OMG that truffle sauce... I was scraping the plate. Tuna is the only raw fish I'll eat, which makes me that much pickier about it, but the tartare here was pretty damn delicious. Flavorful, not fishy and the chips they were served with were addictive. There are 2 $5 cocktails to choose from, and while I'm totally a whiskey girl, I actually preferred the gin-based Hessian Tea over the bourbon-y Winter Bramble. The prices could have been a little less expensive, though I do have to say that it was worth what we paid. Nice spot to check out before a show at Irving Plaza, which is right around the corner.
