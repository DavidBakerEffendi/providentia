This review is based on a delivery experience. Pretty good price on the vegetarian thali ($16.95) and mango lassi. The "chef's choice" entrees turned out to be navratan korma and baigan bartha, along with lentil dal. All the dishes were very tasty. They provided nice papadums and good tamarind and green chutneys. The portion size was fantastic. With a little extra rice, it would have been a feast for two. The lassi was a reasonable single portion. The dishes were nicely spiced and flavorful, but not chili-hot at all. That was fine with me. If you want hot and spicy, I guess you need to ask. The naan was only OK, but that may have been because it was wrapped in foil for delivery. If I'd had a toaster oven to re-crisp it, I'm sure it would have been fine. Why four stars? The promised raita was missing, and more importantly, so was the napkins/dinnerware I'd expected. Since the delivery was going to a _hotel_room_, it was a pretty safe bet that I would need those. Maybe they were going for an authentic Indian experience? You could make a banana leaf out of foil and eat with your fingers. Anyway, great dinner at a fair price. I would definitely order from Zaroka again if I were back in town.
