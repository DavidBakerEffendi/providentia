I like the food at LaFourno.  It's tasty and reasonably priced. But the service just kinda creeped my out.  Yeah, we went pretty late, so we were some of the last people in the restaurant.  But I just want to enjoy a nice quiet dinner with my girlfriend.  You don't have to keep checking on us every five minutes. So it's probably a good place to go with friends, especially if its busy.  Me, I think I'm gonna look a little harder for a quiet dinner spot on South Street next time.
