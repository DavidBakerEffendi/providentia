Went here for brunch last week and was impressed at every level.  1) We got a table right away, at noon on a Saturday, even though the place was really busy.  2) They sat us in the beautiful back area where there was a lot of light and greenery and a gorgeous ambiance in general.  3) The waitstaff was attentive but not overly so--really perfect service.  4) AMAZING FOOD (maybe that should have been #1?).  I had the frittata and it was sooo delicious I wish I had it in front of me right now so I could eat it again.  The toast was so good my table ate pretty much all of it.  If you are in the area, hit this place up.  It's awesome.
