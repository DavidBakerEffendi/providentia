This was a terrible experience. I placed an order for delivery and was quoted a 20 minute wait time, my food showed up an hour and fifteen minutes later, cold, and partly missing. I called the restaurant to complain and the woman who answered the phone was rude and combative before the first sentence left my mouth. I would have settled for a re-delivery, even though I was pissed, but instead demanded a refund. She said "I can't deal with this," before passing the phone to a guy who told me to call Seamless, which is the service I placed the order through. In short, the food was terrible, but the customer service was even worse. Avoid at all costs.
