I loved this tiny little Filipino restaurant and I'm really glad my Yelp phone app led me to it! I had the Adobo Pork with Garlic Rice and it was spectacular! The pork was so tender and delicious, it went perfectly with the garlic rice. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! As a vacationer on a budget, it was pretty pricey for a lunch meal. We spent over $40 on lunch for two with a drink each. I had a bit of my boyfriend's pancit, definitely not as good as my dish - I'm used to the way his mother makes pancit. You can't ask for more from the awesome service - our server was super friendly and really informative. He was enthusiastic about every dish!
