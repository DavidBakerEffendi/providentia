love love love this place!  My husband and I go out to breakfast on sat and sundays and we love this place.  We have been trying out different places around philly and this is the top of the top!!  They always have specials but their regular menu has a lot to offer too.  Just get there by 930-10am on the weekend otherwise you will have to wait.
