Woody's is a hot dog joint down an alley off Pratt St.  They have every dog imaginable with catchy names: deputy dog the dog father hot chihuahua dog the underdog reuben dog the southern dog, plus all the usual suspects.   Great place for a quick lunch.  They also have a bar attached which I think has happy hour deals.  A couple of these dogs and you're due for a nap.
