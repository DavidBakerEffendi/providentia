Food tastes ok! B-U-T!!! When I call and ask for an extra large amount of shawarma and get Â the same amount or a spoon larger, in the same container, it makes me feel like i'm being laughed at. When i ask for the salad to be chopped and mixed with the sauce and all I get is bunch of vegetables thrown into an aluminum container with lemon on the side, I feel like i'm being fooled. BESIDES- A SALAD SHOULD NEVER BE SERVED IN A CLOSED CONTAINER WITH WARM FOOD! And when i'm asking for olives to be added to my meal, confirming this twice and being told "ok, ok", but receive my bag, open it to find out there are no olives, IT'S BAD!!!! in addition to all that the bread was scorched! Too bad cause the food has potential, I feel the place has to be ran by more professional people.
