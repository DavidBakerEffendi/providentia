Baltazar is a great French Brasserie that I visit each time in NY which makes that about 4 months early. I bring my clients and friends and we really enjoy the food. The other evening I came in for a dinner with someone of high profile VP of a major fashion brand company. The Maitre-Dit was not French but spoke French and had a horrible attitude and way of of speaking that was not part of the wonderful American service ad kindness when entering in most restaurants. He was nasty - he was just horrible. I would like the owners to hire people that can have a little more of that French attitude that there is already too much of that in France and who needs it in the USA.
