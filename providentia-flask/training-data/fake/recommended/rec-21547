Very good quality, very sincere, and reasonably priced. Got the tuna carpaccio, which was fresh, flavorful, and delicious capers. The taliatelle with bolognese was a good experience for my own palate.  The noodles were soft but not overcooked.  The bolognese was nice and savory. Just a delicious experience all around and I will go back.  Often.
