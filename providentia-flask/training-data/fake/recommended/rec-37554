"Hi, I will be your ser-" "Bottomless mimosa if you please!" "For all of us!" - "Yes, we're reading to order. I would like to get um...3 brunch entrees." "For the group?" "Uh. No. For me. Just me." .... :) Salmon Brulee - HOLY MOTHER OMFG THIS SHOULD NOT BE THIS GOOD BUT ITS HEAVENLY. Absolutely heavenly. The brulee was soft with crisp edges, sweet and creamy. Â The salmon was delicately prepared, savory and soft without being overwhelming or fishy. Scallops Tiradito - BIG GIANT SLABS OF JUICY, RICH AND BUTTERY FISH. Can't say much more than that, I scarfed it down pretty quickly - like an otter/seal slurping up raw fish, quickly. Deviled eggs with tuna tartare - The tuna tartare on top the deviled eggs was perfectly prepared reminiscent of corned beef hash. Lot of flavor and very tasty! - "Bottomless" mimosas had only a 2 hr window and I was pretty annoyed with the frequency (LACK THERE OF ACTUALLY) considering the restaurant was almost entirely empty.... Great food! Took a while to get to us.... Great to be with friends for brunch and enjoy the perfect location/southern italian/spanish wineyard-esque ambiance. Although the service was definitely slow and mimosas were not strong or consistent, the service was also very accommodating and friendly. I would go back again (for dinner not brunch) and I hope more people hear about this place because it's definitely worth a visit! Also a GREAT dinner location for before the theatre - I think they have a prefix theatre option too.
