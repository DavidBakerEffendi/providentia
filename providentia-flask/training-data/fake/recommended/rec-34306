First time at Franklin Steakhouse after hearing mixed reviews. We came early on a Friday evening with a group of 9 including 3 children aged 4, 2 and 1. Service was just about perfect, very attentive waitress, runners and bussing. The menu is pretty big with typical steakhouse/pub fare and a decent draft and bottle beer selection. Unfortunately my first 2 draft selections were unavailable but I settled on a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. For apps for the table we ordered the Calamari Trio which was fantastic - hot and tasty, steamer clams (special) which were plump and fresh, also piping hot. The non-seafood eaters and kids enjoyed a standard mozz stick/potato skin/chicken finger sampler which was average at best. I ordered the full rack of BBQ ribs and truffle fries. The ribs were not the meatiest, but hot, fall-off-the-bone moist and in a tangy and sweet BBQ sauce. The truffle fries were rich, crispy and amazingly flavorful. My wife had the Franklin Steak Sandwich, and my brother had the Sizzling Steak platter - both were thoroughly enjoyed. We skipped dessert but enjoyed an after dinner drink. Overall, moderately priced, nice portions of hot and tasty food served by a very attentive staff in a not-too-crowded bar/pub atmosphere. Would go again and recommend to others.
