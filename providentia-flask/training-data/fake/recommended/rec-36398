For NJ, the Thai food was good. BYOB - plenty of liquor stores around. Not too big, but cozy. Clean restaurant with friendly service. I ordered the green curry, which was good. Sweeter than the red curry, which my friend ordered. I thought the red curry was slightly better. It's your average or slightly above average Thai restaurant that is worth going to if you're in the mood for Thai.
