Another place where great food is marred by sub-par service. First off, the food was excellent. The mixed drinks were sublime. But the service, oh the service... I think they were going for a "young / hip" vibe and hired "young / hip" staff who were un-attentive, forgetful and generally aloof. It started with the host station facing away from the door ("Hello, back!")  Then the waitress mixed up the order, got upset at us for it and ultimately charged us for the item she mistakenly brought us.  Another waitress took over her shift, she was much sweeter but kept forgetting to bring us desert, wine and change. Even our water glasses did not get refilled once. Oh and it was a Wednesday.
