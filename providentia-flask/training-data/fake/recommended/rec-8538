By chance my fiance and I walked past percy street bbq and after reading some press on it decided to give it a shot. I liked the decor. We were seated and were ready to order right away because the menu only has a few items on it. I ordered the sausage and she the ribs. For sides we got collared greens, german potato salad and mac and cheese. For drinks I got a beer and she got one of the cocktails off of the list, which was pretty good but I don't remember the name. Something with gin is all I know. We got our food and after taking a bite realized that it was luke warm. We gave everything back to the server who said that it might come back hotter than we would want, and I replied that at least it would be hotter than it is now. During this time we ate our sides which were good. The collared greens and potato salad were gone fast, but the mac and cheese was a little bit off. It tasted gritty. It seemed that one of the cheeses they used did not melt and created little sand like grains. We got our food back and began to eat. First off, the ribs. I understand that they are supposed to be smoked but the dry rub they put on it was overpowering. It tasted very peppery. The bbq sauce they gave us to put on the ribs was very spicy. I love spicy but it would be good to have another sauce that was sweet so a person could have two choices. Also the meat was very dry. The sausage was bleh. It tasted like they had just put ground beef into a casing and served it. There was a lack of flavor and like the ribs, the meat was very dry. The place just opened so I think we'll be back in a few months to see if anything changes but for right now I am staying away.
