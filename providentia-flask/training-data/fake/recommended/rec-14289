I see how people really get excited about this place.  It is quaint, the food is decent, and it is its own little weird scene.  But... A) The food isn't really all that great.  For the price range I have had much better food.  For example, the beef short ribs were delicious, but the bed of polenta pudding that it sat on did not really couple well and detracted from the main course (and beneath that was lettuce, which also was more annoying than anything) B) The atmosphere was minimalist, but not that cool.  It was just plain and more odd than anything. C) Dessert: I had the warm cobbler.  Average. D) Let's talk about the free fresh parsnip soup...It was boiling hot, so be careful, but don't rush in to it because there is not an ounce of flavor to the steaming bit of yellow liquid (though well presented). All in all, i think this is a 3 star restaurant that really thinks its 4 stars but never quite made it.
