We brought an out-of-town visitor to Izumi, who loves sushi and he was duly impressed. There's no doubt that Izumi is a good place to satisfy cravings for better sushi. And they are proud of what they do, as evidenced by the server's enthusiasm. Izumi has good superior sushi, but the price is a bit of a sucker punch. I used the strategy to sample a la carte sushi from offerings I never had before. That kept the price down (a bit) and also made the experience more special. It's a great place for celebrations or special occasions. The atmosphere is conducive to conversation and is BYO, which makes it more fun and affordable.
