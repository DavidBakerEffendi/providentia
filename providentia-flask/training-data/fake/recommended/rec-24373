This could be the worst restaurant on Earth!  I stopped by to pick up a turkey grinder to go for my wife.  I wish I would have looked at it before I got home because it was the WORST SUB I've ever seen!  I thought a mom and pop place would take pride in their food but it turns out the family prefers to screw customers to save a buck.  For $8, I got 1 slice of turkey and 1 slice of cheese on a 12 inch sub!!  The bread is super thick and when you figure their lack of any generosity with other ingredients, that's about all you get.  An $8 Bread Roll...  My wife took 1 bite of the sub and because of that they offered a 50% refund (while wanting the entire sub back....  Insane! I know!!!)  Please don't support these criminals.  Go anywhere else to eat unless you feel like being robbed.  See the pathetic pictures of the 1 slice of cheese and 1 shaving of turkey on this pathetic piece of garbage they call a Turkey Sub!!
