Went to Tom's today after 16 years as a Brooklynite and all the reviews are dead on.  Great atmosphere, incredible eggs / bacon / pancakes.  I got the silver dollar because I wanted to see how good they were with out all the accoutrements. The only reason it's not getting a 5 star rating is because of the crowds (at 11 am on Wed!) are a bit daunting and seating is crowded with little room to stretch out which I like in a diner and no fountain soda.   Definitely a great place for breakfast, simple menu, friendly staff and no one rushing you too leave.
