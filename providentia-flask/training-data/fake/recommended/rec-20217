I've never had falafel before. But when my wife was just dying to get some good falafel while we're visiting the city and we realized we were staying a block away from Taim, it was a no-brainer. Compared to all if the other falafel I've had in my life, this was the best (and the worst, technically). But seriously...The one thing I have had in abundance is pita. And their pita is amazing. Everything was amazing. In fact, we ate here for the 2nd night in a row. That's saying something.
