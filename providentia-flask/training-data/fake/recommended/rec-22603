Another great meal.  Got there a little later than expected, before a Red Bulls match.  Still they managed to find us a table.  The tapas are amazing.  I've never had a bad dish here.  Both octopus dishes are scrumptious and we have them every time. Catas is especially amazing before a Red Bulls home match, as it is a home of the Viking Army Supporters Club.  It gets loud. What? It gets loud. I can't hear you. It gets really loud during Red Bulls pre-game partying. The staff maintains an amazing level of friendliness during this particular chaos, and  you should go on a non-game day to enjoy their service.
