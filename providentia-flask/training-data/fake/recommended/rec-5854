Much better than I expected.  This place seriously doesn't look like much or any good from the outside signage and appearance but I would have to admit that I was very pleased with my meal, price, and presentation.   I ordered the sesame chicken dinner special with pork friend rice and egg roll. (the usual take out combo).  It came out on a dish with a nice presentation and the sesame chicken wasn't drowned in sauce.  The chicken was still nice and crisp.  Prices are really great too.  You can get sushi here too.
