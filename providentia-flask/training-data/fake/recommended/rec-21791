File me under "not a pancake person. . . until I tried Luluc's." Like many Yelpers before me, I didn't understand what was so special about this breakfast staple. One bite and all my doubts melted away like warm butter. Not too heavy, not too light, and sprinkled with white powdered euphoria. My brunch companion got the quiche. It was a little rich for both of us. We should have just ordered more pancakes.
