It's right around the corner from my home. But I've managed to eat here only once, because this place is too damn (1) popular and (2) expensive. I only had the ramen once, at 10:30 PM after I came back from work, when they happened to have one seat available at a communal table. Yes, Â at10:30 PM on a Wednesday night, this place was packed, with multiple groups waiting. I think they should give priority to people from the neighborhood. Heck, Webster Hall lets us get in for free because we live within a few blocks. Rantings aside, the ramen is superb. For that, Ippudo beats Momofuku and M's uptown, cheaper competitor Naruto hands down. But at $18 a pop, I would come here at most a couple of times a year. There's a lot cheaper and decent place on 2nd Ave.
