Balthazar is a popular SoHo Bistro that is bustling at 2pm in the afternoon. The place was filled to the walls and a wait for just two people was 30-45 minutes. Luckily, as usual, the bar is first come first serve. There was delicious bread being served, thanks to the Balthazar bakery right next door, and the menu items are relatively pricey but well worth it. I had the pleasure of ordering a delicious cheeseburger which was cooked to medium well perfection and served with a tasty slice of Gruy√®re. The cheeseburger and fries were delicious. The bartender, Olivier, was a cheerful French gentleman and remarked on the food of his country and expressed their love of Nutella. Overall, I think Balthazar is a wonderful restaurant that I'd love to eat at again and again. The food is delicious. Just make sure you are willing to wait a while for a seat or plan ahead and make reservations. Either way, it is well worth the wait and I recommend to all that live in New York City and those from abroad.
