First, the ambiance here is great. Rustic feel with wooden tables, dim lighting and high tops. There is a separate room in the back with a few tables, where my friend and I were seated. They have a great selection of spanish wines and our waitress was very knowledgeable in them. We ordered the ham croquettes and croquette of the day (mushroom), which were both delicious. Very creamy, rich and flavorful! We also got the chorizo (get the small portion for just two people - they give you a big portion), artichoke wrapped in serrano ham (great as well), spanish cheese plate (less impressive), and the patatas bravas, which were by far our favorite. They give you a big portion and the aioli that is served on top of the potatoes is perfect! I would definitely go again. Make sure to make a reservation!
