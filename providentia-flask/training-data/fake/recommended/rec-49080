Awesome food and atmosphere.  Two of my friends and I split the rabbit meatballs, burrata, sausage and broccoli rabe pizzette, charred beets, and the special pasta- maltagliati with oxtail ragu and pomegranate.  Loved the mushrooms with the meatballs and the burrata was some of the best I've had.  Citrus additions to the beets was a nice touch too. We had the special dessert banana bread pudding which was the perfect ending to such a savory meal.   Great, friendly service too.  We were seated promptly at our reservation time of 830 and were not rushed at all over the course of the three hours that we ate, drank, and chatted.
