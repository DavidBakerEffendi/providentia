Curses!! Curses to the gene that made me intolerant of more than one serving of alcohol within a 12 hour period.   The Sangria was great (the one glass I did have, Harlem, which had spicy notes of cinnamon)...I wish I could've tried the six other kinds.  My friend had one of the white sangrias with lychee and coconut...totally yummy, like the best sugary fruit juice you can imagine.   Bread / pastry basket was good, but not excellent, though it came with a nice strawberry butter (details, details) and sufficiently quelled my brunchtime urges for sweet things (I usually have to order one savoury and one sweet dish for brunch, which always leads to leftovers and generally unpleasant food comas for the rest of the day).  I ordered the  Latin Benedict, whereas my companions ordered the skirt steak and eggs (which was very delicious).  My dish was pretty mediocre, and TINY! I even commented that it was tiny to the waiter (at that point, the sangria may have hit me already.  I'm pretty sure it did).   What can I say, I'm a big girl.  I like big portions.  *shrugs* But yes, nothing special.   Overall, it was cheap (roughly $35 w/ tax and tip for 2 ppl), fairly tasty, and got me crazy drunk enough to sleep the rest of the afternoon away when I should've been doing work.  Try it!
