Food was fabulous! The pancakes were literally like cake. I ordered the breadbasket and you could tell the bread was made right then and there. Everything was so fresh. Only downside is that the restaurant is very small and I was constantly getting pushed and shoved. Also our waitress was extremely slow. Had to ask her multiple times just to bring our drinks.
