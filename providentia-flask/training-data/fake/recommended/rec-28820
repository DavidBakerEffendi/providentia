I had a salted caramel milkshake and shared the "s'mores concoction" with the hubby. Both were SO delicious. The presentation with the cool "Alice" ceramic cup for the shake and the platter and jar setup for the dessert were cool. A bit pricey of course. The place smelled amazing. The service was super slow but friendly. The treats in the little shop were not as pricey as other chocolate/candy shops I've been to. A great place for a sweet treat. Very noisy so not great for conversation.
