Food was awesome, great atmosphere, and extremely casual. Views of redhook and NYC skyline are amazing. Good relaxed date spot, or chill spot for the boys. Went a week ago, wasn't sure between two different dishes, my server Alex was great in giving me advice on the better dish to try (Antarctic crab roll). On the weekends it can get packed so be ready to hang at the bar for a bit before getting seated.
