I have to give this restaurant a 5 because it really exceeded our expectations, and delivered great service to a table of 13 'picky, drinking, inpatient' people (my friends and I were very hungry!). And the bill was not outstanding- it was Extremely reasonable. As we all know, it is very difficult to make every single person in a table of 13 happy with each of their plates, and that's exactly what this restaurant did last weekend...Not one complaint!!! Every dish was surprisingly delicious, and yes, the recommended ASPARAGUS WITH POACHED EGG dish is a must! And I personally loved my SALMON- perfectly cooked (on the medium well side) with a sort of PUMPKIN MASH that was so delicious!! We skipped on dessert because we were too full but I totally recommend this place for a fun group dinner. Food- 9 Service-9 Ambience-10 (dim lighting, "old country cabin" feeling) Price-10
