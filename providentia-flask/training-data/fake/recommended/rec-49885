Right down the street from my parents house, this place opened up and was the most perfect addition to the area! Their iced chai tea is one of my favorite things and something I randomly crave. At the right size, and the right mixture of spices its price appropriate. They even have a frequenter card to get discounts after so many visits. The stuffed cupcakes they get from a little shop in Nutley are also to die for. A little pricey but absolutely worth the trip!
