pork belly buns........ pricey for a small little bun (2 per order, and you can't just order half an order or anything...), but soo worth it. even better with the sriracha they give you. also tried the fish ball special which our waitress described as very delicate... and it was. not sure if it was THAT special in the end though... although we did all enjoy it. lastly, got the rice cakes with ground pork..... really yummy as well! very satisfying, and a decently sized portion compared to the first two dishes. just a tad oily, but otherwise... very tasty. the rice cakes had a nice crispy outside, but very chewy inside.
