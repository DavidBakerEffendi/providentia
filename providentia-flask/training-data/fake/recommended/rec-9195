Busy and smallish place.  Accommodating staff sat me, a single diner, as quickly as they could at my choice of bar seat or two top.  I chose the bar and went with the basics - hamburger and fries.  Good burger, good fries and nice selection of wine, beer and spirits.  Prices were in line with what I'd expect in NY - not cheap, but reasonable and appropriate given the food and service.  Hoping to get back there for some seafood or a late, late night dinner later this week.  Good conversation with the waitstaff, bartender Will and some of the regulars who visit the bar or pop in for quick meals.
