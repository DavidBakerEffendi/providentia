If you want to eat like a tourist go to Pats. If you want the best cheesesteak in Philly you go where the neighborhood goes...and that's Delessandro's!! When my son said he wanted a cheesesteak from Philly the friend we were visiting INSISTED we go to Delessandro's. Sure glad we did. It was just great!
