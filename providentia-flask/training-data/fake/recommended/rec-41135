Really tasty ramen. Mostly traditional but with a bit of modern flair + Tonkotsu. Less intense broth than I expected, but still very good. Mustard greens were an interesting touch. + Miso. Very rich and flavorful broth. Think I liked this one slightly more ~ Noodles a little harder than I like but still good ~ Pork was good but not exceptional
