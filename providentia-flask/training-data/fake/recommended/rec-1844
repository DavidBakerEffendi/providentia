I don't usually like pork, but I kept hearing about this place and thought that maybe it will change my mind. Atmosphere: In the loud, bustling and beautiful Reading Terminal Market. It gets super crowded during lunch hours, especially the time I went given there was a convention next door. But the line moves fast, and people are constantly leaving their seats and you can snag one. Food: Roast pork sandwich with provolone and spinach. I can understand why people like the sandwich - lots of tender/juicy meat and overall a fairly large sandwich that you could split with another person. I felt that the provolone got a bit overwhelming after a while though. Service: We snagged seats so a sweet lady took our order and things came to us fast. It's worth a try. I blame my natural distaste for pork for not making the experience more memorable. If I ever find myself in Philly again I'll try another type of sandwich.
