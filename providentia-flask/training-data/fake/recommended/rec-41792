This place is FANTASTIC. Seriously, I loved everything about it. Â  For some reason, this reminds me a bit of The Smith- just to give you an idea of what it's like ambiance-wise. PROS: 1. GREAT and really unique cocktails (I had pomegranate & ginger- so good) 2. The space is big and the perfect mix of modern, laid-back, yet semi-upscale 3. They play great music- most is really fun (like anything from 90's to Earth, Wind, & Fire) 4. They have round tables- this place is perfect for a birthday dinner! 5. Food comes really quickly- servers don't hover to take it away and let you take your time 6. The food is just plain good- try their cheese fries. You won't regret it. CONS: 1. It's just a little expensive- you can do a dinner for under $20 if you order the right things, but just plan accordingly otherwise! 2. It may have been a little understaffed, but it's a holiday weekend, so I'll give them that. I highly recommend this place!
