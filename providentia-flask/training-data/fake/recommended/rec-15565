Great bar! All craft beers, with a very informative menu that includes % alcohol and ratings (from ratebeer.com I think?). Interestingly there seems to be a positive correlation between the two. In any case, if you don't *love* the taste of beer, like me, I recommend the cider. This seems like it would be a great place to take in a game, although when I was there the only thing that was on was a Crossfit competition of sorts? It's on the loud side, but nothing crazy. Someone in our party did order food- wings, which came with sauce, veggies and ranch-- but cannot comment on food. Bottom line: come here to drink. You'll have a good time. :)
