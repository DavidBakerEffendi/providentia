Very much worth the trip to this place. I didn't try the Italian side of the menu, but the Cuban was excellent. To start they give hot, fresh bread with olive oil and herbs. Fantastic! The prices are very reasonable for the huge portions you get. The food is a bit flavorful, so expect that going into it, but the taste is delicious. We went on a Sunday mid-day (3PM) so it was quiet, service was great, and our waiter was the head chef. Flan was excellent, too.
