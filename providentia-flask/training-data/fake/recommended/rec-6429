I went here on a Saturday night for a late night date. The space is great - beautifully decorated and yet the vibe is welcoming and unpretentious. We split a very good (and reasonably-priced $40 bottle of wine). The food was fantastic - like the decor: stylish and tasteful but completely unpretentious, Greek comfort food. The server was attentive but not overbearing. The great staff and Â "home-cooked" food allow this place to maintain a family - owned vibe, while still being a great place for a more dressy night out. Pylos is an absolute gem!
