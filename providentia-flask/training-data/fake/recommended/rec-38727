Had diner last night in this fantastic restaurant. The food is delicious and fresh. The menu had so many amazing options. We shared three delicious starters and each person ordered their own main dish. The chicken was amazing and delicious. The shrimp was fresh and yummy. The desserts were also fabulous. The banana bread pudding and the chocolate cake were excellent. The only draw back was it's BYOG so you have to bring your own wine however you can purchase alcoholic beverages across the street. But service was not the best.
