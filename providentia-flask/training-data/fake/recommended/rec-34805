I loved this place. I would describe the decor as "nouveau farmhouse". The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. I really liked the menu. It's full of comfort food that has just a bit of a twist. Mostly I was really impressed at how much they were able to source regionally - I'm always looking for restaurants that make a point to be sustainable and/or support local farmers. Bubby's does a great job of that. HIGHLY recommend Bubby's. UPDATE: I've been here four times, and had a different entree every time. They were all good. I also brought friends once, and one friend's fried chicken was delicious as well. The other friend wasn't too happy with her salmon nicoise salad. So that makes Bubby's 5 for 6 in my scorecard.
