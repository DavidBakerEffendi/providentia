This place is a paleo mecca! I wish I could explain how excited I was to find this adorable cafe, just a few blocks from my office in Manhattan. For breakfast today I had a mash bowl - vanilla chia pudding with berries and coconut cashew cream, all organic, with a coconut milk latte! YES, you read that right, finally a place (other than my own kitchen) where I can get a coconut milk latte!!!! I also grabbed a paleo strawberry muffin to snack on later. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other paleo muffins (the espresso one was also calling my name), more of the Mashbar breakfast bowls (paleo granola, what?!), and maybe even dinner. I'm obsessed with this place now. True, it's not cheap. I'm lucky that right now I have my travel budget to spend, but even if it was my own money I would be happy to pay for such high-quality, organic ingredients. If you're paleo, primal, gluten-free, or just looking for clean, healthy eats - check out Hu Kitchen!!!
