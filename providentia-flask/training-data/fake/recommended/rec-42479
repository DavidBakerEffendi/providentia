The food is delicious and the decor is funky.  Everything is very fresh, including the pita which they make to order. They have a sign stating that they serve "slow food" and they are not kidding.  I'd love to go here for lunch more often but it just takes too long.  If you want a relaxing and unrushed meal this is your place.  If you have the time, the food is most definitely worth the wait.
