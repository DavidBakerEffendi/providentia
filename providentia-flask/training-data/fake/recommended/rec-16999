This is my absolute favorite Cuban restaurant in NJ. It is such a fun environment! I love when they play the drums for birthdays! I also love the punches to mix with your BYOB alcohol. Don't make the mistake of not bringing your own alcohol if you plan on drinking, you'll be sad looking around like I did the first time! That's no fun. So the food! I always order the same thing! For starters, I love the papitas rellenas. It is a fried mashed potato ball stuffed with meat and served on salsa. Taste so much better than it sounds. For my entree, I get the churassco steak with spicy sauce, medium, with coconut rice instead of the regular rice it comes with and a side of yuca! It comes with plantain and black beans. The steak is always so tender. Definitely a fun place to eat with your friends. Be prepared for a wait on weekend nights though!
