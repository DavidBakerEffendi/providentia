I decided to write this review after eating at a different barbecue restaurant, need not mention their name.  The brisket at Morgan's is smoky and peppery, juicy and moist....oh man, and the bark....  I'm so full but my mouth is watering just thinking about.  There really isn't another place quite like it, the waitstaff is friendly and helpful, the bartenders are cute and clever, and Pitmaster is serious about his barbecue.  I still haven't even mentioned the ribs... The meat falls right off the bone, I could have eaten an entire rack.  I'm starting to sound like a carnivore.  I'll save the vegetables for my next visit/review.
