My friends and I came in on Friday night and had the best dining experience we had in a long time! They sat us right away and quickly brought us bread to start that was delicious! The service was incredible, we started with appetizers (muscles, arugula salad, Cesar salad) and everyone was raving about their food. The timing was perfect and as soon as we finished they took our plates and brought out delicious meals! The grilled chicken with tomato pesto, palenta, and brussel sprouts was incredible as was the mahi mahi and the penne alla vodka! I can't say enough about the exceptional service and delicious authentic food! The ambience was perfect and made us feel like we were right at home with our family and friends! We all can't wait to come back! Thank you for the best dining experience! Also it's a BYOB and our dinner was so affordable! A must visit!
