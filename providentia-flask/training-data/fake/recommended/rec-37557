Alligator on a Â stick - a very tasty, spicy sausage with a nice spicy whole grain mustard on the side. This sausage is not pure alligator, which is too lean to make a good sausage, so I know there was some pork or something mixed in but it was good. Jambalaya rice - good, could have had more goodies mixed in with it though Etoufee - not bad, but not enough shrimp and crawfish, mostly gravy, nice spice to it and loved the okra. Beignets - nothing special, sorry. Service was very friendly, prices were very high for the portion size though.
