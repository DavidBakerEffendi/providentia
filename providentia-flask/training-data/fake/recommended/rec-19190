Lord ohhh Lord, this place was GOOD. I had the empanadas and they came with eggs, black beans, and "home fries". There was nothing special about the eggs, black beans and homes fries, they tasted like they would anywhere else. The home fries are actually cut up potatoes in seasoning. The empanadas were a different story, they were delicious!!!! One of my friends had the biscuit & sausage gravy while my other friend had the chicken and waffles. Both dishes were delicious!!!! The chicken melted in your mouth and so did the waffle. It was probably, if not the best, one of the best chicken and waffles ive ever had. I WILL be back to try more things on the menu.
