Love the chow here, awesome drinks, and the waitresses are smokin' hot, but WTF, no coffee at brunch anymore?!! You cats need to amend this, quickly. Even the diviest bars have a coffee machine. And you're a goddamned semi-fancy restaurant. You cannot offer eggs/brunch and not serve coffee. My non-caffeinated buddy couldn't even a glass of milk for his french toast. This is borderline criminal. AMEND THIS PLEASE. I love you anyway, because I'm a sensitive dude and realize you're probably just going thru an awkward phase.
