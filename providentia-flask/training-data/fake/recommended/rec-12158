Came here around the time they opened up and then again a few times after that. Each time was satisfying, especially after drinking. I like the cheese fries, but I don't like the cheese fries. I think i'm too used to Cheese Whiz, that when I get real melted cheese, it's just not the same. The burgers are very good and so are the concretes. The only other thing that's not so fun, is finding a place to sit. It's not hard, just annoying because sometimes the tables aren't readily available the minute you get your food.
