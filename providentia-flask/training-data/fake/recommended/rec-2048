This place was great!  My wife and I stumbled upon this place after we tried to go to Bukhara grill a block away, which was closed.  What a great find this place was!   I've had belgian food before but my wife hadn't so it was a first for her.  We ordered the 2 pound $20 mussels with white wine cream sauce.  We didn't get the "all you can eat" mussles for $22 because you can't share.  In the end that was fine because the 2 pounds between the both of us was more than enough and left us stuffed for the night.  The fries were also perfectly fried, not greasy and served with mayo. For dessert, we had moelleux au chocolat (chocolate molten lava cake) which you can't go wrong with.  It was delicious.  We also ordered the Tarte Tatin which is like an apple tart- it doesn't taste like apple pie filling if that's what you're looking for. We both thought it was okay but it grew on me a bit more than my wife so I would still recommend it.   Our waitress, Tanasha was very niceand helpful with recommendations.   We will be back.
