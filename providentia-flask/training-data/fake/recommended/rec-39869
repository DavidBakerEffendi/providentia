The minute I walked in the joint, I could tell it was a place of comfort, a real time spender. :) Penelope was charming, delicious, and welcoming. I had a wonderful chicken sandwich with artichokes and cheese. The fresh salad that accompanied the sandwich was wonderfully prepared with every piece of lettuce delicately bathed in a light dressing. The dessert gave you the warm, homemade feeling inside. The flavor combo of the Maple Oatmeal Cranberry cookie paired nicely with the side of ice cold milk in a chilled white mug. I would definitely be back soon with friends.
