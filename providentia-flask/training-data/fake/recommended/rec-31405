After skipping brunch at Bella's and Georgie's (too long & annoying a wait for both) on a Sunday, a friend and I decided to stop here. I've seen it on my way to other things, and it always looked like it would be good. It is. It is better than we expected. I was expecting something a bit like Patricia's in New Haven (breakfast standards, low prices, one of my favorite places.) Jerri's has all of those things, like eggs & toast, pancakes, omelets, etc. BUT they also have... COLOMBIAN FOOD! SURPRISE! It is good. We both ordered arepas with eggs, hot sauce and avocado, as well as a side of plátanos [great with maple syrup.] They also offer chicharrón, which I did not want at 10am, but plan on trying sometime in the future. There is bistec y huevos. All of this, I would eat. The place is tiny, but we had no wait. Servers were friendly. Regular Diner + Colombian Diner = will be back.
