I am speechless as to how bad this restaurant is. Am really at a loss for words. Absolutely terrible service, where the waiters are rude, condescending, and dim witted. We ordered the calamari appetizer and it was so bland, it's what I would imagine plastic tastes like. We asked 3 times before ordering if the calamari is breaded and what sauce it comes with, with the waiter telling us that it's not breaded and comes with marinara sauce. Both of those things were not true because the calamari was served heavily breaded with a store-bought salsa. When I asked the waiter about it, he told me that in his "opinion" this dish is the way he described it. I'm telling you, the staff is DUMB. The restaurant is over-priced with low quality everything. Just awful.
