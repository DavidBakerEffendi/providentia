Stopped in for lunch over a brisk weekend and was pleasantly surprised. We sat at the bar, which was stocked to the ceiling with all kinds of whiskey's and liquor, it was fun to pick out all the brands we'd never seen or heard of before.   I ordered the Kentucky Hot Brown sandwich and a Ginger Rogers mixed drink.  The drink was really good and had a nice kick to it.  The sandwich was delicious  and was complimented nicely by the duck fat fries we ordered.  Overall, cute place, enjoyable crowd, I am looking forward to going back and trying some other items on the menu
