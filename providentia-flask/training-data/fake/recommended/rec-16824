for center city, this place has a lot of character and a decent crowd. It attracts all walks of life but everyone is pleasant and friendly. I love all the pictures of the dogs on the wall. I would really like to know a little bit more about where they came from. It seems like they were taken in Philadelphia. As far as the food and drink go, i can't complain. The burgers are great, beer selection is pretty good and everyone seems to love the sweet potato fries. My favorite part is on the 3rd floor. They have one of the nicest pool tables in center city. It attracts lots of good players and you can always find a good game. Definitely recommend this place if you want something that is not too pricey and is low key.
