ok, so my coworkers and i are constantly searching for a new place to order lunch from. we get sick of the same old pizza, chinese, and cheesesteaks. we were craving mexican so we searched yelp and found this place. the reviews made it hard to resist. we ordered our food to be delivered...a fajita burrito, a chicken quesadilla, and chilango crispy fish tacos. when we ripped open the bag i was excited to see the individual little baggies of chips for each of us. but then was quickly disappointed to find there was no salsa to accompany them. really? who wants dry cold tortilla chips? onto our meals....i opened the fish tacos to find greasy pieces of over fried fish and pico, with a few thin slices of avocado in a cold stale tortillas. there was also two lime wedges squeezed and thrown on top. no sauce? no sour cream? they just looked blah....sorry for not taking a picture, but i was starving by the time the food came and devoured it even though i found it to be only mildly satisfying. the tortillas were so stale and rubbery that each bite i took required a followup tearing motion to actually break off a piece. the taste was ok, but i was definitely disappointed with this meal. my cowoker ordered her chicken quesadilla without pico and asked to have peppers and onions added to it. the quesadilla itself looked great, but she was given the veggies in a cup on the side. umm....so i guess she was supposed to open up the wedges and add it in herself? thumbs down. the pastor burrito did seem to please, as my other coworker said he would go back, i highly doubt i will though.
