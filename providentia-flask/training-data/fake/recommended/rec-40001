I was ambling around the Vill before catching a friend at a book launch and decided to stop in here for a bite. I'm thoroughly glad I did. Why? For one, I'm a french fry junkie. Like, serious. So when I saw this place it stood out mostly because it was rustic and real mellow. I decided on the special. Listen...you want to get the special. Two sliders and a regular order of frites. I'm thinking, 'can't be that hefty.' Out come two burgers. I'm like, 'THESE are their sliders?!' They were succulent, tasty and done well. The frites were crunchy and highly tasty. Now again, GET THE SPECIAL. I know some have claimed that they can't get with the mayo - listen, you'll want to have that with these. I think La Frite fits in well as a great calm foodie oasis in the Village. (they also open late on the weekends - another bonus) The staff was highly friendly as well. I told them I would be back, and I intend to make good on that real soon.
