We were excited to have dinner here, but it was hotter inside than it was outside, so we took our food to go. I ordered three veggie tacos, but the fillings were really basic for the price we paid. Having other veggie options would definitely benefit everybody. Something as simple as saut√©ed mushrooms and zucchini to go along with the beans and rice would be wonderful, instead of just beans and rice. I think having another taco option like that would make a lot of people happy, not just vegetarians.
