Simply sublime. A wonderful pairing of innovative tapas and interesting varietals in a casual but elegant setting. There's much to be explored here but the tasting menu is where it's at. The space is very intimate, with seating only at the bar facing the chefs' pulpit allowing you to see every step of careful preparation in the organized and efficient stations. Even a moment of observation will whets the appetite for the delights to come; you'll want everything.
