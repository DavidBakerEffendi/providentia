Best Greek food in the city, hands down.  This place prides itself on simply prepared but fresh dishes.  My boyfriend and I normally get a bunch of their appetizers and share them.  Our favorites are the grilled octopus, grilled veggies, spanakopita, and the baba ghanoush.  Four appetizers is usually more than enough to feed both of us (and we're hungry people).   We did end up getting entrees once, and they were also delicious.  The seafood stew had more sea life than I've ever seen in a single dish:  mussels, clams, scallops, shrimp, and squid in a nice tomato broth.   If you're on the fence about this one, just try it.  It's small and cramped but that adds to the intimacy of it all.  Plus, you can watch the cooks making everything right there in the heart of the restaurant.
