I had breakfast at Cafe Orlin this morning, and it certainly was worth the effort of getting up an hour earlier. They have a pretty swell breakfast special: for $5.75, two eggs, potatoes, toast, a cappuccino and a small glass of fresh squeezed orange juice... where else can you find that? The food is pretty good, and even better when enjoyed in their sidewalk patio: great way to start the day on a beautiful sunny morning. The service was fast as lightning, though not particularly warm and even a little curt. I'll be back nonetheless.
