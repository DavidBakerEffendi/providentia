I went specifically for mofongo de pernil and that's what I got... It was delicious!  This place is small but authentic!  I refused to head back to Maryland without stopping here and I will be sure to visit again when I return.  If I lived closer I would definitely be a regular. This place is a must if you're ever in the area!
