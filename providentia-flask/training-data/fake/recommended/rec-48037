FANTASTIC!  We had the tasting menu.  The dishes were beautiful, delicious, and interesting. My only criticism would be the atmosphere - dim the lights, light some candles, whatever.  But honestly, when the food is that good, it really doesn't matter that much (thus the five stars).  Also, service was so wonderful and friendly while maintains the professionalism you would expect at a fine dining establishment.  Treat yourself with dinner here.
