I went in at 11pm on a Saturday night and it was hopping; great crowd, up tempo Indian dance/club music, and an energetic staff.  More importantly the aromas were heavenly and the wraps were small, but superbly seasoned.  Salads were also fresh, included organic greens, and smartly paired with delicious dressings (lime cilantro and the cumin tamarind were tasty).  Nicely pressed, too. Fast and delicious Indian wrap carry-out joint in Midtown.  I'll be back.
