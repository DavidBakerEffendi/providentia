The service was exceptional. Everyone was very friendly. I was back and forth in between the French toast or omelette. I went with the Wisconsin cheddar and apple omelette...oh add bacon! It was a glorious occasion in my belly after a long week! Â The ingredients were fresh like they had Paula Deen in the kitchen whippin it up! I will be back again!
