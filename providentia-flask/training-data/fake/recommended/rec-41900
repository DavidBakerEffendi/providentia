My boyfriend and I came here last night at the suggestion of a friend who said it was "amaze balls." She couldn't have been more right. The food, we both got the Turista prix fixe (what a great deal for $35!!), was great. We tried a little bit of everything, but the gnocchi that I ordered as my pasta dish was the gem of the evening. I also enjoyed that it was BYO. What made this place stand out to me was the service. Ian, our waiter, was amazing. He took the time to go over the menu with us and answer any questions that we had all while making us feel like we were in no rush to order (which was good because there were so many delicious options to choose from!). As someone who works in the service industry it's hard to find a restaurant that I feel has outstanding service. With that said, Ian surpassed both my boyfriends and my expectations and we would return here again just to have him as our server.
