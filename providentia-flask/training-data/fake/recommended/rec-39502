This is a very cool place. When you step in here you feel like you've been teleported to Germany. The place is decorated like a German tavern with soft folk music playing in the background and staff dressed up in traditional getups. They have a big selection of German beers and an authentic menu. We thought the food was great! They have a brunch menu too with a good selection of items and unlimited mimosas, bloody Marys, coffee or tea. The bar looked like a great place to come in the evening for drinks with friends. We definitely will be back!!!
