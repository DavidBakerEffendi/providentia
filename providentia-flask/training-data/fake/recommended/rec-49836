Food so good, it makes you want to cry. Generous, generous portions, polite wait staff, delicious food, and a beautifully appointed room... at an affordable price. I am unfamiliar with Turkish cuisine, per se, but now that I have been to Saray, I want to have more... from Saray.  I will definitely be coming back and bringing friends. First, they brought out a fresh, hot, generous basket of bread with some lovely seasoning (black sesame, I think) on top. I ordered from the dinner special 3-course menu.  Good choice if you are uncertain what you are ordering, but this is not a place to be shy and order something plain. Then was my appetizer portion of fried eggplant in a savory tomato sauce. Then slow-cooked lamb, cooked in a crispy filo wrapping, with a side of rice and grain and salad. I cannot say enough good things about the lamb entree.  Amazing. Then a honey cake with a turkish coffee. needless to say, I took home a large amount of leftovers, they gave me separate boxes to use for my different courses (very nice touch!)  and they even gave me a bag to take home the bread. Beautiful room... very well decorated.  This would be a lovely place for a family dinner - I saw several families dining and enjoying themselves.  This would also perhaps be a good place for a romantic date.  And.. in the unobtrusive distance, soccer on a flat-screen (what's not to love?)  I felt a bit underdressed in my casual attire, but there did not seem to be a problem with that, but next time I will probably dress a bit more. :) If it were not likely to be culturally inappropriate, I would have asked to kiss the chef.  thank you for making this woman very happy with this meal :) Thank you so much for gracing West Haven Connecticut with your delicious cuisine! (The one critique I would have is to ask them to replace the occupancy sensor in the Ladies' restroom, because it kept going out while I was in there, and was obviously damaged.)
