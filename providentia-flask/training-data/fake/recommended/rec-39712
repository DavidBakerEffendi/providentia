Let's cut to the chase. Waited 45min outside, would have waited longer if we didn't meet another couple and made it a 4 person table. Waited an hour for my pizza. When it finally came i was more mad than hungry and.. the crust was burnt! Damn you for burning my favorite part!!!!! Service was okay. I just hate it when a place gets so popular the waiters seriously thinks it excusable to have patrons wait an hour and when ask they respond with "That's how it is" WTF? Be professional, Lie to me that you'll check it at least. I should not have to tip you for that kind of BS response. Pretend to check my goddamn pizza and lie about how much longer i would have to wait! It gave me a inkling of how good this pizza could have been but what a let down. Pizza is a simple thing, That's why people love it, With all that wait, bullshit and in the end i get pizza that's soggy at the tip and burnt at the crust. I definitely had better. Surprisingly... one of them is their Manhattan location. For shame Brooklyn you have failed me here.
