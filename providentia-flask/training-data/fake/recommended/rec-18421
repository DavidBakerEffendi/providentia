So....the food was good, but the prices were a little high for what you get...but it is New York, I guess, what does that even mean?!? The service was great, as they even took the time to wipe my saucer clean from the minimal coffee overflow from my cup. Wow. Another positive is that the staff is neither uppity nor uptight, and willing to joke around with you (at least our waiter was). The ambience was warm and classy as the tables were draped with white fabric table cloths, and the dining room was lit with soft low lighting. Overall, it was a great brunch experience.
