Jungsik - WOWWWWWWW!! My favorite Michelin restaurant in New York alongside atera and Chef's Table. I was extremely happy to see them be awarded the 2 Michelin Stars in 2014 from their one star prior to that. This restaurant is not only creative and visionary with turning Korean cuisine into an artsy gastronomical experience, but they also bring about their own flavors which just give it such a WOW. I love Korean food, but this is a totally different take to it. Reservations are fairly easy to get. Used to be even easier prior to the second awarded Michelin star. Location is in your quiet Tribeca area near Tamarind. Drinks are fantastic, their cocktail menu containing asian ingredients that serve as the major flavor (Yuzu, asian plum, etc). Waiters and staff are beyond knowledgeable and great. Definitely a very upscale stuffy vibe to it, but the food is just so cool. You have the option of a 5 course tasting menu that will leave you extremely stuffed. I would highly suggest you do this if you come to a restaurant like this. The Bibimbap and Kalbi are both fun. They have incredible tasting pork belly. And I loved their dessert. I know I had other dishes, just can't remember right now since it's been almost a year since I went for my birthday last year. Can't wait to go back for my birthday this year.
