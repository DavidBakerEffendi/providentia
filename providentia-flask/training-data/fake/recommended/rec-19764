I've visited Tabare 4 times now, and still can't stop dreaming about their mussels and chocolate cake.   The menu offers an amazing range of Uruguayan options, from fresh salads to fried provolone cheese. Every dish I've had, including the bread and oil that they open each meal with, is wonderfully flavored and perfectly presented.  The items are all priced appropriately, perhaps even on the cheaper end of the scale and are above par for the amount of space they have in the kitchen. The dining room itself is dark, romantic and creative.  The lighting is perfect for an eve out with friends or a date.  And, the guys who run this place make everyone feel right at home.  They love their customers and will sit down and have a glass of wine with you, given the time and your invitation. I highly recommend giving this spot a try.  I'm highly jealous of anyone who lives close enough to Tabare to make it their local dinner spot.
