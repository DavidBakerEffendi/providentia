Pylos has become my favorite, most trusted establishment in the East Village for a nice, casual chic dinner. I've been going there for the last three years from time to time with friends, family when they come to visit etc. and everyone agrees from the ambiance to the service to the food that it's a solid bet. The whole experience is consistent which counts for a lot in my book. The scene is bustling but not snooty or too loud. All around love it.
