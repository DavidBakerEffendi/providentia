The long lines are intimidating, but not as intimidating as the guys working the cart. As my friend and I stood in line during a bitter, cold New York night, we witnessed customers getting yelled at for not knowing exactly what to order, or not giving the correct amount of cash. Here's the thing: when we visited there wasn't a menu in plain sight. It's either you know what you want or get out. Seeing as how it was our first visit, we were really nervous about the whole ordering process. Fortunately, a group of regulars standing in front of us were discussing what they wanted to order, so we eavesdropped and decided to order whatever they were planning on ordering. We went with an order of the chicken rice platter with pita bread, and squeezed over it some hot sauce and white sauce. The pita bread was dry, but other than that minor complaint the platter was delicious and worth the wait. If we had known about the lamb option, we would've ordered that instead.
