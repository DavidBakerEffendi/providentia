I freaking love Frankford Hall. I've probably been here 9 or 10 times, and I've never had a bad experience. The beer selection is a nice mix of German classics, which you can get in half or full liters (bonus). If you're not sure what to get, I recommend the KÃ¶stritzer Schwarzbier (how did you like that use of the umlaut? Pretty good? I know). To get the full experience, I also recommend going with the liter size! The outdoor area is just awesome. It's a bunch of picnic tables flanking some fire pits, in front of a stage where they play great live music. The only downside to FH is that if you hang out outside, you will leave smelling like an Oklahoma BBQ pitmaster, given the wood smoke coming off of the firepits. Recommend washing your hair before bed so that you don't smokify your pillow. Food is always good here. I could eat a million (at least a million) of their giant pretzels. The roast chicken is also good, as are all of the german side dishes, like red cabbage. Definitely get something that goes with ketchup so that you can try their housemade curried ketchup. This place can get packed on the weekends, especially on nice nights, so just a heads-up.
