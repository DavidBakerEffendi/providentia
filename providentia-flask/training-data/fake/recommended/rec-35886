Last night I was invited to dinner my host had to reserve a week on advance; the place is popular alright. It was crowded at 6:45 when sat down and it was uncomfortably crowded, you had to cut your way out thru the crowd, when left. Service was simply put overwhelmed; we had to frantically waive our arms to be noticed, getting a refill of our wine glasses was an adventure, and after we asked for the check they brought us the deserts menu. On top on that the food was underwhelming at best. The salads boring, except for the beet salad where it was allowed to take over aggressively, goat cheese was just okay, and the moules were so tiny ... I fail to see why people endure such log waits and unpleasant crowding for this joint.
