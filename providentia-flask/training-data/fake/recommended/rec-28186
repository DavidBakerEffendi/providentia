So happy that this place finally opened! Â Finally a place near 34th ave where you can get a good cup of espresso. The coffee here is super strong and brewed fresh, and the bacon egg and cheese sandwich that I ordered was one of the best that I've had (and I've eaten a lot of BEC's in my day). No wifi yet but the owner says that it's in the works. I really wish this place stayed open later! They're only 7-4 right now, but I would totally stop in and get one of their delicious sandwiches (they even have pulled pork) or affordable salads (6 bucks and change) for dinner if the hours were at least until 8. I hope this place sticks around!
