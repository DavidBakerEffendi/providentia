Took a little get away to Vermont and saw this place while shopping. A couple of days later was suppose to go to American Flatbread but the weather was so bad we didn't want to have to look for parking and walk to find it. So we settled on this place. The place is really nicely updated, loved he decor. Our waitress was sweet enough. We ordered the meatball app as well as the spinach dip. Both were good but both were nothing to write home about. Then we ordered 2 pies, the meat pizza and the margarita pizza, I preferred the meat pizza, the sauce was sweet and fresh tasting, the cheese was gooey, and the meats were salty and yummy. The butter garlic margarita was a lot more bland, the cheese had no taste really & I didn't taste any garlic. The crust was ok, but again nothing mind blowing. I left full, but ave a feeling I would have been more satisfied walking in the hail storm to get to the original plan of American Flatbread.
