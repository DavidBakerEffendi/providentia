I can't add anything here that hasn't already been said.... This place is amazing. Long story short, I found myself camping in my own house in south philly, ahead of a move out. No food, no plates, etc.... Ordered take out twice in 3 days and both times amazing. The beef for the kebabs is high-end steak quality, the hummus is so creamy and good, the salads are fantastic, full of herbs and lime. And both delivery drivers were cute. I wish I had found this place before I moved to center city, but I'm glad to have had the two meals I did.
