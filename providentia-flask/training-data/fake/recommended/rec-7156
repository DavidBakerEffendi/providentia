Excellent service, very welcoming homey feeling from the moment you are seated. They only do seasonal tasting menus, and we dined during NYC Cider Week, getting the Cider pairing with our meal. The bountiful shared appetizer tasting samplers were very tasty morsels and filling in themselves. Especially good with the scallop on the half shell and the chicken liver pâté. The first course ricotta dumplings were very melt in your mouth. The mains left a little to be desired (pork loin and hen of the forest mushrooms) but the desert was out of sight, both in presentation and flavor. Capped off with petite fours brought out by the head chef herself, all in all a great evening.
