The best food truck/stand ever! Amazing food at cheap prices - perfect. The only drawback: seems like half of midtown knows about this place. The line can get so long during the lunch rush. But rest assured, they know how to handle the rush. After you passed through the first round of waiting (to order), the second wait to get your food is minimal (less than a minute! - what!?!). Noob story - The first time I came, I got my food almost immediately that I thought they confused me with someone else. Now for the food. It took me a while to try this place despite what everyone said because I naively thought it was just any ordinary chicken over rice like from the halal carts. This Greek truck does serve chicken over rice with "white" sauce and hot sauce but it is completely different. The "white" sauce is tzatziki sauce which uses yogurt, sour cream, etc (yummy)! There is a Â bunch of items on the menu but they make it easy to order (also, you get two chances to check out the menu). Simply pick a style (platter, gyro, salad), pick a meat, pick a topping combination, and edit. They have Philly cheesesteak, fries, etc. But I would go for the customizable option. The lamb is so delicious. The chicken is very very well seasoned. The sauce is what pulls everything together. I got a combo (lamb & chicken) over rice - Greek & spicy. So filling. Huge portions. I left the rice to make room for the delicious lamb and chicken. The Greek salad is a more approachable portion. The cheese, sauces (added hot sauce too), veggies...best lunch ever.
