I live two blocks from here and it's awesome for those spontaneous cravings.  Their prices are fair and their quality is good.  Before they renovated last summer it looked like a typical diner. Now it looks more like a restaurant with all the perks of a diner (fast service, etc.)  The day time on the weekends is usually much busier than nights.  I've never had brunch there but from other reviews it seems like a steal.
