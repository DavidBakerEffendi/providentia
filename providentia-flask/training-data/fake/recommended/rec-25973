I love this place. The food is amazing and really makes you feel you are back in Brazil. Have lunch or dinner outside, Richardson street is so quiet that you will think for the time of a meal that you are not longer in NYC. The staff is extremely nice. They will always make you feel at home, try everything to get you the table you want and always have a smile to welcome you. Try the Caipirinha here. it's delicious!
