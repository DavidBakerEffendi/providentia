Awesome lunch specials! The staff are very welcoming too and they were very happy even though we were a party of 8 and the bill definitely did not seem like it was.  We came on a Friday afternoon and the place wasn't very crowded but at had a good amount.  Although the spring rolls for the appetizer were cold, everything else was pretty okay.  I was surprised at their prices for being in this area of the city.  The decor is very unique, that is dressed up like an old fashioned hotel lobby with a huge chandelier that covered most of the back of the room.  The moment you step in, there are these huge curtains.  My friends and I were having too much fun with those curtains, pretending we were VIPs at a fancy hotel.  Food was great for their price but I believe if it was at regular price I would be disappointed.  Will probably come back for the lunch special again if I'm in the area again.
