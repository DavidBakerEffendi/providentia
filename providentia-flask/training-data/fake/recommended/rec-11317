I've been to this place about 5times already & need to go back soon, because I miss those incredible thai & buffalo wings. Also the atmosphere is ever so cool & laid back. The bar that sits in the other half of the restaurant is very chilled & secluded. Don't miss out on this spot, you won't disappointed!
