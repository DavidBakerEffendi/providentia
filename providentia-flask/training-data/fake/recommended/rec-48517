Lamb stew to die for.  Good beer selection.  A little slow when we got there but it was full by the time we left.  Fairly young professional crowd.  Atmosphere a little dim and maybe could use a scrub down, but...hey, that's sort of what Irish bars are supposed to look like.  Waiter was a little distracted.
