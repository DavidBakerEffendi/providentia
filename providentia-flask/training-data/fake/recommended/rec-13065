I've been here twice. Once for lunch and once for take out. Service is great. Long lines if you are here at the normal dinner hours. I see kids and strollers, so it's a very family oriented type of restaurant. the bar and wait area was big. there are many types of food you can get here. i saw a sushi chef once. the french dip sandwich was the highlight. meat wasn't dry, the au jus dip was flavorful and delicious. the only negative was the price. so expensive! it's not an everyday type of restaurant.
