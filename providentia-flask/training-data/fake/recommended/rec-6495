$7 for a lemonade and $9 for a Mac & Cheese that at best came out of a packet. Tried to come here once before because of the insanely high rating on Yelp and saw a crowd of people waiting. Went back today when it was quieter and was punished severely for doing so. One star, and that star is only for the waitress who was nice. Â This place has a long way to go before it can charge what it's charging with a straight face.
