Came here with my family the other day.  It was pretty empty for a Thursday night.   Service was good but a bit weird.  You can tell they are still trying to get their act together.   We shared mussels (good but beans were a bit too predominant).   My dad ordered the lamb sliders with a side of fries, fries were really good but they brought them our with the apps.   My sister got burger which was really good though was only slightly bigger than the sliders.  Everything was pretty good though not sure if I will be back.
