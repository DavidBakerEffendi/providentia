By far one of the best if not only sports bar and daily regular hang out for me back when I still lived in south Philly !!!!!!!!!! I was there hanging out for lunch ad dinner and partying til closing nearly 20-30 hours a week at least. Great place to catch the games, mingle with people and the friendly staff. I'm sure if management or Pete himself reads this and sees my profile pic he would remember me. If owner Pete is reading this ....."yo Pete you should consider opening a CP out here in Vegas all the Philly people that live here and there is quite a lot to be honest love and miss CPs . Recommendation to people is def try the crab fries. Many of te items on the menu are great. Been 3 yrs since I moved from south Philly to Vegas but I'm guessing there's been a lot more added to the menu? I really hope to one day be visiting back home and will def want to come back to CPs. I miss the overall experience atmosphere, food, service and most importantly the people of CPs as that's what really makes me love the place and is key to any business to retaining clientele returning. Hope someone that remembers me reads this and messages back on yelp. Would so seriously love a CP franchise location in Vegas for all us Philly natives and such out here. Plus Vegas could use the most popular voted sports bar in the nation at the biggest sports betting capital in the world here in sin city. Love you all at CPs Tony Lance Chiu Tough Tony
