My friend recommended Great NY Noodle Town, and I'm glad I listened.  Open late, I took the subway from Times Square after Phantom.  Took us to Chinatown, about 5 blocks from Noodle Town. The roast duck, roast suckling pick, and roast pork were all tasty.  The veggies were cooked well, and the won ton soup was very good.  The won tons were stuffed with shrimp.  The beef chow fun was a favorite.  My friend has seen Dave Chang there late night several times, so that has to say something. Some reviewers didn't think the service was great, but hey, it's Chinatown, not The French Laundry! Will take a late night subway trip to Noodle Town my next visit to NYC in Sept.
