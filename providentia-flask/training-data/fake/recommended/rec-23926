Hands-down my favorite place to eat in the neighborhood. The Vegan Fajitas are out of control, definitely meant for sharing. The plate includes smoked tofu, chicken-style seitan, lots of veggies and guacamole. Throw some green hot sauce on there and you're in the zone! They also have Vegan Treats cake for dessert! You can drink for cheap here if you want, Tecate in cans and Negra Modello. If you prefer drafts, there's a nice rotation of glasses (not always pints) in the $4-$6 range. I was going pilsner crazy this summer. Lots of booze, fancy cocktails, tequila flights. Don't get too faded. Great juke with the essentials. Any place I hear Pulp "Common People" and Jesus and Mary Chain is going to win me over. It gets busy on the weekends and when it's nice (the new patio area is totally sweet), but I've never waited too long for a table here. Always the best times at Cantina.
