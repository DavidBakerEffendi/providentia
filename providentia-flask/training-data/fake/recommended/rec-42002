I rarely give five stars, so this is a big deal!! I dined at Melograno with a friend recently, and loved our experience there. We were there around 6 pm on a Friday, and had no problem getting a table. I loved our food, which was thoughtfully prepared and delicious, I loved the space and ambience, the service was great, and the prices weren't too bad either! Overall, it was a fabulous experience, and I will certainly be back!
