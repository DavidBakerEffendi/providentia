Walked in on Saturday night without a reservation. We were seated immediately and the food was great. I ate with my parents who were visiting from Australia. They mentioned to me earlier that they felt pretty indifferent about the vast majority of meals they had eaten in the US, and wondered why there weren't many "real" restaurants around. This struck me as a bit strange, however I feel their attitudes had been changed somewhat following the lovely meal we enjoyed at Perilla.
