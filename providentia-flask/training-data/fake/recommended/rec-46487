Great dinner at Marc Forgione's. I've been here two or three times for work (before he was on the show), plus now three times out of pocket with my wife. Every time has been fantastic. The menu changes frequently depending on what fresh ingredients they can source, so you may not be able to get the same dishes, but my wife had the duck, which was more like super-tender steak (in a good way) than a fatty chewy fowl, and I had the pork chop and pork belly special, which was like no other pork chop I've had in my life. Apps (unique escargo w/ cumin; ricotta ravioli) and desserts (warm brownie; blueberry cobbler sundae) were great, too. Highly recommend. Plus, where we were sitting, my wife could see Marc himself there in the kitchen, cooking, plating, and supervising. Excellent meal from the Iron Chef!
