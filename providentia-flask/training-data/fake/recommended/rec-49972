in North Brunswick, this place is very classy and art filled looks and lighting, the salad bar is good, not as indian tradition, yet good, not much space inside, most of the water effect arts which are not often on during buffet lunch, takes up too much space, the hot served food is good, but the sauce will be very lathering thick in body, you will need plenty of rice with the hot serves, they lack sweet/desserts more then anything else, drinks can be pricey for simple beverage and for a simple lunch buffet, not for those who are intimidated with the classy look for a fine dine buffet, the dinner serving orders is good, as one could expected from most restaurant.
