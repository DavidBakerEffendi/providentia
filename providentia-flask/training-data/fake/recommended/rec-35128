I went the first time when they had a paypal promotion and got the thai chicken salad crepe. It was out of this world. Seriously. It was one of the best things I had had in a long time (and I don't even like salad)! I loved it so much that I went back 2 weeks later to get another one. :( I don't know what happened. Maybe they were on their A game the first time I went because of the promotion, or maybe the second time I went was just an anomaly, but something was up. I ordered the exact same thing (the thai chicken salad crepe) but it was really lackluster this time. The chicken wasn't as flavorful, the truffle sauce was almost nonexistent, and it was just all around disappointing. Not so bad that I couldn't eat it, but just disappointing after the excellence that was my first crepe. I haven't been back since. My first crepe was worth the $9. The second wasn't. I've been thinking about going back to try some of their dessert crepes, because I feel like those will be good no matter what. I just wish my thai chicken salad crepe had been more consistent.
