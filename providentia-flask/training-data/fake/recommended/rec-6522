I've gotten Luzzo's take out before, and knew I was in for a treat at this place.  They still don't have a liquor license, so they just gave out a glass of wine to everyone on the house.  They had two reds and one white to pick from, which was very nice.  The bread we started off with was delish - like pizza dough bread... yum!  I ordered the bruschetta - bread was delish, and lots of tomato.  I also got the small bufalo pizza which was just incredible.  The sauce was amazing - had a bit of tang to it!  The Luzzo's take out that I had isn't quite as good as this place (not sure if I eat there it would be the same).  Also the portion was pretty large for a small - served on a cutting board too.  The large was only two bucks more and was HUGE... I should have gotten that and eaten it for lunch the next day.  The service was great, the food was awesome... I'd definitely recommend and return!  It was pretty busy for a random Tuesday night, so I'd definitely make reservations.
