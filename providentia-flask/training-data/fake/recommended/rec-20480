We hosted my mom's surprise birthday party here, and it was a great experience.  Cesar and his staff were easy to work with, the food was delicious, and service was attentive.  All of the guests loved their meals and we had hardly any leftovers.  I highly recommend this restaurant for a dinner for two or a dinner party of 30.
