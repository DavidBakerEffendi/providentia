Came here on a visit to Philadelphia.  Neat little place in a  neat neighborhood.  Cool decor and atmosphere.  Also, it is tiny and cozy.  The food is presented well and colorful.  The tamales were great and the hot chocolate was excellent.  We also ordered a cheesy queso appetizer that was just ok for us and one more entree item that I cannot remember, but it was not memorable.  So it was 50/50 for us.  Based on one experience, probably difficult to rate, but this was our first impression.
