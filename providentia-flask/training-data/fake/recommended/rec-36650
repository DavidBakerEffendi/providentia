As a visitor from Los Angeles, i expected for one of the few restaurants in New Haven to be hugely disappointing... however, I was pleasantly surprised! The pad thai, at 8.95 (without tax) is on the sweeter side, for those of you who have sweet palettes.  The mister and I mainly did take out- because at rush hours for dinner, there is a small waiting area and a big hungry, waiting crowd! Another delicious dish is the pad-see-ew at 8.95 (thicker noodles with a brown sauce) + broccoli (YUM)! A recommended appetizer is the fried tofu- it's a lightly fried golden color tofu cut in triangles and it comes with the sweet dipping sauce. (Peanuts on top of the sauce for those who are allergic, beware!) It's delicious and you can't go wrong with it! Only 4.95.   The lunch specials are cheaper at 7.95, and a variety of things come on the plate.  They are only served at specific times, 11-2? (call to double check!) and less crowded.   The service has always been mediocre, unless they are totally empty- but the male servers are usually much friendlier than the females.   All in all, for two people, the bill for a meal with two entrees and an appetizer will cost you about $25 dollars with tax and maybe a couple of dollars more for tip.
