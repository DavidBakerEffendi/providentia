I wish this place could cater my life. I often stay up at night thinking of their jerk pork and how amazing it is. The first time I went here for dinner, it was kinda late and they were out of the jerk pork AND the jerk chicken, yet I still had a wonderful meal because the oxtail and the goat are just insanely good. The bok choy is also outstanding. The plantains are standard and tasty. The cocktails are novel but also delicious. Drink them. The other 2 times I have been, I just completely fell in love with the jerk pork. It's cooked just right and their jerk sauce is out of control delicious. My only qualm with Glady's is that I wish there were more vegetable side options. The bok choy is awesome and the slaw is decent, but I could use another green option. However, this is a minor complaint and I am not deducting any stars for it. 10/10 would eat any time.
