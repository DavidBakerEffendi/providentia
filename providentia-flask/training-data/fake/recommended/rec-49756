I just learned that approx. 1,200 readers already know about this place but for the uninitiated like myself, I'm going to throw in my two cents anyway. I LOVE RAMEN. I've been actively researching several ramen restaurants for years, but I think I've just discovered nirvana. It's called "Ippudo," in the East Village.  It's of all things part of a franchise I'm told, but don't confuse it with KFC.  This place is the real deal. When I arrived, the place was packed, which I heard was the same thing, every single day.  A solid one-hour wait, but it was well worth it (I suggest getting pleasantly saturated with cold sake at the too-small bar in the meantime). This is what I sampled, and it was beyond wonderful-- pure gastronomic heaven, unforgettable.  First, the starters... I ordered the small pork buns, similar to the classic Chinese cha shu bao, but more delicate in presentation, incredible.  Then came the chilled Japanese cucumber, smaller in circumference than it's American cousin, but infinitely more flavorful and crunchy,  awesome.  Then I ordered something I've never had in an Asian restaurant, anywhere-- these small, Japanese green peppers, quickly sauteed in olive oil then dusted with a special salt that was equally fabulous.  In fact, I think this single dish was the surprise of the entire evening.  Then came the soup noodles.  They begin cooking the broth early in the morning, it was clear and pork-based, thin strips of Berkshire pork glistening on the surface like a piece of Japanese art.  It was the best bowl of ramen I've yet had in New York City, period (still a joint in Edgewater, New Jersey I'm told that's supposed to rival the best in Tokyo, but I've yet to make the jaunt). Ippudo was a bit pricey, but well worth the effort.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys truly inspired Japanese noodles at their zenith.  Scrumptious Factor:  Wow.
