It was decent. But having to wait 1.5 hours and then only having mediocre food? Don't think I'll be back for a while. It's not that it was 'bad', per se. Just very regular. And waiting for soo long and all the hype? Regular doesn't cut it. We had a sandwich of some sort on english muffin. And a scone. It just didn't blow me away. Maybe I'll come back if there was no wait and if it wasn't so crowded, but that's not the case!
