Really liked this place. It is BYOB The soup dumplings here are amazing I've been here twice and the 2nd time I went just to eat soup dumplings. The first time I was there I ordered another main course and tried some of what my friends were eating it was all delicious. I'm planning on returning for a third time soon.
