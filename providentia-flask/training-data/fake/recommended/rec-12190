Wow!  When one block in Philly gets both a Capogiro and a fancy sushi place, you know that the real estate is getting pricey. I went to check out East Passayunk after NYTimes did the article about the 'hood.   The sashimi platter was the star of my dinner.  It was inventive and the delicate flavors were brought out by clever sauces.  I was too hungry to make more notes- but the lightly charred calamari was dreamlike. Outdoor seating near the fountain makes this a picturesque place.   I'm keeping an eye on this neighborhood.  I sense many new, interesting developments.
