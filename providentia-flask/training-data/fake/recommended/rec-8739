We left the movies at midnight and were looking for a late night spot. Blue Ribbon came up highly rated on every list so we decided to try it and were starving. The homemade bread loaf was good and a nice touch to quell our hunger until the appetizers started rolling in. We started with the Salt and Pepper Shrimp as an appetizer and it was delicious.  The shrimp was crunchy and flavorful and accompanied by a citrus soy dip.  We also ordered the beef bone marrow, which was cooked perfect and comes with toast so you can spread the marrow on it. It was soft, buttery, and tasty. I ordered the Sweet and Spicy Catfish as my main. I thought it would be dry so I ordered a side of the citrus soy that came with the shrimp.  I didn't need it; it was very moist and the best catfish I had. Blue Ribbon is a must try and a great meal any time.
