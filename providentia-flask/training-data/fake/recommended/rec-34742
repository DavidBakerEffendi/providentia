The hours posted on their website are misleading--we'd stopped in 15 minutes after the posted open time only to be told that they didn't open for another 30 minutes yet. Some slightly less than desirable customer service aside, the food is excellent, arriving quickly, well-prepared, and cheap. An interesting palate makes for a great quick and/or portable lunch. Five-star food with some 3-star business habits.
