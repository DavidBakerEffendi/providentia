What can I say that hasn't already been said?  This food is like crack... you'll be hooked (seriously, the FDA should analyze this food for addictive elements because just the thought of it has me salivating!). A mixed bowl (chicken and lamb) with a lot of white sauce and a splash of red sauce is what I get.  The food is cheap and filling and you probably should share it with someone because its a lot. I really don't know anyone who doesn't like this food.  I'm not saying you will love it too - its just that when so many people give it excellent ratings you definitely gotta try it out.
