Came here for the 2nd time last night. There was only a short line and it moved super fast. Even when the line is long things move right along, so don't be discouraged!!! It will be so worth the wait. Just thinking about it again is making my mouth water. Doused it in white sauce and extra red sauce. It burned... but it burned so good.
