a friend took me to this place a while ago, and i loved it. was a little weird because its not a middle eastern place...theyre american(i think) and theyre selling falafels. so i didnt expect it to be that good, but it was! it was pretty healthy too i think their falafels are baked and served in a wheat pita with lots of veggies. but portions are HUGE! so the 6 or 7$ is not so bad.
