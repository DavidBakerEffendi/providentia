When I looked up restaurants open on Christmas day, Ponty Bistro was one that really caught my eye.  I'm a huge fan of anything with lobster. Who isn't? And Ponty Bistro's brunch menu included: LOBSTER EGGS BENEDICT. I love lobster. I love eggs benedict. Christmas brunch place? CHECK. When my friend and I arrived at Ponty Bistro, we were greeted by one of the chefs and seated near the window.  After we were seated, we were given menus and I immediately noticed that we were not given brunch menus.  I had thought that they would offer brunch on Christmas day, but was sorely mistaken.  However, when I brought this up to one of the chefs, he said that he would make it.  That is what I call real service. The lobster eggs benedict was delicious albeit a little salty.  We definitely got a good helping of lobster for $15.  However, I would've liked my eggs a bit more runny than they actually were. Overall, good food and good service.  I would love to try the other items on their menu.
