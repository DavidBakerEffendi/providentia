The idea of "Food and Bourbon" actually wasn't what sold me.  A friend recommended and I liked the clean look of their website.  The "Grade Pending" sanitation grade concerned me a bit however once entering, I found it to be very pleasant, not overwhelmingly crowded but good energy.  Great recommendations from the servers.  The salted caramels with the check are amazing!
