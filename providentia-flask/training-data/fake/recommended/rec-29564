AWESOME place.  First time I visited here was in August.  Now, I frequent this bar almost every time I am in the city!  Blood orange margaritas?  yes please!   I even tried to recreate these in my own house, to no avail. I have never been disappointed with El Vez.  Always has lots of people, great food (guac!), yummy margaritas and a photo booth!  BONUS!
