I went to Cookshop this past Saturday night for a birthday dinner. There were 8 of us - and we had a 9:30 reservation. After patiently waiting, we were seated at 9:50.  I understand that sometimes its hard to move people from tables, and the maitre de was generally pleasant about the delay. We ordered quickly, and our appetizers came out quickly- but then we didn't get our dinner until 11:15. Not only was our party starving  at this point- but our waitress had gone MIA - and seemed annoyed when we asked where our food was. She never even checked in for another round of drinks. She had other people bring over our meal, and didn't check in until about 10 minutes later. And of course, the food came out was cold. No one liked their meal. But I was with people from the South, who basically admitted that they were too polite to complain about their food. The steak was chewy, my tuna was average in a watery sauce, and basically no one enjoyed their (expensive)  meal. We didn't leave the restaurant until 12:15. The service was slow, and no one was helpful to us, despite being a large party. It was a mix of New Yorkers, and people visiting from out of town and was an embarrassing way for guests to enjoy a night in New York City. We were celebrating a birthday dinner, and everyone was in a bad mood when we left. The waitress could tell we were all annoyed, but no one tried to make it right - a free round of drinks, etc. This was my second time at Cookshop, and I had a positive experience the first time, but I would never return to this place, and not recommend it - especially for a late seating, or for a large party. There are plenty of places in NY where you can get a steak for $30 - try somewhere else.
