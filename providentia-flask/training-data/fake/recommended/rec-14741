When it comes to pizza this is a 5 star. The oven is made of brick and ceramic.  They use a cherry wood to heat it up. I actually saw the chef crushing the tomato's by hand. The kitchen is open and you could see most of the preparation.  My favorite pizza is the Quattro Stagione which means the four season's. The atmosphere is warm and friendly as is the owner "Pasquale". Connected to the restaurant is an Italian bakery called "Aroma Di Napoli". What a great way to top off any meal. This is one place you can't leave disappointed. Mangia & Bon Appetit........
