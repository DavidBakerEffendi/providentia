I believe the servers name was lily she was training or it was her first day if i recall correctly . Her service was fantastic , very attentive yet not annoying or hovering over us . The bread amazing we had too much of it almost couldn't get through our entree. Drinks came out perfect with great timing. The entire experience was amazing the food was delicious ... The paella was ok the sea food didn't taste anything out of the ordinary . Over all 11/10 we will surely visit this venue again!
