Let's be clear from the start - this is purportedly a Steak House, and to me that brings certain traditional standards to be met, which they missed by a long shot. On a first trip a couple of months ago, it was pretty good but dinner yesterday was a loss. The service, decor, cocktails are fine. The sides and salads were good but a little too salty for our taste. Our reason for coming here was a big disappointment. Our Steaks (fillet and porterhouse) were certainly NOT top quality beef - my porterhouse was actually tough, and all were over seasoned. Last visit seemed to be slightly better quality meat, but cut a too thin for a good steak. Maybe that's why they push sauce for all the steaks - not what a real steakhouse would do. Wine list was good and priced well, but at $40 for a steak in a steakhouse, I expect a really good steak. This ruined what could have been a very nice family dinner. I will not return given a couple of notable alternatives in the area for this price.
