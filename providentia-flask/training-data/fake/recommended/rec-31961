Walked into this joint for the first time expecting a welcoming committee especially since they parade their 39 or so new and old ZAGAT RATED signs wherever there is space.  Upon entering the two dour-faced bartenders or a bartender and a bar back ignored us. They looked like they were just audited by the IRS. It was about 6pm and there was no manager working the floor.  A waitress, who introduced herself as Christina, saw us from the back dinning room and walked up front to greet us. Christina and the busboy were both very nice and efficient. The food was spectacularly bland.  Potato Leek Soup that tasted like a bland version of Split Pea Soup; a steak wrap that you could've gotten at any NYC Deli for about $10 less. The Sheperd's Pie was seared (burned to a crisp), obviously it came too close to the sun.  Also, lots of veggies in the SP, but where was the beef? Or the lamb?  The answer, no where to be found.  Not impressed, not even a little bit.
