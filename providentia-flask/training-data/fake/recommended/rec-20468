what a great new place to find in my hood. the food was great and the drinks reasonable but it was packed! we had to wait over an hour. i recommend trying to get a reservation. i had the pork sausage that was amazing. my boyfriend had the scallops but the portion size was very small! but other then that is you like southern food this place was great. also the chicken was really great.
