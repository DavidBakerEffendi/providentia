4 friends and I had a wonderful dinner!  Got there early, so there wasn't a wait.  We'll definitely be back!  We shared the following dishes: Fresh Focacia Bread with olive oil (delicious) Appetizers: Cured Meat & Cheese Plate - tasty! Frisse & Charred Fava Bean Salad - totally unique and fun Entrees: Pasta w/ Gorgonzola & Kale x2 (it was too delicious to eat only once!) Veal w/ Ramps (out of this world!) Cookie Plate Service: One of the owners, Julian, was working the door.  He was friendly, funny and fast, as was our server Keith.  Another server (though I don't remember her name) was also the baker.  She was just as charming as the rest, and snuck us a few extra cookies as well! While the menu was limited, I got the clear impression that it will change with the season.  Hello... ramps are only around for like two weeks!  If there were any first week hick-ups, they have been resolved perfectly. My suggestion: head to Rucola for dinner tonight!  It's an excellent addition to the neighborhood.
