This was my first time here. Went for my boyfriend's birthday on a Monday night. Not too busy. We were seated downstairs, which I found to be HUGE. I love the decor (walls with the tree branches). It was the perfect setting for a romantic dinner. My boyfriend ordered the lomo saltado and I ordered Juanita's chicken (just the rotessiere chicken) with a side of the avocado salad. The food came out FAST (like 10 mins after ordering). I was a little skeptical because I read somewhere that they could just be leaving cooked food under a heat lamp but the food tasted fresh). His lomo was really good - steak flavored well Â & cooked to his liking (medium rare). The chicken was so moist & flavorful on its own but the green sauce made it extra yummy. Def. ordering the Matador combo next time with a group of people.
