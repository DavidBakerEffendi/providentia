The presentation, taste, and environment about this restaurant guarantee many future returns. I went here with my boyfriend for dinner and it was fantastic! The wine is very good and was excellent with a platter of paired cheeses. The tapas were exceptional-- particularly the stuffed calamari (a must try). Save room for dessert because the creme brûlée literally will make your week and dance across your tongue. Lastly, the mulled wine will warm your soul and win the heart of even the most picky wine-drinker (like my boyfriend). Definitely a must. Service is wonderful and not even slightly rushed. Everyone is friendly and the environment is calm and collected. Wonderful.
