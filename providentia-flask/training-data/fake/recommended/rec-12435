This place is worth the wait you are bound to experience.  The food is top notch and the coffee was delicious. We went for breakfast and had three different items; all great.  Get the pancakes or the French toast or omelette; and make sure to have the biscuits.  You really can not go wrong.  Only problem they have is trying to accommodate everyone who is trying to get a seat but hey, they have takeout.
