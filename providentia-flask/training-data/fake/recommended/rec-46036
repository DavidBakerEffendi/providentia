We came here around 8 pm on a Friday night.  A good amount of customers were there; all the tables were taken minus two.  We waited a while for the food because there was a big party ahead of us, but we didn't mind.   The parking is very limited, so you may have to park along Ridge Road, but the food is worth it.  We've been here a few times and I always get the fish tikka masala with garlic and cheese naan.  It never disappoints!
