Great location right next to the highline, so you can take a short walk while you wait for your table. I came on a Sunday for brunch and only had to wait 20 minutes! Several bloody mary's to choose from, and the BLT one I had was very good! Beignets were good and more doughnut-y than ones I've had in the past. I got the scramble and biscuit--it didn't come with hot sauce, but it was perfect as is! Our waitress did give us a house-made habenero hot sauce when I asked for it, which was spicy and amazing! The bf got the french toast, which was baked and kind of had a bread pudding consistency. So delicious.
