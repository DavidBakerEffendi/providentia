The first time I came to Grey Dog was just to grab a coffee and catch up with a friend I hadn't seen in a while. As I was sitting there watching Â the snow falling in the background, I couldn't help but think about how places like this make me love New York. The atmosphere, music and even the people who work there make it special. I almost forgot to mention the food! I will start out by saying it's a little expensive for what it is (but what isn't in this place). But everything I have had here has been soooo good. From the hearty portobello stuffing salad to the amazing desserts, I have yet to make a bad choice. Thanks for being awesome.
