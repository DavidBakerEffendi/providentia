YUM YUM YUM. Ok - can't even begin to tell you how much I regret the fact we waited so long to get our tails in here. When you hear a place is famous for paninis, it's hard to really understand how delightful paninis can be! OMG - we haven't had anything at Il Bambino that we've now mowed through in a matter of seconds. We love the soups, appetizers, paninis you name it... and as an italian, I have to say, it's some of the finest quality cuts of meat, pestos and cheeses!! I am sorry I've waited so long mi bambino. Now you've got some new regulars... I don't even have to tell you about the Crumbs cupcakes they sell... it's unbelievable. I highly recommend the Elvis cupcake if you have calories to spare. :)
