I must say, I've become quite smitten with Johnny Brenda's.  I think the only place where I'm more likely to be found is in my own house.  And, ok, maybe my boyfriend's apartment.  Maybe. I've mostly used Johnny Brenda's as a place to have a few beers while checking out a show.  The upstairs opened last fall and since then I've seen a good number of shows.  I haven't been disappointed by any of them.  The space is what I consider to be a perfect size for a show.  There isn't a place in front of the stage where you'd have a bad view, and it's a wonderfully intimate setting. The beer selection is pretty fabulous (as you would expect from the people who also own Standard Tap), and it's also reasonably priced.  Both things I greatly appreciate. The bar kind of has multiple personalities.  Downstairs has all the hallmarks of a local dive bar: the floors are linoleum, the tabletops are always sticky, and there are even a few neon lights.  I love it. Then you go upstairs where the floors are all hardwood, the bar is well designed with accent lights everywhere, and there's even a partial third floor balcony overlooking the stage.  I love upstairs even more. I also have to give my vote for Best Women's Bathroom to the 2nd floor of Johnny Brenda's.  There are more stalls than you could ever need, there are multiple mirrors (including a full length).  Also, the lighting, sinks, and fixtures are gorgeous. Now I just need to get in on some of that brunch.  Man, do I love brunch.
