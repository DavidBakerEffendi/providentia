If you're looking for good food and a vibrant atmosphere, El Vez is a solid pick. I love the fish tacos here and the margaritas are tasty as well. I have only been here with a group of four; however, it seems like a great place to come with a large group of people, too. It reminds me more or less of Distrito in University City (which I happen to like better in terms of the food options); however, if you're looking to spend your night in Center City, it's a better bet simply out of convenience.
