Bought some Japanese onigiri pancakes (shrimp with eggs and scallions) and some tofu and salad from the hot and cold bar. Pretty bad stomachache right after eating it. Wanted to throw up the whole night. Imagine the greens were the issue (left out in open and not cold enough). Please beware! Two stars bc I have eaten here before and all was fine, but feel terrible this time around.
