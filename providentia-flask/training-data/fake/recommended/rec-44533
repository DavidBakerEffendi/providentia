The food was great..I got the fried chicken which was amazing. I'm marking it down a star because it was a bit uncomfortable in the restaurant. We were VERY close to the table we were next to and the booth I was sitting on had a huge cushion and even being the small person that I am, my legs were pushed up against the table. However, I still would strongly recommend it.
