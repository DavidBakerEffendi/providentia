It has been about 9 years since I have been here, but this place has been the benchmark that I judge all other places that claim they sell "the best Philly cheese steak" etc etc... I used to live in Roxborough many years ago. I still remember getting food while having a party. I remember the smell of the food as it entered the townhouse, or as they say in Philly, the duplex, and we would all just stop what we were doing and stuff our mouths... Maybe it is just the memories of good times, but that's fine, Consider this a tribute to where this West Coaster learned what a true Philly steak was all about.
