I was very happy to find this restaurant on a recent trip to Philadelphia--it definitely hit the spot!  When we arrived around 7:30pm, the place was jam-packed and we had to make reservations to come back around 8:30pm to get a table.  That ended up working really well because we went had a drink before dinner, but if you're looking to eat right away, I'd recommend calling ahead.  I ordered the Rainbow roll and the Salmon Yaki roll and I enjoyed both.  Their sushi had just the right ratio of rice to other ingredients, and the fish tasted very fresh.  Plus, the wait staff was all very friendly and accommodating.  If you're in town and in the mood for sushi, this place is a sure bet.
