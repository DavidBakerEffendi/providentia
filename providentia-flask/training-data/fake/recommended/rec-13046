Although there are a ton of reviews for Clinton Street, I feel obligated to express my love. I absolutely am obsessed w/this place. Hands down the best pancakes I've had in New York or anywhere for that matter...the delightful little butter syrup they use is addicting. I am also a HUGE fan of the fried chicken---it's seasoned to perfection and has never let me down. The shrimp and grits are 'lick your plate' good. I suggest going with a friend and sharing entrees and a stack of pancakes, so you can enjoy it all. Definitely, go there with an empty stomach and prepare to come out w/food coma. I have gone at night and had no waiting-line which is awesome...although I would wait in line for this food any day!
