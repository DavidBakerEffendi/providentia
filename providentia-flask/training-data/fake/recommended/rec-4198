Great experience.  I usually do not like small plates but these were delicious, nice sized portions and fairly reasonable.  We had brunch here and are glad to have it in the neighborhood.  We had heard  that is was a great option.  Recommended. We had the patatas bravas, cheese plate, croquetas and more.
