Admittedly, we were HUGE fans of the former La Creole that occupied this space.  We were hesitant to check it out due to the loyalty we had, but then we heard they brought the old bar from La Creole back and we gave it a shot. Very glad we did.  We've been going consistently since they opened, and have never been disappointed.  They have the best burger in Philly, hands down.  The wings are fantastic (ask for a side of the BBQ Aoli with them).  I've tried the oyster and the shrimp po bois, and both were excellent, though it's tough to get away from the burgers. I'm an admitted beer geek, and this place does a nice job with a small craft beer menu that matches well to their food and season.  They always have a stock of Abita and 21st Amendment, a Yards draft, then rotating drafts and bottles.  The servers and bartenders know all their beers and food well, and can point you in the right direction. The best times we had were sitting outside in the summer, as the patio about doubles their space and is a great place to watch games.  Feels like your in a city neighborhood porch.  Looking forward to spending more nights here down the road.
