Wanted to like this place. Got the beef burrito to go since sitting inside was going to be hectic. Beef in the burrito was plentiful but also dry, tasteless, and extremely salty. The rice inside was very mushy and similarly tasteless. Also annoying was how unevenly distributed the ingredients were. All the rice was packed down at one end. Pico and guac was in first few bites then disappeared. Really was just overdone, salty ground beef in a burrito shell. Hate to knock em, but true.
