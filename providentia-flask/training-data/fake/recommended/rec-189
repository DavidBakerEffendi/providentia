A group of friends and I stumbled upon Penelope after being relegated to cold and 45 minute wait times on other restaurants. Penelope's had about a 5 minute wait which was the perfect amount of time to notice the delicious smells from the kitchen and the hot chocolate on the menu. I went with a group and everyone ordered something different. Â The Mac and Cheese was super cheesy with a yummy crumb top. The chicken sandwiches, BLTs, and subs were served on generous portions and with crispy fries. Although our waitress did mess up our order about three times, I would definitely go back, especially to try out that amazing sounding brunch!
