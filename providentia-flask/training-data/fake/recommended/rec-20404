A little pricey, but this place is cute and the food is good. I like the simple decor and service was also good. Brunch is very reasonable, considering the quality and quantity of food that you get. There wasn't anything that knocked anyone's socks off, but no one was disappointed, either. Would definitely return for brunch if in the area, but make sure to show up way ahead of time. There are no reservations and brunch will be crowded for many hours. The staff is very good with seating. Some other reviews said noisy. I wouldn't say noisy, I would call it lively. Maybe too lively for those with a hangover, but I thought it was fine.
