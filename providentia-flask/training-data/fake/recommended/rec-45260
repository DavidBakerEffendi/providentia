Well I found this little hidden away place through a friend.  I lived in Wayne my whole life and never knew this cute little friendly place existed but I sure am glad now!  Very friendly bartenders and staff.. They make you feel welcome and as if they have known you forever so it leaves you with an "I wanna come back" feeling.   Now to move on to the food.. I was a little hesitant at first to order a fish dish I saw on special one night being an Irish pub but loving fish I decided I would ... Best decision I ever made!   The flounder was cooked to perfection the franchese sauce again he nailed it .. not to lemony and perfect texture.  On my second visit without any hesitation I ordered the fish on special which happened to be Salmon ... I ordered it without the sauce only because I wasn't a fan of that particular sauce... The chef actually came out and personally asked me what kind of sauce I would like,  that he would make whatever I liked .  Once again the meal came out and he nailed it to perfection again!!  This chef is so awesome of a cook that he should be in a more upscale restaurant without a doubt!!!   I would definitely be his groupie lol wherever you go chef I will follow .... Keep up the good work ... And applause to the cutest friendliest local place around!!
