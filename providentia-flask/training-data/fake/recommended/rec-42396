Yum. What else is there to say? Totally love the philosophy and the beer. The beer was great, the server helpful, the portions plentiful and a great time. I have been for lunch and dinner, both times I had a great experience. We were not rushed, the servers were helpful with the beer selections and had insightful comments on the menu. I had the pulled pork sandwich the last time I was there and my mom had the chicken salad. Both were wonderful and were paired well with the beer selections. We enjoyed the meal so much, we stayed a little longer for another beer! The best use of a former McDonald's I've come across so far!
