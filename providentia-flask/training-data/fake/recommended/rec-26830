One of only French restaurants in the area, and as several other reviewers mentioned before, the location is quite unexpected.   First came the foie gras. Although I have since boycotted foie gras since I found out the cruel methods in which it is produced, the time I had it here, I was not impressed.  It was cold and unappetizing.  I thought it would at least be heated or cooked a bit, but it was a cold slab on the plate, and was just gross. The escargot came in a very very tiny portion without its shell in a mini cruset pot. I really liked the creamy texture of this appetizer with the pleasant surprise of pine nuts. The Steak Fritte was the highlight of our meal, and the delicious potatoes that came with it were perfect. I also enjoyed my scallops and pasta.  I don't normally like pasta, but I wolfed this down in a matter of minutes.
