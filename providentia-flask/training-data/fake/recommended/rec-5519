I have stopped in here for a quick happy hour with a friend twice now and think it's great! I initially went in because I could see that it was super cute inside through the window.  They have cool decor, mason cars for lights, and only 1 small TV. Once I saw their drink list and cheeses, I was sold. They also have a good happy hour as well. Both times I have went, I just sat at the bar even though there were tables open.  Both times they had asked me if I had a reservation as well, so maybe that's recommended as it gets busier near dinner time? The bartender was attentive, talked with us a bit, and not pushy. Overall, a great place, I'll be coming in again!
