I'm not sure how this place gets 4 stars from 200 reviewers.  The dogs were not very good, the buns were not good, nothing about this place was good.  I don't mind the dive/hole in the wall atmosphere if the food is good, but it was just not.  I went with my coworkers and none of us thought this place deserved the rating it got.  I went to The Hot Grill down the road right after we left this place and the food was SO much better.   If I'm back in the neighborhood I'll give it one more  try to be fair.  and I will change my rating if it's better, but until then it's getting this 1 star.
