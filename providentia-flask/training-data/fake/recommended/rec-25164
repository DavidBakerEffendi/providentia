I have had MUCH better burritos/tacos in New York that cost less. Heck, I'd say Chipotle is still better than these guys (say what you will, but their burrito is the perfect size and the chicken is on point). Dos Toros' decor was nice, and the guac looked decent and was given out generously, but I rank my burritos on the base model. First, what the heck did you just put on my tortilla without asking me? Did I say I wanted cheese? No, I did not. I did not want some SLICE of cheese on my burrito. Who makes a burrito with sliced cheese? It stuck to my teeth and detracted greatly from my experience, but this wouldn't have been a point against you if you had asked first like any self-respecting burrito assembly line. The chicken was grizzly and they gave me sooo little (which may have been a good thing, as it turned out). This is the meat (and potatoes) of the burrito, and it was SO disappointing. Sub-standard, even. Nothing else about it wowed me. The size was slightly above average perhaps but unimpressive. Overall, it had no flavor (and I should not have to rely on hot sauce, that's not what I'm paying for). This may come as a surprise to you, but I am not a picky eater at all (though I do appreciate good quality when I taste it). I eat what's put in front of me and usually enjoy it. I am, however, discerning with how I spend my money. This burrito was not just meh or okay, it was a genuinely negative experience for me. I do not understand the hype. Go just about anywhere else, and you will likely find a better, cheaper burrito.
