Fresh, simple, well prepared deli-style paleo food. They have a juice bar and coffee bar, as well as a selection of paleo baked goods (their muffins looked fluffy and amazing, and their grain-free brownies and 4-ingredient chocolate bars are indulgent in the best way.) The dining areas are comfortable and the place is just over-all awesome.
