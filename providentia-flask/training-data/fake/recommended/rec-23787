B2 is great! The staff is always pleasant even when it gets really busy. Their espresso is pretty good, and I love that they have tofutti cream cheese. They stock a few yummy vegan baked goods, such as whoopie pies, brownies, and cookies. I wish they'd branch out and hook us vegans up with some cupcakes and banana bread (or other loaf-style/breakfasty goodies) too, though!
