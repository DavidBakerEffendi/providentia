I walked in here feeling a little deflated and the faint smell of urine didn't help, but two things happened that made me think that Corner Bistro is a perfect New York spot: 1) the woman sitting next to me at the bar started up a conversation and we ended up reminiscing about our favorite So You Think You Can Dance routines of past seasons for 20 minutes. 2) My Bistro Burger (medium) was juicy and satisfying. The bacon was crispy and the burger was just on the large size of perfect.
