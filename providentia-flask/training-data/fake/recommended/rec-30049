We went here for dinner and I had the Poussin al Mattone.  It was good, but not great.  I have to say that the vegetables in the dish were fresh, and the chicken was cooked great.   The reason why I say it was A-OK was because I felt like it was a little overpriced for what we received.  I know it's 'locally grown', but the dinner was pricey.  I felt like it was more of a place where people want to be seen instead of focusing on the food.   So, it is great that the food was locally grown and veggies were fresh, but I don't thin I would be going back.
