3 words - healthy, delicious, reasonable. I'd eat here every meal if I could, and I would turn into Superman. My ideal meal is some kind of lean protein, some vegetables, and a little bit of complex carbs. Unfortunately, most of the time you order this, as well as most of the time I make it at home, it's tasteless and dry. I got a bomb-ass plate last night with lightly steamed broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini and carrots over brown rice, with lemon-herb marinated chicken chunks on top. Threw a little tahini-based sauce on top, and I had the perfect post-workout meal that didn't put me to sleep. And it was delicious! The chicken marinade is really good, and they don't overcook the chicken and dry it out. Tahini sauce was killer. Veggies were fresh and not cooked until they were soggy. Can't complain about anything here...
