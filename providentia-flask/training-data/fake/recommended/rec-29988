Had always passed it on the way to DiLorenzos, and the opportunity for us to skip great pizza came up.  We were quite early before a movie and had the entire place to ourselves.  Great chat with the owner and waitress on the menu items, which are extensive.  Had the potato cheddar soup to start - delicious and I plan to try to make my own version!  The entree of chicken artichoke Francise was delicious - the mashed potatoes were amazing and the corn was wonderful.  Huge portions and took half home.  Husband had the filet mignon focaccia and it was full of mushrooms, onions and melt in your mouth steak.  Fries were excellent and the entire experience was great.  We will be back on Thursdays to try the Mussels and dessert!
