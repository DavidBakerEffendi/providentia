Creative, innovative, enticing and just plain delicious.  This is what makes visiting NYC an incredible culinary experience.  Your not going to find this in the suburbs.  Well worth the trip to the bustling lower east side and well worth the wait.  Especially loved the curry lamb ribs which just falls off the bone.
