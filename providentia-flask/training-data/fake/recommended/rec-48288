Still the first and the best! Best tasting pizza on this planet. The secret is in the dough and in the brick oven. Most toppings are outstanding. Tomatoes that accompany mozzarella starter are so fresh you'd think they grew in an on-site garden. Love the pitchers of beer. Service has improved. Added dining space helps. Worth the long lines.
