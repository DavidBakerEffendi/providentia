I've been supporting this bar and grill for quite sometime, but what I'm beginning to notice is a pattern of receipts with items never received or ordered and never brought to the table. I've shared my table with complete strangers to wind up having my bill attached to there's so it would be above $50 Â so gratuity can be added. Mind you I'm a good tipper regardless. I've even had one particular bar tender ask me To pay for a bill that customers ditched even though she knew they were not with me only sharing the table. I brought to one of thee employees attention a mistake on my bill to have her reply what do you want it's not the four seasons. Exactly and Maybe that's where I should start going. I would like to visit the Booton location to see if this is Sharky's mentality or just an isolated Clifton issue. But who knows it sure ain't 4 seasons. I bought a coworker there because the food is good most of the time and it's close and practical, but after 2 visits we were totally disgusted with the service and have vowed to find somewhere else to spend our hard earned cash.
