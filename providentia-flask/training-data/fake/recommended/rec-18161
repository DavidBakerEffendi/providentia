Finally! Delicious pizza in Philadelphia. The space is cavernous, but manages to remain homey and warm. There is a huge glass covered patio that I am sure is gorgeous on a warm summer day. We ordered randomly about the menu, some secondi, contorni, pizza and antipasti, and structured it as we wanted, and there was no problem with that. Everything was delicious. The mozzarella in carrozza was really fantastic - so crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside, with a great salty finish, and the chef was quite accommodating with my request to add an egg to my Margarita Pizza (I picked up this habit at Roberta's in Brooklyn. Try it.) The Artichokes alla Giudia were perfectly crisped and browned as dark as possible without burning. The only issue, and this was minor, as we really did have a lovely meal and lovely evening, was that our server was not exactly awesome - appeared to be about 17 and didn't seem experienced or professional. Sweet, but overly eager and a bit awkward. We had to fight to hold onto our cheese plate, and our conversations were abruptly interrupted occasionally. It wasn't a problem, and didn't ruin our meal, but given the standards for all other elements in the restaurant, it was a bit out of place.
