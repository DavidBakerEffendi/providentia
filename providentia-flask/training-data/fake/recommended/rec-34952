Just had Grouchy Burger for the first time and was very satisfied! I ordered the "grouchy burger" for the fact its advertised as being very spicy and i love spicy. i didnt think it was grouchy enough but i am hard to please as far as heat goes. The menu had a variety of special burgers as well as the basic burger,and extra toppings you can add for $1. The fries were delicious! Although I didn't try anything else,the menu also offered appetizer type sides and a few other things as well! All around great place to eat!
