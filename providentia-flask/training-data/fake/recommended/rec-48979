I agree with the other two reviewers, that there is good and bad here. Yes the staff is less friendly then at King's Kid across the street but the bagels are much better.  My biggest issue is the prices, I got a bagel with cream cheese and a pint of OJ for $5.xx, this seems very expensive.  The parking stinks!
