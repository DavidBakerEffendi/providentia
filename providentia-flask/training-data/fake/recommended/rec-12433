The service was great! For starters I would recommend downloading the app NoWait that way you can "wait" in line without actually waiting at the restaurant. Since I wasn't aware of the app I waited about an hour or so but my boyfriend and I just walked around the area until we received the text that our table was ready. Anyway now for the food, the food was good! Not the best brunch I've had and definitely pricey (about $50 for two) but it was a nice place for a one time thing to try something different, especially since I went there for breakfast on my birthday. It's a small place so expect to sit very close to the table next to you. Last but not least, the milkshake I had was DELICIOUS!
