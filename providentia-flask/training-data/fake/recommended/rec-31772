Kids and I stopped here for a late lunch.  Kids split a burger and loved it, great fries, had sweet potato fry option but could not talk them into that (I wanted just a few!).  I had a garden salad with salmon - was perfect!  Great dark greens and the salmon was just enough protein to energize but not too heavy.  Loved the dressing not sure ingredients, olive oil based, great flavor with salty salmon.  Atmosphere was great too, small row home feel, tables were full even in late afternoon, must be popular with locals too.  My only negative is that if you are in a hurry this is not the place, service was slow.  We did not mind because needed a break from the heat and wanted a slow lunch.  Would have wanted to know if we had been in a time crunch.  Overall, great restaurant!
