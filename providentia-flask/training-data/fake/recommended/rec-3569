Ah I'm torn! I had an amazing time with dine-in at Chavela's the last time I went, and one of the worst delivery experiences I've ever had when I tried to order-in. Chavela's is located in a previously semi-dead zone of Crown Heights that seems to be quickly filling in with trendy bars/restaurants/shops. For now, it still stands out as one of the best meals you can get in the immediate area. The fare is mid to high-end Mexican, portions are on the small side, and food/drink prices are a bit pricey. If you can, try visiting on a Monday. Their Especiales del Dia are more reasonably priced and are actually pretty filling, and I found the Pastel Azteca to be a totally divine vegetarian option. Overall though, I wouldn't say they have huge variety for vegetarians and nearly nothing for vegans. So the delivery....oof. Chavela's gets 3 stars from me because my delivery experience was so horrible I may never go back (even for dine in). We live .7 miles away, straight down Bedford, close enough that it seems like they'd deliver right? Well 18 rude and/or unhelpful phone calls with the restaurant and incomprehensible driver and an hour and a half of waiting later, we learned that they only deliver "north of the restaurant". We eventually got our food, smashed boxes and all, close to midnight. The staff was so incompetent, including the manager we finally spoke with in the end, that I was really turned off. I'm also pretty insulted at what seems to be an overall lack of interest in serving the wider neighborhood. I know there's money north of you Chavela's, but you're really missing out on a lot of delivery customers with few other options in every other direction.
