Wow,Wow,Wow!!!  I Love This Place! You come here to Eat! This is the best tasting Italian food I've eaten anywhere. Stuffed little neck clams, Stuffed mushrooms, fried egg battered eggplant , stuffed artichokes, whole dish of fried peppers, just to name a few of the amazing appetizers served. The butter, lemon, & garlic sauce that is prepared on the clams and mushrooms you can soak up with the warm fresh Italian bread given to you when you first sit down. Linguine with garlic & oil was the bomb, sweet roasted garlic cloves the size of a 4 karat diamond. Chicken & Veal Don Pepe(fried cutlets covered with tomato brushetta, red onions so tasty) . Only cutlets ever eaten where you use a spoon to cut them, yes a spoon they are so tender. Home made bottles of wine that are great, red or white, (didn't see Brenda & Eddie, you know the king and the queen from the prom). This is not a place to come if you are looking for a romantic setting, it's one big brightly lit room, reminded me of a large Chinese restaurant setting, but you do come here to eat, and eat you will. Everything is served family style and the waiter's do a great job. For dessert, the cannoli's were just freaking out of sight. This will be my go to Italian restaurant for many years to come. They have been open since 1968 and the crowds keep coming, it's a family owned business and Mike greets you at the door. They take cash only, and are closed for vacation Feb. 17,2014 - March 3, 2014 reopening March 4.  I expect to be back on that day. Maybe I'll see you there, Ciao They do not take reservations, first come, first served!
