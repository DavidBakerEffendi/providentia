I came out here with the family after looking for a good/easy italian meal to have.  My sister lives a couple blocks away from UVA so we thought it would be a good quality meal to have.  We walked in expecting at least a 20min+ wait on a Saturday night but to our surprise, we were seated instantly.   We sat inside which is significantly louder then the outside patio but their was no wait so that plays a big part into it.  We ordered a variety of different pastas from a Vegan meal to a meat and seafood filled disk.  The vegan one was pretty bland but the other meals made up for it.  The seafood in tomato sauce dish was incredible along with the veal with ribbon pasta. Over all, this is a great small italian restaurant.  If you can, try and sit on the patio because the inside is unbelievably loud compared with the outside patio.  Service was great and the serve quality food!
