We came here for girls night dinner, 18 girls!!! We were upstairs in a relaxing, gorgeous room with a fire place and candle lit tables. They accommodated Â the large crowd with ease and the food was out of this world! I have been to Puerto Rico and didn't have food this good. I had one of the specials, the portion was huge and the flavor was outstanding. Although dinner was large, we kept room for dessert. The rum cake was moist and fresh. Please do not leave here without getting their coffee. I can't wait to come back with friends.
