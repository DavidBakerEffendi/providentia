Came with a good friend to celebrate her engagement. I had one of my best dinners ever, mainly because it was such an easy, pleasant and delightful experience. I can't wait to come back To start - amazing ambiance. We sat outside, and atmosphere was very engaging. Waitress was attentive and supportive (in terms of suggestions). Next to meatpacking, I didn't feel any pretentiousness, and noise level was just right. This place is known for its pasta (as our waitress suggested earnestly), but we were feeling more seafood (to where the menu is also weighted). A restaurant's second best specialty, proving better than almost every other seafood place in NYC that I have tried, is an indication to me of the flexibility, potential, and depth of the menu The bread - wow. A few pieces had butter, some vegetables and I believe meat already baked into it. Absolutely delicious Appetizer: We had the raw yellowtail and creamy polenta with truffed mushrooms to start. I definitely soaked the remainder of the bread in the polenta to completely clean off my plate. Yellowtail didn't have a sushi taste (good thing) and was appropriately seasoned to taste very unique and clean Main course: Black Cod with caramelized fennel and tomatoes. Fish was cooked perfectly, and with a delightful mixture of the sweet underside, crispy skin, and tender meat, i found myself cleaning off my plate, again Dessert: Chocolate cake and Banana Budino. I have always been a fan of cake with ice cream on the side. The blend of the warm fluffy cake and the sharper chilled texture of the ice cream made me (you guessed it) clean my plate again. Waitress definitely thought I was a pig Wine: Vermentino. We wanted a refreshing white wine on a muggy day, and this hit the spot. Perfect recommendation by waitress I can't wait to come back and try the pasta!
