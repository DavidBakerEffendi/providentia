Great quick meal.  Had the vermicelli with grilled pork chops & shirmp/spring rolls.  Perfect for $10.  Meat had a lot of flavor and the veggies used were fresh, crisp, and plentiful.  Might up for the rice though next time and definitely the soup on a colder day.  A beer or two would have helped but that might be in the works (and not like there aren't 42 pubs in that area for afterwards).  Would love to go back and try the traditional Banh Mi or some of the specials on the board.  Service was quick and attentive, food was brought out quickly.  Rooster sauce in massive containers is always a plus!
