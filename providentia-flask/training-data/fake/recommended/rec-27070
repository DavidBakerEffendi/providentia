I think it's safe to say this is my favorite thai restaurant in the area.  I absolutely LOVE the ambiance - I believe one of the owners actually designed the tables and some of the main pieces in there.  The red walls against candle light make for a warm and inviting meal. Foodwise? Everything I've tried has been a WIN.  From the pad thai, pineapple fried rice, massamun curry, to green curry - absolutely FANTASTIC and my go-to thai place.   I recommend Bangkok Kitchen 1000x times over. It's family owned and you def. feel like you know whose serving you dinner when you've gone there more than once.
