Dish is hands down my favorite new restaurant in downtown Hartford.  The decor is much swankier than most of the surrounding restaurants, with exposed brick walls, a granite water wall and several separate seating areas.   They have great drink specials during happy hours from 4 to 6:30, Monday thru Friday.  They also  have a daily menu special called the daily  dish, the best of which is Monday's Sweet Tea Fried Chicken.   The chop house has really fresh cuts prime beef.  For the mashed potato enthusiast  - they have the mashed potato sampler that includes 4 types of potatoes including lobster potatoes.  A big family favorite are the creamed spinach and the everything salad. You can"t go wrong with this diverse menu.
