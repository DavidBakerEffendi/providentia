I really enjoyed this place tonight. They have a good beer selection, and most of it was stuff that I've never had before.  The beer was good, I tried a bunch of stuff, and the ambience was very enjoyable.  I do, however, have some things that I didn't really like about it. Firstly, the $10 price tag on the flights only applies if you order only the cheaper beers, cheaper of course being $7 or $8.  Also, I'm pretty sure the price of the flight goes up to $14 even if you only have one of the more expensive beers in a flight of four. Secondly, they do not specify the type of beer on the menu.  This would be fine if all of the names include the type or a hint at it.  When they're in another language and/or totally foofy, though, it makes the beers a bit of a mystery.
