I love this place. Nice place to go out on a date night! Had the garlic & shrimp, chicken liver, lamb kebabs, deviled eggs,and potatoes! All the dishes were yummy but ultimate favorite was shrimp& garlic and the potatoes!! Highly recommend to try these dishes.service was awesome, a friendly atmosphere. I went on a Monday night so was not as busy then as I've heard people say its super crowded at times.
