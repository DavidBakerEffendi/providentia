Unfortunately, not the best noodle house.  If you're looking for a relatively cheap, easy to walk to noodle house because you're one of the thousands of Yale students - then knock yourself out.  The actual quality of the food is very much average.  The broth is lacking in substance and body, which to me was readily apparent just by looking at it.   Asian mommas will tell you that you can tell a lot by just looking and smelling the broth.  In terms of taste, it's a very generic experience for both noodle and soup.   I'm going to keep looking...
