Ordered some lunch specials, everything was tasty, cheap, and in the 3-starish range.  Fast friendly service.   The extra star comes from the fact that, yes, they have chicken gizzards.  Fried chicken gizzards, and you get a big fat tub of them for $4.  They were lightly battered and seasoned with 5-spice and crispy and chewy and gristle-y like gizzards should be.
