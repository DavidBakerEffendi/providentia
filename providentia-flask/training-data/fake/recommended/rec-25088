Nice place for great family fun. After looking at their website I noticed that they had a lot more to offer than I actually saw. I went with a bunch of my kid cousins there, and it was a blast. I didn't really play much of the games as I let the kids have my game credits. I did play in the laser tag which was really fun! We broke up into teams and there were lots of room to duck and run around. Large play structure for kids 12 and under, and all my cousins left w/ a smile on their face. Tons of fun indeed!
