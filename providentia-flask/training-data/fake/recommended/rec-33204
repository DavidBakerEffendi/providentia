Steam table with very competent classic Brazilian home cooking, and the grilled meats are divine--I always get some picanha and some linguiça. Once in a while, the steam tables will turn up a divine surprise, like the...  butternut-squash-meringue-thing? Desserts are as authentically sickeningly sweet as you could expect from a Brazilian restaurant.  I like this, but it's too much for some. This place really helps matar a saudade, and so cheaply. Brazilian food is very approachable, especially in this unintimidating format: I've taken several people ignorant of Brazilian food's glories here, and they've all been enthusiastic.  Give it a shot.
