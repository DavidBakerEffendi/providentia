FANCY SCHMANCY! Who knew such a beautiful restaurant was hidden behind a hospital? I was here for a party and the food I have to admit was pretty tasty. My favorite was their skirt steak, roasted vegetables, and mashed potatoes. I think I will have to make a trip here on my own one day and have a real sit down dinner. I think it'd be lovely!
