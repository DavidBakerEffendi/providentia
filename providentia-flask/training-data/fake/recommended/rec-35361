Chicken, Lamb, rice, and white sauce....don't bother me I'm gorging!! One of the best meals after some fun and drinks around town, on a nice night, the line can get ridiculously long but it goes by fast.  If you don't want the full "tourist" experience, there's a few other carts by the same company, a block away in just about every direction but north.  Even at the "tourist" experience there's a local's line.. shady people! welcome to NYC.
