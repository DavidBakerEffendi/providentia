My husband and I happen to just stumble upon this little place while spending our last day in New York.  We sat up at the bar for almost 4 hours drinking tasty Tamarind, Habanero and Grapefruit margaritas.  We snacked on yummy guacamole, tacos and churros dipped in chocolate all the while listening to great music.  We especially enjoyed the music, it was if it was taken right out of my rhapsody play list.  They played everything from Dillon to sublime  and everything in between, a very eclectic mix of music.  The atmosphere was warm and inviting with a mix of friendly people and bar tenders.   Barrio Chino is a "must go to" spot  while in the L.E.S.  And if you go, make sure to either sit up at the bar or at the tables that are in the wall to ceiling windows that over look the street.
