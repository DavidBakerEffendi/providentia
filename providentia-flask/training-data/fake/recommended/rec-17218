The only things that really suck with this place is if you are going during what I like to call "high tide". When the restaurant is busy, which it usually is, you have to wait. Normally, that is not a problem. I'm good at waiting. But just not on an overcrowded staircase for over an hour. That is def. a fire hazard. The wait staff is trying to squeeze past you. Some people are going up stairs, others down stairs. And the staircase is narrow. And you have to wait on the staircase otherwise if you don't hear your table name called out you are screwed. With all the money that that restaurant makes per night you'd imagine that they can at least order a table seating queuing system that vibrates and lights up when your table is ready. Because honestly i'd prefer to wait outside...in the rain! And I have waited outside...in the rain... while my party took turns having to sacrificially wait on the staircase like a soldier staying up at night so that the rest of the platoon can sleep. But the food is really good ;)
