They have probably the best "veggie burger" that I've ever eaten.  You will not leave hungry!  I think it's also impossible to leave Sketch in a bad mood.  If you don't like playing with crayons then you don't belong here.  We once arrived close to closing and were still served a full meal with milkshakes with zero attitude.  Didn't think existed in Philly!
