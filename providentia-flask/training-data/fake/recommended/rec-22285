Visiting a couple friends in NY, and as a somewhat avid Yelper, it's a little hard to let go of control and let other plebes pick out the restaurant - however, they did me right. This time. Holy freaking goodness everything we got here was close to the best of that category I've ever had. Cheese plate? Gouda, sheep and chedda' = dope. Especially that kinderhook sheep, daaaaamn. Pulled Lamb sliders? Don't mind if I do. Brussels sprouts flatbread? Competitive with the cheese for best thing all night. Mac and cheese? More along the standard route, but is that bad? I'll answer it for you - no, no it's not bad. Mac and Cheese is always good. The waiter recommended a great white wine for us, and I had the Nocturnal cocktail afterwards. What a place. Sorry friends, for doubting you. But I'll probably keep doubting you anyway.
