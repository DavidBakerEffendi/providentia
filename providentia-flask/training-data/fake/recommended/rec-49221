I am in a pork coma.  Since I cannot think, here is what my party ate. - bottle Prosecco ($40) - onion brioche - soggy toast (delish) - baked chicken and mashed potato - Steak au poivre - pork....ah.... the pork. freaking amazing - pot au chocolat - pot du...ah.... caramel - le chevre A. Maz. Ing. Okay, I'm tipsy but this was a great meal.  Went on a Thurs night at 7pm, was told 40 min wait, I think we were seated about 1 hour 10 minutes later but hey it was worth it. We had a drink at the Barrow St. ale house around the corner while we waited.  It's better for 2 people, we were 3. You can sit at the bar too.  No reservations. Host Adam was sweet and our server was a real peach - great recommendations and did I mention a peach? I can still taste the caramel. Thank you JL.
