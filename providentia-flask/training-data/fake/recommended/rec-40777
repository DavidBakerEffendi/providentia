What can I say? This is one of my favorite restaurants. The pho is DELICIOUS. I always order a number 2, with steak and brisket. The pho comes with a plate of bean sprouts, thai basil, culantro(i think), sliced jalapenos, and lime. This allows you to doctor up your pho the way you like it. Add some sriracha...maybe a squirt of fish sauce...golden! I think I am seriously addicted to the hoisin sauce as well. I love dipping my meat in it. *snickers* The meal would not be complete without the jasmine tea they give you while waiting for your order (it takes them like less than 5 minutes to deliver a steaming bowl to your table), as well as some vietnamese coffee...rich, robust...floating on a cloud of condensed milk, poured over ice or hot. Seriously, if you don't know about vietnamese coffee, and you're a coffee drinker? Well...you need to learn. If you're not a coffee fan, order the jackfruit smoothie. I eat at Pho Ha at least once a week. I have also brought at least a dozen people there so that they could experience it for the first time. You will get a fulfilling meal that only costs about 6 bucks...perfection.
