Came here for my 27th Birthday with a group of 10 and have ZERO complaints.  The staff was awesome and didn't give us a hard time for being kind of obnoxious due to large consumptions of alcoholic beverages.   As for the food... AMAZING!!! The pork buns and these pancake appetizers were beyond delicious and the ramen is not the cheap college bricks you are used to. It's more like gourmet ramen on steroids.  The cold and hot sake was also excellent! Group of ten, lots of apps, ramen and drinks - bill was somewhere around $450.  Everyone was more than satisfied and had a great time. I will return for sure!
