I absolutely loved this place! We made a reservation and got seated pretty quickly. At first the table seemed very close to the table next to us, but it was actually fine and I could hear my friend just fine. The service was superb - our waitress was very attentive, and the food came very quickly. I got the mushroom crusted virgin chicken, which was AMAZING. I could taste the truffle broth and it wasn't overpowering. The broth and the risotto together was a good sauce combo for the chicken. The portion size was also perfect, though for the very hungry you might want to order an appetizer as well. My friend got the fettuccine with basil marinated gulf shrimp, which he enjoyed very much as well. I also got a watermelon martini, which was a summer special. It was very alcoholic but still delicious. I didn't get dessert, but the menu looked amazing. I absolutely loved this place, and I am definitely going to come back many, many times.
