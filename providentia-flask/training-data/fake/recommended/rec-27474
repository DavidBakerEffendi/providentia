I want to clarify, I am a burger fiend. While this burger was not so good as to come back for a repeat performance as of yet, it is worth making a visit. This is definitely the top dog (top cow?) in the non-traditional burger category. I went to this place completely on a whim by myself for lunch on a nice day last summer. The window door things onto the street were open making for a delightful breeze and excellent people watching. I had the Bronte burger. The ciabatta bread is ingenious. It's almost as good as english muffin burgers. The burger itself was mouthwatering meaty goodness. That little sauce is fantastic. And the fact that they serve it with a side salad and not a crap ton of fires which you have zero desire to eat after stuffing your face with burgery goodness was the cherry on top. My friend popped in to say hello mid lunch and also loved the burger. Sometimes, when conversation lulls, we look into each other's eyes and say "Remember that burger at Ruby's?"
