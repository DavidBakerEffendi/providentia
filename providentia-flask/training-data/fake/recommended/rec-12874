I arrived at 0915 on a Sunday.  Was seated at 1000.  Tried the "famous" blueberry pancakes, honey bacon and a filter coffee. Meh..good, but nothing spectacular.  Best part was the maple butter.  I would have been seriously upset if I had waited for 3 hours... that was the wait time that people arriving at 1030 were being told.  Don't believe the hype over this place.
