This place is fan-fricken-tastic!!! The red curry is absolutely heavenly - my friend got it and I kept eating off of her plate. I got he pad Thai - also amazing but the curry was the for sure winner. The service is amazing. I can't count how many times my water glass was filled! We went for the lunch special which is a great deal! You get a soup or salad, a small appetizer (we did the dumplings and the spring roll) and your entree which your choice of meat. We both got chicken - only $9! So amazing for the price!!! You must go here if you want great Thai!
