Perilla seems to be hit or miss.  First hit: it has a lovely and calm atmosphere and excellent service.  A very laid back place which felt like a nice escape from the swarms on a Saturday night. Second hit: the crispy boar belly and crab appetizers are awesome.  The pork belly has a succulent layer of fat and the crab was sweet and delicious.  First miss: the tuna appetizer.  It tasted like . . . . like . . . . nothing.  Weird, I know. Third hit: the duck.  Mixed reviews at the table, but I thought it was very lean and flavorful.  Second miss: the rabbit done three different ways.  The cabbage bun of rabbit was a bit too much meat and the seasoning was way too sweet for me.  The fried rabbit fat was a big pass, and the rabbit in a sliced roll was too dry and lacking in flavor. Fourth hit: the chocolate souffle.  The right way to end a meal at Perilla.
