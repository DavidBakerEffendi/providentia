As often as I get food at Temple, I've only ever eaten at the crepe truck once.  It has nothing to do with the food, but rather has to do with the fact that the truck isn't near any of the buildings I go to, and I'm too lazy to walk the extra block or two. Anyway, the one time I went there, the guys in the truck were really nice, and the crepe was very good.  I got the chicken Ceasar crepe.  If I ever rouse myself to walk over there again, I think I'd like to try one of their fruit crepes next time.  Definitely try this place.
