My stroke of luck with this place had been unintentional.  Apparently I have always gone there on weekdays and never realized it.  The people who push and shove and pile in the 5 x 5 space on the weekend are touristy and horrible and have zero concept of proxemics. However.....I discovered that Prosperity Dumpling isn't just a denizen for pork dumplings. A recent vegetarian wager left me forlorn thinking I wouldn't have them again, but then I discovered their steamed vegetarian dumplings.  They don't have the same fried sensation of a coronary, but they are just as tasty. And from now on I will be happy to wait for a fresh from the wok sesame pancake with vegetables.  The difference is amazing!  And it was great before, but to get it fresh is a whole new dumpling party! So good, an obsession with this place is totally normal.
