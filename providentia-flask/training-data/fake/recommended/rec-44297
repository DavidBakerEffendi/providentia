I'm a big BBQ fan, I've cooked for two so far, and I am always looking for local 'que to compare. When my family here up north told me they liked this new BBQ joint in the neighborhood, I was already out the door and reading reviews. I hate to disagree with family and fans, but I can't in good conscience give a restaurant with "smoke" right there in the name a better review. Smoke-Box was a big letdown for me - they did not deliver the full flavor meat I expect from when I visit BBQ. The distinct color and rich flavor imparted from many hours in a smoker was sadly absent from both the brisket and the pork. The plates they offer ($9 or $12 box) are pretty cool, your meat comes on top of tortilla chips, fries, or salad and extra stuff can top it off and sides can be added. However, they also ask which of their sauces - sweet, mustard, or vinegar - you would like and serve it pre-applied. This is a very suspect practice where I come from and many consider it a compensation for weak meat. I asked for my sauce on the side but received it tossed in the stuff anyway. The cole slaw was forgettable, but not really bad and the fries were kinda soggy and certainly didn't benefit from the wet meat on top. The side Caesar salad I did for whatever reason, lack of other greens I think, actually complimented my brisket that had been tossed in vinegar sauce pretty nicely, and the pickled onions were tasty. Smoke-Box isn't bad for a quick lunch and a fairly inexpensive one at that, but don't expect the powerful smells or well-developed taste of smokey BBQ to welcome you warmly outside or in. And there's no beer, just sayin...
