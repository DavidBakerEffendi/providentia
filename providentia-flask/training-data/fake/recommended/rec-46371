Best duck I've ever had. Small portions on some of the dishes, so be prepared.  We cleverly split the chicken between two people and then had duck and halibut (both a bit small), the chicken is so large that the portions evened out. Service was terrific, thoughtful and willing to spend more time with us (when appropriate) than most places.  Their bartender lengthily demonstrated to my mom how rye whiskey is different from bourbon.  That guy ought to get a raise. Oh, we spent a week in NYC going to quite a lot of well-reviewed Yelp spots, this one was far and away our favorite.  If you can afford a somewhat pricey meal, this is the one you'll want to.
