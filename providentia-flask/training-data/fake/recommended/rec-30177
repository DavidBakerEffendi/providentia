This is one of the best places I've dined at in New York. Truly a gem. Definitely worth the trip to Astoria. Prices are very reasonable. So many delicious items on the menu, that I suggest you share a bunch of plates with your friends. I went gaga for the meat and cheese plates. Love a good charcuterie plate and they have an excellent selection. Paninis are large and can easily be shared. Save room for dessert. The outdoor patio is cozy, too.
