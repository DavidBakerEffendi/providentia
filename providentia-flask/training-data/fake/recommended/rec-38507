There was a time when this place was the bomb.  Their sandwiches were always on point - even if the service, cleanliness, and general ambiance were a bit in the lacking.  The food was so great, that it didn't matter if the rest of the experience sucked.  That's changed. The chicken cheesesteak was the no-brainer choice whenever I was lucky enough to be eating here.  Over time the sandwich quality turned for the worse.  There were a few guys who worked the grill that could cook a pretty mean sandwich, but they seem to have moved on to better things.  Now it ranges from half cooked to over-done mess.   If you've been going here over the years you've probably noticed the inverse relationship between size of your sandwich and its price.  My last visit I paid $9 something (including tax) for a wrap (they run out of bread everyday) the size of my fist.   When they do have bread, you'll notice they cut off the ends of the sandwich to use as the accompanying piece of bread for cup of soups. The cake slices used to vary from average to tiny.  They fixed that issue - they're all tiny now.  I understand the cakes (which are baked and delivered by a third party) are expensive, but you can't help but feel ripped off.   The cakes in the case look like a mess, which is in line with the general experience.   The service has always sucked and I can't really blame the people working there.  They're not making much and working in crappy conditions.  I'd be sour too. Save your cash. There's a dozen other vegan options within a five minute walk.
