Burger #242: Front 242? I really hate that band. While at dinner #1 (previous review), I was discussing the burger at Minetta Tavern that I had to eat right after. But there happened to be local New Yorker at our table who swore that Minetta was over-hyped and Coner Bistro was THE place to go for burgers in NYC. So being the trusting fellow I am, that's where myself and a coworker walked to right after our Italian dinner. Corner Bistro is basically a bar with a few dirty tables in the back. We ordered the burger, medium-rare, with fries and some scotch. A few minutes later, our burger was presented before us. yelp.com/biz_photos/8XLh… It looked simple enough; very light charring, fully melted cheese, and ample bacon. The smell was very homemade, as if someone bought a 5lb tube of 80/20 meat and cooked it on a flat top grill. It ended up tasting just like that as well. The burger was thick, under-seasoned, and uninspired. It was a tad overcooked and not cooked that evenly. The bacon was nice, but didn't fill in the much needed salt gap. yelp.com/biz_photos/8XLh… Past that, the fries were pretty bad. Bad enough to be left uneaten by a pair of men who needed something to snack on with their scotch. Overall, it was a lackluster meal that not only failed to deliver on the promise of a great burger, but also left me overcome with desire for a good burger that we left and started walking to Minetta Tavern. To be continued...
