You'd think for a place called Room Service, they'd have decent service.. I guess their waiters didn't get the memo. I'll be honest, the hostess was nice and seated us as soon as everyone was there. 1 star for hostess, 1 star for food. Here's when thing started to go downhill. The glasses of water they gave us were DISGUSTING. The outside of the glass was sticky and clearly not washed. The meal was good, I got the half chicken, and it was delicious. But then, and this is what really irked me about this place, I wasn't even done with my dish, and waiters and busboys kept asking me if i was done with my food. And it's not like i was sitting there with my napkin on my plate (the universal sign for "i'm done" and if you don't know that you really have no business being a waiter) but I was still actively eating!!! I was trying to eat and have a conversation and TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE came by to ask me if I was done, FOUR TIMES IN A ROW within a 5 minute period. It was like they were watching me take every bite, then asking me if that was my last one. Seriously, don't ask me if i'm done eating when you're standing there watching me put food in my mouth. I'm NEVER going back to this place and if i do, it would only be to follow your stupid waiters around, asking them "are you done? are you done? are you done? are you done?"
