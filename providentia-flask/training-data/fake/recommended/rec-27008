This was the highlight of my visit to New York this past weekend! I came here with a friend and we both got the Chef's Dessert Assortment. I got the Twelve Trees Oolong tea and it was amazing! It was a flavorful yet light tea and possibly the best tea I've had! The ice cream was great (green tea) + macaron + an amazing black sesame creme brulee. Absolutely great atmosphere (very relaxing), plus amazing tea, dessert and best of all, amazingly attentive service! I would absolutely go back!
