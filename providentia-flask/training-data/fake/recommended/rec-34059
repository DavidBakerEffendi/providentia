This place was recommended to us by two people on the street we had asked for directions.  It's delicious!  A hint for those of you going there w/o GPS - the awning says something like  "Middle Eastern Food" on it, but the restaurant name is (slyly) printed underneath. Chill atmosphere - cozy inside, and hip outside.  Big picnic tables outside with cool graffiti - "European" style seating where other parties sit at your picnic table.   The menu is organized by the size of the plates:  Small plates range from $8-12, Medium $11-15, and Large $15-25   BONUS: It's BYOB!!  (I consider it a bonus because it keeps the price of the bill down quite a bit, and you can bring whatever you want.) The menu is small, but very creative, including interesting combinations of flavors and somewhat deceptive names.  For example, the wasabi pork "shumai"  were more like little deep-fried meatballs, but they were oh-so-good.  And there was some sort of coconut pureé underneath...yum.    We had a seafood dish which included clams and prawns in a tomato sauce with fresh local bread.  Also, the nachos were killer.  They aren't really nachos, they are more like deep-fried pierogies but these were the tastiest morsel of the evening. We spent about $40, including tip.   Service was friendly and attentive, and the experience was overall quite excellent.
