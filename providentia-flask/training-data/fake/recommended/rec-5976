Continental is a nice, modern diner - reminiscent of hipper joints in bigger cities like LA or NY. It's still fun looking enough - though I imagine the day the decor is passe. The food is solid and well prepared - from pancakes to grilled tuna. That said, I think the more typical diner dishes - burgers, breakfast and the like - are more successful than the Asian-ish concoctions. Most recently we had nice waiter who explained that the Ahi was prepared by rolling it in sesame seeds and then introducing it to a very hot pan. Later in the meal, with my cup empty for some time, I tracked him down and asked him to introduce some coffee to my mug. While this place can get super busy, it's Americana and you're in and out fairly quickly. Standouts include the young hotties at the front desk and the fun styling.
