According to Wikipedia: A salt lick is a salt deposit that animals regularly lick...salt/mineral licks  provide the sodium, calcium, iron, phosphorus and zinc required for bone, muscle and other growth in deer and other wildlife, such as moose, elephants, cattle, woodchucks, domestic sheep, fox squirrels, mountain goats and porcupines. If you are not a nutrient deficient wild animal, and especially if you have high blood pressure, I would strongly suggest staying from Osteria.  Even the bread is intensely salted.
