Went here on a Tuesday night place was almost empty. We were seated and waited on right away. Salads and drinks came out quickly. The salad was average.  We ordered the beef strip, shepherds pie and Cajun chicken . All were perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious! The only complaint would be that the steak was lukewarm, but not cold enough to be sent back.  Will go again for sure, hopefully the service and food are just as good when it's busy!
