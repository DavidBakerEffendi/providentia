No wait no hassle ! I went with a friend (table for 2) and almost got seated immediately on a Tuesday night at 7:00pm. Just waited 5 minutes for them to clean the table. Food: The Royale. There's a chunk of spare ribs meat on top of the patty (it's not the size of the patty as I assumed haha but still perfect size for the burger). Delicious. Just enough juice and fat. Every bite melted in my mouth. I don't know how that's possible with beef ! haha. Personally, my most recommended burger of any burgers I've ever had. Also ordered Margarita, tatortots, and truffle fries. All delicious. The truffle fries didn't stand out much but still delicious nonetheless. Margarita was perfectly made. Service: Friendly. Jasmine was very nice and helpful. There weren't many waiters/waitresses that night but she still stood her ground haha.
