We have traveled to NYC for the past two years and we have been here at least 4 times. YES, its THAT good. I was referred here by a friend telling me "they have the best pancakes in the world". Now I haven't been all over the world, but I imagine it would be quite difficult to find anything close. The maple butter is a culinary masterpiece. Everything is fresh, made to order and just the right portion. The chorizo is splendid, not greasy with great flavor. The potatoes are made just right with the perfect combination of crunch and soft. Fresh squeezed orange juice, fresh jams for your bread... oh just thinking about this place makes my mouth water. To those who complain about the long wait.... I say, the best things in life are worth waiting for. Clinton St. Baking Co. is definitely worth waiting for!!
