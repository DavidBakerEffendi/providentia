Grabbed lunch earlier. Really nice. They mentioned they just added local wines to their menu. By the bottle only. Had a nice white wine, pretty good for $20. First time there, on a road trip, but was great. I had the gnocchi special, delicious, $11, fresh, appropriate (on the smaller side) portions. We came at a weird time so it was empty but by the time we left people were trickling in. Oh and the outdoor seating was very comfortable.
