Considering that I'm a Crown Heights local (and trust me Crown Heights locals still consider Washington Ave. part of Crown Heights and I'll be damned if any broker can convince me that for a 2-3 block stretch between Crown Heights and Park Slope lies a mystical, magical  gem known as "Prospect" Heights.  Get off it.)  Anyway...considering that I'm a Crown Heights local I was surprised to never have been to this place in all my years here.  My mother actually introduced me to the place last year.  As everyone has said the owner is really nice.  The orange slices and cookies are great.  The ambience is totally funky with the vintagey vibe and the floral disguise outside (you wouldn't even know there was a diner inside).  The Lemon Ricotta pancakes are fantastic.  As a matter of fact I recommend any style of pancake for the simple fact that they serve it with 3 different flavors of butter.  Yum.  Yes, the owner closes very early and they are closed on Sundays.  No complaints here....just saying...you should make a note of it.
