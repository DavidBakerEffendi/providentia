The atmosphere of this place -- chalkboard with the menu specials, sunflowers, green apples, light, open, and airy reminds one of the feel-good, save-the-earth vibe of Ikea. Inside it gets very crowded and noisy. Very hard to have a conversation without shouting and trying not to listen to your neighbors'. The best bet is to sit outside, and look at the lovely Spruce St. brownstones, while dining on flat breads and the like. The food is pretty good, interesting (have had ostrich as a daily special) and the waiters attentive.
