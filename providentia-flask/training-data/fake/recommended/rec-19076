Another birthday for my wife. The french are odd people, so that makes this place odd. Two of our friends that attended grew up in the lower east side and remembered this place being a crack house in the 80's and 90's. Its amazing what the french can do with realestate.But what I found really amazing was that the food is prepared on a sheet of metal and a toaster oven. Great food and the prices are cheap. There was only one waitress and I think she was not happy with our group. Very LOUD and the place is pretty small. All it was for us was a meeting place to group up and then go out. GOOD: WINE BEER and FOOD was great. BAD: The french will always rub off on me as a s sholes, But I will go back for dinner with just my wife.
