At Hai Street Kitchen & Co, sushi and burritos have put Â aside their differences and joined together to together to create a super force set for food domination. City of Brotherly Love indeed. I had seen the concept executed well in San Francisco, but never have seen anything like this on the East Coast so I was very intrigued. When I arrived I had no idea what to order, there were plenty of choices and I had just one stomach. Le sigh! The friendly counter person said that the salmon was the most popular on the menu but his personal favorite was the chicken katsu. I was sold. It was topped with a teriyaki sauce, romaine lettuce, red onion, red cabbage and green papaya salad. And because I'm fat like that, I added some wasabi guacomole and fried shallots on top as well...as well as a side of freshly made tempura corn. I was happy with the size of my sushirrito, it was not too big and not too small. However, I found it a bit dry and lacking of flavor I ate all the chicken inside before giving up. Perhaps I should have gotten the salmon instead. The tempura corn on the other hand completely satiated my hunger for all things salty and fried. Those little buggers are addictive and before I knew it my little paper box was just a small puddle of oil.
