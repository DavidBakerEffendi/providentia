Stay away! I would give this place negative stars if I could.  First, the cheese steak: the beef was dry and tough, the onions were raw (rather than sauteed as they should've been), there were no peppers (not to mention mushrooms), and it was served with cheese wiz, rather than, um, actual cheese.   Second, the price: $9 for a bad sandwich following a notable wait in line is a scam. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the staff and environment of the place: Geno's is arguably xenophobic, with signs like, "This is America, speak English!" Never mind that we don't have a national language and that the founder of Geno's was Italian and so presumably spoke, uh, Italian.  There was also a shrine-like photo to a cop who had been killed 30 years ago, which struck me as, well, odd and perhaps obsessive?  Then there were the in your face photos of Geno with Glenn Beck, Geno with Rush Limbaugh and, oh look, Geno with Sean Hannity! Then of course there were the token pictures of scantily clad teenagers (females, of course).  Overall it was really (white) trashy decor.  The staff aren't worth much commentary - they were generally trashy (as in, I wonder if they even washed their hands today and eww, they're handling my sandwich), middle-aged, a-hole-ish and couldn't care less whether they filled your order correctly or not. So, given all this, why would ANYONE go to this place? There's not one selling point that I can think of...
