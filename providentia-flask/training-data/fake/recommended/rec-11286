The Spruce St location is my favorite Tria spot, as it has a more intimate feel than some of the others. I'm a wine drinker while most of my friends drink beer, so their lengthy lists for both usually allow everyone to find something to their liking. The food is always delicious - everything I've eaten from their menu has been tasty. The waitstaff is always friendly & knowledgeable; when I've asked for suggestions, I've almost always enjoyed the recommendation.
