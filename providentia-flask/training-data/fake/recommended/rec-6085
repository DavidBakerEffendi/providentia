I have made this beautiful small restaurant my second home since it opened its doors. It is a one of a kind restaurant --from its decor to the food: It's authentic southern French, and so are the chef & his wife, the lovely/ gracious host/ manager you will get to see every time you are there. Every dish is well thought-out, and well archived at every level. The service is always GREAT - very friendly, attentive and simple. I always leave amazed at how authentic this place is. It's not your typical hypster type of place ...it's a breath of fresh air in Williamsburg. Highly recommended!
