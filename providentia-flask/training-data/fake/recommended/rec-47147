Sunday Brunch Review We walked in without a reservation around 11:00 am and had our choice of inside or outside seating. Pretty rare for a hot-spot in the West Village that doesn't take reservations. We were seated inside, but unfortunately half way through our meal a party was sat behind us that aggressively pushed their seats to hit mine. There was a table with more space for them a few feet away from us, where they could comfortably sit without invading my personal space. For once can I dine in NYC without feeling cramped? Sigh... But their food was delicious. The menu is simple enough, your standard brunch options, but there is nothing wrong with that, if you do it right. I got the Eggs Benedict and it was perfectly done. So good and we somehow had room for dessert and got their french toast. Again, delicious. I don't live in NYC but the NYCers I was with were excited to try the place out for dinner. Which I imagine is probably the better time to experience Extra Virgin, with someone you're on a 3rd date with, at dinner. Just think how much they'll blush when they hear where you're taking them.
