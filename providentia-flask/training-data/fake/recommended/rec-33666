Great food. Great service. Went there at 8pm on a Friday night and was seated immediately. We ordered a delicious artichoke appetizer, which came out in a very timely manner. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, and very quickly replaced my wine when I noted that the glass was dirty. I had a daily special of pappardelle with roasted tomatoes and ricotta. It was delicious and a very decent portion. All the ingredients were fresh and Â flavorful. Even the bread and parsley/olive oil sauce they provided as a complementary appetizer were delicious. One downfall - the restaurant is cash only. I will definitely go back there again.
