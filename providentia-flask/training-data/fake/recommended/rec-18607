Eat half of the Lamazou Favorite (prosciutto, mozzarella, roasted peppers) and save the other half. Now... try not to touch/completely maul it for the next 20 minutes because it's just not possible. Other options like the Smart Duck sounded appealing and it's something I'll definitely want to consider next time. It's just that, I'm the type of person that once I've found that ONE thing/combo I love at a restaurant it's really tough for me to want to explore elsewhere (ex. Chipotle)... But, this one's the winner. The Lamazou Favorite is really all I need in this lifetime. Lolz, just kidding. It's great though! Sandwich is a bit pricey -- about $11, with the option of choosing halfsies for it, but you don't want that... You want the entire sandwich and you want every. single. sexy. bite. of. it.
