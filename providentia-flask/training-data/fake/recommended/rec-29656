While wondering Little Italy, we decided upon Benito One based upon the reviews here on Yelp and the price rating.  I would agree with the other reviewers in that the food was superb and the service as well.  However, the price was a bit more than we expected.  We had the veal parmesan, fettuccine Alfredo, and the Penne Arribita.  All of our dishes were outstanding.  My wife really enjoyed her veal.  The portions were good and the waiter was very attentive.  After a couple of glasses of house wine - the whole bill with tip topped a hundred dollars.  If your looking for good food in Little Italy, this is the place.  The price was more than expected, but truly on par with the rest of the surrounding restaurants, and well worth it.
