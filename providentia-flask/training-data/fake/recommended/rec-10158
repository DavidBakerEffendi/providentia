First of all the decor in this place is really amazing. Very "Alice in Wonderland". The only thing bad I can say is maybe the chandelier (even though its gorgeous) maybe just a wee too big for the space....just sayin" The employees seem to take a lot of pride in playing the role, with goofy fadoras/headbands and black attire......looks more Japanese Couture than Thai but thassss coo... Honestly I am still trying to figure out why Yum Yum has 3 restaurants on the same block almost, but regardless I think Room Service has them beat. The plate presentation is really nice and its one of the only Asian style restaurants that I have been to that has Chrysanthemum Tea (served in a cast iron pot) on their menu. A great alternative to the very fattening and very American Thai iced tea. The food is very tasty and they have really good lunch prices. A great place to take out of town guests. They will be impressed.
