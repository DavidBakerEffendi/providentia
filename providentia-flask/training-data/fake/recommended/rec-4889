another great sign that South street is up and coming. I went here for a decadent lunch with a friend to celebrate. We started with the planter's punch--it had a nicely alcoholic punch that started our celebrations off in the right way. We split the southern caesar salad, which she loved and I liked (full disclosure--I'm not a huge Caesar fan). I had the jambalaya, which was awesome--nice and spicy. Very good. Since then I've also been back for the salmon entree and the shrimp and grits at brunch, all very good. What really makes this place, though, is the drinks and the desserts. The sweet potato turnovers are wonderful, the pie is excellent, and the bread pudding is decadent. I also recommend all the drinks--I've tried them all--but my favorite remains the planter's punch. Definitely a great addition to the neighborhood!
