A Saturday night 4 of us popped in off the street, every table filled. I new better than eat out on Sat. but with friends and it worked out that way. VERY inviting atmosphere and music. Everyone was eating. We waited for over 1 hour at the bar, but good company so OK. Very nice waiter. Got an appetizer at the bar-very tasty eggplant, but it was cold in spots. hummm It took another 1/2 hour to be seated. Starving we each ordered a different special to speed things up we thought, but 1 HOUR later, came the 4 plates. No offering of something to tie us over meantime as we had to ask for  the bread. Person #1 order of branzino was a very very tiny portion but loved it in 3 bites. Person #2 lamb chops were good. Person #3 steak was way way too salty, person #4 large shrimp wrapped in bacon was very tough, tasty however, but risotto very bland. Was told finally that the sous chef started only 3 days ago and wish we knew somehow how long we would have to wait. Oh well. toooo hungry and unfamiliar with Bedford. We will try again for sure, and chalk it up to just a bad experience.  Hope the sous chef gets it together. Great atmosphere and music. and we will make reservations next time. happens.
