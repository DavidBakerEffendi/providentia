Margaritas are good. That's it. Want real Mexican go to taco Riendo at 5th and Thompson. This places blows, it's not even good Mexican American. The shrimp tacos were white. Shrimp is supposed to have a tan or red color to it and you can tell how frozen and old there shrimp was cause it was pure white. They were chewy and flavorless. My boyfriend ordered the chicken tacos which seemed to have flavor but were incredibly dry.
