What a find! Before I moved to Philly, I came here to visit and wanted to check this place out after seeing it on Man vs. Food. On the show, they feature the roasted pork sandwich with broccoli and provolone. So we ordered one of those along with a brisket sandwich because the brisket looked fantastic. In my opinion, the brisket is better than the pork. To be fair, I've never really like pork much anyways. But that brisket is amazing, and somewhat surprising too, because I don't think of Italians for their brisket. When I think brisket, I think Jewish Brisket and Texas Brisket. I am a big fan of both. But man this brisket is also amazing! The first time I was here the line was extremely long, but the last time I was here, it wasn't bad at all. I think I had beat the lunch rush. The guys who work the counter are very nice, friendly, and helpful. I was surprised because the last time I was here I felt rushed. Maybe because it wasn't that busy this time. Each time I come to the Reading Terminal Market I've eaten here, and it will be tough next time because there looks like so many other great things to try too!
