"Lychee Valentine" must have been the most romantic crepe I've ever tasted. With edible rose petals and rose custard cream, it could easily be a Valentine's Day snack destination. The bacon in the "Eight Turn Crepe" was likewise memorable; not your typical bacon. Though the crepes did not look as plentiful as the pictures show, with ingredients spilling out, service was pleasant and smiles were abundant. Only wish the place was bigger so I could always depend on sitting and enthusiastically devouring my crepe then and there.
