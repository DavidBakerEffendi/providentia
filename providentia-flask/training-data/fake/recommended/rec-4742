I found out about this place by browsing the web for the best vegan spots in Philly. This cafe came up again and again and, after checking it out, I can see why. Grindcore is entirely vegan with lower prices than most vegan spots I've been to. I started out with their bottomless coffee. It was brewed to perfection and their creamer options expanded beyond mere soy to rice milk almond milk and coconut milk. Service was helpful and friendly. There's a great seating area in the back with AC, a "radical" library and free wifi. I did some work there and had two more cups of coffee. I finished my visit with a chocolate pb brownie. It was a little oily for my taste but absolutely delicious, especially considering it was entirely vegan. I will be returning to try the cinnamon bun which is apparently very popular! If you like coffee or are a vegan/ vegetarian be sure to check out this spot
