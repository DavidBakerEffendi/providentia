I sometimes have to try very hard not to eat at Han Dynasty more than once a day. My fiance and I first went to Han Dynasty shortly after they opened because it's on our block. We didn't know at the time that it would become an addiction. Â We were lucky enough to get to know Han before the Best of Philly and three bell rating from Craig LeBan, and he's given us quite an education on Sichuan food. We've tried just about every main dish on the menu, the tasting menu and several things that aren't on any menu, but Han happens to have something special he wants us to try. Some of our favorites include the fish and tofu in hot sauce, cumin-style lamb or beef and dry fry lamb or beef. The cucumbers and dan dan noodles are also fantastic. If you're looking for authentic, mouth-numbing, completely addictive food and a unique experience, come in a let Han take you on a tour of his menu. It's well worth it.
