I felt like I was cheating on Pho Dang when I paid Pho Hong a visit, but it was worth my guilt. ;)  I'm a huge fan of their egg rolls stuffed with a filling similar to crab rangoon.  Pho Hong's atmosphere wins hands down if you are comparing the two places, the price points are the same (super affordable) and it is BYOB also -- always fun.  Try it!
