The service was substandard. Meals were delivered haphazardly. Of a party of 6 one person did not receive their meal until the other diners had finished. The wait staff was not attendent. The noise level was so high that it was extremely difficult to communicate with the wait staff let alone each other. The quality of the food was so-so. Including the gratuity in the bill was the last straw. Disrespectful. Overall far below the expectations of a Steven Starr restaurant. Last time I patronize this establishment.
