The food here is great. They lose one star because the room feels a bit tight (would have been OK if the table 6 inches away wasn't annoying) and only two of the entree's are "really" Mexican. Try the hanger steak or the sea scallops. Both were excellent and the service was fast. Expect to pay $25/person for an entree and an (alcoholic) drink.
