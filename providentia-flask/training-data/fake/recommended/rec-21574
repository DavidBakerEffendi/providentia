The Buffalo chicken wings here are "bangin'." I think Silk City serves some of  the best in the city.  They have a nice spicy, kick without the heat from the hot sauce over powering each bite. The wings are nice and meaty.  Not over cooked or dry.  We saw a bunch of other tables with them ordered, after our plate was empty.   Definitely, a solid choice for wing lovers.
