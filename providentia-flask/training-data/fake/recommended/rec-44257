Best dining experience I've had in New Haven so far!   The atmosphere was really fun (it's owned and operated parents & their kids) and our server, Yvette, was super friendly.  Not to mention the delicious food... Reservation recommended  - we saw people getting turned away I really recommend trying  the bread with cheese and tomato (I forget what it was called.. bottom item on the first page)... best bruschetta I've ever had hands down I will be back!!
