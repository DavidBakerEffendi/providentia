Hearing we were going to Lidia's I'd expected a lot... but was sadly disappointed by the food. I had ordered the seared ahi salad which had a positively enormous piece of fish and some lightly dress arugula, which may have been my error. Others had the pasta though and that was "meh" too. The service was amazing though, with the staff finding ways to keep a four year old happy, even going so far as to quasi-entertain him.
