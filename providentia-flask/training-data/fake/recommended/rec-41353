I have to be honest, I often forget to review so many places that I have been to and enjoyed or NOT, but this is just one of those places, I should have reviewed ages AGO! Shame on me! This is hands-down one of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn! I was taken here for my birthday some years ago and fell in love with it then! It's very romantic, small, cozy, just my kind of place! If you are a seafood fan this is the place! My hubby took me back here for V Day! I was sooo happy! I had the Cioppino which was amazing, the lobster was cooked to perfection! We had fried oysters for appetizers, and the seafood soup which was divine and creamy! Before I forget to mention-this place is BYOB, and has a $5 corkage fee, but so worth it, for Vday, we got champagne! There is a bit of a wait, but there are bars around you can go get a drink at.... The Chef is friendly, and makes you feel at home, which I love. Service is on POINT!
