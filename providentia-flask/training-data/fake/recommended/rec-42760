This is a neighborhood gem! Delicious Thai food my favorite is the chicken fried rice! Very authentic and savory flavors. The service is also great here so you will get great value for your dollar. The drinks are awesome the bartender is very friendly and personable that is what to expect for when you dine out. You will not be let down!
