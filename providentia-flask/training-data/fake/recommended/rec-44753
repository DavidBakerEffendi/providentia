Visited Philly for work and was told to come here by many ... it definitely lived up to the hype. Whatever you do - order the steak tartare toast - it's UNREAL! Maybe get two orders actually.... I had the seabass and it was fantastic. It has the most amazing, flavorful tomato sauce with it and broccoli. Â My friend got the rabbit and it was equally as tasty. We sat down by the bar - but there is an upper level as well that I am sure is great. If you're in Philly - make a stop here. The atmosphere is simple and chic and the food is top notch.
