I've been sitting here for an hr and a half waiting for my food. I came here with my buddy for gift cards for Christmas & decided to dine in. They accommodated my vegan requests or so they said bc I haven't actually seen my food. Anyway there's supposedly tofu wings & an avocado lettuce & tomato sand which that they'll make without cheese & mayo... I hope! Ok so I gave this place another star because they comp'd our meal. Steven Starr restaurants are usually good when it comes to service but I guess there was a miscommunication between the bar & kitchen which I can understand having had many friends that were bartenders in college. Anyway the food was meh but what do you expect from American comfort food? Being a vegan I wouldn't eat here again because the tofu wings were just ok & the alt had no vegan substitute when it came to sauce so it was very bland. The side salad however was exquisite!
