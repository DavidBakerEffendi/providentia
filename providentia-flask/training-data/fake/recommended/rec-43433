I am from the west coast, and I went to that place because it was highly recommended to me by a friend. This friend was used to come to that place a lot and she told me that I must go to Hoagie Haven if I had a chance to go Princeton. So that was what I did today. I have to say she was completely right when she told me that she had the better cheese streak she never had before there. If you look carefully on the right of the boutique, you will see a poster that said that they served the best sandwich on earth! Yeah this is a simple as that! The place is not very large. They don't have any seating options but who care? In fact who would like to have a sandwich inside, especially when the weather is nice? They provide half or a whole cheese steak hot sandwiches (among a long list of others - hot or cold - that I can't comment about because I haven't tried those). The whole cheese steak is definitely a lot of stuff to eat. Much heavier (and even larger) than the 5$ foot long that you can find at Subway. (I know there is no comparison between a fast food and a local place - but that was the only comparison that came into my mind.) So you should go for the whole only if you are very hungry! Once you order your cheese steak you can choose the kind of toppings that you want: tomatoes, lettuce, pickles..., there is no limitation on what you would like to add as soon as they offer it!. Prices are also very low. 3.9$ for half and 6.9 for the whole cheese steak. Please note that they don't take credit card. Last but not least, they've got the oldest cash register I haven't seen before. Very original touch to that place. Bottom line, if I can, I will probably come back and try another cheese steak variation they provide on their menu...
