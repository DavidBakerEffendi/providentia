Fourth cheesesteak place I've tried in Philly (Geno's and Pat's included) and I have to say they are the best... greasy and filling. The fries are similar to BK fries (very crispy outer coating) but the size of steak fries. Its an interesting combination that I enjoy. They have Cheese Whiz, too (what's the deal with provolone on steaks?!) The guy that works there seems pretty cool as well.
