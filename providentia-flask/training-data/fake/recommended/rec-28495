A true Astoria favorite! Â From the rich, warm homemade soups to the chewy bread panini to the green beans blanched and tossed with truffle oil to my favorite crustini with the freshest ricotta, tomato slices, drizzled in rosemary oil... each meal there is a treasure. The atmosphere is especially nice in the evenings when the lights turn down and the charming little candles are lit. The staff is uber friendly. All in all, this is my favorite meal in Astoria.
