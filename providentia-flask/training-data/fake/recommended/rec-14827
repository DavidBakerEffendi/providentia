I had to update this upon trying the rose sauce: hands down the best sauce I have ever had in my life! Creamy, cheesy almost? blush deliciousness! I introduce it to all of my friends, and they have all loved it as well! It's my go-to sauce! I don't know what I'll ever do if I leave Philly and don't have access to it anymore!
