Although it pains my Batali loving heart to say it, I wasn't particularly impressed by Lupa. Maybe I just had too high expectations going into it but I just found it merely good not great. Now, I know it's a popular spot and they need to run a tight ship but there's a difference between efficiency and bitchery. Not to say that anyone was really bitchy, per se, but I just felt so unwelcome. Now, the hostesses were really nice, I will give them that, but our waitress was so brusque and gruff. It also rubbed me the wrong way how you had to order your appetizers and meal together. Again, I understand needing to be efficient in a place like that but come on, really? Her reaction to our request to start with some appetizers before we each decided on our meals was met with such ice that it made me afraid to possibly add anything again later. And in the end it wasn't really that snappy of service anyway. We had a decent lag time between our apps and our main courses coming out. The food was tasty. The appetizers of tuna & cannellini and marinated olives were delicious. My main course of the spaghetti alla carbonara was light but filling. I tried my friend's beef and it was cooked perfectly. My dessert of panna cotta with spiced pineapple was enjoyable but it didn't knock my socks off. All good but it just didn't leave me walking out of there thinking "Boy, I can't wait to come back!" The space is cozy and casual. The music playing was awesome (some of my favorite songs represented throughout the night including some music from my friend's band which was a nice surprise). In the end I'd definitely give the spot another shot but it's funny how this was the meal I was most looking forward to during my trip to NYC and it ended up being my least memorable. Ah well!
