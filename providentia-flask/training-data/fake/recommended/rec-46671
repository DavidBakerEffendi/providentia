I used to work around the corner from Mama's and I would get one EVERY day!  When I decided to move to LA 4 years ago, Mama's was the main thing (other than my family) making it very hard to leave.  Now, I visit back about twice a year and go at least 3 times in the week that I am here.  I love the food and the people who work here.   Now, my sister works next door and goes whenever she can and of course tries to make me jealous :( I still have not found ANY falafel in LA that even comes CLOSE to Mama's!  Keep it up fellas! ~ape
