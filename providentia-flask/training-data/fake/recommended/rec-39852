Best pizza I have had yet!! You have to get there by 8:30pm to put in your order, sometimes you can squeeze by. It was fun to watch a pro. Beautiful flavors, amazing, chunky tomato sauce! Usually I don't like too much sauce but in this case bring it on! Great Neopolitan pizza with the possibility of toppings!!!!! I got fresh sliced pepperoni, sausage, and garlic. Really amazing, and I about ate the whole pizza because I hadn't eaten all day!!! Worth the visit and experience, especially if you have someone in town visiting!!! GGGOOOOOO there now!!!
