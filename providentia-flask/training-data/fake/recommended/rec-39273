We yelped this while we stood outside. This was a last resort as it was dinner time and other places we were familiar with were booked. Was hoping we had found a good/great hole in the wall. Well, we left befuddled at the positive reviews this place has over food quality. Â  Garlic bread lacked garlic and was coated in tasteless cheese. Cheap sub roll bread. My lasagna was tasteless mush. The ricotta was pasty mush and the noodles were hard dry tasteless. Few bites and I sat back. My body deserves better. My daughters pesto chicken had dry tasteless pesto in crappy oil. The chicken was freezer burn dry and was cooked some time ago. Likely from a frozen precooked package. My sons chicken parmagin was made from cheap frozen cutlets. Cheap prices but shouldn't be this bad. If you have any sense of good food I'd walk by this place. Yelp rating here is a disappointment.
