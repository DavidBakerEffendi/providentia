I chose this restaurant as a pre-show dinner for me and a friend. We were watching Avenue Q, making the restaurant about a 15 minute walk from the theater. We were running a bit late, so I called the restaurant to let them know and they said it was fine. When we got to the restaurant, we were promptly seated and a server came to start us off with drinks and an appetizer. My friend and I were starving at this point, so ordered a pitcher of red sangria, empanadas, and shared mama juanita's chicken dish for dinner. Dinner was excellent, sangria and water glasses was always topped off and overall service was great. Good food, good music, good company= always a good time.
