Cheryl's is my default place to take out-of-town visitors for dinner or brunch, and is the perfect restaurant to hit before or after a trip to the Botanical Gardens or the Brooklyn Museum. It's a great local spot with a relaxed atmosphere and good food. The patio in back is absolutely lovely - like eating in a friend's backyard. The service can be slow and spotty, and a couple of my friends have had experiences with servers bringing them the wrong food (especially during brunch, which gets crowded), but the staff is friendly enough that it doesn't really bother me. The benefit of slow service is that it's a good place to chill with your dining companion(s) without feeling rushed - I especially like coming here for dinner on weeknights. The menu is a little all-over-the-place, but that just means I can always find something I like. On a side note - the bar next door (Bar Sepia) is a great spot too if you're looking to follow dinner up with a drink. I'm glad this restaurant is in my neighborhood.
