Came here with D on a Friday, it's a cute casual spot with a fun vibe but the food was nothing to write home about. D was looking for an izakaya and we settled on Robataya. We ordered the pork belly which was plain slices of pork served with a side of sauce (highlight of the dish which says a lot) and a touch of yuzu pepper. It was good but the sauce was really its saving grace, reminded me of katsu sauce, minus the tang and a bit more savory. We also ordered the whole fish which was tiny and not worth the price tag. It was also super salty.  Again, nothing special and also ordered a side of taro which was plain grilled taro. Had to dip it into the remaining pork belly sauce to give it some oomph. Finished dinner with the salmon ikura rice that other Yelpers raved about, and it was again, nothing special (and not worth the price tag).   Maybe people come for the bar side seats or for the sake but we has neither so it was an underwhelming to say the least. I will most likely not return since Blue Ribbon Sushi Izakaya (love!) is just a quick cab ride away.
