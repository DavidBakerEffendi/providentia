Wow, I was going to give it 2 stars but decided on the 1 star because when I saw my bank account, I see that they made their own decision on the amount of my tip for a party of 2. Different type of atmosphere that seemed  ok . After I was seated a woman came over to the table and was selling bootlegged dvds to us. That was different. They also try and bait you into appetizers by telling you that the entree is going to take 45 minutes, and it really took over an hour. But of course you buy the overpriced appetizers because you dont want to drink your sangria on an empty stomach The appetizer, breaded eggplant with mozzarella, spinach, balsamic vinegar made into some form of sauce was different too and tasted fine. What was supposed to be a star attraction the paella marinara was pretty disgusting. it was basically mush. The rice was so sogged and mushy, had a horrible flavor a gooey mess.I have never tasted paella like that and I have eaten a lot of it in my life the lobster was overcooked and shriveled up as the rest of the seafood. perhaps day old leftover. the sad thing is that a couple who came in after us ordered the same entree and they were served a nice fresh dish that didnt look mushy and had nice plump lobster. The service did not warrant  the huge tip. the waitress was nice enough, but no one came to the table to see if we were good. The man who served the table next to us at some point looked over and said "you ok over there?" So as I said, they added the gratuity to the check. I changed it to suit what I wanted to pay and when I arrived home, I see that they put through the gratuity on my card that they decided upon, again for 2 people. I would NEVER return there. AND I always get a bad taste in my mouth for establishments that run my pockets by STEALING what they want from your card for gratuity. This restaurant is CRAP! And I feel like I was robbed.
