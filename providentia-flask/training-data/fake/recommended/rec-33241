Despite having to wait a verrryyyyyy long time for our table..what a fantastic meal. The staff was very apologetic for the delay and brought us some appetizers while we waited at the bar.  Once we sat down, they brought us several more apps on the house to make up for the wait.  We didn't complain about the wait, but they handled it really well regardless. Now the food...a delight.  Other than the group appetizers, I started with the cucumber soup and it was really wonderful. I then shared the spring ravioli with my friend and we were very happy with it.
