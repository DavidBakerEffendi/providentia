The shop is a tiny, 6 seat and standing room place.  Very much a grab em and go kinda spot, located in the Italian Market.  Two other people were there waiting on their sandwiches when I arrived.  I ordered 2 sandwiches, Arista -Whole Roasted Suckling Pig, Italian Long Hots, Broccoli Rabe & Sharp Provolone for my friend, and Daddy Wad- Mortadella w/ Pistachio, Genoa Salami, Sopressata, Cappacolla & Prosciutto di Parma, Sharp Provolone, Arugula, Tomatoes, Onions, Sweet & Hot Peppers on a gluten-free roll for myself.  These are 2 beautiful sandwiches. I didn't get to eat my sandwich for about 20 mins., and as with gluten-free breads they get soggy quickly. Sadly, that is what happened to mine.  Why the 4 stars then, because the meats were fantastic and the love put in to the making of the sandwich was evident.  It wasn't their fault that I didn't eat the sandwich in their shop.  I bet it would have been fantastic.   Next time I'm visiting my family and friends, I will eat my sandwich there.
