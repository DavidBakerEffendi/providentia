It's an ageless debate whether Pat's or Geno's are better, so here's a comparison: Geno: Less meat, meat slightly tender and more seasoning Cheese wiz thinner - more runny Bread is softer, I think they steam the bread but because it's Italian bread, a little chewy after steaming Sandwich is presented tightly wrapped - easy to carry around. The wrapper is bigger and non-porous General appearance is cleaner and brighter Pat: More meat, less tender, not seasoned at all Thicker chess wiz Bread is more crunchy They give the sandwich to you un-wrapped in a much smaller piece of wrapper. The wrapper is porous - oil sip through makes eating messy. General appearance darker and less clean
