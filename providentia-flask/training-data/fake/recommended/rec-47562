I met up with some friends at the Waiting Room last Saturday to watch the Rangers playoff game.  It was my first time there so I was a little surprised more people were not there for the game.  The bar is clean and the service is excellent. We had about 3 servers coming by checking on drinks and food. I hear the food is awesome. I only tried the French fries, which were very tasty. The gravy was insane.  Some friends had a grilled cheese, Philly wrap, and some burgers. It all looked and smelled great.  There was a cover band that came on at 10pm.  The only down side was that while the game was on (the huge wall screen) they would not turn on the volume. The band was not playing yet but I can see how not everyone may want to listen to the game.  The band came on at 10pm. The Rangers were going into OT. So we had the live music  in front of us while trying to see the game. It was not a deal breaker. I will deff be back. We had an awesome time. You can not beat the price or atmosphere.
