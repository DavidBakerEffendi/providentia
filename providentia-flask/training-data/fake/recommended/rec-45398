I was relieved when it opened.  I live right around the corner of the old Jolie and I miss it so much.  So easy, food was always consistently great, relaxing, close by... my husband and myself were true regulars. Now we walk  just a few blocks to Jolie Cantina. It's the same chef and the menu has a tapas-like variety of many small plates and then the standards I missed so much.  The menu is surprisingly big (which you don't get a t most Mexican restaurants.  I know people have expressed some confusion over the mix of Mexican and French, but it's the same chef cooking what he loves and it shows.  Some things have slightly more heat but what could possibly be wrong with a merguez taco?  Seriously? They were starting to infuse some of these dishes into the old Jolie and no one seemed to notice-- and they were delicious as well. I'm excited about it's future  because Ben is a great host.  He knows what people like, how to run a restaurant well and people are loyal to him because of that. And the food is always just consistently good. And now there is guacamole(and still a flaming desert)! What more could you ask for? !!
