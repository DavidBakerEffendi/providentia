If this place were a band it would be the Beatles! Wait! I have already used that in a review. Ok, try this on for size (heavy metal music blasting): on front desk introducing Jinhee (but pronounced Jeannie), working the sides her fiance Johnny, and my man on the grill ( music creshendo) Kleaver!!!! Too much? Good. Now that I have your attention I will do the rest of the review in my normal voice. :-) Lots of restaurants are started every year. Every once in awhile you get a place where you want to see the owners and staff succeede. This is one of those places. This past saturday was my first time here and I plan a return visit. I went with one of my friends and his mom after a day of helping with chores. My entree was the beef brisket with a biscuit and gravy side. The brisket was an amazing bite size with red BBQ sauce. Nice and tangy without being overpowering. The light flaky biscuit was accompanied by melt in your mouth white sausage gravy. Our party also split some of the best fries I have ever tasted. This was the nosh fries with sausage gravy and pico de gallo. The pork bellies were crispy and juicy. The collard greens are some of the best I ever tasted. Finally it is staffed by some of the nicest people. I have found a new NYC spot after visiting this city every year for 20 years. Go to this place. You will not regret it!
