Ama-ZING.  I've been to Philly a few times to find the best Cheese steak, and well 'll be a Monkeys uncle, I found it.  It is north of the city, not downtown, in a nice neighborhood.   The price is cheap, and the steak was off the chain.  I loved it and can't wait to go back again. Eating  Pat's or Geno's is like eating the left over steak that falls on the floor and it ran over by a truck.
