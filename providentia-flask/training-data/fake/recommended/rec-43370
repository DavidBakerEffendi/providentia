Having grown up in Princeton and gone to middle and high school only two blocks from Hoagie Haven, there is no way that I can't give this place 5 stars! Every time I go home, this is a must visit for me. If you are a student, whether in Princeton, West Windsor, Plainsboro, Montgomery, or the surrounding areas and you haven't been here, you've been wasting your time! There is no possibly way to describe just how delicious and lovingly crafted these sandwiches are. Don't mess around next time you're hungry, and get over to Haven ASAP.
