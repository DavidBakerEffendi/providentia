Aurora is a once a year treat for me and my coworkers - work anniversaries, milestones and farewell meals.  Today was a less than positive experience at this venue.  We are normally seated and given a wine list, we had to ask for that.  Our waiter was inattentive or too busy or too "mind elsewhere."  We asked for the check twice and he forgot each time.  Then, while walking back to our table (not too far from the register) he loses my card underneath another patron's table.  After a minute of searching, I finally helped the guy out and pointed beneath a customer's foot - there was my American Express Card.   Perhaps this was an off day for the waiter or restaurant, but it was not the way I wanted or envisioned sending off one of my co-workers on their last day at the company. Food was good.  Ambiance was awesome.  The service ... not so much. Ciao for now See you in a year
