Creative menu/recipes were entertaining (butternut squash & kombucha soup?!???). Everything was delicious albeit too salty for me... I had the octopus and deviled eggs. Brussel sprouts with grapes and raisins, beets salad (so colorful!) were also great. Nice cozy ambience and all the servers were very nice too.
