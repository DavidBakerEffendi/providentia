Went here while visiting home for Thanksgiving. One of the biggest things I miss from NY, is the pizza. You just can't find anything like it, anywhere else. Sadly, the big pizza chains have a large part of the country brainwashed into thinking that what they sell, is good pizza. Anyway...went here for my NY pizza fix, and LOVED it. I've read in some of the reviews that the service is lacking....this isn't a 5 star restaurant....it's a tavern! The waitresses were busting ass the entire time I was there, and seem focused on getting what their customers needed to them, in the shortest time possible. Loved the place and will be coming back again next year!
