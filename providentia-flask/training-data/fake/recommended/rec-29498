Masa Sushi is probably one of my favorite places to eat! I actually found this place on Yelp and so happy I did. It's a bit sketchy because it's in a strip mall but their food and service is on point! My boyfriend always orders the "volcano roll" one of their specialty rolls. Their prices are fair.
