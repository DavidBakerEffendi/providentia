The best drunken noodles I've had. I've been to half a dozen Thai restaurants in NYC, another handful in other parts of the country, and the food is pretty similar across all of them, with some being spicier than others, while others being sweeter. The universal attribute between them is that none of the ones I've tried have been able to cook beef. After having tried different types of Thai noodles with beef at many of these restaurants, I've come to the conclusion that Thai beef is supposed to be dry, tough, and fairly flavorless. Not here. My drunken noodles with beef had beef that was tear-with-your-front-teeth tender, and there was plenty of it. The noodles could have been taken out of the pot a little earlier, but better than the soggy mush that I've sometimes gotten - though to be fair, I really prefer my noodles al dente (though I imagine that's harder with broad noodles). Nice amount of food, with plenty of vegetables as well, which many places skimp on. There were even grape tomatoes in it - though I would've appreciated if they had thrown a few pieces of broccoli in as well, like they did with the vegetarian option. The d√©cor inside isn't anything to write home about, but the garden out back was quite pleasant. Proper shade over every table as well as a fountain provide for an oasis away from the busy streets of Queens. I could even imagine having a band around during dinner service. A bit far for a Manhattanite, but as I work in Queens, I do think I'll be back here again.
