I love this place, simply because of the variety of food you can get and how cheap it is (7.99/lb) - assuming that you don't eat monster quantities of food. When I do come here, it is usually in the mornings right before the rush-hour lunch and food is usually pretty fresh. On the other hand, there's like no way to tell how much you're getting on your plate - so it's easy to fill up 2-3 lbs of food and then be surprised when your lunch suddenly costs 15-22 dollars after tax. Better to be stingy and then grab more later? Yums.
