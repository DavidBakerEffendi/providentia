This place has everything...great decor (it's absolutely stunning), great food, great drinks, and great prices. It's a nice spot in the neighborhood and a great place to take visitors after they've seen a show or something in Times Square. My only complaint was the service, which was slow and spotty. Other than that, though, this place is a gem!
