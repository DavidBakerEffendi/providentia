I was out with my friends looking for a place to hangout and have some soju.  Woorijip came to the rescue.  Although it's a market of sorts with their prepared foods sold by the pound, they also have drinks.  When I first heard about the place I was thinking, "They let you drink there? What?"  Well, that is indeed the case. When we walked in around 10:30 that night, the place was crowded.  I was actually kind of shocked, but luckily we found the last table available in the very back.  After securing the table, we picked up some baekseju, soju, and beer.  When we paid, the clerk asked, "Do you need shot glass cups?" Do we ever! Haha... I didn't try any of the food here, but from what I could tell it looked good.  I'm assuming the quality is good, but probably not as good as what it could be with the large quantities I saw them selling.   I would definitely come back here.  It was the perfect place to just hang with my friends and catch up.  Besides, where else in ktown are you going to find a place where you can buy soju and drink with your friends for these prices? $8 for a 375 mL bottle? Check!
