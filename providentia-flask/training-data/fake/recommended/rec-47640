I picked Cast Iron Soul based on some high recommendations from other Yelpers, but I will have to admit I was underwhelmed. Compared to other soul food places I have eaten, this just didn't quite measure up. I ordered the "small plate" with pork ribs, mac n cheese, and green beans. Mac n Cheese was kind of bland and dry. Not creamy and rich as I would have hoped (As a self proclaimed mac n cheese connoisseur, this was sad). Green beans were nothing special. The ribs were the highlight of the plate as they were perfectly cooked and fell right off the bone. I got 3 HUGE ribs on my small plate and I also liked the sauce they were served in. Big points to Cast Iron Soul for awesome, friendly service and being very affordable. While the food didn't Wow me, it was a very enjoyable experience overall.
