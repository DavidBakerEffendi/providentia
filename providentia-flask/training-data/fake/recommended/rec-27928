I said i'd be back right? went here last night with justina, hadley and ed and introduced H&E to the wonderful world of ramen. i think ippudo is a good starter. the wait was 1hr 20 mins, but it went by pretty fast. after a cocktail at the bar, we got a good table and started with the cucumber app (sliced cucumber - maybe slightly pickled) sitting in sesame oil, ground sesame seeds, cracked chili flakes, man this was really really good. surprisingly good even. i could eat a ton of this. we also got edamame, which ya know, is edamame. i got the akamaru modern which smelled delicious and really good. what it didn't include, which i wish it did, (and btw, minca includes this) is an egg, a big leaf of seaweed, those black mushrooms, and less fatty pork. nevertheless, the noodles were great and i ate the whole thing. i was really into justina's extra spicy bowl. i liked how tasty it was, although while i like to think i could last thru the whole bowl, i think i probably would have had to drink a lot of water to make it through. is there a spicy grade between regular and extra? i forget, but i think thats where i could fit in. hads got hmm...maybe the classic and ed got the spicy one in mild. i'm pretty sure they liked it. ed said he'd come back but we'll see...
