I came on a Tuesday for dinner with a group of friends before doing some bar-hopping in the area.  We were 5 and didn't have a reservation but they were able to seat us pretty quickly.  The atmosphere was typical of a neighborhood Mexican restaurant/bar- busy but not rowdy.  The decor was eclectic, the service pretty average.  While waiting for a table we got a round of their version of the city-wide at the bar ($5 for a Tecate and a shot of tequila). Our order of chips came with two large salsa dishes, one pico de gallo and one salsa verde, which made for easy dipping/scooping.  I split a pitcher of watermelon margarita which was good, not too heavy or too sweet.  I enjoyed my calamari tacos but they were nothing to rave about.  The calamari was well-cooked, but their "corn" tortillas were a bit strange, no color or texture.  Thankfully there are about 5 different hot sauces at each table to spice things up a bit (no pun intended).   So here's where they hooked me: I tried one of my friend's seitan buffalo chicken wings, and it was PHENOMENAL.  As a pescetarian (yes surf, no turf), I usually go for the fish option if there is one, but these veggie wings were so out of this world delish-juicy, flavorful, no weird processed texture, and the sauce was good too-I want to go back just to have these wings again.  And another watermelon margarita.
