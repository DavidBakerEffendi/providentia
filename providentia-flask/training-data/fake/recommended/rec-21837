I'm so happy we found this place. Thanks again, Yelp! The fiance and I were looking for a place just like this for our last brunch in Brooklyn. We were also meeting friends who also happened to be visiting NY. It was our last day and their first, so we wanted to impress with our food choice. This was better than could have been expected. Everything was delicious and refreshing. I loved the drinks we had and the corn on the cobb was awesome. I don't even remember everything we had but it was great! I think it was an egg sandwich and mac n cheese. The decor is so fun, like a farmers market/bookstore/greenhouse.
