So, on my first visit I only tried three dishes, if you count the rice. I plan to go back. I will update when I do. The two dishes I ordered couldn't be further from each other in flavor, though both included chicken. The first was sesame chicken, which was outstanding. The chicken was tender. It had a crispy shell. And the sauce was neither too heavy with corn starch, nor too sweet. This is an excellent version of this dish. The second was the dry pot chicken. The description says that it comes to the table in a sizzling mini-wok. Indeed it came in a mini-wok, with some sort of apparatus meant to take a sterno can underneath, but there was no sterno can to be found. Curious. I was ready for spicy, and this was definitely ragingly hot. It is one of those dishes full of dry hot chilis that I tend to eat around. I don't mind eating around a chili, but there was a lot to eat around in this dish: copious crumbled bay leaves (so many kisses from the cook,); star anise, black peppercorns, and sichuan peppercorns. One of these things was rather unpleasant to bite into; I think it was the sichuan peppercorns. The flavor of the chicken was outstanding, but picking all those whole spices out was a pain. Maybe they should consider straining out the bay leaves and sichuan peppercorns. cheese cloth? bouquet garni? And the rice. I don't mind an al dente rice, but this was a bit beyond. In short, there is no comparing this restaurant to a crappy take-out place like Lucky's or a crappy sit-in like Beijing. This is cuisine on a different level.
