FOOD was great. Branzino- tasted like it was caught fresh that day. And grilled octopus was the most deli-sh octo I have ever had. Meatballs - of course good. Hanger steak my finance had... was ok, nothing special. Definitely go for the seafood, understated atmosphere, service and and great Greek Wine-priced well too. Sad I've lived on the UWS and i just discovered this place. One issue was the our reservation was for 8 pm. and we arrived at 750- and finally got our table 825- but that screw up was not a huge deal. And I will surely be back.
