I absolutely love Ants Pants.  Every time I've been here I'm surprised at how good the food is.  They use tasty and fresh ingredients, and don't skimp on the good stuff (like maple syrup).  Everything I've had here is excellent, including the coffee. I don't think there is a better brunch spot in Southwest Center City.
