This is one of the best restaurants in the city in terms of an intimate atmosphere, delicious seasonal Spanish food, and good service. I went to Salinas on Dec 23rd with a friend. We needed to catch up, and the cozy, intimate feel at Salinas is right for that. Plus the space between tables allows u to keep a conversation private. The waiter was knowledgeable, and we asked a few questions, we also took a long time to decide but he was very helpful. My friend had the cod, and I had the seasonal soup. Both were delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant. I have been here before with a group of 8 friends (all between 27 and 33), on a date, and with a friend. I was very happy each time. I will definitely go back and will recommend it to anyone who appreciates good food, good wine, and a beautiful place.
