Decent food, incredibly rude. We made reservations for 6, the place was empty and they squeezed us in a table for 4, I ask for a bigger unoccupied table and they refused, we ordered plenty of food, nothing much different than other hot pots except for the corn soup, decorated plates and fish with torino, so we finished our food and we asked for the check and free ice cream, they told us we had to pickup the ice cream at the cashier because there were a lot of people waiting, WTF so they were basically kicking us out after paying, and on top of that the bigger table we asked for was still empty, I'll never come back or recommend anyone
