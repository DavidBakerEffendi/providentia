This is a great spot in TriBeCa.  Very loud, but that's part of the appeal.  The food was spot on.  Wife and I split the miso glazed Salmon which was new to the menu and absolutely perfect.  Daughter got the orrichette pasta which was also excellent. The mixed green salad was divine in its simplicity, the mixed beet and aged goat cheese salad also top notch.   Service was great.  We told the waiter to take his time, which he did, and the pacing of the meal was perfect for us.  All too often the entree arrives moments after the salad is cleared but that wasn't the case here.  We wanted to enjoy ourselves in a relaxed manner and that's what we got.  It' s nice when they listen to diner's requests. If you are drinking, try the Aperol Sour.  A true European classic.  Our only reason for downgrading this restaurant is from the wine service.  We ordered a $100 bottle of Amarone, our favorite kind of wine, and it was served at room temperature.  Sorry folks, there's a price point, and in my mind it's way below $100, where you start keeping your wine at the proper storage and serving temp. Other than that, a great experience and will definitely return.
