I went in November (the day before Thanksgiving to be exact) around lunch time to purchase a gift card at the bar. The male bar tender rolled his eyes when my friend and I said we were not there to eat. He took his time getting our gift card together. After he rang me up he turned half way towards the bar and threw my credit card at me! Other people at the bar noticed and even commented on it. I will never go back. Because of this experience I created a Yelp account.
