Umami burger would've been given 5 stars if it weren't for the price. They make really solid burgers, but my dining partner and I were a little surprised when we were slapped with a $40 bill. Maybe I was thinking this was more in the shake-shack price range? But I guess I can't complain - everything was delicious, including the market salad. It was perfectly dressed with a light vinaigrette and skinned cherry tomatoes. The truffle fries were also great - not too heavy on the truffle oil and complemented by a truffle cheese sauce. One question I have is - how does one get the spoon with the multiple sauces? How do I get the cheesy tots? I didn't see any of these on the menu, although maybe they were hidden in some umami-lexicon I didn't know how to speak. We even mentioned to our server it was our first time - why didn't she go over some of the highlights instead of explaining to me what umami means? Thanks for the Japanese lesson but where are the tots? I got the classic burger - it was a little under done for my taste, and I enjoy a good medium rare. I didn't leave any room for dessert but gotta save something for next time.
