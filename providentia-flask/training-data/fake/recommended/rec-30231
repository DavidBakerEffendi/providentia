Dinner was awesome tonight!  We got there a little early and had a drink at the bar, which was great and the bartender was really awesome.  Definitely try the Ginger-Tangerine Margarita.  Our food was really good, great flavor and the entrees were the perfect portion.  The only reason I'm giving a 4-star review is because of the service.  Our waiter was OK but kind of a dud.  I asked for recommendations and what he personally liked and it was like he didn't really know the menu.  Other than that, all was great and would definitely go again.
