Unfortunately I had to spend Thanksgiving in the frozen hell that is Vermont. We were starved when we landed in Burlington and couldn't decide where to eat.. we came to this place first. You get what you pay for! The grilled cheese sandwich seemed like a bargain at .91 .. until I saw that it was the size of my thumb. My fiance's burger was tinier than the kiddie meal ones at mcd's. The fries? nothing special. Â Definitely make sure to dobule up on your sandwiches here. I can't imagine any adult eating that grilled cheese and feeling full!
