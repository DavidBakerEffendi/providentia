I came here with 2 friends and had a very nice, solid meal. Everything was cooked well, the service was attentive, and the atmosphere was pleasant. However, I believe that Hearth is built up (and sells itself) as something very special, where your taste buds will be blown away and you won't mind paying extra for your experience. I can't justify that expectoration. If all the entrees were $5-$10 less expensive I would certainly give this restaurant a better rating. But, it just did not live up to the standard set by its prices.
