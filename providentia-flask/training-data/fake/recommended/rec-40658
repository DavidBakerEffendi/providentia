Love this place! Went for Saturday brunch around 11 and were seated immediately. We got the monkey bread appetizer - delicious - and a variety of omelettes served with tater tots and sides of Mac and cheese (we were hungry). The food was delicious, but the decor and the service really make the experience great. The decor feels like a ski lodge from the 70s - fireplaces, shag carpets, wood paneling. Very warm and comfortable, and the service was friendly and top notch. Highly recommended!
