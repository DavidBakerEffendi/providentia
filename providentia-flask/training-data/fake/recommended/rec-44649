The Bar Room is a great experience before you even sit down. As you walk in, the room has been made to look at least twice its size by cleverly placed mirrors and lighting fixtures. Just below the ceiling level, there is a beautiful mural that reflects throughout the eating area. The food did not disappoint either. I went there for brunch and had their Garden Omelette, which was incredibly fresh and filling. My friend had the Bar Room Benedict and was also singing praises afterwards. The service was friendly and efficient, and the prices were very reasonable. I haven't tried any of their drinks yet, but will definitely be going back to try out some of their cocktails and to soak up the atmosphere again. I highly recommend The Bar Room to anyone who wants to eat at a classy place without hurting your wallet.
