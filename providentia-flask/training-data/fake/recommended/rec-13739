A very small place with a warm and cozy atmosphere. We ordered 2 small pizzas and a plate of calamari for 3 people, which was more than enough. Everything was very fresh. The pizza was thin and crispy and the sauce was sweet, tangy, (which I found delicious) and really stood out . The toppings were just right; they weren't too overwhelming or over the top (as in not too cheesy or the meats too salty). It's can be a nice change from the other neighborhood pizzas. The waitress was very friendly. I also saw an espresso machine but didn't have a chance to try any of the coffee yet (went at night). Though I did see two ladies next to me order some cappuccino and finished it without complaining, so maybe next time I'll give it a try.
