I don't know why the other reviewer said there was only sweet food,  I had am amazingly light and tasty quinoa and arugula salad.  My girls had adorable mini grilled cheese with savory wale fries.  The hot Co late is a great experience add well,  work things like make your own and crackling, the forks couldn't finish then they were so big. We finished off with the kids menu dessert for two.
