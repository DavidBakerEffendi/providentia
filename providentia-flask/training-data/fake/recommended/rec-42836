This place came recommended from two foodie friends of ours, so we decided to try it out last night.  We were particularly excited given that it is a BYOB kind of place so we brought one of our favorite wine bottles.  Food did not disappoint.  The tuna tartare appetizer was particularly good and the escargot was delicious.  There were other items on the menu that I wanted to try which I will have to save for next time.   The only drawback is that this restaurant is a no reservations, cash only place.  Given the small, intimate environment of the restaurant, we were standing outside in the cold while we were waiting to be seated.  We didn't wait long for a Saturday night (about 20 minutes), but I suggest going on an off night or for an early or late brunch if you want to try this place out.
