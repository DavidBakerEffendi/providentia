I went here with my boyfriend and it was such a great date night. It's very small and intimate, and a bonus for us was being able to walk to it from home. We each got 4 rolls and soup, which seemed like a lot to the owner but hey, I can eat! We said we were fine with waiting a while since he said it would take time to make all of them. I think the whole dinner took 2 hours, and that's without dessert. I thought it was perfect though, because it allowed us to have a nice evening together without feeling rushed. The sushi rolls we chose all tasted very fresh, and I particularly liked the rice in the rolls. It was fluffy and sweet, and there was a lot of it. It didn't take away from the fish, however. I don't remember which rolls I got, but I remember thinking I probably would've been happy with any of them. The only reason I didn't give u1 5 stars is because I still like Jo-Sho in somerset better.
