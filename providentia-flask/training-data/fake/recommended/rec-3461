Excellent!  The chicken milanese was prepared perfectly. Panko style. The side dish i ordered was broccoli rab prepared in a way i never saw, with crumbled sausage sprinkled in. Delicious. I suggest a return just for that.  I didn't have desert but the people next to me did.  Man, did the desserts look good. The owner, a personable guy named Claudio, was all over the place, checking with us often. Overall, a well run, vibrant & delicious place.
