I was in town in Philly for a conference and discovered this place completely by accident. Holy cow was it amazing!! I ordered food from Kamil's (Middle Eastern)- it was a major disappointment. The tabouli- a Middle Eastern staple if there ever was one- was completely flavorless (except for the overwhelming taste of parsley and cucumber). It tasted nothing like how a (good) tabbouli should taste. The falafel sandwich was- for its price- tiny and mediocre. In short, avoid Kamil's (unless you don't mind overpaying for bland, mediocre and overpriced food)
