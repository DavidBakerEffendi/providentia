Came for dinner and ordered salads for the appetizer. I apologize if the names are incorrect, but I believe it was the ensalada de mixto and the fungi riperi. Both very delicious. These two salads won me over right away! Had pasta bolognese for my entree, which was nothing to die for. Fettucini was a bit undercooked, but for pasta bolognese I wasn't expecting anything exciting. The house salad that came alongside the entree was surprisingly very very delicious actually. It was mixed greens with fresh croutons and tomatoes dressed in their vinagrette. Because I couldn't decide between the salad or the soup (italian onion, tasty), the server gave me both! We were the last table of the night, but I thought that was very sweet. The service was very helpful and attentive. She was very sweet and genuine. This seems like the type of place where they will remember you. Oh! And don't forget, this is a BYOB! We ended up not making the Wine & Spirits in time, but Panini's offers a complimentary glass of white or red wine. The service here was definitely memorable, and I will be back!
