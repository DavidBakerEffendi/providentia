This is the best sandwich, from start to finish. Mmm. The bread is crispy but not so much that it's tough to bite into, and it's clearly very fresh. Not that I'm any sort of expert on banh mi or Vietnamese food in general, but I know a great lunch special when I see one. The shop is a hole-in-the-wall kind of place. You have to walk down some stairs to get in there, and there is a ledge area around the window with stools for indoor seating. Most people seem to order to-go though. I highly suggest the lamb, it's spiced to juicy perfection! I usually get the combo with iced Vietnamese coffee, and it's all awesome.
