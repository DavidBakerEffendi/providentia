First time back in probably 8 or 10 years...  At the time, the Corner Bistro was the king of NY burgers.. In every listing from Zagats to Time Out and NY Mag, people were singing their praises.. It was the first spot which I can remember, that caused such a stir. Bottom line, it's a good burger.. Always cooked spot on.. Medium in the true sense of the word.. Not grey all the way through but, actually medium...  The best way to describe the burger is to call it a bar burger.. It's a large thick patty.. Unseasoned, formed, grilled.. Nice char on the outside, pink on the inside.. It's juicy, just kind of tasteless though..It needs salt, pepper, some things to spice up the meat a bit... The ground beef didn't have any aging or really any flavor to it.. The room is great.. Dark wood, very cozy, the perfect place to eat a burger.. Definitely should go and give it a shot.. I am certainly will not wait so long to return.
