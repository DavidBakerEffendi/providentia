A bit overpriced for what you get. They have a really big selection of wine, and seem very knowledgeable on their stock which was really helpful when deciding what to drink. The only problem is when you're fresh out of college..most of the wine bottles might be a little too steep for your budget. Never the less, they also have a decent selection of wines by the glass. We ordered the charcuterie board assortment which was good, but the meats were average meats you could get over the deli counter. We also ordered the oxtail risotto balls, which were pretty small and a bit lacking in spices. Finally, we tried the bone marrow which was my favorite part of the meal. The bone marrow was served differently than most places and was pieced onto warm toasty and greesily delicious bread. It was acrually really tasty and definitely my recommendation from the night!
