Possibly the best new establishment in Philly this year. What makes this place amazing is you can try anything from the retail side before you buy it...the cafe is as high-quality as any of the other Garces joints...and you truly can enjoy yourself for any price. i've spent $10, i've spent $35...each time walking out wondering when i would be back next, and the answer has been at least 1 visit a week since opening and no end in site. Cheers GTC!
