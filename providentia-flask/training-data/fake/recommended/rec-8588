I can't believe this place is so highly rated on here. It is truly a failure of the yelp-bot or something. If you'll notice, most of the good reviews are quite old. We ordered takeout and got three different apps: chicken pandan, shrimp wonton and beef satay. The pandan and shrimp were just plain nasty. They tasted the opposite of fresh. Like, doubleplus unfresh. Blecht! The beef satay was tolerable but skimpy and tough. I had the beef curry fried rice, which was okay. The rice was a bit mushy. The flavor wasn't all that great. Mostly just spicy. My coworkers got a couple of variations on pad thai, and they concur with the "meh" assessment. Kind of bland. Just spicy. When we called our order in, they said they don't deliver, contrary to their profile on here. Fair warning. There are definitely better places around. Blecht! I still can't get the nasty taste of that shrimp wonton out of my mouth.
