Positive Yelp reviews and Zagat's lead us here for a cheap and filling meal New Years Day, and we were not disappointed. I'm convinced the noodles were bottomless in my sliced beef noodle soup.  I kept slurping and munching and the bowl never seemed to empty.  I think the leftovers I brought home may last another 2 meals.   The brother was really flavorful, the noodles are just delicious.  My only complaints: my bowl was a little heavy on the cilantro (some is OK, but this was too much) and some of the beef was too fatty (good for flavor in broth, but I don't want to eat a slice that's more gristle than lean). My better half had the stir fried vegetable noodles.  While he is a man of few words when reacting to food ("It's good" vs. "It's all right...") gave the meal 3 "goods" and ate nearly the entire plate. All in all, totally worth the $15 check and probably double that.
