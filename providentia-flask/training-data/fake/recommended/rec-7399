Thoroughly disappointed! At first, I was excited that the restaurant served Filipino cuisine as well as launched by a chef from Top Chef. Also, after enjoying authentic Filipino cuisine from the Philippines, I was craving a good fix here. However, the general lack luster experience combined with mediocre food did not win me over for its overpriced menu. Even if Pig and Khao's ambiance is suppose to be a casual experience, their staff did not know ANYTHING. We decided to order the 5 course tasting menu for a fix price. For one thing, our waitress, although courteous and nice, did not tend to us as frequently despite the lack of patrons at the place. FYI, we were there for an early dinner around 5-6pm and there was only another couple having dinner. Did I also mention how there were 3-5 staff members just aimlessly waiting around? Not cool. The next thing that disturbed our experience was that when we received each dish, the presenter, who was not our waitress, did not even try to explain what we were getting. (Even if he did try to explain, he was either on mute or he just explained the meat type.) I even asked for better elaboration on one of the dishes and whether if it was Filipino .The presenter did not know whether if it was a Filipino dish or what the dish was at all. HOW IS THIS A TASTING MENU EXPERIENCE IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE TRYING? I'm not even trying to be anal about our experience. I did not even try to make it a big deal during our dinner, but after thinking about our experience, I will not come here again. The second part is that even the dinnerware seemed like cheap $1 items you'd find in Chinatown. I don't have anything against cheap dinnerware, but if I'm paying for an ambiance and an experience at a place, I'd expect better utensils. Next time, I can just eat at Chinatown for authentic food at a lower price. Food was mediocre. It only got 2 stars because our food came out fresh and I liked the coconut rice.
