So people have been telling me to come here for a bit now. I typically avoid times square like the plague but some out of towners were visiting and surprise surprise, they wanted to go there. Ugh. They were looking for some food, and other than the chain restaurants yelp provided this familiar name. After calling to confirm availability at 3:30 on a sunday afternoon with a group of 7 (3 adults, 4 kids), we made our way over. This place is huge, honestly, I never thought it would be. Portions are obviously huge. Serious group dining place. Fried calamari, linguine and meatballs (one of the kids REQUIRED linguine over spaghetti), and chicken parm. I was not expecting anything better than your run of the mill food, but wow, was I surprised. This is good stuff. Is it the best? No, but considering portion size, pricing, obvious markup due to location, this is worth it. Would I come here again? If people wanted italian and it was a large group, yes.
