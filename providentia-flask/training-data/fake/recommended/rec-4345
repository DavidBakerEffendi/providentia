Can't get enough of this place! A little out of the way if you live in the center city area but worth the commute. I prefer the outdoor seating during all times of the year. Even during the winter the backyard beer garden has multiple heat lamps and fire pits that make it so you don't have to wear a jacket. The atmosphere is very friendly! Great for both going out with families and with friends. Make sure to grab a jenga set at the front if there isn't already one on your table! Order a few appetizers and sausages to share and a couple liters of beer on draft for yourself! My favorites for appz: Pretzel w/ cheese dip, cucumber salad (maybe my favorite), potato pancakes Sausage: Get the weisswurst! However, you really can't go wrong with what you order because all are great. All of the meat is from Illgs Butcher Shop where my family and I have been buying products for over 8 years now and have never been disappointed. Beer: Spaten Oktoberfest or Franziskaner Hefeweizen. You'll feel super cool with a liter mug but be sure to drink it fast otherwise it'll be a warm beer catastrophe.
