Tasty chicken fingers & BYOB friendly, Sticky's is a fun little joint if you're craving something fried and boozy. I've been here a couple times, once courtesy of Gilt (date for 2, friend & I got way too much food, enjoyed vastly) and once without (about $20 for 6 fingers and 2 sodas) Price is on the higher end for fingers but Sticky's sides and specialty flavors are worth trying. Space is small (so come quick for seats), bring your fav drink (partial to honey jack myself) and enjoy the wall graffiti as you munch away.
