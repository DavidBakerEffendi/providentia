The lines here can get pretty long especially for take out however don't let that deter you. It moves very quickly. The roast pork sandwich is sooo good with the broccoli rabe. OMG I never would've thought such a combo could be so good! It was absolutely delicious!! It was so good that my BF decided we had to come back the next day to get another sandwich! Next time I'll try the meat sandwich because it does look just as good!
