Most accurately described, Joe's Shanghai is like the perfect taste of a Sunday afternoon in my childhood. One bite into those xiao long bao, and I'm back in the nostalgia of being eight years old, sitting at a round table somewhere deep in China Town with my parents. Chinese food on a cold day, after bristling your way through New York's windy freezing streets, this is the best treat a person could hope for-- there's also something oddly comforting about sitting around a table with perfect strangers. Small smiles and whispers are exchanged, "oohs" and "ahs," questions about what they got and what you got... It's the comfort of enjoying the same thing as they, one perfect moment of understanding. What should you try? EVERYTHING!! ...Well, the first time, you must, of course, try the xiao long bao. A few notes: *Pork xiao long bao: delicious. You might want to give it a minute to cool down a bit. but try to be as careful as you can with picking these little ones up. Once they burst, all the broth spills out, and you'll miss the BEST part. Scoop them up, placing them in the big spoon they give you, drizzle a few drops of vinegar, puncture a small hole into the dumpling, and SLLUUURP. So, so so good. *Crab bao: definitely not as good, so if you're debating between the two, get the original pork... Or you can be a fatty like me :) these dumplings were just a bit too fishy for my taste. Nonetheless, they were still good. Enjoy! *Noodles: greasy heaven. Just do it. *Hot tea: Chinese classic. You just gotta do it. Nothing out of the normal, but on a cold night, it warms you up quite well- --If you can, try to order a few things from their menu. Everything is a beautiful Chinese food creation, leaving you stuffed, warm and happy. ENJOY!
