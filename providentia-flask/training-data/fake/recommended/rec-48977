The guacamole was boring, although that did not stop me from eating all of it. They also messed up the order of our order . . . bringing our appetizer out at the same time as our main dish, with no acknowledgment of the mistake. And the tortilla soup was horrible. More like a bowl of warm and sour salsa verde with a few shreds of chicken and tortilla. There was no broth. I was pretty disappointed because I used to be a huge fan of Chavella's on Classon.
