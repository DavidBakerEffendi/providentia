I am really on the fence between a 3 and a 4 star rating for Nan Zhou, so let's go with 3.5 but rounded up to 4. This is a mean bowl of noodle soup. I go here, every so often, just to get away from Sang Kee and other egg noodle houses. I have tried multiple items on their menu and am still exploring. They are all really delicious. The highlight would have to be the noodles. Hand drawn or shaved noodle? They are both really tasty, but I prefer the shaved, just because it is a little different from what I am used to and the consistency at that size is a pleasure to eat. The broth is really rich and flavorful. I can see why they have a steady customer base. I am disappointed on the amount of meat toppings in EVERY bowl I've had. Maybe it is just an illusion because they give you a TON of noodles. But, at a dirt cheap price of around 6 dollars, I shouldn't be complaining too much. Here is a tip... get the spicy beef tendons! They are thinly shaved tendon, served chilled with chilli oil. Delicious. Nan Zhou is a small and quaint place with quick service and great food.
