Here's a literal hidden gem in New York City. Brought my girlfriend here for our anniversary by recommendation and I will continue that recommendation to anyone reading this review. We had their tasting menu which is $55 a person and unlike most other tasting menus in the city, we left full and fulfilled. The courses came the right times and matched well together and since you have your own time slot they don't rush you out. Also our server who I greet to have forgotten his name was awesome and kept us entertained during the courses. If you come here I can promise that you will not be disappointed.
