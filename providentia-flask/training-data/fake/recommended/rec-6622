Consistently great!   What you see is what you get.  Everything about this place is straightforward.  Their pre-fixe brunch menu stays pretty much the same from what I've noticed, which is not a bad thing at all.  This is where I go when I need to satisfy a nutella fix......the nutella french toast is a MUST TRY.  it's one of the best concoctions I've ever tasted.  I am less enthusiastic about the omelette dishes. Cute, cozy interior....they do a great job of using candelight to change up the ambiance a bit for dinner.  Speaking of, dinner was good but keep in mind that the portions are on the small side. Cash only, expect a long wait if you go during peak brunch time....and if you are still on the fence about the nutella french toast, just do it!!
