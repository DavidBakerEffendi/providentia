By far my favorite pizza in the city! Anytime I have friends in from out of town I make it a point to take them here, usually after a long night of drinking. Everyone is always super impressed & Craves going back the very next day. I always get the spinach & artichoke slice, which is the right portion of cheesy & creamy, but still has a perfectly crispy crust. The place is always packed, which means the pies are being made constantly & always hot & fresh. The staff is polite & moves quickly. The only bad thing about this place is the lack of seating & that it is cash only.
