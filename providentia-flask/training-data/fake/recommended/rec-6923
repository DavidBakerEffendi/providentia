I love the ambiance at Bijan, especially the wood burning fireplace.  I also like the tables, the bar, and the lighting. Unfortunately, I thought the food was only average, especially when entrees are mostly in the 15-20 range.   I had an enjoyable evening here, but I think next time I would come for cocktails (which are inventive and only 10 dollars) and snacks rather than a dinner.  I had the salmon, and while it was OK, it just wasn't great or worth the 18 dollars I paid for it.   So I would say Bijan is 4 stars for booze but 3 for eating.
