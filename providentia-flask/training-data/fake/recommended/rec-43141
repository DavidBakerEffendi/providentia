Such a cute little coffee spot in Midtown East. It's really tiny, and seems to get pretty packed on the weekends. I lived on 59th and 1st for a few months and didn't notice many specialty coffee spots so I'm not surprised people seem to flock to this one. My latte was very good and so was my chocolate croissant.
