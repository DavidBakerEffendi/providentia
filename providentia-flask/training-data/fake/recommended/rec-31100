Loved it!  The "house" salad was  chock full of the freshest ingredients.  We recommend the crabcake.  Not as impressed with the mussels.  The service was friendly and efficient.  The manager spent plenty of time providing the history of the restaurant - very enjoyable conversation.  Looking forward to our next visit!
