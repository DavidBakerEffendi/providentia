There aren't many quality Filipino restaurants in New York City. Okay, scratch that. There aren't many Filipino restaurants in New York City, period. That's where Maharlika steps in. To fill in the huge void, and to make sure they satisfy your palates (and stomaches) with tasty Filipino fare. What started out as a brunch pop-up has now developed into a full-fledged restaurant. I'm sure that's a direct result of the restaurant's popularity. If you ever find yourself at Maharlika, be sure to try their cocktails; they're delicious. My favorite so far has got to be Pacquiao's Punch. Made with Santa Teresa Gran Reserva rum, homemade ginger syrup, lemon, pineapple, and a "kiss" (or spray, rather) of absinthe, you're guaranteed to love your dinner. Must haves are the Filipino Pride Chicken 'N' Ube Waffle and Lamb Adobo. And if you're feeling adventurous, try the balut!
