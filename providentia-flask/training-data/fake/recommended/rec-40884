It's my new favorite place in the neighborhood. All of the salads are good. The duck torta=5 stars yum!! Lobster roll = 4 stars... I'm not a huge lobster person so judge for your self. Fried cod = 3 was fried perfectly but the sandwich was a little bland for my taste, maybe it needs a side of lemon served with it
