One of my favorite Mexican spots in the city. Started coming here over the summer when I moved into the neighborhood and it quickly became a weekend staple. I absolutely love everything from the staff to that chipotle sauce(more on that later) The food here is great. First off, the chips and salsa seem standard at first. But I promise you you'll start craving them after you leave just like I do. The chips are the perfect amount of crispy and I end up pouring half the sauces at the table on top of them. They offer tobasco, sriracha, chipotle sauce(drool) and I think another hot sauce. I appreciate this because I am a spicy food lover and I love drunkinly creating hot sauce soups(Ugh, sounds so gross. Drunk me promises it's not). I'm a vegetarian and I think I've tried all the options here. My favorite hands down would be the vege quesadilla. AMAZING. (FYI the portion is huge so I always end up splitting with a friend) Now on to the good stuff - THE DRINKS. The pitchers of margarita. Um hello - do I need to say more? The flavors range from blood orange to pineapple and they're all equally delicious. I remember one night my best friend and I ended up downing 2 pitchers( to test out the flavors..all in the name of Yelp) and we had a great time. That was also the night I tried their dulche de leche cake (awesome btw) All in all, this place is amazing. The atmosphere has that standard hipster vibe complete with the chalkboard menu that is handwritten, the music is nice, the food is great and the drinks are even better. I do want to say it has a tendency to get very loud so I won't really suggest it as a first date place! Unless of course it's warm, and you get to sit outside and people watch..and eat those chips...and drink those margaritas.
