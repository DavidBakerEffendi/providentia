I searched Yelp by star ratings and proximity to our hotel for a restaurant - wow!  Yelpers did not fail us!!!  This was a most excellent meal.  We ordered a hummus/falafel plate, Greek salad, and eggplant dish.  All were delicious!  The atmosphere is more of a take out, casual type of place - no table service - it was very clean and well appointed with middle eastern decor, and very friendly employees.  The only complaint I have is that they charge $1 for a small, albeit delicious, pita, but it was so good I'm not even going to dock a star!  Yum!!!!
