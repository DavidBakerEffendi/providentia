This place is everything the other reviewers said, and then some.  My sister and I had supper here last night, and the entire experience was fantastic.  From the owner so passionately describing the night's food selections, to the delicious food and dessert, we had a great time.  The owner checked with us several times to be sure we were enjoying our meal, and the wait staff (I believe his family) were equally friendly.  I will definitely be returning here often.  The portions are huge; my sister and I each had leftovers to bring home.  She had fried chicken, I had roasted chicken, and we both had beans, yellow rice, fried plantains and fresh blackberry juice.  All delicious.  Oh, and we had coffee served in Boontonware!
