I really enjoyed eating here and its a super relaxed place.  Ive been here twice and had sandwiches both time.  You can build your own which is great because they don't really charge extra for anything.  The salad bar is also quite extensive with a lot of different veggies to choose from.  They also have 3 different sizes for the salads so you can get as little or as much as you like. The staff was really helpful when I was trying to decide what to get.  Also, the sandwiches can be grilled making all of their wonderful ingredients taste even better.   This seems like a really good place to sit and relax or study for the Vermont students and its in a really convenient area.
