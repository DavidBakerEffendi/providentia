I've been here twice (this past summer) - once for lunch on a Saturday with a fairly big group (8 of us?) and once with my fiancé for dinner. I opted for the tasting menu both times (since I loved it so much the first time). The food was great both times but the value you get during lunch is significantly better (I think we each paid $90 for lunch and had ordered 2 bottles of wine; on the other hand, the total bill for dinner was over $500!). First, the atmosphere is phenomenal. It is old school French but so beautiful (the space itself with its high ceilings is stunning). Second, the service is attentive but a tad stuck up. Third, the food is outstanding. I can't remember what everyone else ordered but I remember I started with the treasure of wild mushrooms (delicious with foam) and ended with a truffle gnocchi (doesn't appear to be on the menu anymore but it was phenomenal). The chocolate soufflé is to die for!! The little dishes they keep bringing out and the selection of breads were great too. I remember a lot of these small dishes having truffle - no one complained about this of course! Bottom line: Go for Saturday lunch and opt for the tasting menu.
