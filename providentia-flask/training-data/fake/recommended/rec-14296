3.75 stars. Yet another burger place I've been dying to try for the longest time. Ordered the "Bistro burger" which is basically a regular cheeseburger with bacon added.  The meat patty is fried (at least, that's what my friend said), thick, and had the crispy bacon with fresh lettuce, tomato, and onion.  There was no sauce.   I was able to appreciate the natural flavor of the beef, and also the fact that it wasn't very oily (I ordered mine medium well) despite it being fried.  The fresh veggies added to the overall "clean" flavor.  And while I was able to appreciate it, I still felt the burger was a little dry (maybe I should've just ordered it medium?) and could've used some sort of sauce or maybe more seasoning.  The bacon was good and crispy (often times I find bacon in burgers to be limp and soggy). It's a thick patty (like Shake Shack) and about the same size too.  However, definitely not as oily/greasy as Shake Shack's.  But not as tasty either =( Overall, pretty good.  I'd definitely come again. The fries were stale, tasteless, no salt, nothing great.
