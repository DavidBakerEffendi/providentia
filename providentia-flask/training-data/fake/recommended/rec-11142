I definitely want to come back here sometime when I can enjoy the full experience.  I came here for a Sunday Funday HH with some friends, but I was on a detox so I couldn't drink!!!!  I know, it was awful....seltzer with a lime....the things you do for your friends :)  Still, the drinks THEY had looked yummy, and the bar menu had some tasty looking dishes as well. Love the decor!  Silent black and white film playing on a huge flat screen at the back of the restaurant, cute mirrors and pictures on the walls, very warm and inviting and fancy at the same time. Great happy hour specials, $5 featured wine, and featured cocktails...not bad!
