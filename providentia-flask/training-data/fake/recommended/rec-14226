I came on here to write an update to a previous review I had written about L'Artusi. Imagine my embarrassment upon realizing I have yet to write a review about this place. Gasp!!!! If we ever live in New York, this will be our regular dining spot. This is the restaurant that fueled me for a 1/2 marathon PR in April! The kitchen that had me eating raw fish and loving it! This past Friday night was our third trip to L'Artusi and even better than the past two. Â We had a great waiter who was specifically monitoring the bar area (great strategy so that the bartenders aren't doing double duty) and was really friendly, with plenty of suggestions that definitely didn't steer us or our tastebuds in the wrong direction. The garlic spaghetti was a (perfectly sized) bowl of yum. My husband loved his white bolognese and to cap it all off, when we ordered a cheese to try at the end of the meal, they added a ricotta for us to try at no additional charge! The atmosphere is perfect - intimate (but not snobby), upscale (but no need to dress for the Oscars nor bring an ATM with you), friendly (staff are awesome, from the front desk through to the kitchen) and underneath the appearance is real food (some of which is sourced locally). L'artusi = love.
