The food was not worth the price. I don't know about you but to me the most important part of a restaurant is the food. I ordered blistered peppers, a grilled octopus special, a tuna and caviar special, and baked goat cheese tapas. None was excellent, the dishes were all mediocre. Sure the place was lovely, the service was really good, but for a $120 meal (4 tapas & 2 glasses of wine) I expect great food.
