I've had Robataya bookmarked as a place to try for the longest time, so I was so happy to see that it was within walking distance (and open!) after we got out of a concert at Webster Hall. Their menu is huge... full of delicious things; I wanted to order everything! Eventually, we settled for uni kobu yaki, the duck appetizer special, the sashimi appetizer special, grilled barracuda and salmon & salmon roe kamameshi. The star dish of the night: salmon & salmon roe kamameshi! It's basically rice cooked in an Earthenware pot topped with salmon and the roe - but, it's so good! Simple and clean, the ingredients really shine in this dish. The most anticipated, but most disappointing dish was the grilled uni. Sea urchin grilled in a clam shell topped with salted konbu seaweed. The seaweed totally overpowered the delicate flavor of the uni, I couldn't even tell that's what I was eating... even after we pushed aside the seaweed. The portions are small (especially the appetizers! 3 slices of duck and 5 of sashimi) as other reviewers pointed out (as did our server), but the rice dish is filling and not very expensive so I'd definitely recommend finishing the meal off with that. We weren't insanely full, but were satisfied after the dessert: black sesame mochi (delicious).
