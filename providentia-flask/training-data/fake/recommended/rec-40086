Okay, so this really is excellent pizza! I split a small (14", 6 slices) with a friend and we were both stuffed and quite satisfied with our food experience. We added pepperoni and sausage to ours. I normally don't like to load up my pizza with meat, but I decided to here and I was not disappointed. Four stars instead of five for the price: $16.50 for a small pizza PLUS $3 for each topping. In total, it was $22.50 for 6 small slices. That's a bit outrageous, even for New York.
