Amazing food, good happy hour specials, and a good atmosphere. If you are looking for a hipstered out bar to be seen at, then go somewhere else. I like this place because they have TV's for sports games, quality happy hour specials, and a great deck out back (includes a beer pong and actual "stoops" to lounge on). The staff is friendly and the place has (so far) seemed to steer clear of hipsters.
