Ive been wanting to try this place out for sometime now, ive read great reviews and thought i should check it out since i love friend chicken!.. i decided to go last night and ordered the chicken basket, 3 pieces of chicken, biscuit and mac and cheese. The chicken- ive had better, seem to me that it needed more flavor and i think i got it a lil on the pink side. this was the main reason i gave the review "3 stars" The mac-n-cheese- it was really good i enjoyed the hot sauce, ive never had mac n cheese with hot sauce. The bicuit- i really really like the biscuit and mixed with the mac n cheese even better but unfortunately it was cold? wish it woulve been fresh out the oven .. overall the experience was good and the food was ok but not 4 or 5 stars i will try again but not make it a must have food... next time i'll goback and get the donuts which i hear they make themselves and are really good..and update my review then
