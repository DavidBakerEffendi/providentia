My girlfriend and I had a terrific experience at Bleu Sushi. The decor is fantastic, we loved the lighting. The staff was incredibly upbeat and treated us like gold even though we purchased a LivingSocial deal. The owner came out and personally greeted us right before we ordered. He saw that we brought a bottle of wine and had a chiller sent to our table. I often feel a little awkward whenever an owner visits my table, however this guy was the best. 30 second, quick conversation, thanked us for coming and encouraged us to try the kimchi fries (which we did and were awesome). The sushi/sashimi was spot on. Very fancy presentation.  We ordered about $30 worth of food and were full.  We had an amazing date there and look forward to going back ASAP style!
