I was a fan of the old Jolie on Atlantic and I'm a fan of this new place, too. Sat at the bar a couple of times for wine and a sampling of appetizers (the fish tacos were delicious). Â I really miss Robin du Bois and JC (although very different) does have the same vibe: Not too crowded, not too loud, caters to "regulars" and the bartenders/staff are nice but not overly chatty.
