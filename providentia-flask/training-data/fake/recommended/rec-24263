We thought this place would be a great shot in the arm to the neighborhood but it's just lame.  The cooperate all black costumes are silly, stiff and so 1993.  We were charged for our small to-go box, which is fine, but when you say its part of our mission statement, present said mission statement where we can see it (admittedly, it may have been in small print on the menu... but tell us when we ask...) My steak and eggs was good, the steak above average, but the breakfast taters were greasy and mushy.   The rosemary potatoes are better then the "signature" potatoes (onions and peppers) but still, greasy and mushy.  The veggie benedict was minuscule and mediocre.  All and all, average food in a in a forced environment that felt planned in a boardroom.
