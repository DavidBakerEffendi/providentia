Went after work with a friend to check out the happy hour....was very pleased with everything! The hostess and bartender were very friendly, and the atmosphere was awesome. It was my first time there, and I loved looking at all of the specialty olive oils and other things for sale on the shelves by the bar. You can even try all of the olive oils! I love that they have hooks under the bar for you to hang your bag or coat; I didn't have to worry about my work bag getting in everyone's way or sitting on the floor out of reach. I had the pinot grigio on the happy hour menu. It went down very smoothly, though I was expecting perhaps a bit more flavor; I didn't think it was either dry or sweet....I'm actually having a difficult time describing it (though I've just recently started drinking wine, so perhaps that has something to do with it). I still enjoyed every sip, though! My friend had a glass of the malbec, and then tried the montepulciano which he loved. We shared the fresh housemade mozzarella and the margherita flatbread, both of which were amazing! The bartender suggested that we try some of the garlic olive oil (from the cool display shelf; they provide small cups at each station) to go with our dishes, and it was a great recommendation! Will definitely be back! I'm interested to check out the full menu.
