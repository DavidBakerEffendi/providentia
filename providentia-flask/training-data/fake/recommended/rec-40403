I should be kicked out of a moving car and left on the shoulder to find my own way home for not coming to Sharky's sooner. I live well within walking distance and should have been coming here for years. The beer selection is a notch above what usual dive bars serve and include Newcastle, Sam Seasonal and Cherry Wheat, along with the usual Coors Light and Rolling Rock stuff. 40 cent wings for happy hour Monday thru Friday and all night Monday and Tuesday is nothing to scoff at. The chunky garlic wings are also unique and delicious. You gotta like garlic, but they will knock your socks off.
