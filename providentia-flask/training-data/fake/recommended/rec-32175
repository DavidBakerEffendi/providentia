I recently dined here with a few friends and their children.  I must say first of all that this place has the BEST sushi I have ever had.  Hands down. Additionally, I noticed there were quite a few families also dining at the same time - and everyone (including our group) was having a fantastic time.  The service was great - our Hibachi Chef was Brian and he was funny & great with the adults & the kids.   Our server was Dan - he was busy with a few packed tables, but really did a great job attending to every request in a timely and friendly manner.   Next time I definitely want to check out the bar before dinner!
