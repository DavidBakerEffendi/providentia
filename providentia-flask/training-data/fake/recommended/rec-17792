I got a Gilt voucher to this place with a 4 course meal.  Let me just say that the food was delicious as well as the service.  We added more to our order especially the 1 dollar oysters for Happy Hour!  Me and the hubby loved it so much we went back without a voucher can ordered what ever we wanted this time around.  It maybe a little pricey but your in New York two $$ is the usual.
