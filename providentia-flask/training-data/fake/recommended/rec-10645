This place is great, exactly what I was looking for in a place to get a cup of tea and study. The tea was loose leaf in a bag, and they have English breakfast decaf in loose leaf which not a lot of places have! Unfortunately the foam on their cappuccinos is more an airy foam than a good froth, and the tables are very tiny, but I understand they need to accommodate the masses.
