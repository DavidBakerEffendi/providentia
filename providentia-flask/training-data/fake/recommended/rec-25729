Loved Nook!  I came here with a friend for dinner before a Broadway show, we found it on Yelp and decided to give it a whirl--we were not disappointed.  It is literally a nook though so if you're claustrophobic you may want to steer clear.  We sat at a tiny table by the host's station/kitchen, we didn't even have to order because the owner/waiter overheard us discussing what we were going to get so he simply confirmed it with us.  We had a delicious sea bass and a shrimp dish. The food was great, also it is a BYOB which is rare to find in NY, so that was fun.
