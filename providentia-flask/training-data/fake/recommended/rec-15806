Drat I really wanted to try their brunch... But dinner turned out to be pretty awesomesauce so I didn't feel too disappointed. Penelope has a waiting area right when you enter, and it's a sign of their popularity that they have a bench + several stools squashed in the doorway to sit on (though some preferred waiting outside in the cold for some reason). It was PACKED inside, but once my friend showed up we didn't have to wait very long. I can see myself coming back here for a casual dinner date since the interior was warm and had that intimate ambience; the whole restaurant was very dark, to the point that the only light seemed to come from the mini candles placed around the room. Note: it gets rly noisy inside, not to the point that I had to shout for my friend to hear me, but I definitely had to put in some effort. The Food: - warm brie and green apple sandwich w/ honey mustard and fakin' bacon (delicious! combo of the melting brie, slices of crisp sweet apple, soft textured bacon, and tongue-tingling sauce was unique and tasty) - BBLT + fries on the side (this was my friend's drool-worthy sandwich, and I got to try some of her soft yummy fries) - red velvet cake w/ cream cheese frosting (the red velvet part was good, but the frosting was so thick and sweet I had to scrape some of it off) We got separate checks, and they came in these cute mini-buckets that we just plopped our credit cards into. Service was tiptop except for the instance when our waiter forgot to bring my friend her lemonade; I had to give the waiters props though cuz I got to see how busy they were while waiting for our table to be ready. One of them was wearing shorts and had rly hairy legs ;P I'll be back for brunch and an update!
