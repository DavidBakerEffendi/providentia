More specifically, our meal and experience = 3.5 stars Perhaps add another half star for the bit of dramatic entertainment that was thrown in! During our hour-long wait, when the crowd had cleared we sat at the bar. My hubby ordered a drink and immediately the bartender made it and brought it to him.  About a minute after that - the restaurant manager came over to talk to the bartender. Could not hear what was being discussed, but soon the bartender very calmly said to her "Well, I thinking I am resigning now."   He turned around gathered all his things and left!  Very awkward moment for everyone at the bar.  Cool thing is that my hubby was never charged for his drink. On to our meals: Our waiter at our table had to now be the bartender too so we felt bad for him.  But he was awesome and didn't miss a beat.  He made my martini which was very good.  We ordered the special for two: 40 oz. ribeye, potato hash brown thingy and fava (sp?) bean salad. The steak was prepared right, medium,  and it tasted alright - not spectacular. Lots of fat. The au jus dipping sauce made it.   Potatos were nothing spectacular. The bean salad was the best part. I could have eaten an entire bowl of just that.   Next time we will order a regular dish instead of the special.  We will also make reservations a couple days in advance.
