There are so many great restaurants in West Philly that it can be difficult to choose, but this place definitely deserves a visit! We started with a sampler that included: - hummus w/warm pita - stuffed grape leaves - lentils I definitely recommend it, but the hummus was the highlight.  My entree was the shrimp served with rice, it was friggen fantastic.  My girlfriend had the salmon, and I would say it was a toss up. Dessert was not as yummy as I had hoped--Oreo beignets sound great, but were a bit dry and a bit of a let down. The waitress was very nice, and overall we felt that the meal was a good value.
