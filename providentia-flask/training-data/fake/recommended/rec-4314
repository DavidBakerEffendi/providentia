A disappointing meal. Terrible red sauce. Milky white salsa? Eager to find a place that serves "authentic" Mexican cuisine in West Philly I took a chance Guacamole Mex. Big mistake. The Chips and Salsa I was given the option of mild or hot salsa. The hot "salsa" came out as a small cup of a milky red sauce. What is this? Mayo with sriracha? Definitely not salsa. It tasted of ground up Hot Andy Cap snack fries and mayo. Gross. Don't call it salsa if it is not salsa. The unheated store bought variety chips didn't help the situation. Bad sign when an "authentic" Mexican restaurant can't even make their own warm tortilla chips. The Meal I chose two of my favorites: cheese enchiladas and marinated pork tacos. Given the quality of the chips and salsa I was indeed worried about the main course. The enchiladas, which weren't even hot, were covered with what looked to be a slice of American cheese and an overly sweet red sauce. This sauce tasted more like canned Hunt's tomato sauce than any enchilada sauce I've ever experienced. What a mess. The bubbling, hot, cheesiness I expect in cheese enchiladas was nowhere to be found in this disaster. The marinated pork taco was the only redeeming part of my meal. Though again not hot enough in temperature, the seasoned pork (which I believe was just Chorizo), pineapple, cilantro and onion filling was a great complementary mix of flavors but the weird cheese slice could have been replaced by a shredded variety. A corn shell would have worked better than its flour shell. Overall a disappointment that cost me 18.75. Guacamole Mex-Grill is not a restaurant I'll ever be returning to. I normally give 1-star ratings to restaurants I would never return to, however the pork taco bumped it up a star.
