I happened upon this place randomly one night.  I love it! The service is fantastic, very friendly and personal.  The food is even better, every bite of every meal that I've shared here is amazing.  From the fennel salad, to paparadelle, to scallops, to tiramisu and so much more, it's terrific.  This is now my favorite Italian restaurant and my go to place any night of the week.  The only problem is that they're so fantastic, it's very crowded on a Friday night, so expect to wait an hour plus.
