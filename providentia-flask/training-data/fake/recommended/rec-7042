What a wonderful restaurant!  Down to Earth, welcoming and just damn tasty.  Anything involving fried chicken and biscuits should be delicious but this place takes it to another level.  We shared the fried green tomatoes and three fried chicken and biscuit sandwiches: nettie, moselle and the 'michelle' which had pimento cheese on it.  The owners brought us some jezebelle sauce to try which had an apple horseradish base and was delicious.  Highly recommended!!!
