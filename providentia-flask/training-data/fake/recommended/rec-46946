We came here after going to peaches 1st and discovering that it was closed for a private function. A nice lady walking by suggested that we come here. It was a little weird at first coming in the door a little on the rustic side. We ordered the margharita pizza a coffee and mimosa. The pizza was flavorless and lacked consistency. The coffee was bland and the mimosa was flat! When the waiter asked us how was our food, we were honest. When they came back with the check they apologized for our experience and took the pizza off the check. We give them a 5 on good customer service.
