Great for an inexpensive and good lunch near downtown Hartford! Bonus they have a small parking lot which is hard to find. Stopped in for lunch with some co-workers and we all enjoyed it! The serve was fast so we were able to get in and out during our hour lunch break. I had one of the Maki lunch specials: miso soup, Californian roll and salmon avocado roll for $8.50. The other lunch specials range in price from $8.50-$14.95. So great price for sushi for lunch. It is nothing crazy fancy but if you are looking for good quality sushi at a reasonable price this place fits the bill.
