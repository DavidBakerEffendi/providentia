Apparently this place is usually packed but we got there Friday at 10:30pm and we were able to grab a table for 5 immediately. There's a lot of hype surrounding this place and it's pretty on point. The original burger is incredible. There's the texture of fried cheese in the middle which makes this burger crazy good... also the mushrooms and pan seared tomatoes (which simulates ketchup). The buns are potato buns which is what I like and the patties are fantastic - as they dripped a bit of grease and blood onto my plate - amazing. The onion rings came out undercooked, but their fries are pretty excellent. Overall great place. Might not be worth a 2 hour wait, but definitely one of the better burger joints in the city.
