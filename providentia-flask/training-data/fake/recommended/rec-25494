This is some of the best Georgian food I've had inside or outside Georgia. Incredibly moist, great-tasting, fat kebobs; astonishing khatchapuri (Georgian cheese bread); fresh salad; fragrant and juicy khinkali (dumplings).  And a good Georgian wine list and real Georgian mineral water!  A very special experience and highly recommended. Our least favorite thing we ate were the grape leaves.
