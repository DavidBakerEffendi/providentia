I love this place! Like what the other reviewer mentioned, it's small but it's clean and cozy. The owners are so friendly and accommodating. As far as food I would say it's above from the other filipino places in Queens. I am so addicted to their Bami noodle and beef pares. Can't wait to try their other food but just can't help to get the same dish again and again! Oh they also have karaoke and kamayan night. It's a BYOB place.
