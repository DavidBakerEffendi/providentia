I think Egan and Sons is pretty standard. Nothing mind blowing and nothing terrible. They scored huge points in my book for staying open on a crazy snowy evening a few weeks ago. Most other restaurants we closed or closing. Egan and Sons, however, was warm, welcoming, and serving food! For a young adult on a budget, the menu is pretty limited. My date and I both got burgers (portobello and beef) which were all delicious. They were really the only thing we could afford on the menu without spending our entire out-to-eat budget.
