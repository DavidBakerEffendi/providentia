Was introduced to this place while walking by with some friends. She pointed out to me that this place sells Belgian fries. The line made it look pretty good. Tried it by myself and loved the variety of sauces to choose from. I picked the Wasabi Mayo. Was good and tasty - when you are in the mood for a creamy spicy dip. Portions are big for 1 person but that also comes with the price. Not cheap but not expensive either. And something like fries - 1 person eating is boring and just way too gluttonous. Came back with a friend from DC. We got the Vietnamese Pineapple Mayo. Is probably one of the best sauces there. Was really tasty - creamy, a little sweet with a bit of savoriness to it. Great balance. Been to this place several times already and with friends - they all love it. Fun food, great to enjoy outside - or after some drinks. They are very quick with the orders and very helpful with giving samples of the sauces so that you can choose which you'd like to get. Have not tried the poutine yet but pretty excited about it. Haven't had poutine for years since my last trip to Montreal. And even then, my last poutine was from Burger King! So, a nice, homemade poutine sounds awesome. Definitely recommend for a place to go with friends and share fries - fun food!
