I attended a friends and family night at The Gander and was impressed by the quality of food and service that the restaurant provided from day one. Our server Koreen was very knowledgeable and personable. She suggested a nice Cotes du Rhone for me to start with and later stepped it up to a fuller, funkier Portuguese wine. I was dining with a vegan, and that wasn't a problem at all - they had a salad to start with, a trumpet mushroom entree, and a vegetable side for him. I had the trout tartare - tender small pieces of raw fish served with red caviar, spicy mustard seeds, chopped asparagus (I think), and a crunchy toast of something that looked like fish skin - inventive and delicious. My main course was the beet tortelli - round pouches with bright deep pink bellies of beety filling cooked to a perfect consistency, topped up with radish (I think) crisps and goat yogurt. Superb! Finally, for desert we had a strawberry rhubarb sorbet (for the vegan) and a creme brulee made with whisky, among other things, and served with bacon bits and hazelnuts. The rich creamy goodness was a perfect combination of sweet, salty and bitter, not to mention the pretty presentation. They also had a health inspector visit in the middle of the preview night, which made them stop serving for a bit. However, the staff handled the situation with grace and we loved them even more for it. Welcome and best of luck to this great new addition to the NYC contemporary American dining scene.
