I'm kind of in shock that I'm not in a sugar coma. Why you ask? Oh because my mother and I went here and got (get ready for it) one choux creme, one tiramisu, one pear cream thing, and one hazelnut chocolate tart. You're probably getting a cavity just reading this. Take a break to floss if you must. By far we liked the choux creme the best. It had just the right touch of richness but was still light and the hazelnut was amazing. I think the chocolate tart was too rich. It needed less dark and more semi sweet. The pear thing... is the reason this is 4 stars. NASTY. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I am literally screaming that which is why it is mass capped. The tiramisu was alright. The choux though. That was the bees knees. And other cheesy sentiments. Can't wait to eat dinner here!
