This place is a GEM tucked away in South Philly. We mixed up the tacos and sampled them all. The al pastor and the chicken were to die for! The salsa was fantastic. Everything was fresh and it all screams authentic Mexican. Try the burritos and the plato mixto as well! Whatever you get...it will be awesome. The best part!!! It doesn't burn a whole in your wallet. Enjoy.
