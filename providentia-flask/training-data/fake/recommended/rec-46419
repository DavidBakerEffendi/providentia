I love it when the critics like Adam Platt from NY Mag write negative reviews and the entire place is packed and booked solid.  It accurately portrays the value of his profession.  =) This was a wonderful restaurant with interesting dishes that were wonderful in their (seeming) simplicity.  Yes, the lobster appetizer is well worth it and delightful.  The salmon dish was prepared perfectly; if you like your fish cooked until it's jerky this will not be your place - it was barely seared.  Perfect.  Bartender made some excellent drinks and the waitstaff was fun and friendly. I will definitely be thrilled to eat there again!
