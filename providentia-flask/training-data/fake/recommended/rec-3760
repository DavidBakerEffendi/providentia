This is one of my favorite Thai spots in BK.  Once you are seated they serve the food pretty fast!  I love the chicken curry puffs and the chicken curry Penang dish!  We tried the pad Thai today and it was prob the worst I've had.  It was wayyyy to sweet!  I had to keep drinking water after each bite.  Also they need to do something about the front door!  It's so cold inside if you are seated close to the front.  We had to eat with our coats on and ordered tea to keep us warm when it was 14 degrees out!  Next time I will do take out! The cheap prices will keep me coming back though!
