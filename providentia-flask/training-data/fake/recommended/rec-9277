I had the three kinds of endless pasta, which was very good, but I was Â eyeing someone's osso buco across the room. Next time I'll have to resist my carb urges and order something off the menu. The problem with the pasta special is that you get filled up so quickly, since it's so heavy. We went for a pre-theater meal, and the staff here is very efficient about getting you fed and out of there on time. My only complaint is the tight seating -- this other couple was practically sitting in our laps and we all had to work hard to pretend we couldn't hear each others' conversations. Oh well. It's New York.
