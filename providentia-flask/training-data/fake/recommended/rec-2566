The pizza was good, but I wasn't wowed.  The wait was long and I was really hungry. We ordered a large Margarita Pizza.  The crust was crispy and tasty but there just wasn't enough toppings. I thought it tasted kind of bland.  I know the crust cannot be light and crispy with too many toppings but it could've used a just a little more.   I would say Lombardi's is good but not great.
