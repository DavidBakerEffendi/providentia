I went here on a first date about a year ago. ive never been to a restaurant like this before than, and didnt really know what to expect. It was a small cozy place, only a few tables. Paper menu, which my date commended because it means they change the menu often, i guess according to season. I ordered the porkloin medium, with a spicy carrot puree. it was so delicious. i can still taste it a year later. This was the restaurant that turned me on to REAL food.
