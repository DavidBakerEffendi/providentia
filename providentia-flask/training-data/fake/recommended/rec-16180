I love the food at this place! Came here twice in the past two months, once for dinner and once for brunch.   Dinner - This place is lively and fun!  The food was amazing.  We ordered the Dulce  which is a Fire Roasted Sweet Corn Empanada, Goat Cheese, Vine Ripe Tomotoes for appetizer, it was so good, cooked to perfection!  For dinner I had the salmon minus the mango chutney (i really dislike mango!)  It was cooked perfectly and was really yummy.  My hubby had the chicken which he really enojoyed.  I ordered a glass of berry sangria with my meal....It was delicious, some of the best I have had outside of spain!   We had the cocos for dessert which was made with coconut ice cream it was delicous.   We back a few weeks later with my girlfriends for Sangria brunch.....YUMMY!!......Def make reservations though....I saw people being offered to sit at the bar because they didn't have reservations..... I ordered the Huevos Divorciados which was really good, the crab cakes were cooked perfectly and the portion was the perfect size. My friends ordered the Tortilla Espanolia and the Veggie Paella, which they both really enjoyed. The sangria bar was set up not to far from our table and they had 8 kinds of sangria that you could choose from.  It was unlimited which was nice, and one could try anyone they chose.  I had two different red sangrias both of which were delicious!   Overall we had a great time and never felt pressured to leave our table quickly even though the place was packed......
