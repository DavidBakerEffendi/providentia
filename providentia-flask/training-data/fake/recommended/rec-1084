Was there in n early October 2013.  First impression was good.  The owner was in the lobby to greet visitors, told me the hostess ( OK,  you fascist liberals, yell at me because I didn't use the politically correct word for "hostess" ) would be right with us and she was.  Very gracious lady, I did not have a reservation, but she seated me on a busy Saturday night.  The room we were seated in was beautiful.  Polished floors, white linens on the tables, very nicely done lighting on the perimeter of the room.  Great ambiance.  Old-school Italian elegance.  Service was absolutely phenomenal.  There were 3 people watching my table - server, busboy, another person to bring bread and water.  I'm all about service, if you've read my other reviews, and this place is EXEMPLARY.   Even if they had served me TastyKakes  and Twinkies, I would have given them a great review because of the service.  Now the food:  Had veal braciole. Absolutely  tasty beyond belief.  I got a portion of two bracioles, plus the pasta.  The salad was freshly made, came out very crisp.  No brown-edged lettuce in this place.  Portion size is good, I couldn't eat it all, had to leave some on the table, and I can eat.  A word about their gravy ( or "sauce" for you superior people from New York ).  This is a darker gravy, one that is cooked down for a long time.  It is not burned, it is just cooked longer and gets dark.  There's nothing wrong with it, it's just a different style of gravy.  It tasted really good.   Don't bother looking for a parking spot in this neighborhood, you'd have better luck trying to get a date with Sophia Vergara.  Use whatever valet service or parking lot is in the neighborhood.    Full bar service.  Which makes the Irishmen in the family very happy.  Hope you enjoy your visit. Very traditional southern Italian cooking, and I would say their menu is very consistent with what I used to see when I lived in  Naples.
