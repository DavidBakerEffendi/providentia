Lived in New Haven for about six months with my wife and several friends. We endeavored to sample all the main pizza establishments on a few occasions (Sally's, Pepe's, Modern's, Bar). There was some disagreement in our group, but in general Sally's came out on top. The eggplant pizza at Sally's is a masterpiece. Fried eggplant that is melded with cheese and sauce (not fried disks on top like many places). The pizza manages to be custard-like on top and still crisp and bready below. Sally's is definitely my favorite new haven pizza
