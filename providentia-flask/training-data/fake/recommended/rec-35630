Went here last night and had a GREAT meal. Cute atmosphere, complimentary sparkling water (what a cute touch!), complimentary hummus and pita instead of merely bread and olive oil.... Ordered a delicious, fresh cocktail with thai basil in it. Very light, crisp. A +. Boyfriend and I shared the cauliflower with chickpeas and yogurt and the kale with fried egg for appetizer. Both were delicious! Cauliflower was tangy and light. Kale was perfectly roasted and crunchy. Fried egg was an interesting addition. For meal I ordered the vegetable cakes. Edamame hummus on top of cake was delicious. String beans were OK. Not amazing, but sufficed. Overall veggie cakes were very good, but appetizers were better. Boyfriend has Osso Bucco Pork. Pork fell right off the bone. YUMMMM. Polenta was lackluster (though). Tasted like flavorless oatmeal. Hmmm.... Side of fiingerling potatoes needed seasoning or some sort of olive oil. Not a fan. Overall I was VERY HAPPY with my cocktail and meal. Skipped dessert. Cute place, healthy options, I'll be back!!
