This place is amazing!! No joke. I rarely review or have this much zeal to appreciate a restaurant but this place I can honestly say is my new favorite. I've eaten here several times. Once to have a dinner and the other times for take out. I'm steps from this place and its a godsend. I don't really have time to cook so I've been ending up ordering dinners/breakfast from here. The courses are pretty much spot on homestyle (yet complex) Italian. I've just recently spent 2 months in Tuscany and this place reminds me so much of it. I just recently had brunch here (take out again) and its pretty amazing as well. The English breakfast is rich and complex melange of flavors. I was so impressed by the black pudding. Not many places can do this very well. The staff is super friendly and very accommodating. The place itself is whimsically decorated and very visually appealing. The wallpaper is amazing! It's unpretentious, easy, calm and relaxing in the restaurant. Such a change from the usual neighborhood spots. I completely recommend everyone to stop by this amazing place !
