It was a bit crowded in Stowe for New Year's Eve week and dinner reservations were impossible so we sauntered down to Burlington and hit the Bar at Hen of the Wood shortly after 4 pm opening.   We were then able to get seats at the open kitchen bar where we were delighted and entertained by Chef Laura.  She was awesome to watch as her passion for food is exhibited in her every move and she graciously engaged in conversation and answered our every question.   Three of us sampled pork hake and rabbit for our main course and a couple of small plates to start.  The food was exhilarating and wine pairing exquisite.   We couldn't have had a better food experience.   Highly recommended!   As good as it gets.
