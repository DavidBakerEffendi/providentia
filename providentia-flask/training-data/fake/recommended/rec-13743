I was there March 2010 @ 11:30am sharp; no waiting in line. The pizza is ok not the best. I had the Original Tomato w/mozzarella and added sausage as my one topping. The crust was the best thing here, slightly burnt edges and slightly crispy all around. But the tomato sauce lacked presents; ketchup would've made more of a flavor impression. They shred their cheese which hides it's fresh taste because it gets too caramelized in that brick oven. On brick oven pizzas, I like when they cut circles from fresh mozzarella balls, the cheese retains a lot more flavor and melted texture. The sausage was very nice, with slight hints of herbs and cut into small circles. You'll notice that the pizzas have an irregular round shape because the dough is spread out by hand, which give it a nice rustic appearance. Good and friendly service, historic space, and cool views of the kitchen. I recommend this place to any tourist. But I gave it three stars for the pizza; I guess I might have liked it more if I hadn't eating at Lombardi's in NYC two days earlier.
