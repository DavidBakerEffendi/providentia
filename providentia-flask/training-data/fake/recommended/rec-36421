My husband and his friend dragged me here for brunch, and I'll be the first to admit I wasn't on my best behavior, playing the whiney wife who didn't want to wade through throngs of people to eat a heavy meal on a beautiful Saturday morning... So all my bitching made it worse when I loved my breakfast... Hubby saw a waitperson carrying a bowl of oatmeal through the dining room--it wasn't on the menu--and asked the sweetheart serving us about it. They serve it next door at the bakery and she ran over there (literally) to get me some (nice!). Steel cut oats with raisins, made in a way I've never had before and wish I knew. So light and creamy (made without cream--I asked). The fresh fruit plate was one of the nicest and freshest assortments I've had ANYWHERE. Sound ridiculous to rave about cut up fruit, but it was that good. Hubby's eggs benedict more than satisfied his craving. Perfectly poached eggs and a very light hollandaise. Friend went for the mussels and a side of french fries (all those reports saying these are the best fries in the city are true! And being the french fry addict I am, I grabbed more than a few). We splurged for the bread basket assortment ($19!), but it was worth every penny and every morsel of fat. Still dreaming about the chocolate bread and sticky bun. Yeah, it was crowded and loud, but I'll say I'll be back next time in the neighborhood.
