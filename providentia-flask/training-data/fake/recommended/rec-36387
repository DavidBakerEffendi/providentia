Food was exquisite, but the table I was in it was horrible.  we were seating next to the waiter station and they kept bombing in to us with out say sorry or excuse at least.  I made the reservation 3 weeks before  and this where the seating me? Really bad mannerism, not what you would expect from a 4 star restaurant.
