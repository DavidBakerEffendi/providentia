To give this review some context, I think it's important to give a bit of background info. Okay, so, I am not vegan, but my daily diet is largely vegan or vegetarian. That being said, I always held a firm belief vegetarian sushi just wasn't the real deal. However, Beyond Sushi has really taken vegan sushi to a new level. Each roll is so creative and flavorful that I hardly realize that there is no fish present. So, I would just like to thank Beyond Sushi for changing my mind about what constitutes sushi and of course, with providing me with delicious food. Now, if you're still a skeptic, I strongly suggest you going here and seeing (or I guess tasting) for yourself. I don't think you'll be sorry :)
