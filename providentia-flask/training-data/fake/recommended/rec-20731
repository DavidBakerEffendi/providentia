Came here to get lunch because some of my friends wanted to try this place. The cold soba noodles were pretty good. I got the Bang Bang Ji that had chicken breast, fried noodles, some green stuff I forgot what it's called and soba noodles. It comes with an orange colored sauce that was pretty tasty. I mixed it all in with the soba noodles but only things I didn't like was that it was spicy and the portions don't fill me up. Other than that service wasn't bad and the place is pretty small. It had tall tables and stools but I prefer chairs. Overall, pretty good experience.
