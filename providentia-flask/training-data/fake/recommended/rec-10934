Took my GF here for Sunday brunch. 1) This happened to be a very cold day and it seems as though the restaurant neglected to turn on the heat because everyone in the restaurant (including us) were wearing their jackets. Way to create a comfortable enviornment. 2) I see my waiter jump behind the bar at one point, and when he comes over I mention "oh your the bartender too?" He replies "No we just all work the bar". I am all for employees helping out but this is Sunday brunch, they should have a designated bartender. And this explains why the service was really poor (had to ask twice for bread and hail people over to get a drink and a check) 3) AND MOST IMPORTANTLY we got FOOD POISONING. Now I know that the source of food posioning is very hard to prove however using deducution that myself and my GF only ate or drank together at this particualr restaurant within a 24 hour period prior to and didnt eat afterwards I can almost certainly say this place got us HORRIBLY SICK. Like ruined my Thanksgiving 5 days later sick, and I love thanksgiving. The food although tasting good was clearly contaiminated. THANKS FOR THE $95 BRUNCH FOOD POSIONING LANDMARC.
