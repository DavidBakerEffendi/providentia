I was a little skeptical at first, unsure if the 2-hr wait was worth it - especially after having had an underwhelming experience at the over-hyped Momofuko Noodle Bar. Any hint of hesitation was quickly erased as I took the first bite of my pork bun. Â The staff is wonderfully warm and efficient. I love how they yell out "welcome" in Japanese to everyone that walks into the dining room. Pork buns: best thing I've ever put in my mouth. A work of beauty. We sat at the bar and saw the effort and dedication that went into putting this together. The pork is incredibly juicy and tender. The buns and special sauce are just right. I couldn't get enough of these. You can order some at the bar while you wait for your table. Ramen: We ordered the special ramen, which was Szechuan style pork ramen with black sesame sauce, and we added Bakudan, a spicy sauce, for $2. The broth was amazing; incredibly flavorful, spicy and delicious. The noodles and everything else complemented the ramen perfectly. My only complaint is that I wish they were as generous with the pork as they were with the flavor.
