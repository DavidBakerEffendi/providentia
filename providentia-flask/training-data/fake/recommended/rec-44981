A cute Mediterranean restaurant in the west village. Quiet area, but not far from Cowgirls and White Horse Tavern. Very open and several outdoor tables. Tips: Come early, they do not take reservations. Even if you have to wait it's worth it! What we ate - Entrees: Mushroom Ravioli / Delicious! Truffle Oil made this dish. It was not too heavy for a pasta dish Short Rib Bourguignon / very tender and extremely delicious!! What we ate - Apps: Merguez / small amount of meat, but still delicious Baked Meatballs Â / A MUST Hummus / Don't leave w/o trying this Bottom-line: Great for dates, friends, and other smaller intimate groups. I will be back and I am dying to try the brunch!
