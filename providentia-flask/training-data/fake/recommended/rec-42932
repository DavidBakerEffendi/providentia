Stop reading reviews and just go.  EVERYTHING is delicious with some dishes going above and beyond the call of duty!  Everything is fresh, they use local organic ingredients as much as possible and you can taste it.  BLT, raviolis, salads, meatballs, etc.  All just perfect.  A wonderful local italian restaurant that I visit on the regular with friends. Enjoy!
