I visit Spasso's again and again. I first ate at spasso's 4 years ago on a first date with my boyfriend (who comes from a long line of amazing Italian cooks).  We now go back everytime we want to celebrate or just have an amazing meal.  Prices are very resonable for the freshness and quality of the food...average about $15-$25 a dish. I recommend the outdoor seating when weather permitts as it gets quite noisy inside.  The service is always 5 star, and has been the same waitstaff for the all of the years I have been going there.  I enjoy this restaurant because I feel comfortable ordering anything off their menu and their specials are always outstanding.  I always start with the grilled calamari (best I have ever had).  My favorite dishes include the Zuppi de Pesce and the Veal carcophi (sp?).  Their red sauce is amazing.  As for dessert, my bf can not leave without having a cannoli and we always wrap up with 2 shots of Lemonchello (HIGHLY recomended).  Spasso's is hands down my favorite Italian restaurant and everyone I have sent there/taken there LOVES it and comes back again and again!!
