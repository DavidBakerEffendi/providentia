Decent Italian restaurant but not stellar. The Spaghetti a la Vongole had multiple pieces of sand and the noodle was unusual (not in a bad way), reminding me of egg noodle. The appetizers were quite good (squid with quinoa and fried squash blossom with ricotta cheese). Ambience is OK but beware of high level of air condition and mediocre music background.
