I was severely disappointed in this place. I went for lunch and I knew exactly what I wanted when I walked in. They were quick to take my order but that was the only thing they were quick about. Someone walked in 15 minutes after me and we got our starter salads at the same time. 10 minutes later I watched the same person get their entree which was pad see ew ,versus my pad thai , get served first. I had finished my meal and the dumpling appetizer still hadn't been served, which I guess was actually positive thing because the guy that kept getting served before me returned the dumplings since Â they weren't thoroughly cooked. Overall it was a terrible experience and I will not be returning.
