This place is great. My choice if i want Spanish food in the area... I usually get the half chicken since its so cheap for a good amount of food. But if i wanted to spend a little more i usually go for the lomo saltado or the chicken fried rice which both are awesome. The staff are nice and the decor is pretty good too. Highly recommended
