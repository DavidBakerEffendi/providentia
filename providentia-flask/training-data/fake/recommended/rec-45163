A locovore restaurant at the entrance to the Church Street Marketplace.  A good place for an upscale dinner or drinks.  A nice selection of wines and well cooked if not spectacular fresh food.  Everything was well prepared and the quality was better than some other venues on Church Street it just lacked the OMG or wow factor.
