I went there for a lunch one day. The waitress was very friendly. The food in more on the pricey end. I order the kale salad because that was recommended on Yelp by many people. I end up like it a lot at the beginning,( definitely should take it with two eggs) However, when I finished the dish, I feel like eating something else because kale have a very heavy taste.
