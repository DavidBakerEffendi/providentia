Nicolas used to be my favorite restaurant in the area. Unfortunately, since they moved from Hawthorne the food has gone down hill. We ordered chicken Marcela tonight and the sauce was like water. No flavor at all and the mushrooms appeared to be canned. My daughter would not even eat the water soaked chicken. Perhaps today was a really off day, but we will not be returning for overpriced boiled chicken.
