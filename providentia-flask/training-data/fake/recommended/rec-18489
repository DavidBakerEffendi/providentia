Can't believe I didn't discover Mediterranean cuisine until recently. Before I thought it was just mushed up goo and vegetables, and now....well even if it is, I have to say it still is extremely tasty, and doesn't make me feel gross like coming out of a steakhouse or Chinese restaurant would! Came with a buddy on a late weekday evening, and we only had to wait 15 minutes or so for a table outside to open up. Receptionist and waiter were both extremely kind, and the vibe was nice from the beginning. Started off with the Combination Platter with babaganoush, hummus, beets, tabouli, falafel, matbucha, carrots, roast peppers - this was extremely filling and honestly I think we could've just finished the meal right after this. Extremely tasty piles of goo =). Then we got the grilled octopus and the grilled spiced calamari (wow, I didn't realize how healthy we were feeling that day) - both were fantastic, although thinking about it if you asked me to distinguish the two I wouldn't really know...for both, the plates were perfectly seasoned, and the rubbery texture of the seafood meshed quite well with the vegetables and sauces. Portions were rather small for the price, but the Combination Platter more than made up for it! This place is pretty awesome and is truly a charming and swanky neighborhood gem =)
