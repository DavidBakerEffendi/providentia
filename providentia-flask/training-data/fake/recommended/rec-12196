Solid dinner tonight at Il Pittore.  I look forward to heading back their way in a few weeks.  There are kinks to work out for sure; mostly service oriented.  Th interior is charming and I will most definitely head to the bar (first floor) next time.  Living in the neighborhood, I could see this being a regular spot for a quick pasta fix.  The formality with the white table linens is charming, but a little cumbersome with anxious service staff monitoring every stain, covering them with white napkins. The staff and management are all amazingly friendly. I have to compare the food to other italian eateries of similar price point.  Really, not up to par with the heavy hitters that come to mind.   I'll be back and expect to add a star or two.
