The first time I was here, I was completely enchanted with the food, the service, and the environment. I came here again last week and my opinion of the place remains the same. I was greeted immediately by the hostess, who asked that I wait for the rest of my party to arrive. He joined me a few minutes later and we were noticed and seated immediately. We ordered the coconut tempura calamari (this was a favorite from the previous time, and it was a heaping portion, hot and crispy) as an appetizer, then he settled on the pork chop and I on the Room Service pad thai. The pad thai was a little saltier than I would have preferred, but it was just a slight change that I would have made. The Room Service pad thai is different from the regular one because it is enveloped in a thin layer of egg, which was beautifully presented and downright tasty. The pork chop was tender, perfectly seasoned, and had a divine sauce to it. Both of us enjoyed the food, and the service was attentive. All the servers are adorable and well dressed, and the environment is romantic, trendy, and hip. The music isn't too loud and you don't have to shout over each other. The prices are great as well, and you feel like you get a lot for your money/the quality. This time around I didn't have the cocktails, but there is one with delicious spices rimming the glass that I was blown away with last time. If you can figure out which one it is, try it - you won't be disappointed! :)
