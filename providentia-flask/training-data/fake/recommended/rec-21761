Love it! Adorable little place across from my friend's apartment building. TRY THE DEVILED EGGS THEY ARE PHENOMENAL. -and this is coming from someone who doesn't like deviled eggs, at all, ever. Great wine selection and friendly staff who are very helpful. I also had the quail egg toast, and pulled pork sliders both of which were lovely, not too dry or overly seasoned. Def recommended!
