Climb the stairs to the second floor and walk into a very small Indian restaurant. I decided on the Prix Fixe menu: Mulligatawny soup and chana saag with rice pudding for desert. All three dishes were delicious. The garlic naan was warm and garlicky. The waiters were very attentive, filling our glasses with water and removing empty plates as soon as they saw them - undoubtedly because the place is so small and was crowded. Despite that I never felt rushed by them. And you can't beat the price: 16.95 not including drinks, tip or tax. I would give this place five stars but I don't like to do that on a first visit. When I return (and I will) then they'll get the five.
