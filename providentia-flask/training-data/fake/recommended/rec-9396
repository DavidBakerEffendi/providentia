Prepared fresh right off the grill, the coconut curry lamb was stellar. the baguette was toasted perfectly and stuffed with plenty of lamb meat and veggies. Each bite was packed with flavor. Craving it again while writing this review. A must visit spot whenever I'm in St. Marks. PROS: absolutely delicious, affordable, quick service (even though its prepared fresh) chill staff, takes CC CONS: place is quite small but u can take it on the go, no problem
