I have to admit that I had been dying to go this place.  I like ramen and I especially like genuine ramen.  Ippudo has been getting all the latest raves and reviews, from foodies to chefs alike, and they have been consistently good. So, I came here and waited the signature 2 hours to get into a New York restaurant that is currently all the rage.  Be aware that they do not take resevations.  However, if you go in person and give them your name, they will give you a wait time and you can come back.  For restaurants with extremely long wait times like Ippudo, it is good to do this early and then go and take a stroll. Once I get in with my girlfriend, we are so starved that we actually proceed to order half the menu and sample a bottle of sake too.  Everything is consistently good, just as previous reviewers have said.  Good, but not fantastic.  I would skip the appetizers (they are standard asian fusion fare) and go straight for the ramen.  The service is attentive, but at times, rushed because literally, there are about 100 people waiting for your small seat.  The dining room is a mixture of Japanese steakhouse-like communal seating and private tables.  It is a good place to go with a fellow foodie or a friend, but not so much for a first date if you are looking to impress.   I did not come out of Ippudo feeling so completely wowed that I was dying to go back right away.  However, I also did not come out feeling jipped for the long wait.  The food is good, the wait is long, the service is thorough but rushed, the hostesses are a sea of calm in the chaos and it is a good place to hang out with friends before hitting a bar but not for a lingering date.  So there.
