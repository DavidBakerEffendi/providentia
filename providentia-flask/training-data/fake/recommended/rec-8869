Really? Not impressed.  We were staying at the Hyatt Place on 36th, and the reviews for Strand Bistro seemed good enough to take the short walk over for our first meal in NYC. Yes, the atmosphere is nice. The fish tank is cool. The cocktails were decent. But that's pretty much where it ended for me.  We started with the calamari, which was lightly breaded with no flavor. When we asked the waiter how it was prepared, he said he'd have to ask. Should have been a sign that we should order something else.  Since we went pretty late, we didn't do our usual and order a ridiculous amount of food. My companion ordered the pork chop for his entree and it was completely overcooked. I ordered the almond crusted salmon, which was borderline overcooked, and felt like I've had better salmon from my own kitchen. We expected more from a Food Network affiliated chef. There was really nothing noteworthy about this meal. In a restaurant market with plenty of options, I find little reason to return next time I visit NYC.
