This place is the biggest disappointment! I went there with a friend visiting from London almost 8 months ago, because it was highly recommended. We had to queue for half an hour, to get a tiny table and to eat a food which was not the greatest thing ever. Although these are not the reasons that I gave 1 star. It is the service, ONLY THE WAITRESS! I think FOOD ITSELF DESERVES 3 STARS. I got the country breakfast and my friend ordered the pancakes with warm maple butter. The ham served in country breakfast was too thick and not a very good quality one. The pancake was just a pancake. Nothing very special about it. Given the prices and the reputation, we were expecting a lot more. About the waitress... She was very aggressive and pushy. We felt very rushed. I ordered a side of bacon and she asked to my friend that whether he wants one, too. He said no, thank you.  We didn't get any bacon and honestly we forgot about it. When we asked for a check, we reminded the hostess that we had ordered a side bacon, but we didn't get it. We just didn't want them to issue a bill twice. Till that point everything was fine! However, the aggressive waitress came to the table and started to argue with us about it!!! She was very angry and she said  that I asked you and you said no!!! We even thought about going to manager not to tip her, but we didn't want to ruin our day more. We paid 70 dollars including the tip for a breakfast to get an attitude.
