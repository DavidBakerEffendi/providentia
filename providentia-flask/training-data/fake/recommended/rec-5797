I've been to Continental Midtown for happy hour four times now, and each time I love it more and more. For being a usually pricey place, they have a great HH menu, that change regularly so you're not stuck getting the same drink/snack when you visit.  They try to switch the menu up too, with a good choice of wine, beer, or mixed drink to suit your mood.  Plus, with both a downstairs bar, and upstairs indoor bar, and a roof-top bar, you'll never feel want for an available seat. However, regardless of whether it's on the HH menu or not, I ALWAYS make it a point to get the steamed edamame - to put it in terms that only Ferris Bueler fans will appreciate, "it is so choice.  I highly recommend picking one up." There are a few slight reasons why this isn't 5-stars: 1.  If you get a mixed drink or wine when it's not happy hour, be prepared to pay out the wazoo. 2.  The wait staff is a little if-y.  You could either get an emo art-house kid who's friendly and attentive, or you could get an emo art-house kid who's made it their mission to bring everyone else down to their misery level. So I say go for it if you're considering Continental!  Ignore the reviews by the people who think a place is only cool if it's "divey"; if it feels good, do it! Otherwise, Cameron Frye, this one's for you.
