Great drinks at reasonable prices; beautiful dark wood bar, warm atmosphere. Â The Ordinary is something New Haven has been missing. Glad it's here now. Minus one star though for the wooden sporks and, especially, the fast-food style paper baskets that the pies come in. Give us real forks and plates!
