Mmm... mojito's that don't entirely knock your head off after a glass... sweet and minty. The selection of tapas and entrees offered a great selection from the 'tacquitos' to the Churrasco to the grilled spicy tuna.    One thing to avoid those is the fried calamari appys.  Boring as hell thought the chimichurri sauce had a wicked kick to it.  Our group came erracticly so the wait staff was very accomodating in taking our orders and bringing out our food.  So I've got nothing bad to say about the service (unlike other Yelpers). Did I mention the mojitos?!??!!? Only thing that made my experience a non-5-star experience... was that it was hot as F in the back area behind the bar.  I felt like I was just sweating out all the alcohol from the mojito..... so it was either continue to load up on the mojito or head to another venue.... there are a billion other bars/restaurants in this area of the East Village... so did wind up going else where. It was a great quality meal and having the boss around allowed me to avoid flipping for the bill... would definitely go back on a muggy NY summer day to down mojito....
