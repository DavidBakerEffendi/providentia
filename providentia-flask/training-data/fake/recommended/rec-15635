intimate restaurant, with great food, ambiance and pricing.   appetizer of veal mb were the only standard. mozz and roasted red peppers appetizer was delicious. mozz was soft and light.  black snapper entree was visually appealing and delicious.  beet gnocchi w Gorgonzola was tasty; gnocchi was light and Gorgonzola sauce was not overpowering.  hazelnut dessert was a little overly sweet for my tastes.  Overall a delightful experience.
