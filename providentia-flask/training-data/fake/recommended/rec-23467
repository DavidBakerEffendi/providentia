Nothing like spending a nice day, sipping on cocktails in the backyard at the Narrows! It's my favorite low-key speakeasy bar on this side of North Brooklyn. I've definitely sampled all the drinks, but my favorite is the Navy Strength. Order it, and you'll see why it's called that. You won't need many to be drunk. Quality Drinks, Quality Service, and Quality Food! This place is the best!
