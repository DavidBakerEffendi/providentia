I f found a particular reviewers comments both interesting and particularly disturbing at the same time.  I found insightful the reviewers somewhat romantic view of "days gone by", and how the restaurant appealed to the common man.  I am sympathetic to the reviewers concern about how changes, while agreeable to others, tend to dishearten and alienate loyal disciples of this establishment.  However when I hear the phrase, "But then the white people came." I cannot help but feel miffed about what I believe is an obvious racist comment.  Sure, the people that now frequent this establishment have enough disposable income to afford the restaurant an extra dollar sign. Sure, the conversations I've had the pleasure of overhearing occasionally have a pseudo-intellectual flavor to them.  And yes, I find it baffling why some of the patrons need to have a southern California affectation in their voice, when you know they've never been anywhere near the west coast. However, despite the white people comment, the people who now actually patronize this place are actually an ethnically diverse bunch, or at least I assume so since you can't always tell someone's race just by looking at them (believe it or not). What it is clear though, the majority of the people that now patronize this establishment have certain tastes, and the ability to spend that's different from before, which then informs the establishment and drives the cost.  On that score, the reviewer may have a point. All I know is the food is good, the service is good, and the atmosphere is to my taste, although a bit pricey. Is it a place that's cheap enough for me to go again: I would say yes.  However, is it a place that I can afford to frequent regularly: Now that's a different story.
