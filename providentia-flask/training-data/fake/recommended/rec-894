My family and I had decided to take on the Pat's vs. Geno's challenge. In my opinion, I liked the flavor of the steak and cheese better at Geno's than Pat's. However, the large sign saying "this is America, order in English" was the most ignorant thing I've ever seen in a large city such as Philadelphia. We live in America, a diverse beautiful country and we should not tolerate such distasteful humor.
