I had high hopes for this place, and while I can't say that every high hope was fulfilled, I have no regrets over the expensive dinner. I was most excited about the grilled octopus as someone raved about it on here, but it was totally over salted. But the overall flavor of the dish was decent. The margherita pizza was really good, especially the slices with mozzarella cheese oozing on top of it. OMG it was delicious! We also ordered a pasta dish - although I cannot remember for the life of me what it was. The last dish we had the Ribeye and it was wonderfully cooked and our party of three were barely able to finish it, although that's not surprising since we ordered four dishes. I highly recommend Osteria to everyone for a special occasion. I loved the ambiance and did not feel too neglected even though I was in the deepest corner of the restaurant. Well, when I brought it to their attention that my water had not been refilled for almost 30 minutes, they became very attentive to my water level.
