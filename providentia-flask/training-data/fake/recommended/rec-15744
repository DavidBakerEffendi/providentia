The best food truck I've come across in the city so far.  It's nice to get something from a food truck that doesn't feel completely greasy and unhealthy (also that really does hit the spot sometimes).  It's near my office every wednesday, and I think I'm going to have to become a regular! The people working the food truck are really nice!!! I really appreciate them being nice even in the heat and madness of the lunch rush.  And they're cute.  They have lots of options, but my personal favorite is the tilapia over basmati rice.  You get to big pieces of tilapia, and they are extremely tender and flavorful.  It comes served over an entire circular tin full of rice with a spinach and chickpea salad.  It's a ton of food, most definitely 2 meals worth.  You get alllllll of this for only $10!! It's a great deal! And to make it even better, they will take your debit card if you don't have cash.   Track this truck down and try it out!
