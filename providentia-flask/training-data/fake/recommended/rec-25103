This is the best indian food in town. It is constantly good and I am always happy with the dinner here. I usually don't go for lunch buffet (I'm not a buffet fan in general) but I go there for dinner regularly. I have picked up and eaten in. I usually get the chicken vindaloo and garlic naan, I have never been disappointed. The naan is always hot and has a nice flavor. Vermont has limited choices for indian cuisine and India House is by far the best option in Burlington.
