Went with several friends and ordered tapas style. Always makes the meal a little more expensive. We got a carafe of white sangria (they have a lot of different varieties to choose from) that was very good. I think it was Tropical? It wasn't very strong. We got the calamari (delicious), rock shrimp (amazing), a savichi (not a huge fan in general so can't really say if it was good or not), tacos (not good), dulce (good but small), and datilies (good). Overall it was good. The service, however was NOT good. They ignored us and we had to request extra bread 4 times before we were actually given more bread. The service knocks it down from a 4 to a 3 for me. Bottom line, expensive ($50 per person) for small portions of hit or miss food. I'd go back for the calamari and rock shrimp but I'd skip the rest.
