Pat's is better than Geno's, but that's not saying much. Their steaks are more flavorful and the temperature is just right, but their bread is a little on the hard side. The lines here are just as long as Geno's, but they have a way more courteous staff. Case and point, one of my steaks was a little too dry to my liking and they replaced it no questions asked. You won't get that kind of service at Geno's. Overall, the cheesesteaks are decent, but not worth the price or the trouble of waiting on a long line. This is more a less a tourist attraction, after all Pat's is credited for creating the original Philly cheesesteak. Covered seating is available outdoors and they only accept cash.
