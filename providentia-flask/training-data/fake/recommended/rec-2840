I'm literally wiring this while I'm still seated here. Te corned beef hash I'm eating is the best I've ever had. The pancakes are great and my server is personable and friendly AND efficient. As my 4 year old just put it: I'm gonna ONLY come here. Wish I knew my servers name. Young guy with a beard. Love him.
