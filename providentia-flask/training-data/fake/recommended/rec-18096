Food: Though I typically don't believe in an acid test of restaurant quality, the coffee tends to shape my breakfast experience.  At Gold Standard, my cup of black coffee was good.  I also enjoyed my omelet, which was like a fried egg stuffed with sauteed mushrooms, cheddar cheese, and nicely caramelized onions. Service:  I have mixed feelings about the service.  On one hand, the coffee was refilled promptly and the server, though a little panicked, maintained a very friendly attitude.  The bad: two items-OJ and a side of turkey bacon-never arrived and our check deviated slightly from what we ordered and received.
