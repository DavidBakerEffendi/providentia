The food is really well-seasoned and the service is attentive and friendly in this cozy restaurant.  I've tried most of the offerings on the menu and have not been disappointed.  This place is all about taste, taste, taste!  All sorts of wonderful flavor combinations going on. It's nice to have a place like this so close to home but I can see people traveling from Manhattan and Brooklyn to eat here. Enjoy!
