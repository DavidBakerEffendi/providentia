I was visiting a friend and she suggested we go for dinner to this place. What a great choice! We both ordered the sea bass which was just divine! Buttery, melt in your mouth delicious! Our friend ordered the meatballs which were GIGANTIC! Everyone was pleased with their meal and our wine was good too. The ambiance is a bit romantic, the service was great, and the place is dark but in a good way.
