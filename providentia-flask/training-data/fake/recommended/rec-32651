Suggested by my friend who is a frequent diner here. The food: Fried Calamari with mayonnaise, our appetizer, was crispy and delicious.  Agnelloti with fresh tomato and marjoram, in nice small bite sizes,  was exquisite. The wheat pasta with mushroom ragu and grana padano that my friend had, looked tempting. The portions, although not large, was adequate and satisfying. Overall enjoyed the ambiance and food here. Would definitely be back to sample the rest of the menu. Tip: on a weeknight, you can park your car right in front of the restaurant for free.
