Crazy variety of foods I probably would never have the opportunity to eat if not for Traif.  I definitely would only come here with four or more people.  The food is rich and the drinks are strong.   I ordered the sweet breads not realizing what they were. Don't look it up if you're not an adventurous eater.  Actually, this place is ideal for those who have an exploratory palate.
