Just ordered the Lemon Chicken ($8) from here - quick, clean and friendly and with the refreshing iced green tea, my total was $10.  Not bad for lunch! Tender and juicy strips of chicken with delicately seasoned brown rice.  Went at noon on a weekday and there was no line.  Very tasty and their menu is pretty straightforward, so not lots of time wasted deciding what to get / customizing.  Do wish they posted their drink options on the wall / in the print out menu.
