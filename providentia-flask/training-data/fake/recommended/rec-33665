Go if you're looking for simple, satisfying food with a touch of metropolitan flare. It's cozy, friendly, and quite intimate. The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating, particularly Nick behind the bar. On a cold winter's night, there is no better place to be. Was there tonight and might be going back tomorrow!
