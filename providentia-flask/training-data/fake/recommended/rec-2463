So my friend comes home to visit from the army and we make our way to Philly  to drop off his friend and end up at Geno's... I'd hear a lot about the place and was anxious to try one of their sandwhiches... The sandwhiches are pretty good and so are the fries but not good enough to make me want to go back. I honestly didn't see what the big fuss was about.  Maybe it's just that people enjoy looking at all the pretty pictures while they eat, maybe they like all the bright pretty colors, or maybe it's just the satisfaction of eating under the somewhat controversial name Geno's...  Whatever it is, it definately more of a tourist spot than anything, and I'd recommend it to those just looking for a different experience.
