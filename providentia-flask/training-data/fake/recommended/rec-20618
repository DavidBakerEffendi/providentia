Nevada Diner is my favorite diner ever!! I never had a bad meal here - whether it was breakfast food, the grilled chicken sandwich for lunch or late night, or the baked stuff shrimp for dinner. Its amazing to me that a resturant can churn out everything on a 20 page menu consistently well. Service was always great. Will stop by again next time I'm on Broad Street in Bloomfield.
