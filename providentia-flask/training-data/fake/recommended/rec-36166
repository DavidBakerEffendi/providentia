People talk about Carmine's from miles and miles away. Everytime I tell people I am going to the city, they tell me to try Carmine's. I have been told about Carmine's by at least a dozen people over the course of several years. Here's the only problem. I've already been to Carmine's, and I don't particularly enjoy it here.....at all. So the concept is great right, family style dining - whats not to like about it. It gives you a cozy, family feel to your dining experience, and gives you the chance to share dishes - without feeling like you are stealing the other person's entire dinner, because there is plenty to share! Maybe the problem is I come from an Italian family, and we can make this stuff ourself - but the food doesn't taste authentic - it tastes processed. The sauce even tasted burnt....and burnt sauce......not an appealing flavor. There just was no spark, no magic - nothing was great....and some things were just plain not good. Not enough flavor, seasoning, or innovation to make it worth going back. However, plus side - dessert. Carmine's - your Tiramisu has a lot of good stuff going on. For me though, it's not enough good stuff to get me to walk back through the door.
