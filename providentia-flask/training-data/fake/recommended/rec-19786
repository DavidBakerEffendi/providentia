#1 restaurant in NYC? No, definitely not. The food didn't blow me out of the water, but it was very solid and the service was great. We arrived at 6:30 on a Tuesday night and had a 45 minute wait. The grilled calamari and kale salad was tasty, but could have been a bit warmer, and completely raw kale isn't my favorite - it could have used a good massage (am I right, kale lovers!?) I didn't really like the pasta with clams at all - kind of gelatinous and garlic that was perhaps a little burnt. The uni appetizer was also good, but it was also difficult to eat considering the egg yolk it came with. Â Beer steamed mussels/clams were great. The complementary whiskey cake at the end of our meal was one of my favorite parts. So while it sadly didn't live up to the hype for me personally, I would definitely come back when the menu changes, or for their happy hour which looks awesome.
