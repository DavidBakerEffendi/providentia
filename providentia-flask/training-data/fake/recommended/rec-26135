As previously mentioned, this place has amazing food. Also previously mentioned, the outdated decor. Â While the former remains the same, the latter is getting a full expansion and remodel! Today, I had to take a star back though. After frequenting this establishment for many years, I finally have had enough of the fluctuating prices. Whether it's lack of training, incompetence or simply not giving a damn, it's kinda annoying. Today, the pizza I have been getting for years was nearly $4 more than the average price I pay. Usually it varies within a dollar or two and I laugh it off. Today, I'm not laughing. Especially since I received a fairly snotty and dismissive response when asking for an explanation - which I really didn't get. I then checked my credit card receipt for the other dish I order here regularly. It also hasn't been the same the last 5 times I ordered ranging from 5 cents to $1.45 difference from what it should. Love the food, eagerly anticipate the remodel and strongly urge a reality check when it comes to attitude and pricing. After all, there are an awful lot if places to get pizza in Bayonne!
