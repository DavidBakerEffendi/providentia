We wandered around Hells Kitchen looking for a bite.  We stumbled upon this little restaurant and went in since Alison's "mojo" said lets go. The appetizers were phenomenal especially the stuffed zuchini flowers. NEver mind the bread and olives.  Can't even remember what the entre was, we loved it.  We can't wait to go back.
