Wow. Balthazar deserves it's plaudits. If you're going to have one special brunch in NYC, make it at Balthazar. The atmosphere is so unique and emboddies everything about the brunch culture in NYC. We went at 9am on a Friday and it was packed, buzzing and full of life. Book in advance! The atmosphere and decor is what really sets this place apart. Although the restaurant is fairly large, tables are close together and the intimacy of this works really well. You never know who might walk in next and expect to see celebrities (apparently it's popular with Robert De Niro). We ordered the omellete (which looked great) and the Eggs Norwegian which was the best I've tasted. Two perfectly cooked poached eggs on a brioch with a nice touch of rosti style potatoes on the side. The service is exceptional, the decor is great and the food is even better. Don't leave NYC without visiting Balthazar!!
