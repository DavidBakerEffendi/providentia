Love, love, love the Creperie at Temple. Yes, the lines are forever long, but it's worth the wait. The guys there are always super polite, and they work really quickly and efficiently to get your food out ASAP. I had the gyro crepe today, and that's definitely my new fave. Plus it's super cheap...you can get a hefty crepe plus a drink for $5.25. Sooo good!
