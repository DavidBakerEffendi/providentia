Oh.  Yes. I had a terrible case of the munchies last night and decided to order delivery from here based on a friend's recommendation.  Boy, am I glad I did!  This is some of the tastiest food I have ever had!  We ordered an assortment of empanadas and the yucca frita.  It was delivered in about 20 minutes piping hot and fresh! My favorites were the Viagra and the chorizo empanadas.  The Yucca was delicious as well and comes with a guacomole sauce.  Very, very good stuff. I cannot wait to venture in to the place itself and try some of the entrees which also sounded fantastic. I foresee many orders being placed here...
