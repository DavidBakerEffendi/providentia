Rly disappointing... Pork rillette was my fav thing. Prawns weren't bad but i wouldnt get them again. Fries were good... Pretzels were ok... Watercress & asparagus salad was a total waste of money. The chocolate-covered bacon sundae that sounds phenomenal was the most disappointing dessert i've ever had... The soft serve tasted like nothing, pretzels tasted like croutons, choc. covered bacon was chewy instead of crispy... But the pistachio meringata was good. :/ Our desserts took just under 20 minutes & we received a half-ass apology from our server... Who was honestly the worst one I've ever had... I mean unforgivably bad. I've never seen anyone show how much they don't care. On the way out I noticed there were about 12 tables so they werent slammed or anything. I wouldnt go back. I wish there was a "nothing" check-box where it says "Good For:" in the additional tips on this business.
