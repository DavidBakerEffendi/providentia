Ah, criminy!  Another GD fake pre-Prohibition, wood panelled, Edison bulbed, American restaurant!  In theory this sort of place is right up my alley and combining all-things-old and plain simple food should be a hit, but Rye seems to have been conceived a little more cynically.   With Rye the execution of the vintage, "pre-Prohibition" theme shows definite signs of fatigue.  Seemingly selcted wholesale from a Restoration Hardware catalog, the decor is also too sparse for the size of the space and, moreover, too boring.  (Why are the walls bare?!)  More boring than the interior is the menu, which is pretty well-worn in its offerings and conspicuously lacking the kind of local offerings I would expect of this type of joint (Long Island duck and Berkshier pork don't cut it anymore). Shared a bunch of things on the dinner menu and was not impressed.  The meatloaf was so salty as to render it nearly inedible.  And I like salt!  The waitress was also less than helpful and didn't  have answers to basic questions about menu items.  To be fair this is one waitress and I'm not judging the whole staff on her poor performance.   If you're looking for this sort of restaurant you have plenty of better options(especially in Brooklyn) such as Roebling Tea Room, Moto or Vinegar Hill House.  In Manhattan Northern Spy has a similar ethos.  All of which are excellent and beat the pants off of Rye.
