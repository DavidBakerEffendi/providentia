I should have known when I sat down at the sushi bar that the scallops were dry as hell. Plus what Japanese place thinks that Oyako Don is "Steamed Salmon and Salmon roe over rice"... probably a non japanese owner! I thought it was a typo to see if it was really chicken/egg but asked to confirm and they said no, the description is right. That was probably a sign to leave but we were hungry and wanted to just eat and leave. Also the sushi rolls aren't made at the sushi bar but back in the kitchen. Seems sketchy to me. Thumbs down and won't be coming back. It's sad that people think of it as the best sushi in Princeton. Maybe it is. But I guess students don't know any better by giving such high ratings. Would give negative stars if possible.
