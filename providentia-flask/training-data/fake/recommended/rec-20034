When did they stop caring? A year ago I would have ranked this among my favorite's - a great food menu coupled with a good liquor selection and some nice cocktails and draft beer. But it would appear they've decided to rest on their laurels and quite frankly, just stop caring about their customers. Tonight's meal was decent, don't get me wrong, but the laissez-faire attitude permeated the restaurant in every way, from the completely pedestrian "barrel aged Manhattan" to the switch to only bottled beer (because the tops were too hard to maintain, apparently), to the menu with just four entrees - and that's including a pork sandwich. No specials, nothing exceptional, just a choice of one beef (a steak that's been on the menu forever), one chicken (roast, half, pretty much what you'd expect) and one fish (a shrimp and grits that ate more like a gumbo). Bacon as an appetizer? Sure, they still have that. But so what? I miss the chicken fried smoked pork cutlet. And the sense that it was a restaurant that really wanted customer's business. I should have known when the sandwich board outside simply said "bourbon" - yes, they've still got an exceptional selection, but beyond that there's little to offer here. Better to get a great meal at any number of places along Smith St and save the overpriced bourbon drinking for a more interesting spot.
