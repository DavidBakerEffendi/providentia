Returned last night for the first time in years. It's still probably the best bistro food in the city after midnight, but you will pay for it. Appetizer sized steak tartare is $16. It's tasty but given that they didn't even have to cook it, not exactly great value. Â Some of the mains are reasonable value - fried chicken with sides for $25 - but everything is a couple of bucks more than it ought to be. The crowd isn't the cool one it used to be ten years ago, and probably that's because artists don't usually drop $100 on a light meal for two..
