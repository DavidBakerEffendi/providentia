I was a bit skeptical when I told my friend I wanted to get some tea, and he made me go to this place. I was like "what's the point of paying so much for tea, I could just go to Starbucks"...but it's worth it! :) They have a variety of teas to choose from. I honestly can't even recall the tea that I ordered (so many different names, and I am definitely not a tea-connoisseur) However, they bring your cup of tea (of course) and then a pot of the tea.. So I guess it's worth the 5 or more bucks that you spend on it! The place itself is really cute! I loved the bathrooms...so high tech! I guess it's the Japanese techy-part of it! :) There are private rooms that you can get for like 20-40 a person, depending if you want food or just dessert, which I think would be so awesome to utilize if you want a really romantic date! I like this place, and will be back!
