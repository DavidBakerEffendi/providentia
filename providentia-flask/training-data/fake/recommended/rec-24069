I stopped by El vez during restaurant week and couldn't argue about the price for the deal they gave us. Their tuna is by far one of my favorites and would love to try again if I get a chance. Although most servers were busy they were a to stop by here and there to help out. The bill came out to $407.00 because of the big group but was kinda upset that the last entr√©e I wasn't able to finish nor take home. I asked the waiter but they just took it away. Overall great restaurant, waiters just need to listen more
