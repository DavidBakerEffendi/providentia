I went with a group of five. We had a wonderful dinner! The service was excellent, the entrees offered a great variety and everyone at our table said their meal was delicious. There is a small outdoor area in front of the restaurant but we ate in the back room which has a nice old world decor. Â I would highly recommend Uva and I look forward to going back again.
