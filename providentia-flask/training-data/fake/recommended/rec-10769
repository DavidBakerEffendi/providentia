Horrific.  It blows my mind that people come here more than once.  Very expensive for such poor quality food and service.   I had the pleasure of coming three times, and I have sworn it off forever.  Portions are super small and overpriced.  The steamers are ridiculously sandy and overpowered by whatever lager they cook it with.  The servers never bring water despite being asked many times, and my wine glass was taken away not once but twice with a quarter of my drink left inside.  Last time I was there one of the owners (a middle aged woman) asked me how everything was going just as I bit into a huge pile of sand.  I said "great" with a smile, but she must have noticed otherwise.  Then again, you have to be pretty oblivious to keep this place going as is.  The view is nice, but it's not worth it.  Not even close.   After spending $100 on sandy clams, 4 day old wine, and some super fishy smelling shrimp I went to Rocky Sullivans and had some surprisingly excellent pizza for under $10.
