This place is awesome. Unique but accessible cuisine, beautifully prepared, and very affordable. The sauce that comes with the shrimp is amazing. The fish was entre was cooked so tenderly it tasted like butter. The curry looked great but I haven't tried that yet. Brunch there looks good too, ice cream is killer, and the staff is super friendly.
