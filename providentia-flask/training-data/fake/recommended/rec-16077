It was a warm summer night, and my girls from college wanted to meet up. Criteria: strong drinks, light thai, and "somewhere chic." A friend suggested Room Service, and when I arrived, I was overjoyed! And we ate happily ever after. The scenery is so beautiful! Between the chandelier and the jazzed-up waitresses, I was inspired me to try and eat at places this nice all the time, but I have yet to find decor I like as much. I drank a basil ginger cocktail that felt like I was eating a thai salad...until I stood up ;) Â  The food was pretty normal, but by that point I was drunk enough that it was tasty enough. Plus, if I hadn't liked anything, I could just smile at the sparkling chandelier and enjoy the company of my girls. One negative: the Aphrodite cocktail isn't as good as it looks on the menu, which was disappointing.
