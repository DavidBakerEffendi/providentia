One word, sounds like...BLAH. Went here a few weeks ago thinking it would be a good spot but the three things we ordered were just meh (or blah) if you like. The pizza was ordinary, the salad was gross, and the pasta was overly salty and limp. I think the salad was perhaps the most egregious - they had given us a plate for of dandelion leaves (which are very bitter) but did not mix them with other greens. There were two or three pieces of thinly sliced radish and a sprinkle of another vegetable that escapes me. Finally, the pea dressing. It made the dish look toxic - I'm talking teenage mutant ninja turtles toxic. But, we said, this is a Marc Vetri restaurant -I'm sure they know what they're doing. Spoiler alert - they didn't. It was like eating a handful of crab grass on your local playground. Also - the waitress creepily hovered over us throughout the meal. It was not service, it was very uncomfortable. She didn't have the rhythm that more savvy servers do, instead she kept popping in and lingering. Also - ambiance was weird. It's built to be warm and lively but the music was off, it was really empty for a Friday night at 8, generally there was no life in the place. Others might not agree but after having been to so many similar restaurants that execute this much better, Barbuzzo, to name a local one, it's hard to stomach the food and the cost. Seriously - it's really expensive and then it's like being at a bad chain restaurant. (Also if you're in Brooklyn, walk, no run, to Franny's - this place does it right. The pizza is knee buckling good).
