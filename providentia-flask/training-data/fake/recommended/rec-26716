Went this afternoon for a late lunch despite the pouring rain; so glad that we did. I received an Open Table gift cert for the holidays and redeemed it here since its close and its a new restaurant; the braised meatballs app was delicious; the pizza and rigatoni were also really good. Had a few Dogfish's as well, which are always great. The service was very good; nicely paced since we weren't in a rush, and our server, Greg, was attentive and very nice, even though it seemed he was busy at times. We look forward to returning and trying some new things, but we definitely NEED those meatballs again! :)
