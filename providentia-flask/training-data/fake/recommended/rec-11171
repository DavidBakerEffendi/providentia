Man, I'm so disappointed. I came here for the 3rd time and finally had the mid range tasting menu. It was not worth what we paid and didn't even come with dessert! The main problems: no beef (no beef??) dishes, too much truffle oil served with too many of the dishes, dishes arrived sparingly for the first 3-4 courses, then suddenly all at once, as if they'd forgotten about us. I think you're better off ordering what you want from the menu. Service as always was great.
