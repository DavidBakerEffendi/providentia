Had a reservation for 6 at 3pm and we were running a little late but I called and they said as long as we could make it before 3:30 they could accommodate us (since they have an intermission from 3:30-5) so we were seated and I checked in with yelp so I could get a free order of cornbread. Waiter comes over unsure as to whether we could use this for brunch but then says that we can. Now that im home I just remembered that we never got it. As for food we all got the chicken and waffle. I've had better. The chicken was ok but something was weird with the consistency of the waffle. Also the soco carmel martini was super strong and sweet I wasnt a fan. Also we were sitting in the front and it was very annoying to see people come in and get turned away because the kitchen was closed during intermission and wouldnt open for another hr or so, even a poor pregnant lady got turned away. I just felt like they should have just locked the door but they really did just lose out on a bunch of business. Glad I went because ive heard great things about this place but I wont be back for chicken and waffles. Ill go all the way to amy ruth's in Harlem before I come here. If I happen to be in the area I may go back to try something else on the menu but highly unlikely
