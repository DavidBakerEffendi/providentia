Great place if you like fish/seafood.  Menu is always changing as it all depends on what they have - there is a giant chalkboard with all your choices (and prepared to your liking).  Don't worry if you're not familiar with many types of fish - the wait staff here is quite knowledgeable. Be prepared to wait - this place doesn't accept reservations, although you can call ahead and get your name added to the list.  Since they close earlier than most restaurants, aim to get here earlier so you can enjoy your meal and not feel rushed.
