i really can't say enough good things about ny dosas. even during a recession (such as now) i will scrimp and save to have my dosa fix every week. in fact, this is the only thing i will eat out. thiru is very friendly and remembers every regular's regular order. i usually get the masala dosa (extra spicy) and it is amazing. a crispy lentil crepe wrapped around spicy potatoes served with coconut chutney and a small cup of sambar. i've also had the pondicherry (great too) and the roti curry (which is delicious as well). the samosas are fantastic and the soup is amazing. actually, i haven't tried anything i didn't really love. and its all vegan. if only he served chai, i would be in heaven. thanks thiru for all of the amazing dosas...keep flipping em man :).
