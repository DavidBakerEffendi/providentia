FOOD: Everything is good. The pasta is tasty and the veal is great if you can handle breaded stuff. Get a side of steamed spinach to go with your meal. The wine selection is good as it should be for a homie Italian resto. I've been there couple times and loved it with every single bite. ATMOSPHERE: No reservations. That's about the only setback. The open kitchen is a great touch. You can see how swift the chefs are. I was impressed by their skills. It felt like a Italian place but more homie. Parking could be a hassle on weekends in LES. Â Good for dates, first or second. Groups of 6 or more are difficult to accommodate, especially for the fact they don't accept reservations. Expect to wait. They have a separate waiting bar next door. OVERALL: One of my favorite Italian places for food and atmosphere. I definitely recommend it. If I lived in nearby neighborhoods I would eat there at least once a week.
