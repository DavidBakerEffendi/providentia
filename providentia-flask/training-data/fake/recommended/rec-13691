Did I finally get the right idea of an Izakaya? I think so... Reminded me of a pub in my hometown, minus the japanese, of course. It was snowing outside and we warmed up with beer and a few munchies. The dried sardines salad was very good and the enoki/shimeji tempura had a nice touch of wasabi salt. Have to go back...
