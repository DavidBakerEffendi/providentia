What happened to the huge Chipotle-style Asian burrito they had on the menu when I was here two years ago? I turned around and this place got all fancy. This time, we ate: * steamed buns - pork belly, hoisin, cucumber, scallions: super fatty pork, nice balance of flavors. price tag of $4-5 a piece gives me pause, given that you can get their ghetto cousins in Chinatown or Flushing for about 75 cents. * spicy pork sausage with rice cakes - chinese broccoli, crispy shallots: really spicy! big portions and tasty enough - but not better than at a good chinese restaurant charging around $10-12. We paid around $18 here. * bev eggleston's pork shoulder steak - spaghetti squash, celery root, ramp ranch - fresh local ingredients. again, fatty pork, big portions. Bottom line: unless you're diehard committed to eating organic/local or you and 8 friends are dying to plunk down $200 for a whole slow-roasted pork butt (and you don't feel like making your own: nymag.com/listings/recipâ€¦), you can probably find another place for dinner that is equally tasty for less wait time and money.
