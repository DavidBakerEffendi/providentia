Delicious. As I am rather skint these days, I was lucky enough to be brought here for a business dinner. And as one is app to do when the dime is on someone else, I of course perused the more expensive items on the menu. But I kept coming back to the same all American fare, the free range burger with beets topped with a grilled pineapple ring. After much soul searching, I went for it. The waiter suggested I add the truffle oil fries, which made me feel some retribution for ordering the burger off such a beautiful and seasonal menu. So glad I went with my gut. The best burger I've ever had, hands down. And the fries were amazing. It's the perfect date spot or warm winter location for scheming with friends. It's the kind of place where you want to get to know the staff and laugh with the owners long past the time the doors have closed, sitting at the bar, sipping drinks and slurping mussels.
