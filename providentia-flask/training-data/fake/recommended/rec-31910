Cannot beat their $7 specialty sandwiches. I am lucky enough to live on the same block as this minute bodega/deli. When you go in most of the clientele have, well, bloodshot eyes. You can hear similar people giving their orders for delivery on the phone: "OK, one pack of funions, one thing of Ben and Jerry's Boston Cream Pie ice cream, two bottles of water, sour patch kids..." Anyways, the sandwiches are packed with delicious meats and fresh, creative ingredients. Household favorites include the 1001, Pho Real, and East Side Ink (named after the tattoo parlor across the street). Open all night. Bottomline: Â Sunny and Annie's have the best sandwiches in town y'all--they are just the bee's knees, ya know?
