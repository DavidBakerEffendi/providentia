After moving to the city from Virginia, I was looking for a place to satisfy my Vietnamese cravings. I mean, I had low expectations since I don't know if the Vietnamese community in New York is as big as the one in VA. Even though I've only had the pho here, it's pretty good. It seems the broth is a little inconsistent. The first time I was here, the broth was pretty good, but the second time it was kind of bland. If you're from NoVA, it does not compare to Pho 75, Pho Golden Cow, or Pho Sate, but it's does the job, especially when it's freezing out. Service is really attentive and friendly :) Also, I believe it is Vietnamese owned and ran since they do speak Vietnamese.
