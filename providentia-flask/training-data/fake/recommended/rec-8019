Came here last Sunday for the clams and a fantastic hefeweizen on tap. The food was amazing, and the atmosphere was romantic and charming. I also liked that not too many people were there, as I could actually have a conversation with my partner. I would give it 5 stars if the portions were larger. My $13 plate was really small.. probably around a dozen small clams at the most.
