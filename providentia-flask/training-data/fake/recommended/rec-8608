I have eaten at this restaurant many times. I am basically living at this hotel due do work and its location makes it a no brainer. Service and food here is hit or miss. Some nights you get good food quick and some nights you get ok food slowly. For the most part the food is pretty good. The bar has the typical hotel bar selection and the prices are decent. I have not had a mixed drink here so I'm unsure of the prices they charge for them but, I have heard they are nice and strong.
