This restaurant is wonderful.  The menu changes daily to reflect the freshest ingredients.  That's one of the things I love about this place is they use healthy fresh pure local ingredients so not only is it delicious and beautifully prepared, it's also good stuff to put in your body.  The ambience is great and the servers and bar tenders are friendly and knowledgable.  The fish and meats are always cooked perfectly and the desserts are magnificent creations.  The Maine lobster salad and rhode island mussel appetizers are both scrumptious and the duck and lamb is he's are always delicious.  The cocktails are all great as well as their selection of non alcoholic drinks like the cucumber soda they sell which I can't seem to fin anyplace else.  And the sommelier is generous with his time and his taste pours, spending time with us amd oaying attention to us until we found something we both liked, which incidentally included choosing a wine that the sommelier makes himself.  A great establishment with great food and drinks. I'll be back there very soon.
