Okay, So I have been to this place twice and very disappointed both times. Especially since I've heard great things. First, if you are expecting the servers to be friendly then this is not the place for you. When you walk in there is no host/hostess, there is a sign in sheet.. The first time I came here we did not know this. We walked in and were ignored for about ten minutes until another couple who was eating there told us of this. four servers walked by us and completely ignored us. they could of said hi please sign in or just a welcome sign in sheet is behind you.. but no. The seating outside was empty both times I've went. We waited for 30 mins until someone called our name. We asked to sit outside but they said it was only for parties bigger then four. If they sat smaller parties outside the wait would of been shorter for many people waiting. Once we finally sat the server was not friendly. We thought maybe it is just a busy day so we decided to try this place a again. But same thing happened.. rude service. The food was just average. I honestly wish hawthornes did not burn down so i could of saved myself from coming to this place.
