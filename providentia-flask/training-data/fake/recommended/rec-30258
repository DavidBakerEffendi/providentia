Was good to experience it but wouldn't go again. I feel like I make better pasta. The lamb chops and cod were definitely good. The table though was way to small and the different servers had to keep moving things around the whole night. The service was not that great. I didn't see our main waitress smile even once. She forgot about my drink on two occasions and then forgot to bring the wine out for my friends when the pasta arrived, as they had requested. We had a few desserts. The maple ice cream was probably the best out of all of them.
