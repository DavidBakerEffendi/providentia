Stumbled upon this place ...it is not on the town map. It was very nice inside...small, menu is very small for food...I had the hamburger, the meat was a little dry and overcooked for medium but it was pretty darn good anyway! A whole notebook for whiskey...the old fashioned was also good and good service!
