This is my favorite place to go pre-or post theater, or anytime...the food is fantastic, the staff and atmosphere are warm and friendly, and the whole vibe feels very unlike midtown--it's more of a "downtown" feel in the best way--casual, fun, hip and delicious interesting food. You will not be disappointed, there is magic here :)
