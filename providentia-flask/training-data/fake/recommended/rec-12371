I think I saw someone say it here before but the pancake hype is REAL!  Sure the line is crazy long but do your research and sign up early!  We got there a little before 9am on a Sunday and there was already a line, not to be seated mind you but a line to get on the waiting list since the place hasn't opened it.  Like everyone says, they have this app where they put your name and number down that sends you a text when your table is ready.  We were a party of 2 and had a wait time of 45-60 min.  We got the text literally at the 44th min mark.   I ordered their special Huckleberry pancakes.  Oh em gee.  Best pancakes EVAR and yes the maple syrup is out of this world.  And this is coming from someone that HATES maple syrup.   My buddy had biscuits and sausage which were both great.  They have this homemade raspberry jam which was also delicious Is the wait worth it?  Well I didn't wait that long but I did do my research and took people's advice to get there early.  Would I wait over 2 hour..ehh depends how hungry I am at that point, but yes I would say it is definitely worth it!
