City Tap House always leaves me feeling so.... disappointed. On the plus side, they do indeed have a crazy draft beer list and a spectacular patio (why don't more places have sweet outdoor space?) and I love making my own beer flights. The food is pretty good too. However, the service at the bar is uniformly mediocre and the prices are way too high. They don't even have good happy hour specials! There are plenty of other places with just as good beer lists (albeit in bottles) with better service. City Tap House just isn't worth the money.
