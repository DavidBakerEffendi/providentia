After reading great reviews on yelp and on TONY, I had to come to this place.  Great cocktails.  I had a couple of the cucumber based drinks and they were light and refreshing.  My friends had the old fashioned and it tasted pretty strong.  The menu has some appetizers, sandwiches and entrees.  I ordered the crab croquette which was one single large croquette but tasted very fresh.  The beef short rib sandwich was small but very tasty.  It was used by my friend as an appetizer.  I ordered the meatloaf sandwich which was large and was a little too sweet for my tastes.  Dessert was a maple creme brulee which rounded out the night.  Atmopshere was dark, quiet but had a pub type feel to it.  I would come here again.
