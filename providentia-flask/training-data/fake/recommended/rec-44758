My husband and I went to The Little Owl for my Birthday dinner and it did not disappoint! The service was top notch; the hostess especially was very accommodating and enthusiastic and set the tone for the rest of the evening. We did have to wait an hour so I recommend making a reservation. If not, there are several other spots nearby to grab a drink while waiting. It is a very cozy spot (which I always like) so you are rather close to neighbors but it was actually loud enough that we didn't feel like we were eavesdropping. My dish was good but not great. I had the lamb which was overly salty and the gnocchi which was a bit too soft; this happens a lot when I order this at restaurants so I was hoping it would be better here. But my husband had the cod and loved it. Oh well! We really enjoyed the little notebook the check came in, it was filled with little handwritten notes and thank you's from previous patrons. A very cute touch! Atmosphere: 5 Service: 5 Food: 3
