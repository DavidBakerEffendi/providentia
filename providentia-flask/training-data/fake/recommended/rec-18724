This place is horrible. The waiters and waitresses are not friendly and seem to hate each other and the guy that works the cash register looks like he thinks his life is miserable. The place is dirty dirty and more dirty. Do they clean anything here? When you walk in looks like a place that hasn't had its carpets deep cleaned in years. Onto the food...which is also horrible. Frozen. Frozen. Frozen. The sad part is they don't even try to hide it. Their French fries look and taste like something I could buy in the frozen foods section at the grocery store. The only reason I gave it two stars and not one is because it used to be good years ago. What the hell happened?
