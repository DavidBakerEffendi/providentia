I live for creativity and flavor. Hence, Graffiti is now one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. Almost every dish (I ordered six plus dessert) was surprising and delicious. In order, these were my favorites: (1) skate (2) scallop (3) pizza and then (4) mango chili paneer. I Â would have never thought of mixing those flavors (particularly the hummus pizza) but it all was delightful. At times I can imagine things like the paneer to be cooked a bit better (the flavor could have set in a bit more). Overall, it has been days and I am still dreaming about some of the dishes I ate that night. I had reservations, so I got to enjoy the cozy atmosphere by the window. I loved the artsy ethnic decor. But on a Friday or Saturday night, I could imagine seating to be a problem.
