What a great place to hang out. They've got a good selection of local breweries and the food is great too. Really liked the pretzels with cheese and the spaetzle was very good, although really salty (made me drink more, haha) The outdoor area is large with plenty of picnic tables to sit down at, a fire pit, and a ping pong table. Still a great place to be outside on a cold night, as there are outdoor heaters setup throughout. I can't really think of a better place for a large group of people to go. Definitely worth the trip
