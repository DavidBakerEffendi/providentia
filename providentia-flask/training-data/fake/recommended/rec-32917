Seltzer or water on tap! I stopped in here for a croissant (goat cheese, it was delicious, very soft and doughy) and I was so pleasantly surprised at the free access to seltzer. Wish more coffee shops offered that! I found the ambiance strange, oddly large and empty space for so few, small tables. I appreciate the aesthetic but it felt awkwardly bare. Still, wouldn't stop me from dropping in at rush hour to see if it feel more full then.
