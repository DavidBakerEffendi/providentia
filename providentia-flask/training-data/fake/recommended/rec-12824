Delicious, fresh seafood, friendly service, and one of the few pricey places in Princeton actually worth the cost! The crab and guacamole ($15) is a must have, as are the crab cakes ($28). Unlike most places, Blue Point's are all crab, barely any filling. Another winner is the hazelnut and cherry crusted tilapia ($26). The cherries are actually served on the side, but the tartness pairs really well with the crust. The fish is flaky and tastes fresh, but could use a bit more seasoning. Both portions were verrrry generous (and comes with a side of baked potato/sweet potato, mashed potato/sweet potato, or fries) and we had a good chunk leftover. Brussels sprouts ($6) were a bit mushy, so I'd give those a pass. Obviously seafood is pricey, but this is a perfect place for a splurge.
