2,500+ reviews you cannot go wrong, so here are some pointers. Find the  Authentic guys, you can spot them with the yellow and red umbrella.  Posers have the same tshirts and bags, but they don't have the same umbrella. The Umbrella clearly labeled "original".  The are located at the tip of 53rd and 6th ave, (right in front of the Hilton) any other location are the fake ones.  The real guys come at 7pm and stay the rest of the night.  And is usually the one with the very long line. I can pretty much polish off one order by myself but the portion is big enough to share, If you come here after painting the town red and drunk off your mind; dont bother sharing.  If you give a little tip to the guy he can hook up your order with more sauces. The Phaal sauce is NOT for novices, skip this if you are a lightweight. Less than $20 for 2 platters and 2 drinks, this is the best deal in town. Welcome to New York
