Loved this little place. Typical NYC tiny little Italian trattoria. We had the homemade mozzarella and parma ham to start with which was fantastic. I also had the spaghetti carbornara and it was the best I have had outside Europe. Reasonable prices and decent wine list also. I would go here again anytime.
