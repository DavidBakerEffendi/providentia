i love the hand pulled noodle soups here.  you cant get a better bowl of noodle soup anywhere else and for a place that looks as hole-in-the-wall as this place does - is an unexpected delightful surprise.  i'll choose this place over japanese ramen any day. the only thing that sucks is the service, the styrofoam cups and the cramped space.  the pan-fried items on the menu tend to be very greasy.
