Lombardi's....apparently the first pizza place in NYC.  I've been here twice...once for a pizza tour and then for dinner.  We were given some history about the restaurant and shown the old coal brick oven which bakes the pizzas in around 3 minutes...crazy right.   You have to eat the pizza in the restaurant to get that fresh crisp crust and tastiness of the homemade mozzarella (from a deli in Little Italy) and don't forget the amazing sauce.  Great pizza in a cool spot in Little Italy. Ask to see the oven!
