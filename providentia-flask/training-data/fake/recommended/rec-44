Wow, amazing burger! Full of flavor. Soft, toasty brioche bun. Seasoned well and cooked perfectly to medium rare. Mmm crispy bacon. Mmm ridiculously delicious pimento cheese. Don't bother paying the extra $2 for an added egg on top- though the egg was nice and runny, but didn't add to the already awesome, bold flavors. Sweet potato fries were great too. I wasn't as wowed by the sweet potato-jalapeño laktes and they were overpowering in jalapeño flavor. Service was okay. Hostess and waitress were nice. Dimlit, comfortable atmosphere. Food took a lil longer then I expected since there was only one other table. Overall, burger was amazing and I'll be back for it again!
