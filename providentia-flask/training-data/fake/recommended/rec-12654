Why didn't we come sooner? Literally just two blocks from home, we frequently ordered through seamless but never took advantage of their all u can eat mussels special on Sundays and Mondays. We finally came for their special with my soon bro in law visiting. We had amazing mussels and frites on our euro trip 3 summers ago - and BLX delivered exactly that, But wait! actually perhaps even better! The three of us tried all 7 flavors! The first pot was 2 full lbs and the subsequent orders were 1 lb each. The wait between each order was bit longer than the time I spent on devouring each. So I recommend that when u r 2/3 way through, it's best to order your next round. Every mussel flavor was incredible and the fries (although not as crunchy and thick as the ones I had in Brussels) was still very tasty. The mussels here I swear were mutant size. They are at least 3 times bigger than the ones I usually see. Yet somehow we still made it to third round. By the end of our meal, our waitress was so impressed by our stomach capacity and made it known that we made record that night. Speaking of our waitress, so attentive and sweet. She allowed us to swap the beer that came with the special for soft drinks. 4.5 lbs of mussels in my belly later, I left wobbling out. Overall - what an incredible deal! Would definitely return to take advantage of their specials a few more times before we leave!
