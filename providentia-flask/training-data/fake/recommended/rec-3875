I've been to Tom's a handful of times now, most recently for Mothers day. My opinions are back and forth but hereitgoes: Tom's is basically the old school diner (some people say 50's, but this place has actually been operating since the 30s!) in an increasingly new school neighborhood; which means it is a small place with a big clientele. The food is fine, breakfast all day with some pretty cool specials (ricotta pancakes, huevos rancheros are pretty damn good), and also the regular diner food with a great soda bar offering egg creams and cherry lime rickys. You can walk out of there spending about $10, maybe less, for a good amount of food. The price would be fine if the space was a little calmer and more laid back diner-ish, but it isn't. It can often take the form of a giant feeding frenzy on the weekends. Lines can be long (15-20 minutes), the space is cramped and the service is a little rushed. One thing that exacerbates the whole stressful feel of the place is the over-kitchiness hanging all over the walls. The place is busy and rushed enough as it is without having "a bunch of crazy crap all over walls." The hospitality is the rock of this place. Being used to the upstate NY and small-town ideals of actually being polite and friendly to your customers, the managerial staff here, which includes the owners, makes me feel happy about being there and will interact with you as if they actually want your business (I know, a shock in Brooklyn). So yea, the short of it: good food, great owners, but rushed, packed, and a little frantic at times.
