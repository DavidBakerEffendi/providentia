Settled in a blustery weekday night to meet a very nice Yelper for dinner. Surprisingly, a bit empty inside - but it was a bit early in the night. The decor was quite cozy and inviting like a nicely remodeled basement feel with soft candles dotting the tables. No Pinot Grigio! That worked out just fine though, because I got a great recommendation from the server on Gruner Veitlinger from Australia. Delicious, light, and mild which turned out to be a nice complement. I may have just discovered my Pinot's successor. We had the sashito peppers for an appetizer which were served with a light lemon aioli that had a light custardy texture. We both selected the classic ramen for an appetizer that had a light broth with pork, scallion, and ginger. All in all, a fine selection for this chilly evening. Menu was quite large and had a vast array of sushi, ramen, and steamed buns which sounded oh-so-delicious. Use your Yelp app for a free Asahi draft beer!
