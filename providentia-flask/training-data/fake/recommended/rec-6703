In short, this place had great food, an amazing selection of beer and the WORST SERVICE EVER. I'm giving it 4 stars solely for the food, beer, and the excellent manager. I had the burger, which was cooked perfectly and had lots of flavor. The fries were tasty and not overly greasy. Only thing I was disappointed in was the dipping sauce, which didn't have as much flavor as I was expecting. Out of a group of 10 people not one person complained about the food. Unfortunately, I was recovering from a cold so I was staying away from beer, but the selection was unbelievable. But as I mentioned before, the service was absolutely terrible. Our waitress, Melissa B. could use a lesson or two in common courtesy. She started off a good note, being helpful and friendly. But then one person made the fateful mistake of ordering a shirley temple. A few more orders of waters and diet cokes turned this seemingly nice waitress into a ferociously mean person. Now, I understand that this is a place that people go to solely for their beer, but there's no law against going to a restaurant to just eat food. Besides, our group had 10 people and at least half of them were drinking beer. So was it necessary after I ordered my d. coke for Melissa to say in a cocky tone of voice "so is anyone actually ordering beer?" Was it also necessary for her to reach over people while they were eating, walk out of the room as we were ordering more drinks, forget to put in the order for my friend's burger, and give us the overall attitude of being a waste of her time? Probably not. I understand that a group of 10 means an automatic 18% tip, so more beer = more tip, but GIVE ME A BREAK. Fortunately, the manager took her tip off the bill and we left a tip that was representative of the service. I hope she enjoyed her 46 cents. After all that I would definitely still go back to Eulogy, but next time I'm sitting at the bar!
