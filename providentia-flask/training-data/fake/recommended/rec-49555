Beyond Sushi was absolutely amazing!  We ordered a miso soup, a green roll, a sweet potato roll and the roll of the month, which was topped with beet root.  It was all delicious and extremely filling for being vegan!  I am a vegetarian, and am usually stuck with sushi rolls consisting of one vegetable tempura or a piece of asparagus, but Beyond Sushi exceeded all of my expectations.  Go now!
