Second time at Contra and we loved everything from the incredibly patient staff (we were late for our reservation), service to the amazing food. For $55 we tasted a combination of flavors that we have not tasted before in a very laid back atmosphere that is sophisticated and non-pretentious. My favorite things were the bread (+$3), steak and the last dish. We left full and happy. Highly recommend for larger parties since they do take reservations and for date night!
