Though my waistline suffers, I'm a pasta connoisseur. LOVE LOVE LOVE this quaint Italian gem in the heart of the West Village. Fabulous wine selection and pastas you dream about.... I wouldn't recommend the raw artichoke salad. The mussels are tasty, but not something I would run back for. Â Bottom line, save room for dinner and skip out on appetizers. Homemade pastas galore and olive oil that you swear came straight from an olive tree in Italy. Spinach gnocchi is an absolute must if you crave a heavenly pillow melting in your mouth with a gorgonzola cream finish. The fettucini crab ragu is charming as well. Chocolate mousse is a rich and creamy must if you enjoy an after dinner treat. All in all, I'm a fan!
