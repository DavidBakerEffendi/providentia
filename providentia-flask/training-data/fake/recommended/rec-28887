Hummus offers big portions at a reasonable price. The staff is very laid-back (very very nice) and the service is pretty fast as well, even on a busy day. I personally like the pitas. Sometimes I order an extra few and the hummus is also quite good. I don't think there is anything that is done extremely well here, but it's a good option if you want food that is quite tasty and fast.
