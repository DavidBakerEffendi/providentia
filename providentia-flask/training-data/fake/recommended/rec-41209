Omg I have been waiting for this place to open ever since I got a taste of it at the Great GoogaMooga! YES! Finally! My friend and I went during the non peak hours so there were no lines at all. Lucky us! We had the Truffle burger, Umami burger, truffle fries and the cheesy tater tots which was not on their menu. Best bet is to search up their secret menu online and see what they offer. The Truffle burger has got to be my favorite! It is soooo good! It literally melts in your mouth! Omg I'm drooling just thinking about it. Please do yourself a favor and come here for that burger!! Must I repeat, it is so heavenly delicious!
