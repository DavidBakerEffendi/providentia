La Sirene has that certain je ne sais quoi... DAMN.GOOD.FOOD. Bring your cash and your wine and plan to walk home to work off the calores -- it's so worth it. Overall: 4.5 stars. The place is tiny and quirky and adorable, and the waitstaff even have French accents. And the food...my god, the food. The goat cheese tart is perfection. Do not miss it. The curry mussels -- amazing, a generous portion of fat, juicy mussels in a cream-based sauce with a subtle spicy curry flavor. The shepherd's pie -- light and fluffy, with a spectacular browned crust and moist chunks of pollock and veggies. We also had one of the specials, duck confit. Duck's not typically a fave but holy crap, this was wonderfully tender and juicy and in an incredible red wine sauce with hints of cherry. A quarter star off for the desserts -- we had the first and last items on the dessert menu, some kind of cream-puff ice cream profiterole things -- they were delicious, yes, but I just wasn't as blown away as I was with the rest of the meal. And we felt like both desserts were essentially the same thing, except one had chocolate. Next time I'll try some of the other desserts -- the peach melba sounded yum but I was outvoted. The other quarter star off is for small lags in service -- we felt our waitress's interest in us dwindled as the meal went on. They did get busier, but still -- we had to ask her to open our second bottle of wine, for the dessert menu, for the check, etc. Still very good service overall, though. And the prices are quite reasonable -- a big plus. We will SO be back. And you should SO make sure to check it out, too. Bon app√©tit!
