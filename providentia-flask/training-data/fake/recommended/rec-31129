Valentino's is a local restaurant that does nothing to support the local athletics club.  Last year we brought a group of 30 there for a pizza party at the end of our little league baseball season.  We had a $10 coupon that they would not honor.  They tried to tell us that they wouldn't make any money if they honored the coupon.  CHEAP!!  Bad business for a local establishment.   None of the families have been back there since.
