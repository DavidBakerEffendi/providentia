It's hard to find good Mexican food anywhere in the Northeast, but El Vez does a pretty good job with it. Mainly because rather than trying to make it "authentic," they've just used excellent culinary techniques with some Mexican elements. This isn't traditional Mexican food, but it's delicious. Their guacamole is out of this world, as most of the reviews here say. It is a bit pricey, but for the middle of Philly, it's not bad. The tacos do look small to the eye, but they put top quality ingredients in them, and we were actually really full after finishing up. The guacamole is substantial, and trust me, you'll not go home hungry from El Vez. The restaurant is nicely decorated, and service and everything is top-notch, as one would expect for a Starr place. You can see our entire experience in pictures (you've got to see this food to see what many people on here are talking about!) at: world-tasting.blogspot.câ€¦.
