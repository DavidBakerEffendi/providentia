My hubby and I came here last night with high hopes and ended up disappointed for the most part. He ordered the risotto and loved it. I got the fish tacos. Now I am not a picky girl but these were AWFUL. The fish was SO salty, undercooked and like mush. The portion size and presentation was great but the amount of "mango slaw" to fish was about 5 to 1. The waitress even asked me if I was sure I wanted the slaw because, as she put it, " a lot of people dont like it." I guess I should have taken the hint. I managed to force myself to eat about three bites of a taco and some of my rice which was way undercooked (still hard..) I got hot chocolate for dessert which was okay but not worth six bucks. My husband got the s'mores sundae which was okay, but again, could have gotten something better for our money at Friendly's. Â The menus were dirty and torn, floor was dirty, restrooms were dirty... I wish we could get our 80 dollars back. Sorry Max Brenner! Very bad experience for me and I will not be back.
