only here for brunch. love the prix fixe... staff was attentive, if slightly self conscious brooklyn hipsters. (ok, sorry, all of brooklyn is staffed with brooklyn hipsters and everyone wears their hair the same way and i find it a little ridiculous). the food was creative-ish and well executed. really fresh ingredients! almost californian :)
