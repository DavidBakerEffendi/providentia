The ambience here is just perfect, particularly in the warmer months when they have the outdoor seating open--the palm trees and music make you feel like you're on a mini vacation somewhere in the tropics. The food is sooooo good! Whenever I go with friends we usually forgo entrees and just order a bunch of tapas to split. My personal favorites are the chicken empanadas, the chicken lollipops and the chorizo. Their coconut rice is also delicious. As many others have mentioned, they are BYOB. They have several mixes available Â that you can bring your own wine to add to. Their mojito mix is pretty good too, but the last time I was there we brought rum for it and were told we couldn't have hard liquor visible....so we poured it into our glasses under the table ;) I would give them 5 stars but the service here is not that great. I understand that they are extremely busy but each time I've gone the servers were not very friendly or attentive. Also, its VERY loud which I personally don't mind but some people might.
