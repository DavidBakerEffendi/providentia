I was only in Burlington for 4 days, but I came here twice.  It was close to my hotel and was so great I couldn't resist coming back.  They have such a great beer menu and the food was really great.  I only wish I knew about the secret bar downstairs because I've heard that it's pretty great.  I came here by myself one night and than a few nights later with a large group and both times had great service; every nice waitstaff.  I wish I didn't live in Chicago so I could come back!
