I work right around the corner from tony and it's by far the best lunch option around. Also it's cheaper than most places and much higher quality. I've only tried the veggie hero, prosciutto hero and the chicken and portobello pita, but all are excellent. The veggies are fresh, the white sauce is amazing, and the chicken is cooked literally perfectly. Also the prosciutto hero honestly is comparable to a similar sandwich I had in Italy. Honestly it's such a great little stand!
