I always go to this location when I visit NY. However Food quality has reduced over the years, the meat (chicken, shammi) is dry.  Paneer rolls are better. I feel something is always missing in their rolls - salt, lemon juice - its become drier over the years. I believe they have bed bugs on their seating benches-  it effected both me and my friends. I spoke to other folks who visited this location and experienced bed bug bites on their legs since they had sat on the benches. I wont be going here anymore
