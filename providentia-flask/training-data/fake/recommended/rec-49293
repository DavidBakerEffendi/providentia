Normally, I would give this place a 4-star review, but I bumped it up to 5 because I don't think the negative reviews are remotely fair.  The food here is consistently delicious- try the chicken pad thai and the massamun curry with tofu/vegetables.  The atmosphere here is pretty vibrant and happy, I would say.  The service is quick and amiable. Check it out!
