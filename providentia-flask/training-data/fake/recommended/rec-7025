I love this place. In part because I love banh mi sandwiches, and don't come across them very often. But leaving aside their relative scarcity, these sandwiches are outstanding. The pork is succulent and deliciously-spiced; the baguettes are fresh and flaky. All for an absurdly low price of less than $6.
