"Good Ol' Pub" I was pleased to see the recent changes in appearance at one of my favorite breweries in the country. Tasted some great new beers with my lovely wife while waiting for our table which didn't take too long and then had some more great beers when we sat down. ( Tip for good marriage - marry a girl who likes beer) Our service was attentive but not bothersome, the young lady watched but didn't interrupt accept at the right moments. The staff seemed very pleasant despite the rush which is what I am used to here. It was nice to see the mood was light because it only added to the nice time my wife and I were already having. We got some great food as usual, I got my usual LOCAL beef burger for something like $10!!! with fries and cheese which was really fucking refreshing. I will be bringing my kids in next week so they can get some gravy cheese fries which I will promptly steal bites of. -Fu D
