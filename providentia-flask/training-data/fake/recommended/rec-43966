Two girls walk into a bar on a Saturday night. They order two diet cokes and are asked to leave. That pretty much sums up why I'm giving this place no stars. Without wincing after hearing our order the waiter said that this was a bar and we would not have fun there. By the looks of the people in the bar my friend and I fit in perfectly and could have had a great time. My friend with me has never been an alcohol drinker and in her 7 years being of drinking age she has gone out with friends who drink all the time and this has never happened to her. We were stunned. The place was far from packed, in fact there was a man alone at a four person table next to us reading a kindle. The waiter had no tact in asking us to leave. I really wish I could give them 0 stars.
