Hu Kitchen instantly became one of my favorite places to eat in NYC.  All it took was one or two steps after closing the door to realize that this place was going to be good.  Everyone who I engaged with who was working there was a pleasure to deal with and greeted me with a warm smile.   Like many other people have said, this place is not cheap but you get what you pay for.  Hu Kitchen offers real, fresh, high quality food that I personally love.   My first time there was for dinner and I decided to get an entree with 1/4 rotisserie chicken plus two sides which consisted of roasted broccoli and mixed seasonal greens.  I also decided to get an 100% Organic Grass-Fed Meatball and a few spears of asparagus as I hadn't ate all afternoon.  The total price came to 20 dollars and change but let me tell you, you get 20 dollars worth.  They are not shy about what they give you and they do not cheat you out of portions.   Hu Kitchen is heaven for those on the Paleo Diet or for anyone who simply enjoys nourishing their body the right way.  I visited this place with the rest of my family and they all raved about what they got as well.   Hu Kitchen has a wide variety of food options ranging from shakes, smoothies, hot dinner, soups, and a massive cold bar selection so you should be able to find something that meets your desire! Again, thank you Hu Kitchen and I can't wait to visit again!
