I think that the atmosphere of this restaurant is wonderful and that it is a great addition to the neighborhood. We were very excited when it opened, but I must say that we were pretty disappointed with the majority of the food that we tried. We split the hummus appetizer, and then my fiance got the chicken wrap for his entree and I got the lamb shank. The hummus was a very small portion and was REALLY spicy. I think maybe they made a mistake and put too much cayenne pepper in it? We were warned that it was garlicky, but that wasn't it-- this set our mouths on fire! The chicken wrap, though, was the most disappointing part of our meal. My fiance said it tasted like something you could get at Subway (but it was smaller)-- the chicken wasn't spiced at all and the "tahini" tasted like mayonnaise. You'd be much better off at Saad's or Kabobeesh for a chicken wrap. My lamb, on the other hand, was very well cooked and I did enjoy it. I asked for it without olives, though, and it was almost cloyingly sweet without them. Over all, I was really excited for a place like this to open up in our neighborhood. I hope they will change some things up about their menu so that we can go back and enjoy it-- after our first experience, my fiance is reluctant to return!
