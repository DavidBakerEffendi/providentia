wanted to like it here...but not the case..came for drinks on a friday night because of a scout mob deal I had seen and it was totally empty..the sangria tasted like peach schnapps with extra sugar and the server argued with me about letting us use the scout mob deal even though we met the criteria listed in the fine print. He ended up giving it to us but left a bad taste in my mouth...almost as bad a taste as the awful sangria. Won't be back to try my luck with the food.
