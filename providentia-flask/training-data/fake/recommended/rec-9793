Re-updating because I went a few times again and I just want to update my score for them. 4 stars for: good food, fair prices, and excellent decor. The first thing you will notice when you walk in is how fancy it is because it literally emulates a cosmopolitan hotel. Their lunch specials are awesome ($10 or less for an entree + appetizer). Definitely get: Appetizer: Coconut Calamari Main dishes: Tumeric Chicken (SO GOOD), Pad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice The portions are pretty big, so really expect to get the bang for your buck. If you're feeling like you want a drink, they have good strong drinks too. Both the lychee and pomegranate mojitos are worth it.
