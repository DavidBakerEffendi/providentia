Undoubtedly one of my favorite places in NYC, for the following reasons: - Never tried anything on the menu I didn't like - Tapas portions are actually large enough to be shared amongst friends - 1/2 price tapas on Tuesdays til 8pm - Happy Hour specials til 8pm - Caipirinhas!!!! - Fast service - Outdoor seating The only downsides I can think of: 1) servers WILL card you if you order alcohol and WON'T serve you if you forgot to bring ID 2) they won't accommodate parties larger than 16, so big birthday dinners here are out.
