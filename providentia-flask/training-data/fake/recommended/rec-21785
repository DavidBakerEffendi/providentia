Delicious. Classy. Fun. I felt like I was in Europe. Our waitress was uber cute and Scandinavian (??). They also carded my husband and me which made me feel pretty and young. Ha! The oysters were a bit overpriced but very delicious. Â I had the Tacos de la mama. Super delicious and a lot of food! My husband had the duck with quinoa-sweet potato gratin. It was perfectly cooked and quite delicious. A very nice open space and design makes you feel super style-ish. Nice, albeit somewhat expensive, night out.
