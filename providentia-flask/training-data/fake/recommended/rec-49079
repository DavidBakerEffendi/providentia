If you're looking for New York's hottest food spot, I've got just the place for you. It's got everything.  Good looking wait staff, hummus in a bowl with chickpeas, a baby lamb cooked in so many ways.  And to top it off, sangria that will make your mouth water like a broken water hose. If that doesn't convince you, what will?
