I've recently visited this restaurant for the second time.  The decor and atmosphere is kind of fun and different from the other Thai restaurants on Ninth Ave. and the food is good and reasonably priced.  I had a noodle dish the first time I went there and enjoyed it.  I decided to go with one of the their specialty dishes the second time around had one of the Bankokian duck dishes which was good.  Also tried the assorted golden fritter appetizer which had a variety of fried items (four different things, black sesame crusted tofu, fried shrimp, fried dumpling and spring roll).
