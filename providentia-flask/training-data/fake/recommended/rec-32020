The cops may have a new drug on the street to worry about and that drug is Han Dynasty.  It is one of the most addicting meals I have ever eaten.  I was fortunate enough to go last year and I could not stop raving about it.  I have been there on numerous occasions and it has never disappointed. A few years back I started traveling to Shenzhen, China for work and I was never able to eat Chinese food in America again.  No where I went was anywhere close to the flavors or quality that it was in China.  I went to Chinatown a few times and it was closer, but still fell short.  Then I went to Han and I finally found what I was looking for.  It is by far the closest thing I have had in America to the food I ate in Southeast China.  I absolutely love this place. If you go, I suggest the Dan Dan Noodles.  They are to die for, but you honestly can not go wrong with anything on the menu.  The other thing I would suggest is to do this with a group because it is best to order multiple dishes and just pass them around to try everything.
