I have been reluctant to write a review about this...because I love it so and don't want it to get super crowded. But I really do adore this place so it's time for me to show some love. I first discovered Zest last year, while looking for a BYOB sushi restaurant that I could hold a group gathering at. I figured as long as the food wasn't terrible, it would be a good choice. Here began my love affair. The sushi at Zest is awesome, especially for the price. I've only made their happy hour once, but at $3/roll, you really can't beat it. If you check in on yelp, you also get free edamame! The staff is really nice. One time I came here, it was pouring rain and my dinner guest ended up being very, very late. They let me sit around and wait, while I just ordered one beer. No pressure, no weird looks. I really appreciated it. As others have noted, the first bottle for your BYOB is free. They are really great about pouring you more whenever you need it. Great service. They also never rush you out, making it the perfect spot to catch up with someone. Now the only downside that I have experienced is that fact that Zest is quite small. Only once have I had to wait for a table, but I've definitely been seated before and watched others be turned away. Overall though, this is a place that has consistently been a great spot for me to bring people (...just please don't overcrowd it, ok?)
