according to the hubby, one of the top burgers in nyc. and that's a lot coming from him... trust me. he even peeked into the kitchen as we were leaving to study the broiler contraption they use-- definitely one of the few places in the world to still be using something like that, and i think it really makes a difference. i opted for the grilled cheese-- and it was a perfect no-frills, nostalgic, gooey one with real crappy processed american cheese and white bread. the fries kind of tasted like ore-ida. good, but i felt like i could make them at home. but still, a great compliment to the greasy delicious meal. put all that together for 12 bucks and you've got yourself a winner. we'll be back... and soon.
