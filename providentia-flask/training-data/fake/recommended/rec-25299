Hailing from Southern California where there are lots of amazing Asian restaurants, I have a pretty high standard for Asian foods, especially ramen. I frequent Shinsengumi Hakata ramen back in LA, and it set the bar pretty high. Nevertheless, Terakawa Ramen did not disappoint. I tried the signature terakawa ramen and tan tan ramen: the broth was delicious, and I liked the firmness of the noodle. Overall, the ramen here is good! I take one star off because the service was just so-so.
