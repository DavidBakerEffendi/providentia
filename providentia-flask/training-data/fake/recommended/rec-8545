LOVE, LOVE, LOVEEEE Xochitl.  The place is tiny but has one of my favorite margaritas in the city which is saying a lot!  I have sat at the bar there more than a couple times and love the fresh squeezed margaritas (no lime mix here) and the Michelada's and the bartenders are always charming.  Their happy hour runs from 5-7 and offers half-priced margaritas and beer specials. I am a big fan of guacamole and Xochitl's is fresh which is a major plus in my book and has the right amount of lime and cilantro which a lot of places get wrong.  When I was in there last they had some sort of delicious cabbage stuffed enchilada dish but I don't see it on the current menu.  My dining partner had the goat dish and thought it was awesome and we shared the Sopa Azteca and it was quite good.  It's not cheap mexican but if you're looking for amazing food and drinks in a great, comfy atmosphere I would definitely check out Xochitl!
