I only went for drinks and the specials were OK, 1$ off drafts. It was Philebrity's grog party night so my sister and I started with some of their specials $3.50 beers (i forget the name, but it had lots of pepper in it! DELICIOUS) then we switched to grog which was ok. Overall I just hated the waitress who was not attentive and didn't seem overwhelmed she just didn't look up at other tables while walking by. We had to plead and beg for her attention! It wasn't too packed either!! We got there around 545 and it seemed like a regular happy hour crowd at any center city / old city bar. I was just put off by the waitress. Drinks were fine enough, they seem to have lots of events... perhaps i'll venture back for karoke or something. Seems like a cool place, that I really WANT to write a good review about... but the waitress SUCKED. So go, venture to national mechanics and maybe have an attentive wait person and a good experience and write the good review that I so badly wanted to write... boo.
