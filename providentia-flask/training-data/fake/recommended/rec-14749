The floor was very dirty. The bbq chicken Flatbread was hard and not very appetizing. The chicken and shrimp pasta was not a full bowl and quite spicy. The waitress was nice. I would not say i am going back there. Any Friday's in NJ is better. Not to mention that little black bugs were flying around and on was in my drink that was given to me anyway.
