Last night three friends and I had an incredible meal at Cookshop. We were really hungry when we came in, which was probably for the best, since we ate heartily and shared several things on the menu, starting with the Brussel Sprout pizza and ending with the Chocolate Candy Bar Pie and the Gingerbread Pudding. We had a delicious Portuguese Red to accompany dinner and I ordered the Lamb which came prepared in a tasting of three preparations, all mouth melting, served on top of white flageolet beans and sauteed escarole. Other dishes we shared were the Spaghetti Squash with Hazelnut Cream, Dried Cherries and Fried Kale (DIVINE!), The Bosc Pear salad (not one of our favs), the Semolina Macaroni (delish) and the Cod in Chowder (super Yummy, but heavy.) It was the perfect amount of food for us all and the atmosphere was warm and inviting and we could hear each other despite how busy and full it was. I would definitely go back and would love to check out their brunch!
