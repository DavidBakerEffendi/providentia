I like this place because it's so unique. It's the perfect place to come on a warm summer (or spring this year) night. Half of the place is actually outdoors where they have a bunch of picnic tables, jenga sets, and trees. They sell beer by the half and full liter, and thankfully, they allow you to sample them before you order such a large glass. Personally, I only order the half liters because one liter costs the same as 2 half liters, and the whole liter is obnoxious to carry around. In the fall, they sold smore kits and had fire pits to make them on, but they are apparently gone for the season. This place is pretty large, so it's a good option when you're going out with a big group of friends.
