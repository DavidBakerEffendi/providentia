Cafe Matisse is a culinary experience, it is not eating out.  However, save it for a special occasion since it is pricey. They present you with a tasting menu or what they call a grazing menu, so you will choose 2-3 main dishes followed by a dessert.  Your main dishes are not large by any means but they hey are a healthy portion size.  Coupled with a good wine, and having your dishes spaced over time, you really won't be hungry at all.  On the contrary we were really full. Our meals were absolutely exquisite.  Bold flavors and pairings. Don't be afraid to try it.   My dessert was heavenly!  I thought a basil cream on my dessert would be odd but it was one of the best desserts I ever had. The host was very welcoming and they create a quite romantic atmosphere for each table.  On my way out, the host kissed me goodbye as if I had been at his house for dinner.  It was definitely worth the experience.  The food was all AMAZING!
