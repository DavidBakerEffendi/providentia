I went on a Friday evening at 6:30pm. I called 30 minutes prior to put myself and a friend on a waiting list. Right as I entered, the staff greeted me kindly and happily. The food was great! We got the spatzle (i forgot the exact name) but it looked like a pasta ish dish. And I shared the meal with my friend, because we both did not want to be too full. And got separate desserts. I will go again definitely! If you search #cafekatja on Instagram there should be couple pictures up
