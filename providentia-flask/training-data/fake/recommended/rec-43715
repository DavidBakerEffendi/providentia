this is my favorite ramen place...no, this is my favorite RESTAURANT in nyc! Â i am a creature of habit so i always get the akamaru ramen (a light but flavorful broth with the perfect amount of veggies and pork) and an order of the hirata pork buns...they just melt in my mouth and are soo delicious. only downside is the wait, but it's definitely worth the wait!
