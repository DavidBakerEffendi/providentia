We had some time to kill in Philly before our flight and stopped here to enjoy some drinks on the roof top patio.  They really went all out on their decor - which is a fun mix of 60's and 70's style furniture.  We lounged on some comfy orange sofas near a fire place surrounded by lush plants on the open air (covered) patio.  The cocktail list was extensive and they actually had a few nonalcoholic choices for this preggo lady (that were tasty).  My hubby enjoyed a Moscow Mule which did not come in a copper mug...a major faux pas IMO.  If I had more time I would go sit in the funky egg-shaped swinging chairs on the second floor, which were quite unique.  I'm sure this place is really hoppin' in the evenings, but I don't think it would be my scene (way too trendy for this Denver gal).  However, it was a fun little place to relax for a couple of hours and enjoy the nice breeze!
