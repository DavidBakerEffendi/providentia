I love Room Service.  This is my second time here and it never disappoints.  My husband (who is extremely picky aka if it's not a hole in the wall in Chinatown he's going to hate it) reluctantly went with my pick before a show and he got the pad see ew and I got the tom kha gai and the pad thai.  Service was quick and efficient.  Food was great.  Although most people find the Chandelier a bit over the top my husband of course loves it and takes photos like crazy next to it.   He even applauded me for my pick and made it to the show with no delays.
