I'm not normally a big fan of French food, but I was quite happy with this place. I had the lamb, which was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. The waitress was so nice and accommodating... As soon as they realized that our fries had been delayed, they took them off our bill. I think the food is a bit overpriced for the portion sizes, which is the only reason I'm not giving them a 5.
