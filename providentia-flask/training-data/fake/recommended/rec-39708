I have nothing to add as the 2447th review other than that the ramen is cooked perfectly.  The only thing I will say is - definitely check this place out! So reading many of the reviews people say the lines are long. I must have really lucked out so I will share this tip: GO FOR LUNCH, BEFORE 12:00 - preferably on a rainy day .  (did I just ruin this for others?? gosh I hope not). I went at around 11:40am - waited 15 min. By the time I left, the front room was packed.
