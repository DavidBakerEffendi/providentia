my daughter and I went here for our birthdays since they are so close. The atmosphere is fine. The food was acceptable. However the service was so bad it was laughable. One dish was brought out incorrect and they totally forgot to bring out another dish. We only ordered three small dishes. We had to constantly flag down our waiter. But then he brought our check before we received the third dish. There are too many other restaurants to try in new haven before I would try this one again.
