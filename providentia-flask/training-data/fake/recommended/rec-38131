I love diners. I love Burlington. So, of course I would love this family owned restaurant on the corner of Maple and Champlain Streets. But when I drove up and saw "Texas Hot Dogs" well.........the only Texas Hot Dogs I'm eating is at Texas Hot Dog in Altoona, PA . I was skeptical. Walking in, I love the U shaped counter (built by Earl's dad, when his dad and mom were out of town in 1958! and yes, still there). Earl is awesome and friendly and loves to hang out and chat. Now........the dogs. Split down the middle and fried on the griddle and then put into a soft bun and smothered with some deeeeeeeliciouso chili. Andddddddd.......I'll have 2. You should too. Seriously. Two is good with some great fries. No fries you say? Get 3. Lunch with a Coke under $10 bucks! Awesometown.
