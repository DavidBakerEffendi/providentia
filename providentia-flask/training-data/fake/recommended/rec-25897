Ilili takes the number 1 spot in my book for best Arab/Middle Eastern food in the city!!! I had the pleasure of coming here with Yelp's resident genius and ASCII art master, as well as with some old friends a few days later. And I can't wait to go back!!! The falafel was unbelievably delicious. Really... so perfectly done and seasoned. (don't tell Taim that I have a new favorite!) The garlicky-fries were superb. I could eat another bucket full. And that sauce was oh-so-good! The hummus was great - not too chalky or nutty. The tahini was super tart - the way I love it. The cocktails are not for wimps... they pack a delicious punch (harhar). But the very best part of Ilili, which makes me give it 5 stars, despite the atrocious service, was that they use sumac in almost every dish, and even some of the drinks! This is my very favorite spice in the world, and not found at all in Western cuisine! So, come here for excellent food, and a really cool interior (high ceilings!!!), but not the service. Lower your expectations of the service, so you won't be disappointed when your menu is tossed in your direction or your server brings the check to your table while you are only half-way through your meal. You gotta manage your expectations, folks! My mouth is watering again just thinking about those falafels!! 5 yummy stars.
