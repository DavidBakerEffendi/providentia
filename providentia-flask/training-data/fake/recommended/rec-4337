On a gloomy Wednesday, I stopped by for a happy hour drink and while I didn't have a chance to eat anything off their menu, I did have a good time eating up all of Lou's knowledge about cocktails, beer, and wine.  Without giving up any secrets, he talked up some house-made liqueurs that will make me run back there right now.  Right now!   Seriously, this tiny bar is one of the best I have come across in this town and Lou is the mayor of cocktail mastery.
