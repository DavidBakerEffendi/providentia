I love Almaz Cafe. This place is run by Almaz and her husband Solomon. They are great. Almaz is my favorite, as she's always fun and really nice and makes me smile. If you come enough, she makes it a point to learn your name. She's a trip and always makes me smile.  Conversely, you never really have to make her smile, as her smile is omnipresent.  She makes a mean coffee (always Ethiopian Yirgacheffe) and great espresso, but I'm always bad and get the Cafe Voltaire, as it is just this wonderful dessert for me. The sandwiches are great. The BBQ Chicken Wrap is really well done, as well as the Tuna sandwich. I'm a huge fan.   But really, I'm beating around the bush. The ethiopian fare is delicious. I always get the vegetarian combo, just because I cannot decide what wonderful plate to eat.  The food comes with ample injera, which is always a concern of mine when I go to eat Ethiopian fare.   Seriously, you need to try this place.
