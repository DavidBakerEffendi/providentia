Finally a Â steakhouse in town. The food was delicious and the staff (especially James) were so friendly and accommodating. They had a decent wine list (something you cant always find in bayonne). I was thrilled they had a good super tuscan on the menu! We had the fried calamari as an appetizer and it was perfect. Next I had the NY strip and smashed fries, so delish! We will be back fro the food, drinks and to chat with the staff!
