Solid coffee and pastries, but this was the loudest coffee shop I've ever experienced (and I'm not exactly picky about noise).  The music was loud.  The patrons were loud.  Even the dishwasher was loud with the stacking of the clean plates.  It was like there was a competition amongst everybody to see who could be the loudest.
