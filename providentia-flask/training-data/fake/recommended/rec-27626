anytime I'm in the city, I try to make it to this great little mexican joint!!  a good friend of mine lives in the neighborhood so easy to walk there and check for wait times because, as everyone has already pointed out, this spot has an extreme mix of both popularity with very limited seating.  Anyway, little tacos are awesome..all of them...and the caipirinhas are terrific!!  the guys I always end up there with order those freaking HOOOT margaritas...infused with some serious peppers...I tried the freaking things once and, no joke, took a day or so to recover.  I am not huge on hot things so a bad decision on my part, but it is safe to say that they are as advertised...HOT!
