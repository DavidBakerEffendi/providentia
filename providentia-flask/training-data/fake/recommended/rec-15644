Eh, I feel that this place is just overrated... I've seen restaurant reviews on some of the blogs out there- and everyone seems to recommend this restaurant, so I gave it a try. Well. As it says on the menu, this is more like a restaurant & bar so if you don't drink, you'd be left with an only option of drinking nasty tap water or soda. Food is okay, we ordered grilled jumbo shrimps and the famous gnocchi.. it's tasty. small portion, a bit over-priced, especially the shrimps.. it came out to be 4 grilled shrimps with some.... red bell peppers and...onions..and such..=$22+tax hmmmmmm ridiculous part is the soda which is served in a small,small cup (a cup that'd contain perhaps 1/4 of can soda) with ice and no refill, with a price of $3. Well, I don't live in NY and maybe that's why I don't get these overpriced dishes and 1/4 can of soda sold $3. I guess I should just stay in NJ area, they've got THAT level of food here as well, with cheaper price and such.
