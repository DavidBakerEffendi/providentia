Never again... What a joke!! Would love to address the owner of this low class establishment. I only been in the area a short time and like to gv everyone the benefit of proving themselves. I say this, Â because everyone in my neighborhood told me not to waist my money n TIME... I found hair in my food and waited over thirty minutes for a watered down beverage.. It's sad that people open food establishments to mk a quick buck but really don't care about their patrons.. It's all about the money cause if it wasn't this owner would take pride in their (restaurant ) I guess you would call it??? I would hope the owner of this cafe does not own any further establishments!! .
