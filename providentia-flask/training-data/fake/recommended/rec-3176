A very interesting and satisfying restaurant, and probably my favorite Chinatown spot. Huge menu, cheap, spicy spices, pretty good quality ingredients, definitely dirty, what more can you ask for? Wanna watch sweaty chinese guys in Hawaiian shirts chop, boil, and fry with Tchaikovsky ballet-like grace while you sweat out some intoxicatingly delicious Szechuan curry at the same table as a bunch of strangers? Me too. Go.
