REALLY small place, so come early. We didn't even know the hours but figured it would be open at 6:00pm when we arrived but that was when it opened... Soon after we arrived it was full. Another thing is that if you plan on coming with a group of more than four... don't. There's just not room for large parties. Also if you are for some reason uncomfortable with being really close to the table next to you, this is also probably not the place for you... The tables are so close it kind of feels like the people next to you are dining with you. ANYWAY, the food! We shared the striped bass which came as a whole fish that came with an alright arugula salad and was definitely enough for two. If you're afraid of having bones in your food I wouldn't recommend this.. BUT we loved it. The skin was so crispy and flavorful! Fish was cooked great. We also tried about 4 different types of oysters. (black crescent, fire river, taunton bay, and blue point) Taunton Bay was definitely our favorite. Some of the oysters are weirdly tiny but good nonetheless. Would definitely return!
