Absolutely fantastic food! My favorite is the bruschetta (I get the classic one and the one with goat cheese). Paninis are delicious, and the waitstaff have been very accommodating when I've asked to make substitutions or modifications. The service is very relaxed, which is perfect because I don't want or need to be pampered here. The waitstaff has always been responsive when I've asked for things and that's all I need. Great hidden spot!
