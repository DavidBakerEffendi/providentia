Introduced to this place by my friend and pleasantly surprised.  I love soup dumplings (Xiao long bao) and they I would have to say have the best in Philly.  There is so much soup in the bun.  I have tried Joe's Shanghai in NYC and I think its close if not better.  I'll have to do a test one day to compare.  Only real downfall is that they only take cash.  I've never eaten here only have done take out a few times.
