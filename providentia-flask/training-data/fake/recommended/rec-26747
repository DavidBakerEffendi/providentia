In long island we call them heroes, definitely not hoagies, but I'll compromise and call it a sub.  Meatball sub (traditional) is delicious.  As a very "meat and potatoes" type of person I truly appreciate a place with a simple menu (esp one focused on meatballs) that can really deliver on taste and quality.
