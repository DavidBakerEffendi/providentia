Jose Tejas has delicious food served in huge portions. Soft drink refills keep coming; hot chips and great salsa too. The service is almost always fabulous, and the prices are very very reasonable. It's the greatest deal around for kids. The kids' portions are generous (the fries are awesome!) and they come with apple slices and a full-size bag of Skittles or M&Ms after the meal. (And the prices are laughably low.) They must make their money on drinks and quantity b/c the food is not expensive, and the place is always packed. But get there before 2 p.m. on a Sunday or holiday or expect to wait as much as an hour or longer. It's worth it, but you'll do well to bring a crossword puzzle or very chatty friends to keep you busy. I almost didn't want to write this b/c the place is already so busy, but maybe someone will finally get smart and open another one to spread the Jose's joy.
