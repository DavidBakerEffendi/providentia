The food is ok.  If you are coming to this hood for Mexican this place doesn't hold a candle to el camino real or taco reindo.  However the tuna ceviche is quite tasty and my favorite bartender is at the place so I keep coming back for the drinks not the food.  The salsa is great too. Lunch is decent too, food service is often way slow, so be careful if you need a speedy lunch.
