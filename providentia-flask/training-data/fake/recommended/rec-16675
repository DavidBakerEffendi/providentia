The basics: Good food.  I went once and returned again within the week. Super-affordable (pasta ~$11-15, fish and meat $12-17, salads ~$8). The selection is extensive without being overwhelming. GREAT GARDEN in the back (with cover when it's chillier, which is just as nice) and cute dining room. The service is nice.  Friendly and laid-back, never negligent.  And they don't up-sell.  I hate being up-sold.  I want to know my choices without feeling like a cheapskate if I want tap water! Try splitting a salad and a pasta for two.  Our waitress suggested it and we weren't misled!  Enough food reasonably priced.  The suggested bottles/glasses of wine are good too.
