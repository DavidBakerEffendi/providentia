This is a review of the coffee shop side. I haven't tried the bar/restaurant yet, but I walked by during lunch hours and their lunch options looked really tasty! I don't drink much coffee anymore, but when the craving strikes, I head over here. I am a total coffee snob and won't drink an espresso that isn't naturally sweet, nutty, and smooth. Their espresso bar is awesome! They use a fabulous La Marzocco machine that produces the best espresso crema I've ever seen. The Brooklyn Roast coffee is delicious too. They use the Iris blend. How do I know all this? Because as I walked out of the coffee shop and took the first sip of my latte, it was so good that I did an about-face back into the store to ask them about the coffee they used! What's there besides coffee? A small selection of pastries/muffins. They're nothing special, but definitely good enough for a quick breakfast or snack.
