This place was fantastic!!! the ambiance was great and the staff was very friendly. They have a large menu which makes it difficult to chose because everything looks so great!!!!!!! I ordered the Japanese Pan Noodles w/out mushrooms. It was amazing. This will not be my last time here. I wish there were more in the state! If you're thinking about going..... just GO!!!! Enjoy :)
