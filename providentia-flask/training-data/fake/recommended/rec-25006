Came for brunch because our usual spot was too packed to get in.  It was a decent alternative. Eggs benedict was just OK but the potatoes on the side were really good.  I had pancakes I could only eat one they hid the two burnt ones under the top pancake which was the only edible one. Ambience was cool place has potential.  Kitchen should know when to throw things out instead of serving inedible food to their customers if they want repeat business. We'll be waiting at our usual spot. Didn't feel the food was worth the prices.
