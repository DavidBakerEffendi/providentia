Friendly service, nice ambiance for a date and most importantly, good food. That being said - I wish the tables were spaced a little further apart but it's New York. Space is sometimes hard to come by. Also, for a relatively small person, I can eat A LOT so I also wish that the portions were a little bigger but was happy enough with my meal. I've eaten at places that gave me a lot less for the price so I'm not that bothered by it. That's just the little piglet in me talking. All in all, I would go back again and would recommend it.
