Well isn't this another NY - must. Halal carts are all over the city, but everyone told me that this is the one to go to. My sister said there are 2 locations and we were in this area so, Halal Guys - here we come! We picked up the chicken plate, cash only, which is perfect because I believe I ONLY had $6...which was the perfect amount, lol. We brought it back to my sister's apartment and the portion as so large, large enough for 2 hungry girls to share. Meat was OK, white sauce was good!, rice is what I loved. Great combo of food. Glad I tried it! Line can be long, it's in the middle of businesses and tourist attractions. The "guys" are working really hard with quick service.
