Dined at Bistango last night. Was close to Kips Bay movie theater, so we chose this place. Was able to be seated right away by the windows by a friendly older gentleman. Guessing hes the manager or owner? The menu choices were reasonable. I had the Filetto Di Vitello Con Fungi - Veal wrapped with prosuitto and mushroom sauce, my date had Capellini Con Gamberetti E Carcofini - Angel Hair with shrimp and tomato sauce. Both were surprisingly tasty. The only complaint I have, is I was not given or offered a steak knife and had to use a plain knife that barely serrated. Otherwise, I would of offered my five star rating for this restaurant :)
