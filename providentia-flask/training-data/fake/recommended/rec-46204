Classic case of don't judge a book by its cover. Best Indian food in the East Windsor area, hands down.  Food is consistently flavorful and fresh.  I've been going here 1-2x a week since it opened and have not been disappointed yet. The chicken Biryani and tandoori chicken are especially noteworthy.
