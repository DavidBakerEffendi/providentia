My family enjoyed our meal at LaScala and will return. Our waiter made a 'special' lemonade drink for my kid and even if that is what he does for anyone that orders a lemonade, he made my kid feel special.  You get a nice tip for that and a nice review on Yelp. Oh yeah:  food above average. Chopped salad and the margarita pizza real tasty.   It sounded like they had meals for kids but not a separate kids menu.  Our server mentioned they had a smaller 'plain' pizza for kids, so if you are dining with kids you may want to ask.  Our 8-yr old likes to try new things from the regular menu so we didn't ask.
