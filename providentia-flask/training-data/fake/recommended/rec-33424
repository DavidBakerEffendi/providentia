I'm not embarrassed that the weekend brunch hostess at Olea now knows me.  Perhaps I should be, but given the delight of this place, I'm not.  Olea knows how to do brunch, and has fully satisfied all at our table each time I've gone. The staff are very friendly and helpful, happy to answer any questions or provide suggestions.  The ambiance is lovely, if a little loud.  But the decor is very welcoming and they have avoided the temptation to cram in too many tables. The coffee is fantastic as are the brunch cocktails, particularly the mango mimosa.  Olea also has a number of great options for non-meat eaters, while still pleasing to the carnivores.  The turkish breakfast is a delicious collection of cilantro eggs, fattoush, yogurt and pita.  My favorite though is the parmesan toast - a scrumptious pile of cheesy toast, poached eggs, sweet peas, scallions and an amazing tangy avegolomono sauce with a great kick.   The drawback is that I am not the only one to have discovered this gem.  Get there by 10:30 on the weekend if you want to avoid a potentially long wait.  It's worth rolling out of bed early!
