My roommate & I have been waiting for the "Brick Oven Pizza" mystery storefront to finally open, and last week we hit up the new Barboncino's for the first time. It was a weekday, and slow (they're still trying to get their liquor license, so they aren't getting the bar crowd right now). We got the artichoke & smoked pancetta, as well as a marinara pie for filler. The artichoke & smoked pancetta was amazing. Delicious. Marinara was a good, typical wood-fired marinara pie. Crusts were all nice, crispy, with a little smoky flavor but not too much. I hate when places undercook their crust so this is a plus. The atmosphere is really nice, it's very tastefully decorated, though roommate thought it was trying a little too hard, I disagree. Very cozy. Service was friendly and prompt, on top of things but not overbearing. I'll definitely be back to try the cherry stone clam pie.
