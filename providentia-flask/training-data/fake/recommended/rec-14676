If it wasn't for Yelp, there would be no way in hell that I would be able to find this place. You have to walk down a long long thin alley that is covered by graffiti, and has one garage entrance that looks like it leads to a chop shop (like grand theft auto). Once you enter, the lady with full body tattoos and piercings is pleasant and helps you to your seat. Inside, the place looks like a log cabin, with all the dead animals on the walls to make it legit. Never having done acid, I could only imagine that someone on acid, in that environment, would be in a living nightmare with all those animal heads that are 'frozen in time' with screaming expressions. The service was friendly, and our waiter Dan was happy to make recommendations, which all came out good. We skipped the morning alcoholic beverages and I got the Almond Soda and Marina got the Mrs. Palmer, a variation of the ice tea w/ lemonade (both were good, but the Palmer was better). For entrees she had the 5 cheese macaroni, which was hands down the best macaroni we've had, and I ordered the cheeseburger with french fries, both of which were top quality. I also had the iced coffee, which was nothing special, just regular 'as it should be' iced coffee. She got the cappuccino, which looked really good with a heart design on the foam layer. We also split their ice cream of the day, which was chocolate, layered with cookie crumbs on the inside... also good. The whole place has this very 'old' field to it, and not in a bad way. I used the restroom, and it also added to the decor. I was just really impressed with the liquid soap that they used, which had a musky lemony scent that just added to the experience of the restaurant. Marina spent 5 minutes telling me about all the people that she can't wait to bring here. With good reason. :-)
