Having come in on an afternoon flight from Philadelphia and driven up to Ewing in fairly exciting traffic, I was looking for a good, solid dinner that wouldn't take a long time and I wasn't sure what I wanted.  The Ewing Diner is a real diner to me in that it has a thick, multipage menu in small print, including 64 different omelet options.  The service is good and very fast and the food tasted great.  I love to see restaurants with history that can keep a good tradition alive and do it while serving great food.
