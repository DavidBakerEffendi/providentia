Went here last night because it was recommended by a friend. When writing reviews I tend to steer away from commenting about the service because at the end of the day, I'm there for the food, not the waitress. BUT, i have to comment on my waitress forgetting one of the three rolls that I ordered. It wasn't busy, and I did make myself very clear on the order, so there was no reason to completely forget a roll and then add it to the check. ANYWAY, this had to be the worst sushi I had ever had. I have experienced many different sushi restaurants and this was by far the worst. My girlfriend ordered a Spicy Tuna roll and it tasted/smelled like pure cigarette. She couldn't even look at it. My shrimp tempura roll was ok. I also ordered a Boston roll and honestly, I don't even know what the hell it tasted like. Being that it wasn't our waitresses fault that the sushi was horrendous, we decided not to complain, take basically our entire order to go and toss it to the curb once we walked out the door. We couldn't wait to get out of there! Save yourself the trip and go to East Gate in Verona instead. Much better quality, tasty, professionally displayed, REAL sushi. Sorry Sushi Cafe, you're not for me!
