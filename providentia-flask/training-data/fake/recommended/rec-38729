I want to start off by saying that ten stone is a great place to grab a few beers. I had never eaten here but was so excited to try their food. So I figured brunch would be a perfect time to grab a bite. Well was I ever disappointed with the meal. Ordered the ham and grilled cheese sandwich with a fried egg on top, the toast was beyond dry. The egg was very very over cooked and to top it off there was less than a slice of cheese on this bland, dry, flavorless sandwich. Left the bar very dissatisfied.
