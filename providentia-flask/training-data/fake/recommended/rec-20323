I'm going to start off by saying that I am not a seafood person. I used to like fish sticks and popcorn shrimp as a kid, but somewhere along the way, my mouth and stomach decided that seafood was not for me. I tried to eat a popcorn shrimp a couple of years ago and, as Mike Birbiglia's mouth once said upon spitting out a pretzel, "This is not food." HOWEVER, about a year ago I had a nibble of lobster tail and actually liked it. I didn't love it, but it also didn't make my stomach do a flip flop. So a couple of weekends ago, my husband and one of our friends visiting from Ohio decided to give the Lobster Pound a try. We all went with the Connecticut style roll (I absolutely hate mayo), which is really small for something that costs $15. We also got whoopie pies for dessert. We took our haul to the little park area by Ikea and ate. And my stomach, while hesitant, did not reject the lobster. It wasn't the best thing I've ever eaten, but I have to admit it was pretty tasty. It didn't taste or smell at all of fish, and the flesh was pleasantly chewier than many fish dishes that I've tried to eat. The chips were a great accompaniment, and the pickle was outstanding. Bright green, crispy, just a touch sour. Beautiful. The whoopie pies were likewise awesome. Good, sticky, moist cookie and non-greasy cream filling. While I don't think I'll ever need to eat a lobster roll again, I give this place props for creating a seafood dish that my stomach accepted.
