I wouldn't advise eating this pizza before your prospective job interview or before proposing marriage. It will give you major grease bubble farts for hours on end. I had to eat this stuff whenever I volunteered or worked at Temple. Instead of giving us a real lunch, they reverted back to some sort of middle school psychology technique... "Gee kids like pizza. Pizza is cheap."
