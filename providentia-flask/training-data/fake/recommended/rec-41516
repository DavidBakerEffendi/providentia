As of right now all i can honestly say is that this place had the best cheesecake that i have ever had hands down. I've tried many other places in the past and none compare to junior's. My wife has never been a fan of cheesecake and surprisingly enough she really really liked it. I'll be ordering another cheesecake from them soon through there website since i'm not in the area but when i am you'll be sure to find me there. Probably on the verge of gaining a 100 pounds lol
