Rats exceeded the hype. Service was excellent without being annoying. But the food was really outstanding including some "best Evers": the truffled cheese in the artisanal cheese appetizer and the scallops. Ramp tartlet and filet mignon also delicious. The stroll thru the Grounds for Sculpture capped a perfect evening. Can't wait to go back.
