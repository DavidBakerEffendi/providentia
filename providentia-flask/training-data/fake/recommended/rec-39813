Yuca Bar is the quintessential hung over breakfast spot... Nice open seating area that looks out onto the street across from Thompson Square Park.  Great pre-set menu for brunch on the weekends with your choice of breakfast+coffee+alcohol (mimosa, strong screwdriver or bloody) Definitely try the quevos rancheros, sooooo good!  If you don't feel like breakfast, the burger with yucca fries is also quite good. Overall an awesome spot to know about and with great Latin paintings on the wall.
