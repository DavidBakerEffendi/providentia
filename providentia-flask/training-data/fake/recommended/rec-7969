Doc Magrogan's may be good at any number of things but procuring fresh seafood and cooking it do not seem to be on the menu. Their grill specials feature tiny servings of fish that has been out of the water for longer than one might like before being cooked. The octopus salad has a reasonable quantity of fresh arugula, a few small cold chunks of octopus, and seems to feature halves of previously canned olives as the main ingredient. The dish would be more edible if the whole thing is drenched in vinaigrette, the dominant ingredient in which seems to be vinegar.
