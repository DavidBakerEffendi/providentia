absolutely amazing. seriously, the best meal i've had in a long, long time. i had the sweet sausage, roasted red pepper & onion over creamy polenta. it was beyond delicious. i'm sure my waistline was happy that the portions weren't huge, but my Â taste buds definitely wanted a second helping. creme brulee for dessert. again, crazy good. maybe the best creme brulee i've ever had. it was so light and delicious with the perfect amount of crunch on top. i will definitely be back. and soon.
