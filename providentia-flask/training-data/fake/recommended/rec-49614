A-MA-ZING! Today was my second visit to Beyond Sushi and I think an addiction is developing. I've tried the Spicy Mang, Might Mushroom (my current favorite) and the Haricat. The flavors go extremely well together and the sauce they incorporate into each roll is divine. I'm not a vegan foodie but this place is beyond vegan and sushi, it's just damn good food. It'The location is awesome and the restaurant itself is very clean, has friendly staff and plays great music! A good spot to go with friends and a date. :-) Â Def a must try!
