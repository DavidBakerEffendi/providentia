Excellent food, great service. They were so kind and helpful. I got a pork sandwich which was only $5 and tasted great! I tried both types of rice, the darker rice was better in my opinion; also got some type of beef stew which was also excellent, but nothing compared to the grilled plantains. Had some leftover to take home, heat up and eat with vanilla ice cream. Super cheap as well! Definitely recommend it and will be going back for sure.
