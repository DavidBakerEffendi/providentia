The perfect place for our family!! Daughter is full blown celiac and hubby is gluten sensitive--one of the few places that the waiters actually ask who has allergies, etc... The food was amazing we have been here several times and every dish we ordered was fresh, amazingly delicious and spot on!! The owner comes out to say hi and thank you--I mean, what more could you ask for? I like my wine and even the wine list is superb!! Thanks for the memories as this is the place to celebrate major life events!! But we also come here when we are hungry!! Hahahaha-Lol Â Hubby raves about the carrot cake. He is gluten sensitive, and never gets sick when we eat here. My daughter loves the ravioli and her boyfriend loves the "regular" dishes as well!! Yummy mozzarella appetizer--the salmon entree is to die for and so many options. Its truly an amazing place with a lovely atmosphere and great service!!!
