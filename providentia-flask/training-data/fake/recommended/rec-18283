The worst dinner ever!  Service was beyond poor.  Who was my waiter? No less than 5, maybe 6 people stopped by for something and yet we had to flag someone down to take our order after 30 minutes, flag someone down for our "pickles" starter, which then came out after the beets appetizer. The jumbo shrimp were not jumbo, and served with heads on leaving very little meat.  The meat was so dry, it couldn't be pulled from the shell. For $22 I can do better than that at any restaurant in the city.  Also the wine pour was short to add insult to injury.  We have been here before when they had the small plates menu. That was inconsistent too, but thought we'd give it one last try. We love Garces other restaurants, so this is surprising that it's so bad.
