The bar itself was cool. Friday night and not that crowded. I was a party of one and had the choice of seating outside, at the high top or the bar, I was told low tables were for 2 or more. I am basing the food on what I remember from living in southern Bavaria near Augsburg Germany. Everything was bland and over cooked. The schinzal was most inside however the breading was burnt around the edges and hard. Cabbage was mush along with the spatzle.
