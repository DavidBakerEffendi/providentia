My wife and I have stopped here twice, the first time hoping that the place would be a good average place to get something quick to eat when we don't feel like driving to Somerville or Princeton. We didn' t care for the food, a couple local diners are quite a bit better which in my mind makes this inedible. After a a few months, we forgot how bad it was and figured it couldn't be that bad and stopped there again. Â This place gets #2 for the worst restaurant in our area, with "Charlie Browns" being the actual winner of of the most awful.
