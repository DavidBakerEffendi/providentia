What other coffee shops play gangsta rap over brunch?! Came here for some grub and coffee and was pleasantly surprised by the vibe and patrons. Definitely a great crowd. The food, however, was lacking. I wish it could back up the vibe with some good grub, but it didn't live up to the expectations. If I'd come back, I'd only swing by for the coffee and some people watching.
