Rainy, cold day in NYC. My wife and I are in this part of town to see The Daily Show. Two hours to kill before taping starts. We wander across the street and find ourselves in the Retro bar. Tot-chos and cocktails while we warm our bones. Digging the 80's tunes and the very friendly staff. Feeling like we are Regulars. Retro tee shirt joins the collection.
