Yes. It is completely worth all the hype it gets. We went to umami burger on a Tuesday night, and were seated right away. I had mentally prepared myself for a wait, so was pleasantly surprised when I did not have to! We were taken to the dining room upstairs, which is much quieter than downstairs. I went ahead and ordered the original burger, while my friends got the truffle and hatch burger. The waitress recommended that we get the burger medium rare as this really brings out the umami flavor. I'm more of a medium girl myself, but I went ahead and trusted the waitress and ordered medium rare. My friends chickened out and went medium. HUGE mistake, there was a perceptible difference between the medium rare and medium patties. Medium rare makes this burger a revelation from god, while medium makes it just another good burger. The truffle fries were an amazing accompaniment to the burger, although they are a bit heavy (make sure to workout before coming here). We ended the meal with the original ice cream sandwich and the snicker doodle, burnt caramel ice cream sandwich. The snickerdoodle ice cream sandwich was to die for. Perfect balance of just a hint of salty in the caramel with the sweetness of the cookie and ice cream. I'm so glad this LA joint has made it down to NYC.
