We ordered a number of dishes that was full of hot peppers; dried peppers, fresh peppers, white, red, and green. If you like spicy, try this place. My favorite was the deep fried pig intestines. All were good, except for the fish head with chili. I think they used carp, which was very muddy tasting. It was good that they provided a big bowl of white rice! I would definitely come back to try other spicy dishes.
