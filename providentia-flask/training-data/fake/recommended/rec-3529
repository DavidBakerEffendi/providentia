This place is known for its pork butt. It is good, but not worth the pre order hassle good. Â The waiter was so rude too. He kept on trying to take my menu and I kept on trying to say to him, "I need to order. I need to order." The pork buns though...it is amazing! Just enough of the sauce and bun to hit the spot. Now THAT is worth the wait. The rest, ex Spanish mackerel, was not good. Too salty and needs more of that fruit, but then the flavor of the fish is gone. It is a failure of a dish to say the least. The scallop was overcooked lacking the light pink and soft middle I usually like. Then the pork butt comes. Now I understand why the waiter think I don't need to order anymore. This dish is HUGE. Kinda would've been helpful for him to tell us about that. I ordered a pigs head too! Luckily they might have known we won't finish it...or they just forgot. Rolls eyes* So remember the dish is HUGE right? So the waiter decided to try to squeeze the plate from the left side, fails, then the right side, fails and settles with putting the dish over her head, without once telling her what he's trying to do! She's NOT short either? How could the waiter be so inconsiderate? Okay, I understand why the waiter did what he did because the place was crowded! There were ten of us and elbows were touching. Because the place was so small and so many ppl the sound level was just sheer madness. I could not hear my friends sitting next to me. I mean come on! I don't know if this is a one of a kind experience or not, judging from other reviews I assume it might be, but I really feel this restaurant is such a hype. Please, the famous Chinese restaurant that requires an hour wait is soooo much better than this. I know this is Korean food, but you know what? It really doesn't taste that differently, minus the kimichi, from Chinese food.
