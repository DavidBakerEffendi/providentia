Room Service is a solid Thai spot with a central location on 9th Ave. For the modern, sleek ambiance and the price, it's a tremendous value. The mojitos with fresh mint were delicious, as was the decent selection of $5 Southeast Asian beers. The food won't blow your mind, Â as the menu is pretty standard American Thai, but they'll nail your favorite delivery-night dishes. I had the Spicy Basil Noodles which were tasty but they weren't spicy as the name implied. Also sampled the red curry and pad thai, which were about as standard-goodish as I was expecting. If you want to feel like you're going out without raping the wallet, this is probably one of the better options for Thai in Midtown west.
