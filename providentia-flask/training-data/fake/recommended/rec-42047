Puerto Viejo is MUY BONITA! I love the atmosphere, the theme, and the energy. It's super comfortable but still very sharp. The food presentation way better than I expected and the prices are not bad at all. It is a little small that's why I gave it five stars but other than that I love it. I'll definitely be back.
