I came here after seeing an article on line about great burgers. I will say, the burger was tasty, it was fresh and the bun was wonderful. I think I liked the shack sauce, but I couldn't find out exactly what was in it, so I'm a little scared about that. Did I detect garlic? The burger didn't have me bowled over. I don't see what the hype is all about. Loved the fries. I wish more places used crinkle cut fries. Didn't order a "concrete" because I have no idea what that is other than what we make bricks and sidewalks out of. Didn't see anything on the sweets menu I couldn't live without. I'd eat here again, but I wouldn't walk out of my way for it like I did for this one. I'd say Five Guys has a better burger; maybe not as good a bun or fries.
