I come here often for Brunch. When coming to Chavelas, Be prepared to wait and feeling cramped and maybe a little overwhelmed. But trust me the food is all worth it. The last few times I have gone, I enjoyed the Eggless Don Plato which is a good size mix platter for one of all Mexican deliciousness they have to offer, It comes with fresh hot tortillas, chiquilles, guacamole, mole, pick de gallo and a spicy potato thing that brings it all home. They can definetly work on the service part, but the food is so good. I'm willing to look pass the wait and tightness of the place, since I always go with a good group of my favorite people that make the time there even more special.
