Two words for them: Rip off!! Starting at the hype they create around reservations that "we are ohh so overbooked" and people are lining up to eat here to the "uncooked" pasta and a ridiculously overpriced menu. I mean yea, its fine dining on an noncommissioned floating boat and with titanic interiors and ambiance but a $35 uncooked pasta makes it not so worth it. There are other better fine dining experiences I have had for a bit cheaper. Good for one time maybe to know what the hype is about but naaa for the second time around.
