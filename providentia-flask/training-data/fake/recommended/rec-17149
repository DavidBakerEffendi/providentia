Absolutely love this place! The food is amazing and everything is always fresh. The restaurant itself is very clean and pleasant creating a great atmosphere. The owner and the employees are very kind and attentive. The menu has a very wide selection making it very easy to please everybody. I have been there twice already and will definitely return soon.
