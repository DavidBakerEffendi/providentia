If you came here for authentic New York style pizza, you will be disappointed to find that they do not do that here. This is a very different kind of place that focuses on traditional, real Italian style pizza. I would encourage you to keep an open mind about Â that and give this place a try. They have a great wine selection here and often run specials on their stuff. Have a glass with your meal--it'll compliment it well. We ordered 4 different pizzas, a mushroom one, a vegetable loaded one, one with cherry tomatoes and one with ham and vegetables. They are definitely different from what we know as pizza here in the US. The crusts are thin and crunchy and the sauce and cheese are used more sparingly. It was good stuff though, and definitely full of quality ingredients. We stuffed ourselves by finishing all 4 large pizzas (among the 6 of us). I can't honestly say I would choose to eat here again the next time I am in New York, but that's only because there are so many culinary options to choose from. I would recommend them to open minded diners in the area.
