Best Peruvian place in nyc! I absolutely love this place. Must try items are mama juanitas rotisserie chicken and the green sauce that goes with it. I love the avocado salad and the plantains goes really well with the whole meal. I would definitely eat there again and would recommend it to friends to try out.
