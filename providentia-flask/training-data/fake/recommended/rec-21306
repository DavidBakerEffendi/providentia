robataya is my top 3 japanese restaurants of all time.  the atmosphere here is exciting.  the service is top notch and friendly. THE FOOD IS AMAZING and soooooooo fresh.  i could eat here everyday.  its hard to find any place that has ingredients so fresh they have so much flavor that not much is needed to extract all that goodness.  baby corn only had a light sprinkle of salt, but pow, so much flavor in such a little bite.  along with all of this the prices aren't bad at all, but rather fairly priced.  in saying this, you can easily go overboard and spend lots in ordering many small dishes so be careful.  be smart and order a variety of items.  starch, vegetable, and protein. everything i had here was super good, and i'm sure everything on the menu is solid.  salmon over rice...so good, my mouth is watering right now.  such a simple dish, but executed with so much flavor.  i want to be back here right now. make sure you make a reservation as they have limited seating.
