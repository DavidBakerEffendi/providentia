Pat's doesn't need a review.  Its cheese steaks speak for themselves.  Pat's steaks are responsible for creating an iconic food native to Philadelphia that has been mimicked (unsuccessfully) everywhere in the world.  It is truly an original. If you've never gone there, go.  If you've been there, keep on keepin' the faith.  Pat's is a tradition that hopefully will outlive us all...and if you eat enough cheese steak, that might not be such a long time.
