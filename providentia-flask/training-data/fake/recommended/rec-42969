NYE with my sister and she wanted soul food so we trekked on over to Amy Ruth's... No table wait at 10pm on NYE??? Sweet! The service was super fast despite it being a few hours before midnight. The staff friendly and eager to serve our requests. My sister being more ambitious than I ordered the chicken wings, yams and mac n' cheese. I nibbled a bit off everything she had and it was all amazing. I ordered the waffle with strawberry topping. It was fluffy, warm and filling! Maybe a little food coma inducing. Nice dinner before hitting the town for celebrations...
