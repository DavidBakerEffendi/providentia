Basically, I love Mamas. I go there as often as possible. They make the best falafel you'll ever eat. They are quick as well. Their fries are also amazing. As well as their free bananas and free salt water taffies :P I usually get my falafel with a slice of eggplant inside and amba! Don't forget the amba! Some might say I'm a Mamas boy.
