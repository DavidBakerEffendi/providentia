This is hands down my favorite place to eat in Williamsburg.  The food is always good, no matter what item is ordered from the menu.  Whenever I have friends or family in from out of town, I take them here.  It's a casual place, but you can scale it up; no one judges you on what you wear.  It can be a relaxed hang out spot or a good place for a date.   While all of the staff is great, I always try to be seated with Alejandra (straight dark hair), and my roommate and I sit at the bar in particular if she's working there.  She's very attentive and friendly without being overbearing.  I trust her and feel at ease, and I normally avoid talking to waiting staff in general simply because I'm shy.
