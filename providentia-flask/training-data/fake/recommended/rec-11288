I've already given this place a five star review but I def think it's worth amending my original review for one specific dish....brussel sprouts spaetzle with bacon....I could eat it all day everyday with no complaint. SUPER SUPER YUMMYTOWN. It was my first time going in the uber cold winter months and it's definitely a fight for indoor seating, but if you go with a group it's worth a shot to sit outside around one of three fire pits. Still one of my favorite spots in the city for delic food and beer with a downright fun atmosphere.
