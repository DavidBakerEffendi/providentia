Living in Hell's Kitchen, there are so many Thai restaurants to choose from, but Room Service is by far my favorite. They're a bit more expensive than some of the others, but their food and ambiance is worth it.  They give large portions and I almost always have leftovers for lunch.  I've been here many times, but recently I had the panang curry (with tofu) and it was delicious.  I love spicy food and they made it with the perfect amount of spice.  I've had the pad thai here before too, and that was also great. Whether your order take-out or dine-in, you won't be disappointed!
