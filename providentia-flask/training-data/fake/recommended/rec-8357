Totally disappointed ...I went here for my birthday with a few friends...we were all less than impressed. I had the chicken biscuit...the biscuit was great...the fried chicken cutlet was ok ..nothing special ..mac and cheese ..meh....I've had better at KFC..I hated the potato salad..and the sweet tea wasnt sweet enough..This place needs to put more seasoning on their food..everything was bland...I had high expectations from all the rave reviews.....I would have preferred to go elsewhere for my birthday..
