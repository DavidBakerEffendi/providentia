Hidden gem near Tompkins Square Park. Being right down the block from Crif Dogs, it's tough to compete with their traffic and popularity. I ordered the Pulled Pork Platos Platter as I'm doing the paleo thing right now. Platos, for those that don't know and I didn't know prior to tonight, includes all quesadilla ingredients minus the tortilla. Served in a big ass bowl, I got corn, brown rice, black beans, salsa, guacamole, shredded cheese and that tender pulled pork. If that wasn't enough, I had to throw on 2 servings of the Tequila Chipotle Mayo sauce. Just like my theory that everything is better with bacon or being heated up, anything with Chipotle Mayo on it is 77 times better. Â  Very good. I'm stuffed right now and wish I could stumble back for more. You could tell the pork was of good quality and the guac was fresh and, most likely, made with top notch ingredients. I'll be back and already told the roomies about the next great East Village Mexican joint.
