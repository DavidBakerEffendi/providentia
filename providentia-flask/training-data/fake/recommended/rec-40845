This place has very high prices for their dry overcooked steaks. I have had better steak at charlie brown's. The atmosphere is nice but everything else sucks. The place is also very busy with a long wait. I don't know how this place gets as much business because everything is over priced for low quality food the waiters were ok but could be much much better. I miss South City Prime the steak and service was impeccable. How this place stayed open is beyond me.
