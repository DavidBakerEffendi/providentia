Consistently lovely, this is one of my favorite neighborhood haunts with great scones and muffins for breakfast, a good spread of options for a soulful brunch, nice sandwiches/soups/salads for lunch, and a super sweet seasonal dinner menu. From late Winter through Spring I've been having a bimonthly craving for Cheryl's fish soup. I always love what she does with pork. She's around most nights and is very friendly and welcoming. I haven't had a chance to try all of her scones, but the one's I've tasted are deeeelicious (particularly the ginger) and I do love her homemade ginger ale.
