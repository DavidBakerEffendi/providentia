Came here today with super high expectations for two reasons- 1. Five stars on Yelp 2. The claim to have the best biscuits in NYC.  Well, I left underwhelmed and disappointed.  The biscuits are terrible. Dry, hard, tasteless  and butter-less. I'm not sure how or why these biscuits are considered delicious. I also left hungry. The chicken biscuit sandwich was way too small. There's nothing worse than leaving a restaurant still hungry after you finished your meal.  My date shared the same sentiments. He ordered a chicken biscuit and the open faced turkey sandwich. On the upside, I did enjoy the fried okra and the chicken on my biscuit was well seasoned and juicy. Also, our waiter and the young lady at the front of the house were welcoming and attentive. Unfortunately, I don't have any plans to return and most definitely not for the biscuits.
