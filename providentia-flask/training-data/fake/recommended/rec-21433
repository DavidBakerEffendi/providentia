Excellent food, my friends and I are regulars here for breakfast lunch and dinner! Tonight I got the soup de jour, an Indian stew with seasonal veggies. It was delicious; fragrant, spicy and well balanced. The calamari app was great too- served with a homemade dipping sauce and fried jalape√±os! Delish. The bloody Marie's are to die for. I take all my good friends here, and they are never disappointed with the excellent food, quirky atmosphere and welcoming service. Always a 5/5 in my books.
