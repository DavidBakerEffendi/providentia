A friend recommended Denino's to my family and we decided to try it out. It took awhile to find parking because the parking lot is really small and the streets are packed but we got lucky and someone pulled out after a few minutes. You have to wait to be seated but there are benches outside next to a few video games and an ATM machine which you will need because they only take cash. No credit cards. When I went it was pretty crowded but we were seated after 10 minutes but my family waited almost an hour for our 2 pizza pies hence the 1 minus star. The pizza itself was really good! Thin pizza slices with delicious sauce and a buttery crust. It wasn't as doughy as other pizza's so you don't fill up so fast. It's a good size family restaurant with brown and white decor and lots of black white pictures of Staten Island and the Verrazano bridge. Â For $13 a pie, the prices are not too bad.
