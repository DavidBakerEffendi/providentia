We went here after reading some good reviews and looking for a place on the UES for Italian. Nice place. Cosy and welcoming. Bartender makes a perfect martini. Our dinner was very good. We had a seafood brodo and a pasta dish. Both really good. Would definitely go back. The neighborhood seems to like it also as it was packed on a Wednesday night. Nice service as well.
