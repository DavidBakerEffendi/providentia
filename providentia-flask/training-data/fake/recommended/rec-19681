Love! Vegetarian heaven. Franklin Avenue heaven. Guacamole heaven. Sure, you have to squish into a table, and your stomach will be three sizes bigger when you exit, but this is awesomely priced, gigantic portions of delicious food. The vegetarian platter was a delicious make-your-own dream for $12 -- and the grilled corn was lime-drizzled and awesome. Service was friendly and pretty fast. Look for me frozen awkwardly on the street, painfully torn between my cravings for Gueros and Chavela's.
