One of the best places to get pizza in New York. The crust is fresh and they use the perfect amount of spices and oil to make the pizza perfect. Whether you pick it up, get it delivered or eat it there are will not be disappointed. Personal favorite for a simple treat: Prince Perfection SoHo Square. Will definitely continue to go here for years to come!
