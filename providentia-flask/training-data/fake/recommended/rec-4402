Pretty good overall.  I had to wait a while for a table (a little over half an hour).  Not a huge deal, and granted it was a Friday night, but the place is a little cramped and there's nowhere to really stand out of the way of the servers going back and forth unless you're sitting at the bar.  I put my name on the wait list, but another couple had come in and my table was given away because whoever sat them failed to check the list.  But the bartender was apologetic and said my next beer was on the house.   On to the food.  I ordered the Shame Burger: 8oz burger with a big slice of fried scrapple, cheese, and a fried egg on top.  Delicious.  The scrapple was an interesting taste with the burger.  I felt a bit gluttonous eating it, especially since my friend only ordered the mac and cheese, but hey, when in Rome.  I had to take it apart and cut it in half, but with a little squishing I was able to make it more manageable.  Pretty decent beer selection.  Kenzinger was on special during the sixers game, but kicked before the game ended.  I tried a couple cocktails as well, the SNAPhattan and the Absinthe-tea, both of which were strong and tasty.   Our server was very nice and personable as well. I used a LivingSocial coupon to cover most of my check, otherwise I probably wouldn't have sprung for the two cocktails (which were $8 and $10 apiece).  I would definitely come back again, probably during happy hour or a game when they have drink/wing deals going on.  Maybe if I'm feeling strong I may come back one day and attempt the Shame Challenge, now that I know my enemy a little better... Bathrooms are downstairs, but so is the kitchen, so be careful not to crash into a server on the narrow staircase.
