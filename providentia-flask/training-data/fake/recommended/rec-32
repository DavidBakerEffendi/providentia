One of the best italian sausages I've ever had. Â Tommy Dinic's is a staple in reading terminal market. The line was really long but they have a great system that makes the wait pretty short. The sausage itself was cooked perfectly and had great flavor, but the peppers were what really impressed me. Most places just serve them up out of a jar, but at Dinic's, you get the impression that they knew the peppers were part of the experience. Tommy Dinic's is well worth a visit.
