This is a wonderful experience. I love this place so much, absolutely a great place for brunch. We arrived here before 11 a.m,there was already a lot of people waiting outside. Highly recommend make reservation before go there. We ordered French Toast, Jane Egg Benedict, fantastic! Â Fresh, flavor, just perfect.
