Ivy is a nice little lounge that I went to for the first time last weekend. I went on a Saturday at 5pm, so it wasn't too crowded and seemed really spacious. They have happy hour specials everyday (until about 7 or 8) including weekends that are not on a menu, and the waiter didn't mention until we asked. There are some great choices- I got the pomegranate cosmo, and my friend got a cucumber/lemon drink. They were both $6, so it was a great deal. As for food, one of my friends got the sliders with fries, which was so average that I don't even have anything to say about them. My other friend got the polenta fries which were amazing. The menu has a nice variety, and is very affordable. I liked how the lounge has huge windows that they open when it's nice out, and the ambiance is pretty nice. However, our table for 3 people was so small that I kept on worrying about knocking something over. Also, our friend wanted ketchup for her polenta fries and it took about 15 minutes for a waitress to come by, and then another 5 minutes to actually get it. I might come back if I'm in the area, but I probably wouldn't seek out this place again.
