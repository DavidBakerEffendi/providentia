This place is beyond AMAZING! I actually heard about it from the email I got from Scoutmob and after checking out the other reviews I decided with a 50% off I should give it a shot. I ordered a Mighty Mushroom (six grain rice, enoki, shiitake, tofu and aragula) and a Nutty Buddy wrap. Both were sooooo delicious! I didn't quite taste the peanut butter on the wrap, which I was looking forward to (obsessed with) but it was nevertheless to die for. I took them to go and each came with a different sauce that you can squeeze on to the roll/wrap. I am not sure what they were but they were pretty good. Like others have mentioned the place is really small, more of a to go place than sit down. Can't wait to try the other items!
