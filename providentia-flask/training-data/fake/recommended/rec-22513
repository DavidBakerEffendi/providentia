Great little secret spot on a beautiful street. The atmosphere is really nice (think European cafe/bistro) and relaxing. Big windows let in lots of sunlight so it's cheery and sunny. I went for lunch for the first time and had the spanish style summer vegetable stew. The owner was sweet and served it cold at my request because it was such a hot day. It was so good and only $5.99! I heard the chef telling customers that he makes the pasta fresh from scratch and it sounded delicious and healthy. Lots of seasonal fresh vegetables were on the menu too. Seemed like a good balance of vegetarian, meat, and fish options. They have beer and wine too! I agree with other reviewers to just be patient and go for a relaxing meal or coffee. It's not a rushed place but it's such a nice place to sit that it's no problem. I can't wait to go back for dinner and brunch. This is just what the neighborhood needed.
