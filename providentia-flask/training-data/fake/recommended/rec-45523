Delicious, inexpensive Mexican food. I got the carnitas cemitas, which is a lot like a torta. It's a sandwich on sesame bread with pulled pork (carnitas), avocado, refried beans, and queso fresco. SO good. Everyone else in my group got tacos, which also looked really good. I'd definitely go back. It's legit. You can bring your own alcohol to mix with their fresh margarita mix.
