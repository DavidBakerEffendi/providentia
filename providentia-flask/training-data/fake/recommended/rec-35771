Hyped up.  Worst service I ever got in any restaurant. Ordered 5 tapas, got the first one after an hour. Ordered wine, got the first glass after 40 minutes. Ate the first dish, waited 10 more minutes. Nothing came. Canceled the remaining orders and left. The first and only dish had was sliced chorizo, so can't really comment on the food. Details: Had reservation at 9:15pm (look for the Basque name - yes Basque - we were favorably disposed to being with!). Came in at 9pm. First chorizo at 9:55pm. Server: William. Manager: Pete. The manager tried to make up, but the evening was screwed up by Williams anyway. It would not have made us happy even if Jose Garces  himself came and cooked us a free meal. We appreciated Pete's symathy, but no thanks. The nice thing about Philly is we don't have to put up with crap from any restaurant. We ended up walking two blocks to Tria where they welcomed us with open arms.
