I have been going to this restaurant since I was a baby. And we keep coming back because of great service, food and atmosphere. When you walk in, no matter how busy it is, you will be greeted by someone. And if it's that full, there is a full bar, for some drinks while your waiting. When you sit down, you'll get the best bread you'll ever have. It's amazing. My family loves the dumplings for an appetizer. And for dinner, I love Ethel's famous roast pork. It actually melts in your mouth. And the mashed potatoes and pumpkin on the side are to die for, and I don't even really like pumpkin. The staff is great, and they are super cool and funny. They actually talk to you, not just take your order and walk away. And because my family goes there so often, I got the inside look at the kitchen and the wine cellar. The kitchen is controlled chaos, which is cool. And even though I'm too young to drink, I went down to the wine cellar. It's humongous. That's why Park and Orchard has a lot of awards for their wine list. I love this place, and I think you will too! :)
