So, I've been to St. Anselm several times now. There's always a wait, but we got lucky tonight, due to the Labor Day exodus.  Tonight, the clams special (littlenecks) was PERECT.  Nice and bright and briny...  the spinach gratin is amazing, as always.  the pot de creme is my favorite dessert in the city.  i wish people would go out of town more often to make the wait less arduous.  I 100% recommend this place.  Love.
