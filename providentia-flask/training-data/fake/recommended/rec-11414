Awesome place!!!   Although my girl friend just moved away from the neighborhood, we'll have to venture back.  Good beer selections and amazing food.  Suicide rings are far the best onion rings I've had ( I like thin rings).  Their wings are top notch too.  And you must try the mac & cheese with asparagus and pesto, so unbelievably delicious!
