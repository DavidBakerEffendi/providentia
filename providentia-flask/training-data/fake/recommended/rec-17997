In a word: Overrated. The ambiance feels like a subdued, conservative 80's hotel. The service was rough around the edges; although our server was nice, he was nervous, seemed overworked and made a number of errors. He also talked to us like we were his school buddies. For this price point and type of dining, the service should be much more professional and precise.   The food is generally flavorful, the plating is enticing, but my prix fixe menu felt repetitious, and at times forced. The root vegetable appetizer was tasteless, but the foie gras truffle was perhaps the best and most innovative item on the menu. Juni is not on par with the finest restaurants in NYC for food, service, or ambiance.  We did not enjoy our dinner enough to plan return visit.
