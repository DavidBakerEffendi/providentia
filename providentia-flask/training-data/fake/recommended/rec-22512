Full disclosure:  I have a bit of a proprietary affection for this place.  We had our wedding in this space before Applewood, before Blah Blah lounge. We've always been happy with the food here.  This time got the pickled beet salad and the roast duck.  Service has generally been fine.  There is no doubt that they care about the quality of their food. We try to get here on our anniversary.  It IS tough to get a reservation, it's a pretty small place, and they tend to do their seatings at particular hours.  I reserved for a Thursday evening and paid the price with a 5 PM reservation.  The room did fill up during dinner, which points out my only real objection.  Small full room, tin ceiling=not quiet.  My hearing ain't too good.  Maybe the early reservation wasn't a bad idea after all.
