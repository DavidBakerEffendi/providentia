I can't say enough about how great the staff is here. I am a huge fan of the bar, but the dining room area is great, too. I love that I can go to Flatbread with pretty much any group of friends, no matter what their food or drink inclinations are, and we'll all end up happy. Beer aficionados love the taps. I like that they have a nice selection of whiskeys at reasonable prices. Vegetarians and meat-eaters alike can find plenty to choose from on the menu. The price is right. And, as I said, the service is excellent.
