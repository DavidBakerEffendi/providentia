This place is really, really awesome. It was pretty packed when I got there around the dinner rush on a Wednesday night, but luckily the hostess was so friendly and welcoming. Also, I really love that they text you that your table is ready- this allowed for me and my friends to explore the Lower East Side as we waited (about 30 minutes). Once we sat down, it felt like a small community of people who enjoy meatballs since we all sat on one long table with other guests. My friends and I ordered a pitcher of the Bitches Brew which was super delicious and refreshing. Hit the spot before I even started eating. I personally ordered their sub (comes with 3 meatballs- I forget the name). The sub was amazing- the meatballs were juicy, the sauce was full of flavor, and the cheese was super fresh. Honestly the cheese was my favorite part because I am such a snob when it comes to mozzarella and this was the best I've ever tasted. The sub came with a side salad, which for my tastes was a little bland, but my two friends LOVED it. If you are ever in town, I highly suggest checking this place out. Its worth the wait.
