This place gets super crowded so I would suggest making reservations. My coworker rants and raves about this place because of their veggie burgers. I've had it before and to me its good however, not super special. It comes with a choice of fries or coleslaw. The fries are super tiny, they looked like potatoes that went through a cheese grater. Very good. I ordered the burger and it was delicious, the bun is HUGE so I did not eat the top part but I ate the rest. I was just puzzled by the prices of the entree. Mostly $20-$45?? Why so much????? Maybe trying too hard to be extremely high class. Fine .. Service was good, and ambiance is nice with mostly booths. Extremely midtown-ish style with after work crowd. I think my coworker consumed 32947485745834839 grams of carbohydrates with her order though....
