Pates, je t'aime!! This unpresuming little restaurant sits on a quiet corner of Williamsburg, a few blocks removed from any of the hustle and bustle of Bedford and Metropolitan. After dinner here I left gushing over this place, which was so cozy I felt like I was sitting in a French friend's apartment. The waitresses (all French) were very sweet, and their menu of sweet and savory crepes was long and provoked major indecision on my part (because everything sounded delicious -- and everything I ordered certainly was). The dining experience here might be different when it's crowded. I went on a weeknight after 9pm and we nearly had the place to ourselves, which only added to its charm. I will be back soon!
