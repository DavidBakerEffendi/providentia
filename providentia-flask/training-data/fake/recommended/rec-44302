The only ppl who like this must be from the tri state area or New England. I grew up on Gordos in San Francisco which this is an open copy of (from the font on the menu to the layout...basically everything).I get that these r New York prices for relatively fresh food, but a regular burrito is really skimpy on the meat and veggies and heavy on the carbs and fillers... In short, if you think chipotle is gourmet Mexican food ull think this is good, though u won't get as much food for ur dollar. If you grew up eating Mexican food ull be disappointed and want ur money back.
