I took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner last night.  I had ordered a cake from Termini Bros. with an inscription, so I called ahead to see if they would serve it after dinner as a surprise.  They were completely gracious and accomodating about it, and I was able to drop off the cake at my convenience. We were seated promptly at a large table (well, 2 pushed together), andour Amarone was opened for us right away.  Bread (good, but could be better) came with olive oil and a bit of ricotta.  My man had a very yummy special gnocchi appetizer and I had the prosciutto salad, which was excellent, if a bit small.  Dinner was a grilled chicken dish (tasty, but a bit stingy on the portion), and I had the special spagetti fra diablo with scallops, which was just perfect.  Service by David (?) was super friendly and attentive but unintrusive.  The cake was presented with candles after dinner, and we ended up sharing it with the kitchen and a few other patrons, which seemed to make everyone happy. :)  We hung out and chatted over cappucino with some girls who were English soccer fans, which was cool for my Brit boyfriend (Go Arsenal!).  All in all, it was a perfectly lovely evening, and Porcini made his birthday special.  Thanks guys!
