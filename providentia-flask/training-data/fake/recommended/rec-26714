I was really looking forward to a whole roasted pig sandwich with roasted peppers and good provolone cheese.  What a major disappointment.  I do have to say that the staff was exceptionally friendly, but the food fell sadly short.  Why bother to go to the trouble of actually roasting a pig when you're not going to season it, and you're going to cook it until it's dry?  Even with the au jus that they put on it, the meat was still bone dry.  All the jus just made the bread soggy.  Not to mention, they were out of cracklings, served me seeded bread when I ordered plain (in writing), and the roasted peppers were *green* and still had a significant amount of skin attached...not at all the flavorful red roasted peppers you can expect in a place that really knows about food.  Even the provolone didn't have much flavor, although maybe I'm spoiled by places that actually serve good sharp provolone on their sandwiches...and for less $.
