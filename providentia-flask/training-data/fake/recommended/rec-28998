We went for dinner, and the place was pretty empty...guess most folks like their sandwiches at lunch.  Hubby ordered the Barnyard, and I had the Village Turkey.  We would've ordered the sandwiches on multi-grain bread, but we saw that option too late.  We also ordered a side of their fries.  The sandwiches were filled with a good amount of tender meat, and the sauces were flavorful, but their standard white bread was kinda thick with a chewy crust.  We both thought the bread overwhelmed our sandwich innards, and I actually wished that they had a Potbelly's "skinny" option where some of the bread could be scooped out.  Aside from that, the sandwiches were tasty and the fries...the fries were delicious!  Perfectly fried and crispy.  I'd give them three and a half stars, but three is too low so I'm giving Jake's the benefit of the doubt with four stars.  Fun ambiance and friendly service.
