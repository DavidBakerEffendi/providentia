This place is great! I love Pure Fare, their other restaurant, so I had high hopes. Like Pure Fare, Agno is entirely gluten free and very vegetarian/vegan friendly. The food was really fresh, reasonably priced for what you received (I always expect to pay a little more for organic) and very tastey. I'll definitely be coming here a lot!
