I still dream of the French toast, and that was months ago that I ate there. Good lord. And now that I've been back, I can say that those were unbelievable blueberry pancakes and, while I didn't have a cocktail, I could see plainly that Aaron was a knowledgable and attentive bartender. I don't think that a Manhattan would have gone well with the pancakes, but I'll be back soon to see what he can do with one. He also had a knack for knowing exactly when I was going to want more coffee. I was very impressed.
