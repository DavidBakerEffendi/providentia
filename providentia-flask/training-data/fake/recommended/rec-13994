Ha! NO WAIT! Came in on Sunday around 1pm-ish for brunch (ehh, lunch!) and walked right to the bar, grabbed seats, and we each ordered a fresh pint of their milk chocolate stout! YUM! A bit surprised with the decent selection of beer on tap! Just had to get the Original and the Truffle burgers, a side of fried pickles and regular fries. Everything came out in less than 10mins - burger patties medium rare - check! French Fries strings long and crisp - check! Fried pickles - delish but some may say lacks a bit of actual pickling. I'm just a fan of fried pickles in any form, so didn't mind it. The Original was juicy and tender, could really taste the mushrooms, and the truffle patty, well, you guessed it. Then...it's all about the buns...and the buns held up well! Look, for the price point and the fact that we didn't have to wait in line, the service was also a breeze, we were thoroughly satisfied and would definitely return. Was the burger Ah-mazing? It was excellent (and surprisingly light) but not the best I've ever had. Having said that, for $12 a pop, this is definitely one of the best in this price range in the city.
