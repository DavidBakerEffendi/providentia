This is a way late review but I had dinner at Meritage one evening during restaurant week.  I was excited to try it, after it had been reopened with the new chef and I had read a lot of great things about it.  I liked that they offered the option of ordering off the prix-fixe or the a la cart menus-- it gave a lot of flexibility.  While I'm not a wine drinker, their list was extensive and my dining partners enjoyed that. HOWEVER my main issues were that the server was not very helpful at all, and their restaurant week menu was lacking for vegetarians.   Our server and one other served the tables in the back dining area.  The other explained the menu, the options, helped their diners decide what wine they wanted based on a description of their likes, and was a lot more conversant.  I don't know if our server was nervous or not a people person but the difference was drastic and clear. The vegetarian options on the prix-fixe menu were: mushroom soup, and mushroom risotto.  Aside from mushrooms and risottos being the easy way out for vegetarian dishes, the combination was not very considerate.  The a la carte menu had more to offer, but I do not think that was fair. Overall my experience there was pretty disappointing, but I'm glad I gave it a try. Also a Kenzinger was like $5 which was crazy but not that bad.
