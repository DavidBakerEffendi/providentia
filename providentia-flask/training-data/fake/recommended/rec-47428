Quick: Food great, but Service will ruin your experience. I haven't reviewed something in years, but I've been compelled to write this post. Let me tell you, I've eaten here 10+ times since the establish has opened. I live in the neighborhood, and even know some of the waitresses by name.  I am a late 20's something, and appreciate good food every now and then for special occasions.   The Details are as follows:  Last week my friend and I came here to share some plates.  I raved about how fantastic the food was, the food is simply amazing -its true.  Prepared effortlessly and probably the reason I would ever go back. However, as mentioned in a few posts there is a male French Maitre'd/Manager that is employed at Print who gave us the most upsetting experience.  How is his rudeness accepted there?  He repeatedly gave us dirty looks as we sat at the bar, and shook his head and walked away from us.  We had just spent $$$x2, and our delightful experience was completely ruined by this employee. I keep asking myself if I will return :(
