I think I'm in love... ...with a pasta dish. The gnocchi at ilili was without a doubt, one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had in my life. Moreover, this whole dinner was--dare I say--one of the best I've ever had in NYC from start to finish. We started with drinks in the lounge (they have an amazing happy hour) and all of the drinks we had were perfect. (Our waitress though wasn't the friendliest, but it wasn't that big of a deal.) 8 of us did the restaurant week menu (as is required) and I don't think there was anything that we tried that was less than AMAZING. Also, as soon as we sat down, our waitress bought us over a tasting of their featured cocktail of the week, which was not only a nice touch, but was fantastic tasting as well. We probably ordered close to everything on the menu, but besides the GNOCCHI, which I'm still dreaming of, the Arnabeet Mekle (I've never tasted anything like the sauce this was prepared in) and Moujadara were my favorites. The dishes are all made for sharing, so they come out as they are prepared, with a basket of delicious, piping-hot pita. The desserts were equally outstanding as well--the majority of us had the candy bar--and while I left so stuffed I could barely move and/or form complete sentences I can't wait to come back. This has to be my new favorite restaurant and I can't say enough awesome things about it.
