Went there on Wednesday, 5/13, at 5:45pm. It was empty, and we got perfect seats at the bar. Good atmosphere, no frills, music was at a apropos level. In about half an hour the place was mayhem. I personally think the cheap $2.50 beer on tap was watered down because I drank a lot (6 beers?) and barely got a buzz, which is almost impossible for me. I ate my burger on the way home. Amazing!!!!
