Ok, so its my second time at the resturant. The first time I went the weather was amazing so I got to enjoy the weather so I sat in the patio and its very nice.  Yes ,I had the pad tai, it was great basically perfect. Today, I had the chicken with pineapple and cashew. It started good but for some reason it bacame cold in about 3 min after it was served.  I would recommend this place and will return. Only thing I have to say on my first visit I had to wave the waiter down to place an order, get a refill etc. Today it was much more pleasent. Check it out!
