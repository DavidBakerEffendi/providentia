4/29/14 - Updating my review to 5 stars...cuz when I have a choice I rarely want to go anywhere else for weekend breakfast out (with the exception of the occasional dim sum excursion). Found this out when to my dismay they were closed on Easter Sunday. I had been craving RPH all week! Â Current favorites are the whole wheat challah french toast, Irish eggs benedict (the corned beef hash is the real deal here), and the breakfast quesadilla (eggs, cheese, chorizo, guac, salsa) which is a relatively new menu item. ************** This is our favorite Sunday breakfast joint. The corned beef hash is *FRESH* and dee-licious. Chunks of corned beef and perfectly-made potatoes. The regular home fries are also tasty; they are well-seasoned potato-wedge style home fries. While my kids gobble up the silver dollar pancakes, I always enjoy trying their specialty pancakes, which are always very good - corn cakes were fluffy and flavorful and while the Red Velvet pancakes sounded like a good idea when I ordered them...it was slightly more gluttonous than breakfast should be, even for a glutton like myself! It was good going down (chocolately, with something that tasted like vanilla frosting on top), but I felt gross afterward! The pumpkin pancakes were pretty decent too - even better if you order a side of pecans to accompany them. The Rutherford Pancake House has a family-owned feel to it. The wait staff is usually very friendly and the service is reasonable considering how busy they can get. On Sundays, try to arrive before 10 to beat the after-church crowd.
