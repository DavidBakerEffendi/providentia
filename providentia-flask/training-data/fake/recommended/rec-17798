I went to SuzyQue's for the first time last night on a Friday night. It was not full or busy at all. The place has parking and its quaint. There was live entertainment and the music was good. We made reservations because we got the deal from Groupon( a meal for 2 people include wine for $32.00) It was definitely worth it because we each ordered the BBQ platter(value is $26) The amount of food was great. I didn't even finish my platter. I had calamari as an appetizer and the sauce for it was great. For the amount paid, they could have given more calamari. The quality of the entree food could have been better. They had 4 different types of sauces to use on the BBQ Â food and I only liked one as did my friends. I am not sure if I would eat there again but the ambiance was great. The service was good and on point.They have karaoke, a bar and different rooms for large groups. I would suggest to them to work on the presentation of the food and to season it better. I'm glad I did the deal off of groupon because without it, the bill could have been higher. With some work, they could be much much better. I like trying different places to eat but I could have went to Delta's in News Brunswick or Dallas BBQ in New York and gotten wayyyyy better food for the amount SuzyQue was charging.
