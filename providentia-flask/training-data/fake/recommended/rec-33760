I threw a surprise birthday party here for a party of 15 and it went fabulously! There was lots of space and we had a nice area just to ourselves. Everyone was very accommodating and the food was excellent! They even brought out sparkler bday candles on top of the best baklava I've had! I highly recommend this place for a unique and fun occasion!
