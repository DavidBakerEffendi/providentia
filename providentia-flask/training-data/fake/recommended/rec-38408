The food at Sandra's is fantastic -- I definitely recommend the BBQ ribs, fried plantains, macaroni and cheese, and candied yams. Their sweet tea is (as advertised) very sweet, but the flavor is excellent and the portion is enough for 2 to share. The service is also great: Sandra herself comes out to greet every table, and both the waitress and the busboy were friendly and helpful. My only complaint would be that they automatically added a 20% tip and tried to make us tip an extra time. Bottom line: would return for the food and great service.
