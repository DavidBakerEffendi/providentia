Hello amigos! Mezcal is a muy bueno choice  for Mexican dinner. Get the good seat by the entrance, under the mason jar lamps, it's the lucky spot!  The green salsa with chips is good, but we were also treated to a smoky brown salsa that is not always available. Ask for it-sorry I don't have the name-but it tasted like roasted chilis.  Also, they have a decent chili relleno, which is very hard to find, and literally is the awesome sauce!  The carnitas, burritos, enchiladas, and tostadas my friends had all looked good and received compliments. Now that I'm sold, next time it's you and me, mole'! (Sing to ole' ol-ole')!!Mole'! Mole'! Mole'!  Mole'! Moollllee'
