drove all the way from the "bronx" new york to try this place out. should have read the reviews first. whenever there are negative reviews, the food or place is usually lousy. thank-god there was no line. had no clue that you had to order a sandwich at one window and go the a different one to purchase a drink. the woman at the front counter was nasty. paid $9.00. for a couple of slices of dry, fatty, tasteless beef..the bread and onions were no bargain as well..knew that 'adam" of "man vs. fool" would not know anything about food unless it hit him in the back of his head. would never go back nor recommend..how to people rave about places like this?? moreover, stay in business?? had better cheese steaks ay ny local diner, parx racetrack and atlantic city. was very, very dissapointed.. would never go back..awful...a big double two thumbs down.. this is "a review you can trust!" did enjoy the neighborhood and decor of the place..felt like I was back in the bronx, brooklyn or downtown manhattan. next time, will try pat's and spend the day walking around the streets of south philly! = )
