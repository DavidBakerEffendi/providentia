I haven't written this review yet because I was still too overwhelmed by how incredible my meal was here. This quaint unassuming little restaurant has everything you could want and more. I have no complaints. Lets start with the wine list. Very reasonably priced, and I recommend you go for their house wine, you can't go wrong. It isn't a powerful punch you in the face California Cab, but it is the perfect dinner wine to complement most things on the menu. The portions here are generous (and again, very reasonably priced) so don't make the mistake of over ordering like we did (although I was super excited about leftovers for work the next day). Our choices were the beef carpaccio, the prosciutto and mozzarella made in-house, the veal ravioli (holy heaven of heavens), and the anchovy pasta with walnuts. Everything was fresh, simple, not overdone with sauce or too many ingredients, everything that was on the plate was supposed to be there, and it was perfect. Service was very thoughtful and friendly here too. Great dining experience overall.
