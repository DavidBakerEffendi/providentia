I went here after reading some other reviews and thought I should check it out since my guy loves burgers (and i'm tired of eating at Five Guys). The burgers were okay, nothing special. However, I did absolutely LOVE the fact that they could put the guac on it for less than a dollar extra, which did enhance the taste of it. Their garlic parmesan fries were good, but they give you such a small portion for $4.25. Not impressed at all. It's a small location, with two small tables outside. On some days they have late hours which is probably the best characteristic of the place. Its worth a visit if you're already in the city walking around or running errands. Don't drive there and pay for parking just to go there. Feel me?
