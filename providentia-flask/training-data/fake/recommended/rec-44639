We had an outstanding experience at Perilla.  Being Top Chef fans, we were excited to try Harold's food and we weren't disappointed.  The ambiance was great, our server was awesome and the food!  For appetizers we had the Spicy Duck Meatballs and the Cured Berkshire Pork Loin.  Both were wonderful.  My son thought the Pork Loin was the best thing he's ever eaten!  For Dinner we had the Hangar Steak (tender and delicious) and the Duck Breast (so good!).  Dessert was the Ricotta cake and Butternut Squash Custard.  The Ricotta Cake was good, but the Butternut Squash Custard was amazing.  Can't forget to mention our cocktails; I had the Perilla 75, which was refreshing and tasty.  My son had the Smoke Signal and I think his exact words were 'the world needs to know that this drink exists'. Overall fantastic dining experience.
