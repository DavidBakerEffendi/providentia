Very high quality sandwich shop, specializing in Italian-style subs, except Godzilla-sized and pretty delicious.  DeFonte's is very hard to find, as in smack-in-the-middle-of-nowhere-hard, but it seems to always be busy, especially around lunch time which speaks volumes about the value for the money. Speaking of which, a full-sized sandwich is equal to nearly two sandwiches almost anywhere else and costs almost as much as two sandwiches as well.  Seriously, a full sandwich here will make a Subway's footlong look like a kid's meal and in comparison, taste like a McDonald's burger tastes in relation to a real hamburger. I was too chicken to try out the eggs and potato sandwich that everyone raves about but my next trip will definitely see me holding one of those bad boys. This place is strictly take-out, so don't go expecting table service.  Order at the counter, pay for it and go.  Since you'd probably be driving, I'd suggest hitting the wharf at the near-by Fairway on the other end of Red Hook.  They have some nice tables by the water that you can sit at as long as you're shopping there as well; I'd suggest a nice peach for dessert. If you're really into sandwiches or just want to discover what a truly excellent sandwich is please do yourself a favor and go find DeFonte's.  You won't be disappointed.
