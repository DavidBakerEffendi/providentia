If you want boring old-fashioned food served to you in an upscale TGI-Fridays atmosphere, eat dinner at Rye. The staff are friendly, but the fake old-timey schtick is about as fresh as the Yo Ho Ho song on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and the food is heavy and boring. It's just meat and butter on top of meat and some buttery vegetables. However, the bartender was very knowledgable and made some very stiff, interesting cocktails based on a conversation about what I was looking for. I'd stop in again for a drink or three, but I wouldn't bother with the food.
