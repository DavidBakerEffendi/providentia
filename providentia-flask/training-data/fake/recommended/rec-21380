I am so thankful that frankford hall is walking distance because I always bring my guests over here for beers! The atmosphere is so fun. You can sit by a firepit, hang out at a picnic table with their homemade Jenga games, play fooseball, watch TV...I could go on and on. The beer selection is great and I think it's pretty affordable- especially when you get the full liter! I couldn't believe they had Docs hard pumpkin cider in October. I have been looking for it in stores but I don't even think it's sold commercially in PA or south Jersey. The crowd is pretty varied. I would agree that there are a lot of college frat boys but I've always seen a lot of diversity.
