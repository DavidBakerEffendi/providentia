My husband and I went here last night. Our server Hassim was kind, welcoming and made our experience wonderful. My husband and I had a nice little section of our own secluded from everyone else in the restaurant. The atmosphere was cozy and comfortable, the music was beautiful and not at all obnoxious. The best part of course was the food. 7 courses for two people only at$60 was not bad at all! Especially given that the quality was excellent and halal! By the second course we were stuffed, but the food kept coming, and every dish was better than the last. It was a great dining experience for us, as we don't get out too much. We will be back and encourage people to try it out.Even if you go on a night when were aren't belly dancers, it will still be a great time. Hassim bagged our left overs. I'm writing this review and now that i think about it, i cant wait to get home and finish my food, unless my husband already ate the rest -__-
