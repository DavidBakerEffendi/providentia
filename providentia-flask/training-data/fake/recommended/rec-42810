I LOVE this place. Love it like I love a puppy, or a breezy sunday afternoon. Or money. The entrance is, as everyone has pointed out so needlessly, a fortune teller shop. I thought it was fun. We were seated right away, and I ordered a Ginger Smash. My "special friend" ordered a Billionaires cocktail. Â I thought it was ironic, since she's basically broke all the time. Overcompensating much... but thats another story. We ordered the bone marrow poppers and the steak tartare. The food is nothing short of amazing. Surprising, for a speakeasy. The steak tartare in particular, prepared table side, made as spicy or as mild as you choose. It reminded me of France, and how I've never been there. The bone marrow poppers were incredible. So much so we ordered a second serving, so we wouldn't have to go all Hunger Games to share them. My ginger smash was gingery and smashing. Really. Just the right ammount of gin (a bucketload). My friend's Billionaire Cocktail was good, but not worth a billion dollars. The fifteen bucks we paid for it was already pushing it. On the overall, best speakeasy in town. A must if you have annoying guests in town who want to be amazed by New York. As if their town could do better.
