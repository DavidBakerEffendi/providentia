I work nearby and often saw the long line, but bypassed this place for quicker options, until one day when halal was the only thing I felt like having for lunch and I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed in the least. Waiting in long lines has become far less mundane since the advent of smart phones. I barely made a dent in my twitter feed before it was my turn. I asked the lady in front of me if she'd been there before and she said she was pretty much an addict, so I just ordered what she was having, a chicken/lamb combo sandwich. Took it back to the office and moaned all the way through it, it was that good. That hot sauce is no joke. You can tell it's no joke by the lilliputian size of the container it comes in. I could not have handled more than what they gave me. The white sauce is definitely some of the best I've ever had. I'll be stopping by again on a nice day when I'm behind on checking my twitter.
