i checked out jadis this past monday night -- a rainy night... it was pretty empty (i was there from about 8-12), but i'm sure the weather was a factor.  overall, nice place. low lighting, friendly and down-to-earth service, decent wine selection, reasonable prices, excellent cheese plate: we tried the camembert, pierre robert, manchego, and blue cheese -- all very good. on monday nights, $40+ bottles are half price. but in general, the bottles cost less than $40. small tables in the front, a lounge with couches in the back. nice. the only thing i didn't like was the music -- hip hop and some other stuff..  not suited for this otherwise romantic wine bar. if they played better music, i would change my rating to 4-stars, because everything else was *terrific*.
