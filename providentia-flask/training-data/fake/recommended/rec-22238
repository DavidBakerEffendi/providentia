Meh. I was a fan of the New Haven location, but this place is nothing special. They took a premium dining experience and turned it into a Chilis. Our waitress was very strange and (I hate to say this) kinda trashy, with the big makeup and calling us all "honey" like we were regulars at a greasy-spoon. Tried to push beers on us at 2pm on a Sunday (no thanks means no thanks). And she weirdly grabbed my boyfriend's waist when she brought him something ... It didn't bother me but he mentioned it and we all thought it was odd. Additionally, the burgers were greasy and my side salad that was on the same plate as my burger was so saturated in dressing that it had soaked the entire bun of my burger. The whole soggy burger tasted like balsamic dressing. I was too hungry to send it back and complain, but when I let the waitress know that perhaps they should consider fixing that in the future, she looked at me like I had 2 heads. If you want a premium burger experience go to Plan B or haul it to New Haven. I won't be back here.
