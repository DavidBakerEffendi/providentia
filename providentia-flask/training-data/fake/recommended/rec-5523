I ate here this past weekend and it was amazing. I ordered the eggs Benedict. Definitely one of the best I've had. I also had some onion fritters. They tasted like onion rings and sweet potato chips had a beautiful and delicious baby. It was a little crowded (the place is pretty small, which is typical of downtown cafes), but we got seated very quickly and our food also came out super fast. I'd definitely reccommend this place!
