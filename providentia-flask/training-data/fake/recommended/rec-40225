"Let's go to Shave Noodles" says one of my friend. I dread these words after many years of trying the same noodles over and over again. Ever since moving from the east side to the west side of tenth street, the quality hasn't been up to par as before. I wouldn't suggest the meatball here because it isn't very good, too salty. However, the soup is delicious. Every now and then, the tables would have this weird funky smell like bad laundry. I assume some of the rags has been too many time with not enough washing. All in all, this place is a great place to have a good bowl of noodle soup in the winter months.
