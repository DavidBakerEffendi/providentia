Make sure you have reservations because Bistango gets crazy crowded on weekends.  The only reason my party of 4 ate here was because they have gluten free options.  We had no reservations but the host was able to accompany us but said that they needed the table in an hr for a reservation.  We didn't want a super fancy dinner meaning no wine or apps so that was fine for us.  Service was great, friendly and they even asked who was the gluten free person (my friend) and she got a separate plate of gluten free bread and her own olive oil dipping sauce with garlic.   For the entrees my gluten free friend ordered the spinach ricotta ravioli.  There's actually a bunch of stuff that's gluten-free and many of the regular items can be substituted so it is gluten free.  The ravioli was excellent.  It looked a bit small (5 raviolis) but then once you start eating it you realize that they are stuffed with yummyness.     The non gluten free peeps-the three ordered: Lobster Ravioli-same as the other ravioli, small portions but fills you up because it's stuffed Fusilli con Pollo-spiral pasta with chicken and pink sauce which was delicious, good portion Pollo Funghi-Chicken with mushrooms with a hint of ginger.  Came with butternut squash, carrots and snow peas.  Not ideally Italian but delicious. Prices are reasonable, I would say pasta and plates are $15-$25 I can't wait to come back.
