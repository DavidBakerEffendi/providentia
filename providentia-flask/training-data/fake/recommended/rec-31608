Based on almost 40 years of going to this joint on and off out of necessity I'd say it's thoroughly mediocre. But for some reason--perhaps its better-than-average and authentic Sicilian pie--it's gained some sort of mystique. The staple of the place--its round pie--is pretty much an orgy of mid-grade mozzarella slopped on a thick bland crust. Like I said, the Sicilian is very light on the cheese and very typical of traditional pizza in Italy. One standout is the mussels in hot sauce. Great sauce recipe! The service is brusque and unfriendly on a good day. I'm a New Yorker so I can deal with Soup Nazis and the like, but this is the rare place where I feel like I can't even get my order out before they get impatient--and it's not like they're dealing with midtown volume. Unfortunately it's pretty typical of Clifton pizza, with Grimaldi's being one exception.
