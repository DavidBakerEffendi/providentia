I used to patronize E Mei regularly, but never again after tonight. There was one table available (being cleaned) when I came in with my group of 5. I was told that that table was for my group. Right as the table was finished, a group of 3 walked in, sweet-talked the host, and got the table. I asked why we were not given the table and he said they were there before (couldn't be-- they definitely told their party size when they entered). I told the manager (in Chinese) that I was not happy with the unfair treatment and walked out. In the United States, we seat people in the order they come; it's not about who sweet talks whom.
