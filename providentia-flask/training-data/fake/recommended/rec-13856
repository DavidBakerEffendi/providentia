Service Fail! We live around the corner, so naturally we were excited about the new kid on the block.  We had read the reviews about the crowds and poor service, so we tried for a Sunday night thinking we'd catch them on even footing.  Not too busy, not too understaffed and slow. All the reviews giving this place a mediocre score are correct.  I guess the meatball guys still have a few kinks to work out with their service.   Food was good to great.  Prices are on point.  Waiting 35 minutes for a glass of wine and another 30 for some meatballs kneecap all other positives.  We also were charged for items we had not ordered. I'll chalk this all up to them simply being new and having inexperienced wait staff.  unfortunately, we probably won't be back for a few months to find out.
