I must start by saying I am nowhere near a vegetarian or a vegan! My vegetarian friend and I were out one night and he suggested we stop here for chicken cheesesteaks, I was skeptical but agreed to go for the experience. This sandwich was the best I have ever had. I completely forgot I was not eating meat since it was soooo tasty. I sometimes dream of it lol! Â Since then I have been back multiple times.
