The only negative is that the wait was a little long at the bar for a 9:30 reservation. Other than that, the food was on point and the service was great.  Waitress was super knowledgable and helpful about the menu.  Great white truffle appetizer, and the brick chicken is one of the best dishes in the city. Chef Forgione is deserving of all of his accolades.
