Line was out the door almost, and the space is tiny and cramped. We ended up getting our food to go and eating it in our car. Nevertheless, I read reviews saying this was the best burrito they had in NYC, and so my friends and I ordered the Carne Asada burrito. It was good. I don't think I can say it was the best burrito I've had in NYC. It wasn't much of a difference between the Chipotle that's a couple blocks over. I'm glad I checked it out tho! It's not pretentious, and it's a nice little spot. I would go back again if I was craving some Mexican, but nothing too special. The salsa may have been the best part so make sure you order some nachos and salsa! There ya go! Happy Eating :)
