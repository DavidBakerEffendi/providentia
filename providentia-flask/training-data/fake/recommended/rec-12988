(just as a reference, i LOVE and ADORE taim) oh, taim...i've been waiting for this nolita store to open forever! the new place is great, spacious, and cool decor! it is a cash-only place like the original store, same menu. my friend and each got their popular falafel sandwiches for $6.25 each,   (one falafel flavor w/ hummus, israeli salad, pickled cabbage, tahini sauce) she got harissa (mixed with tunisian spices (mild spicy)) i got the traditional green (with parsley, cilantro, mint) we had enough cash only for one smoothie, the pineapple + coconut one ($5.50) when we went inside, there were only a few customers, but then the line got extremely long within a few minutes! our falafel sandwiches were ready and after taking pictures, we were super excited to devour these scrumptious goodies! BUT...what is this? especially this pita? so hard and stiff! i mean, taim is well-known for their falafels alright,   but are they disregarding their other ingredients? or was it just too much expectation from my part? phew, it was extremely plain and disappointing experience. maybe it was just a bad day...but their falafel and smoothie was great! my friend said she would give another chance for this new chain... perhaps i should take her advice too! but as for now, i definitely recommend the original store in west village!
