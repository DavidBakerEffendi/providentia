A great place to go to switch things up once in a while when you start feeling that all your staple 'food type' options (fancy french, bar burgers&fries, italian byo, fusion bistro) are getting routine.   The atmosphere is distinctive and classy...the decor is distinguished and effortlessly charming...stylish without being trendy or too "fashionable"...overall the space (the restaurant is much larger/deeper than it appears from its Locust st. facade) has an inviting grandeur.   Service is impeccable yet waitstaff add some fun by bringing out some orders balanced on their head.   Their specials truly are, for they included a dish with fried grasshoppers.  After I swallowed my trepidation and a mouthful of them ('just keep thinking they're like shrimp that live on land'), I have to say they really taste more like garlicky & buttery crispy chips than anything else.  Their mojitos were top-notch, steak was tasty, and ceviche okay/decent.  Some items on the menu seemed a little overpriced for standard-ish mexican fare but the experience as a whole is worth it.
