Beef on a bun.....what's the appeal?  Tony Lukes puts this "stuff" to shame.  Pure tourist trap.....DO NOT GO....expensive for what you get....1/4 the beef of a tony lukes cheesesteak hoagie.  Didn't bother going to pats......Sorry folks, just overrated and i tell it like I feel it. 2 whiz wit  cheese fries and 2 cokes
