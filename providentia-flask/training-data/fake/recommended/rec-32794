Good lord. When you walk in here, you would think it's the only restaurant in a 50-mile radius, based on the lack of parking, the lines out the door and the deafening din. I'm not sure how to explain the crowds -- it's family friendly eating with an overwhelming, inch-thick menu and decent food. It's okay for what it is, but I don't necessarily want to put myself through it again, not when there are so many other options. I guess this is a good choice if you've got little kids or babies and you don't want to feel self-conscious about them making a lot of ruckus.
