Have been here many times and have always been a fan, especially of the happy hour.  This past Wednesday I went to happy hour with two friends for oysters and clams.  Flash forward 24 hours and all three of us are sick with food poisoning.  I know these things can happen but I fear going back since it seems the whole crop was bad if all 3 of us got sick simultaneously.
