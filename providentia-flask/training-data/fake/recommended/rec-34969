Try their plain slice first to taste the deliciousness that is their pizza. They also have really good tortellini. REALLY good. It's enough to feed two people but if you're really hungry, you can eat the whole thing. The guys working there are always friendly. It's very small so don't count on a seat on most days but it's well worth visiting.
