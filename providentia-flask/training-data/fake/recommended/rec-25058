This would have been five stars but unfortunately I was seated in an area with poor service. This place has great tasting food and a wonderful happy hour. I ordered the fish tacos for $7.50 and had a Pinot Grigio for $4. I came during happy hour and couldn't get a seat at the bar, I was alone so I felt bad taking one of the two tops in the bar area, but that was the only option. Unfortunately I knew that would mean poor service. even though they told me the bartender would come be my server, she only came once to get the order never came back again. I had been done eating for about a half hour and nobody had come so I went to the bar to get my tab. I would have easily spent another $20 if somebody would've come sooner. I definitely suggest coming to this place, just don't sit at a hightop in the bar area, only sit at the bar.
