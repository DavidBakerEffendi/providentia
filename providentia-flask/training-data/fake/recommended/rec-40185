I've been here twice now, once when it first opened and my soup came out cold and there was slow service and the usual problems However my second visit back was far better although we did get charged for sodas that never came to the table! I took visiting scientists out for lunch here, slightly dismayed they ran out of fish and chips being that it's a seafood restaurant and also our server was unaware it was 86'd I think the lobster mac and cheese was delicious (I get it every time!), def on the $$ side for Univ City and also because there was maybe two small pieces of lobster in the entire dish, but I like that its not heavy handed on the creaminess and just the right amount of salt The renovation is what most impressed me from its former La Terrasse days, they've expanded it into a beautiful, spacious  eatery--would def go back but on someone else's dime! Don't even think of getting a drink, the bottle beer prices were on par with some NYC restaurants!! If you go,  Be sure to ask for a table in the back/atrium area, very pretty with lots of natural light
