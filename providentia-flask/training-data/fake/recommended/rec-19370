It is always a tie when I try to decide what is more amazing here... the specials or the staff.   The specials blow my mind every time and I Highly suggest whatever burger is on the specials menu.  Trust me when I say that it may sound strange but the combos ALWAYS work. The wait can be pretty long and they don't take reservations but you can call ahead and get put on the waiting list... I highly recommend that.
