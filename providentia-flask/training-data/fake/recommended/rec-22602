I guess I'm not impressed by this place.  From the name, I was expecting more than just a place to get food - like a REAL commune where artists,  authors, etc. get together and share their talent with everyone in an accessible way -- something truly different for our 'hood but it's not very different at all.  Same old type of food and it's overpriced.   They hit it right by giving it this name because it peaks your interest and it draws you in.  But as someone posted previously, the execution is lacking. I've gone into this place about 4 times and each time I've left without ordering anything so I can't comment on how the food tastes.  I've left because I can't get over the prices and from looking at the showcase of prepared foods, I never get the WOW! factor to fork over the cash for this food.  So, I've given up on the place. The staff have always been very friendly though. I hope they stay in business however since our little hood needs to have options.  I just feel like this place is too "schtick" for me...but then again, there are plenty of people who like "schtick".
