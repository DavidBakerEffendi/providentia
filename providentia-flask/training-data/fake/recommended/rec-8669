Food is decent, but more often than not the order is screwed up. When you order the pulled pork, expect to get large chunks of pork, not the real deal.  I called and asked what the story was after the second time it happened, thinking they'd changed the recipe or something. Whoever I spoke with said that the person who pulls the pork simply didn't do it right, and was glad to know of the problem. Next week I ordered the pulled pork again and received again just large chunks of pork - not "pulled."  Disturbing that they are so un concerned with getting right the food that leaves their kitchen. I've been burned for the last time.
