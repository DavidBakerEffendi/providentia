Oh, travel gods - you send me to the same corner of the United terminal in Newark each time!  I swear to you, I've sampled whatever options they have in this back wing of the terminal, and it's one of the better options.  But like all airport options (aside from the Dunkin in the circle below the President's club, because Dunkin coffee makes all things happy), it's not great, but it's convenient. 1.  They have seafood options, which are lean and don't make you feel like you're going to be sick on a flight across the pond.  The salmon has always been a great choice for me, but I've had others sample the tuna, oysters, etc.  Everyone has been pleased, but not overjoyed.   2.  They have sweet potato chips.  They are going to cost you FAR too much, but they exist, and are yummy. 3. Service is lacking.  It is sometimes rather dirty, and I couldn't get a refill on my ice tea to safe my life! 4. General gist, it's expensive. If you have time, I'd recommend walking to some of the other wings of the terminal to find other options.  There is a great wine bar (name blanking my mind) and some healthy fast options.  If you're stuck back in this corner though, it's a safe, lean, though expensive, options.
