All-around bad ribs. I shouldn't really give Suzy's only one star but these were some bad, bad ribs. GroupOn helped us find SuzyQue's but unfortunately, even an enormous discount really couldn't help us make this a satisfying experience. The service was friendly and quick, but the food was the issue. Family ordered the combo platter, St Louis Style Ribs, and the Baby Back Ribs. All the ribs were tough and very dry. The restaurant gives you four difference sauces to dip or pour onto your food, but none of them really tasted that spectacular, so I didn't feel like they helped. Even if the sauces were good, these ribs were way too overcooked and the meat was clinging to the bone for its life. These might have been the worst ribs I've ever had, they were next to impossible to get meat off of and by the time I did, my teeth/mouth were tired from pulling. My sides weren't anything better. The cornbread is just not good, because of it's hard and dry composure. My macaroni & cheese featured a weird and unusual cheese, which no one could make out, but everyone thought was weird. This mac&cheese might be good for some because of the difference of taste and the amount of cheese used (A LOT!), but it didn't hit for me. My only side that were decent were the sweet potato fries, which were crunchy and tasty. With a $98 bill between three people ordering two beers a piece, two full racks of ribs, and a combo platter, this bill is an eye-soar. It was NO WHERE NEAR the price of the food. I think if the bill was $50, SuzyQue's would have received a 2 star rating, but with almost $100 spent, it can't receive anything but the dreaded 1 star. I won't be back for any reason. Sorry Suzy.
