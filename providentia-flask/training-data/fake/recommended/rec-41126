I tried both Ippudo, the one in East Village, and this one in Hell's Kitchen. Ippudo is one of the most popular ramen spots in NYC and after several visits, I find the place to be decent and abit overrated. One of the problems with the place being so popular is that the wait is quite long. Each time that I went with friends, we waited on average an hour and half or so, which I guess, is normal for NYC. The good thing about being in NYC is that we can explore the area around the restaurant while we wait. The highlighting menu item here is their pork buns. The pork buns are absolutely mouthwatering. They come in 2 pieces and I recommend ordering several as appetizers to share. I tried both the Shiromaru Hakata Classic and the Akamaru Modern. The Classic is their tonkatsu pork bone broth with thin noodles, mushrooms, pickled ginger, scallions, chashu pork, and half of a molten egg. The ramen is pretty good but abit pricey for the amount. The Akamaru Modern is similar to the Classic with the same ingredients except it has an extra kick to it. The soup base is much more flavorful and I recommend this over the Classic. I wouldn't mind coming back but would prefer going to other smaller ramen niche places in NYC.
