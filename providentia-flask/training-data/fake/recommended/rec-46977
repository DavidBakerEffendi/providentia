After quick review, I was completely into the idea of trying everything on the menu at Sabrina's. A friend and I ordered two dishes from the Brunch menu: chocolate chip pancakes with shortbread cookie crumbles and raspberry-chocolate chip sauce, and the stuffed French toast (filling of cream cheese, Reese's cups, grape jelly). The pancakes not only lacked chocolate chips, but were also extremely dry - something I'd compare to leather. The shortbread crumbles would have been a nice touch if they hadn't been stale. The french toast was equally as dry as it's pancake cousin. The filling tasted purely of cream cheese, and the only element of sweetness was contributed by the grape jelly which did not compliment the dish whatsoever. After tasting each dish I covered each with the two sauces which had come with the breakfast. Neither sauce did anything to enhance the dishes. I was thoroughly disappointed with my first Sabrina's experience, mainly because I was blown away by the eclectic menu and I expected much more. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone, however I am giving Sabrina's the benefit of the doubt by assuming my experience was just a total fluke (maybe from the high dining volume that particular morning). I would give Sabrina's one more try, because I don't want to prematurely Â accept that such a cool spot could consistently put out less than mediocre food.
