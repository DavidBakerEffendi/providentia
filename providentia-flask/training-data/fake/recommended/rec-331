Went here this past Sunday to cap off (or start?) my week with heart clogging and high cholesterol inducing, mid-afternoon food coma, and stomach so full I couldn't eat anymore but just had to finish the few pieces of corn kennel left. I ordered Gabrielle Union, a beautiful and talented actress who I'll always remember for her portrayal as the Clovers team captain, Isis, in the cult classic "Bring It On". In Amy Ruth's case, she was pork chops smothered (or fried, your choice) in delicous gravy(?whatever-it's delicious). I chose the baked mac & cheese and corn for my sides because everyone recommends m&c and I love corn. Also ordered a half & half, which was too sweet for me. Service is excellent here and staff is very friendly. Place is pretty big, good for big groups and small. Entree prices are very reasonable and big portions. 10/10, would suffer (in a good way of course) eating here again.
