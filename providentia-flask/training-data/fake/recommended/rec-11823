Being Chinese most people's first question (besides asking if I know someone else with the same last name) is what Chinatown restaurant is my favorite.  I then have to launch into this discussion about how it depends on what I'm looking for - whether it be dim sum, soup dumplings, noodles, breakfast congee.  If I HAD to pick one though, it would probably be the Nanzhou Hand Drawn Noodle House.   A disclaimer first.  Don't expect a fancy place or gaudy Chinese decorations.  If you're going at peak times you may be seated with another party at the same table.  Don't be mad, no one wants to sit with you either but hey - we're here for the noodles.  Lastly, the service isn't going to knock you off your feet but it's quick. I've almost always stuck with the beef brisket noodle soup with a side of chinese vegetables.  There isn't a ton of beef but the noodles and broth is really where it's at.  The broth is consistently good with a touch of Sriracha and the noodles have the right chewy-factor.  This is Chinese comfort food at it's finest and for quite a steal at $5-6.   I'll end with an anecdote.  One day me and 3 co-workers got a craving for some noodles.  We had 30 minutes.  We walked the 4 blocks to the restaurant, ordered, got our food, inhaled the beef brisket noodle soup, and walked the four blocks to make it back to work in time.  That's how fast this place is.
