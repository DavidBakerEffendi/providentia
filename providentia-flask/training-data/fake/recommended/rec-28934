We had a 6:30 reservation for Saturday night, had to wait a bit to be seated because the place is TINY and it was packed. The hostess was not very friendly or welcoming. The seating is very awkward and there is no place to comfortably wait.   We finally were seated around the center round thing (?). I wasn't very impressed with the atmosphere to be honest...it was nothing special.  The chocolate martini was really good, but expensive and TINY!  We ordered the Chicken Satay skewers to start, they were ok, there were 6 which was perfect for our group of 3 to share.  My daughter ordered chicken fingers and fries, which were pretty much standard.  I ordered the Roast Beef sandwich on a waffle, which was really bland and not very exciting.  My husband ordered the BLT with Avacado which was very good. I ordered the cake with the liquid chocolate filling...it was bland also! They don't have the dip-able popsicles any longer and the server suggested the ice cream cone that had some chocolate pieces and toffee served with it as a substitute...my daughter wasn't really into it and only ate a  bit.  Our server was very nice and the timing was ok for the food, but I wouldn't go back or recommend it.
