I read reviews for Pho on line and thought I would try it.  I have had a lot of Pho in my day and this place was barely passable. I wouldn't go here again. The broth was like dishwater and the meat sub-par.  Those are the two ingredients that give the dish taste. Otherwise the other ingredients were fine.  The ambiance was nice and maybe the other dishes are better.
