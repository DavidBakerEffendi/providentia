If you want some authentic Mexican food, this is the place. My husband and I are here all the time. We love the friendly service and great food. We often feel like we have our own personal chef when we are there.  The breakfast burrito is out of this world and is a must have when going here for breakfast.  The chicken tortilla soup is rich with flavor. Cisco's is the best Mexican restaurant in the area.
