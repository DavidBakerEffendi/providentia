I am giving Steinhof four stars even though the food is just ok. There are so many other things about this place I love -- the decor, the music, the excellent drinks, the film festivals, the friendly, funky neighborhood vibe, the staff. It's my favorite place to go for so many different occasions -- a leisurely family dinner, a night out drinking with the girls, a romantic date night or even or for a quiet drink. Oh, and Monday night goulash and trout night is terrific!
