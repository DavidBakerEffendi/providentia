Happened upon this place on a whim, looking for good comfort asian/chinese/whatever food.  It's a simple restaurant, no decor on the walls, save for a tv playing whatever asian channel you could get on cable.  The menu was pretty straightforward;  a small list of appetizers, and then a whole bunch of noodle soups with your choice of various meats.  I got the beef brisket noodle soup...the broth is good, but after the meat stews in it, its gets even better.  My girlfriend got the roast duck noodle soup, which was quite tasty, except that it was all on the bone, so eating the savory duck was a little tough.  Most soups were under $6, and as much as you eat, it seems like there's still a full bowl.  I ate half of mine and was quite full, although I definitely got dirty looks from the surrounding patrons who ate theirs to finish, with no complaints.  I was thrilled though, to have lunch leftovers.
