Since moving to San Francisco, I've craved for my usual Blue Ribbon fixed ie. catfish dish, fried Chicken, banana bread pudding, etc.. and most of all my dirty martini.. A visit to Blue Ribbon Brasserie on Spring or Brooklyn is always #1 on my list whenever in NYC.  So I suggest you make it yours.. Shout out to my fav bartender at Spring St who makes the best dirty martini in town and Magnus!  FYI. they're so busy they do not take reservations.
