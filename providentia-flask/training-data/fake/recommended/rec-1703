Overrated, over priced yuppie/hipster infested bar with a new york feel, everyone walks around with this cocky, to cool for school look about them, your not that speaial and your not that interesting get over your self, i'll stick to my dive bars, where i don't have to pay 5- 6 dollars for a beer, and i have more to choose from then microbrews
