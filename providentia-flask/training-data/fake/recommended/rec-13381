I had to visit this place during a recent short visit to NYC. I didn't have time to sit down and eat, so I placed an order to pick up an original pie on Sunday around 5 pm. They said it would take 15 mins & it was ready when I showed up. The original pizza was ok, I was expecting more for all the hype associated with this place. Everyone in my group said the same thing. The pizza is eh. I'm glad we didn't wait a long time to eat here. Next time I'm in NYC I will look for another pizza joint to try out. I will skip this place next time.
