I ate at Salinas on a Friday night and it was packed (in a good way)! Everyone enjoying tapas and wine. The staff was really friendly and seated us right away. I had looked at the menu before going and was set on getting Shishito Peppers w/salt,  but our waiter said it was out of season...not to worry because we ended up picking some other delicious tapas! The colorado lamb meatballs were DELICIOUS! They came on top of cucumbers and were perfect, we wish we ordered more. I also ordered the pumpkin/chicken soup which was yummy, just wish i could taste the pumpkin a little more. The Rossejat Rapida was very tasty and flavorful. I had never had Fideo pasta before and i really enjoyed it.. I didn't even need the saffron aioli sauce that came with it.  The codfish was also delicious. The staff was great, and always coming to check on us. The ambiance was lovely and perfect for a nice cozy date. I would definitely come back to Salinas for Wine and Tapas.
