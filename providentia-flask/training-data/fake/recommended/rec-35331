Check-in on Foursquare for complimentary cava! We had the duck egg, pork belly, razor clams, and Pumpkin/Goat cheese croquetas. Highlights were def the razor clams and the pork belly! Could have done without the croquetas. Great service and very friendly waitress. Only downside is that the restaurant gets a little noisy... There is usually a wait-list to get a table, but they will take down your number and call you, so you're free to explore the area!
