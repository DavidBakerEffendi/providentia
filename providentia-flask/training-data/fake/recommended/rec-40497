I ate here last night and it was a mixed bag.  Others have noted that the service is not what it should be for such an expensive restaurant - especially one that Craig Laban has reviewed so highly. I had the same incompetent service experience. It took a while for our server to even appear. Then we ordered cocktails and told him that we were planning the chef's tasting menu plus the higher end wine pairing. Well, it took the cocktails about 15 minutes to get to us AFTER our first course and first wine appeared. Hmmm. Pretty slow and pretty incompetent. We actually had to inquire as to what happened to our cocktails. We then had to tell him to slow down the food delivery - which he should have noticed was off himself. In fairness, the server was sick that night and had to go home, but the service really did not get much better.  The substitute had no idea that dessert came with the chef's tasting menu and had to check after we reminded him that it undoubtedly did. On the plus side, the food was very good. Not sublime, not 5 stars (only Alinea deserves a sublime 5 stars from me). But it could do a sold 4 -- if the service gets it together. If not, people will find out soon enough and it will go the way of the dodo. I will give it another try, but to the management: Get your service act together. For these prices people deserve more.
