This place is so adorable, and would be a great casual date spot. The manager and staff are beyond nice, I had to wait a bit with a friend for a table, but they kept us up to date for when we would be seated, gave us a menu and even gave us some wine recommendations. The food was delicious, too! I had a few tapas plates, and would have loved to try more. Definitely would come back, too! All around lovely experience.
