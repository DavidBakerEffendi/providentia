Ate there last night, party of four. Dinner was good (not outstanding), and not inexpensive. Service was average. Overall, had a great time at this local favorite...except at the end of the meal when the waitress-creature gave me one of the sourest looks I've experienced in NYC and asked me sardonically whether "everything was OK with the meal". I was a little discombobulated, but answered in the affirmative. Then, when we stood up to leave, the maitre d'-creature challenged me on my tip (24.3%, excl. booze (which is how I calculated and intended it)...it would have been 13.5% if booze was taken into account). We commenced a spirited debate about whether one should tip on booze. Note to servers: my experience of your restaurant is seldom enhanced by an outright challenge and debate in the middle of the restaurant, in front of my friends. I expressed this and the maitre d'-creature back-pedalled big-time and claimed not to be challenging me but merely asking for 'feedback' on the service experience. Seeking the high ground (vanity, yes), I demanded the bill once more and increased my tip to 20.2% of the entire bill (booze included), and handed it back to the maitre d'-creature. Result: Cookshop, you gained your extra $20 of tip, but you have lost my custom, my recommendation and my support.
