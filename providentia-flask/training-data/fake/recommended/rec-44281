These guys really now their stuff! Every part of your sandwich is homemade and AMAZING. I had "The Opposition" and the hubs had the "50/50" Ruben. The meat was tender and flavorful, not dry like regular deli meat, and all of the condiments and toppings complemented each other nicely. Very well-balanced! Oh - and save room for dessert! Super tasty homemade cookies and brownies.
