I will never, ever, ever give this place my money again.  By far, the rudest, class-less business people.  Literally they rudely took 2 out of the measly 4 crayons away from a table of 9 kids who had been waiting FOREVER for their pizza, and when my 5-yr old daughter said, "Awww", the owner brusquely replied, "There are other kids here too you know."  Um, can you buy more crayons?  But more importantly, she verbally cut down customers left and right.  In addition, not only the pizza, but the kitchen staff was BAKED.  It took 40 minutes just for the kids' breadsticks.  Our pizza was BLACK on the bottom when it arrived.  When I checked out trying to pay for a to-go pizza, the owner says rudely, "Can you not stand here?!  I need you over there."  How 'bout over at another pizza "joint"?  Give your money to small business owners who appreciate it.  This joint is rude, classless, "stoned" and unappreciative.
