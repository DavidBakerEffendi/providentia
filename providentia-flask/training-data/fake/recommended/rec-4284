This visit was so unexpected, but such a great addition to the day. I had been out and about showing my mom (farm-lady) the big city that I'm moving into next month (!!!!!) last Saturday afternoon. I don't usually drive in Philly, unless I'm heading to my job, so, in other words, I had never driven on this part of South Street before and had kinda gotten myself turned around. Nonetheless, I found a parking spot, paid, walked about five feet, looked up, saw the sign for Rex, and announced, "THIS PLACE HAS BEEN ON MY BOOKMARKS LIST FOR FOREVER!" They were serving brunch when we walked in, and we were instantly seated at a two-top near the bar. Actually, the bar takes up most of the place, because it is tiny. It's much smaller than I imagined, in fact. But it's so cozy and welcoming. My mom chose the fried chicken and waffles, and I went for the pulled pork sandwich. Now. While my pulled pork sandwich was great, I had serious food-envy after trying a piece of my mom's chicken. I wanted all of her plate. Every last bite of that chicken. But alas, she has a stomach too, it turns out, and she wanted it herself so... I'll just have to go back sometime and get that dish myself. While at Rex, make sure to stop in their bathroom. It's bright red and just very fancy. I want it for my apartment. Fantastic experience all around.
