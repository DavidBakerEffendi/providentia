Falafel awesome sauce!! I love Taim. I first discovered Taim thanks to their food truck on Fifth Avenue. They are no longer near the office so now I have to venture further down if I want to eat their Falafel. Quite honestly, I love it more than I love Mamoun's! Sorry guys, but it's well done and every bite has a little bit of everything depending on what kind of sandwich or platter you get. Mamoun's portions aren't evenly spread out and it drives me nuts. Foodies want a little bit of each ingredient in every bite from start to finish. Taim does exactly that and they really do fill you up. My personal fav is the harissa with everything (pickles, hummus, the works). You get so much for less than 10 bucks and that's not always so easy in NYC. I've just made myself hungry for more!!
