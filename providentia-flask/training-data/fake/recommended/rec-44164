We were driving home from a vacation up north.  It was around lunch time and we were starting to get hungry so we did a GPS search for food and found this place.  It's close to the highway  and as we hate fast food, it looked perfect.  This is a classic diner in the silver trailer.  Since my husband and I both love Gyros, when we saw them on the menu, we knew what we were ordering.  They actually have 2 types of Gyros to choose from, the traditional Lamb and chicken.  We both had the Lamb Gyros,  and they were fantastic.  The lamb was seasoned perfectly and  moist, unlike many where the meat has dried out.  There was just the right amount of yogurt, fresh crisp veggies and a soft pita. The service was remarkably prompt, we were in and out in about 30 minutes, and the total bill including beverages was less than $25.00.  If you are driving in northern Vermont  and are hungry, this is a great place to stop, and they have lots of parking.
