I didn't realize how big this place was, but it was still cozy. the food was pretty solid. my calamari was cooked perfectly. not rubbery and i had a great fish dish. the wait staff could afford to be better coordinated. There was duplication of efforts and then moments of no effort i.e. no silverware. I'd still go again. 3.5 stars
