My fiancee and I met here with his family to discuss our wedding plans, which included looking for a venue. This place was on our list of venues to check out, so we figured why not have brunch there! I'm glad we did Everyone we encountered, from entrance to exit, was rude and rushed us. They had accepted our reservation for the time we made it with absolutely no hesitation, but I guess they were getting ready to close up brunch because the hostess, our waiter, another waitress, and a management member all came up to us within a 5 minute time span to tell us we really needed to hurry our order. We then got dirty looks from them all for the rest of our meal. The food was good. I'll give them that. But I'll take my wedding elsewhere, thanks.
