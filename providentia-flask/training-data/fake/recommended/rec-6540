I'm a huge fan of Michael White. So let's just get that bias out in the open. He's such a gem. Some of my best meals have been at his restaurants especially Alto, Convivio and Marea. I like his no fuss approach to creating complex Italian flavors with traditional (and sometimes unexpected) ingredients that are quite delicious and always seem to be of the highest quality. There are very few restaurants in NYC that make homemade pasta (TRULY homemade) and White's restaurants are some of them. Osteria Morini is a simple, casual, rustic and approachable restaurant with a menu chock full of what White is best at: rich, traditional, Italian executed extremely well. This casual joint doesn't have anything on some of his others in terms of refinement or presentation, but it serves up casual, rustic quite well. This restaurant won't blow your mind but is good for a solid, casual meal amongst friends. I'd say that if you compare it to competitors (joints like Morandi or Maialino) then it wins hands down. I'll be back.
