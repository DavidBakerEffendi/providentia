The food is a bit pricey, but the quality is much better than the other outdoor-dining alternative up the Hudson (Boat Basin -- yuck!  The food there is pathetic).   A few things I like to get are the lobster roll with fries, sweet corn, and chicken walnut & red grape salad.  Hubby loves their fish and chips and says their burger is decent (we are Shake Shack fans, but this one'll do occassionally since the view/setting makes up for it).  I also love that they have an espresso bar that opens early in the morning when it's nice and quiet. On a nice, hot summer weekend, it can get pretty jam-packed, especially during lunch. This one of NYC's top summer people-watching spots... You'll see a ton of cyclists, runners, dog walkers, families, and people just hanging out appreciating the outdoors and watching the sunset.   Pier I Cafe is one of the best parts about living in the Upper West Side.  I anxiously await its opening every spring and am very, very sad when it shuts down every fall.
