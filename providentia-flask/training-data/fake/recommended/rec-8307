Omg everyone was right about this place. The prices are very affordable which is surprising considering the quality and quantity of the food. Im new to Indian food, so I wasn't too sure what to order. I went on their site which is very simple and easy to read. I ordered the chicken tikka masala with house salad and garlic naan. It was life-changing. I loved every minute of it. I started eating with a fork but by the end I was using my hands, because the food is that great. The basmati rice was cooked to perfection and fluffy. The sauce was creamy well season and delicately spiced. The chicken was tender and scrumptious. And I ordered delivery!!! I'm so pleasantly surprised. This food will make you savor every moment!
