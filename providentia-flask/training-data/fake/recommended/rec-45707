Awesome find :) extremely friendly service, our waiter was very enthusiastic and just seemed happy to be there. We thought it was so sweet when he told us the dessert we ordered was the chef's mother's recipe. Love the decor and the music was awesome, the owner was playing DJ and playing records (Crimson and Clover was playing when we went in, also caught some Zombies and the Doors), but it was a bit too loud. We could barely hear our server and vice versa, and it was difficult to carry on our conversation. For food, we shared a few apps for our meal. The cap'n crunch chicken fingers, atomic balls, and the bbq pork croquettes. Everything was great, but missing salt. The chicken fingers were a bit too sweet, as was the dipping sauce. The ratio was just a hair off. We got the smores icebox for dessert, MUST TRY. It doesn't look like anything special but he chocolate was fudgy and perfect and it was just amazing. Get it. Get seven of them.I can't wait to go back! Ps- cash only, BYOB!
