My girlfriend found this place and was so excited because she thought she'd be able to take me out to have a real philly cheese steak but vegan style and Abbaye's Saitan cheese steak looked just like that.. Unfortunately they use real cheese on the cheese steak so if you're a vegan thinking you can go here for a cheese steak think again.  So we settled on the vegan wings which were great.. texture was awesome, tasy as hell just a bit on the spicy side. The big issue with The Abbaye that brought the review down was the noise level in there.. There was a table of people there that were just out of control loud.   Mainly these two girls that have only one volume level and because of them the entire rest of the restaurant has to yell to hear anything and then everything just spirals out of control from there. Food was good, staff was so friendly and helpful but the noise level was insane.
