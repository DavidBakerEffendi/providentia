I came here with a friend after an opera at Juilliard.  The atmosphere is warm and cozy.  They don't seem to allow a standing crowd so it doesn't feel cramped even though it is a small place.  The wine list is good and the menu of small plates is varied enough to please most tastes.  If I lived near here I would come often.  FYI, the bathroom doors are heavy and kind of stick.  I stood waiting for like 5 minutes before I tried them again, only to find them both empty when I had thought they were occupied.  Ooops!  Sorry to that girl waiting behind me!
