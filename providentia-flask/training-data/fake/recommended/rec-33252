I have been coming to Olea since they opened. I don't live in the neighborhoohd anymore but still make it a desitnation stop. The food is never disappointing. I had the Cicken & Pork Paella yesterday and it was amazing! It was devoured by my friends right down to the crispy rice at the bottom of the cast iron pan it arrived. Â Oh and I had one of the best Manhattan's ever made.
