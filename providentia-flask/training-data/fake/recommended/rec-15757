The raw bar special has got to be one of the best deals in NYC.  6 oysters or clams with house wine or a PBR for $8!  Definitely had many rounds of that.  The other food is excellent as well.  Great inexpensive seafood place in a city of crazy expensive seafood.  Very casual atmosphere, makes you feel like you are not in New York at all.  Definitely will be back.
