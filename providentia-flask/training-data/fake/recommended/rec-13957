i have a secret for you folks... actually i don't because if i tell you the secret, you won't have to line up for 20 minutes to get one of these pipin hot bad boys. but wow for 6 bucks to get a full freakin bucket of rice, lamb, and chicken is darn good. that yogurt sauce is dang good. the hot sauce, if eaten by itself, will burn your tongue to a flamin crisp, but he right amount is really nice. the food is really strongly flavored with herbs and spices and saltiness, but not so much that its just overpowering. its really good and you want to keep eating, even though i was already full from my previous meal. i wish i was hungry and went straight to this first. not only was it tasty, it was very filling and incredibly cheap. i dont think you'll really find a better 6 dollar deal in new york. 4.5 taste 100 stars for value average.. who knows, but only max 5 is given.
