Dined here on a Friday night.  Originally had reservations at 8:30 PM for a table of two but we got there early (around 7 PM) and they were able to seat us right away. I've been to more than my fair share of rodizio style restaurants but I'd rank this place right at the top.  All of their meats were cooked to perfection.  The beef cuts were super tender and not too salty. The non-beef cuts had a tasty spice rub which wasn't too overpowering. High quality ingredients at the salad bar.  Get the most bang for your buck by trying the expensive stuff (cheeses, cured meats, salmon, etc.) and don't fill up on the veggies. Only disappointment was that grilled pineapple is not included in the meal... but this place is definitely worth the trip!
