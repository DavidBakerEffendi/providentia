So glad I just found a new favorite! I decided to go to dinner for my birthday last Friday for my birthday and arrived with a group of 10. The manager was so accommodating and the service was great. A friend brought cupcakes for dessert and the staff refrigerated them until we were ready and did not charge an additional cake fee. The food was delicious, and very authentic. My favorite was the chicken croquettes but I enjoyed everything we ordered. There are six flavors of sangria and we sampled 4 of the 6, all really good! Since we went on a Friday, I missed the Flamenco show but I will be back soon!
