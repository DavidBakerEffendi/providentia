Something has changed about Kati Roll Co. - Over the years the quality and flavor of the roll has really diminished ( strangely thick and oily roti/paratha, really gristly overcooked meat, bland green masala over everything). It no longer feels worth it to spend $6-8 for something that tastes "meh" accompanied by a really gross chai. I'm taking my late night food adventures elsewhere.
