Sooooooo, the one star is given by default it was close to home. I ordered the vegetable lasagna.  It came with tomato sauce.  This was a pretty simple dish that was not very tasty. I already forgot to mention the flatbread appetizer.  It was like a flat calzone.  Dessert?  No thanks. I would have enjoyed this food more had it been a bit authentic or even Italian American.  This was just another place where tastebuds can be bamboozled. Sorry, it was just not impressive.
