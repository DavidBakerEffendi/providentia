I went here for my first time last Friday night. We were in NY for the weekend...we didn't get here until midnight, for dinner! It was packed, we waited by the bar for about 20 min and then we were seated at a cozy corner booth for 2! The service was great, attentive. The food sooooo goood! We had Pig Cheeks and Deviled Eggs to start, and then shared a Burger. Enjoyed a nice bottle of red wine. Managed to hang out until closing....what a cool environment, great food, service, it was a great experience. I can't wait to go back next time I'm in the city!! Cheers.
