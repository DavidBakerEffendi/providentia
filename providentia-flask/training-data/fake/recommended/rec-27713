Horrible I do not know how their service is when you are dining in. I live literally around the corner from them and have always ordered in. I have ordered there over 10 times in the past couple of months and last night will be the last time I ever call them for anything. I do not mind the hour wait for my order to be delivered a block down from where they are at. However, I do not need attitude over the phone, cold pasta and pizza, all the extras missing when my $50 order finally gets here as I am in the middle of entertaining my friends. Sloppy, Unprofessional, "walk in joint" at best. I have put over 10 orders to this place at minimum $30 per order every time over the past couple of months. I live less than a mile away... The only ok thing about those 10 orders I placed is that one of the ten orders while being late, cold, and missing half the stuff I ordered : got me a free pizza the next day. Mind you, I was entertaining a party of 10 the night the food was 2 hours late, and missing half of itself. Brooklyn Pizza? not in Jersey...
