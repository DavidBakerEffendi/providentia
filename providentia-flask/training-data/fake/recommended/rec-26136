Oh.Em.Gee. Cafe Bello is so good. It's a small place that gives off a warm vibe, great for an intimate date.. However, if you're not really into having a lot of people around you while you're eating, don't go here. It's a little snug inside, but so worth overhearing other people's conversations. I usually get fish when I'm there and really, I'm never disappointed. Most recently, we had the rock shrimp appetizer. WOW, just wow. It was so good and gave off the perfect amount of heat (I like my food spicy). The staff is legit, and by legit I mean they anticipate what you want and give it to you before you even ask. We were talking about getting more bread and BOOM, it was there, before anyone even asked for it! I didn't even know where our waiter was, he just appeared with a basket of bread. It could be that we were just drunk and talking loud, but I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, so I'm going to say they are really good at anticipating what their guests need. Either way, I'm hooked and will be back soon!
