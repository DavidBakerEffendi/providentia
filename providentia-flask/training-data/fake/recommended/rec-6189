Came here on a Monday night, it was empty when we arrived but started to fill up around 8PM. Come here for the watermelon fries, the avocado fries, and the palm fries. I cannot even explain how fantastic they taste. I had the Paella de Mar, and it was your good, standard paella. Friends got the lechon, and it was great. Staff was extremely attentive and friendly! Yerba Buena is well worth the price-tag.
