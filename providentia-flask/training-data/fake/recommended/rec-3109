I can see why everyone raves about this place...but for the 1hr + wait, the priciness of just one bowl of ramen...whose broth is WAY too salty...the trade-offs just aren't there. Sure, the akamaru modern is indeed flavorful, but they need to be more sensitive about over seasoning it -- my tongue was numb from the saltiness. The noodles were wonderful however and well cooked. Going to go explore other ramen shops now...
