Let's cut to the chase. Let's  call Wolf and Deer what it is -- a place named (erroneously) after the proprietors' offspring. Now...hear me out...I may have made that part about the name of the place up, and if so, I apologize. I'm not very smart. What I DO know is that Wolf and Deer is ALSO a lovely place for small plates, fantastic cocktails, great wine selection (from which we have yet to partake in our two visits), and perfect customer service -- with an emphasis on "perfect." We've been here twice during peak-ish times, and felt like welcome guests to this cozy space each time. I hope word doesn't get out too much about how great WD is, but I wish them great success...so I can keep coming back for the meat and cheese plates, pickles,  and delicious libations. Next stop is their sandwiches, which also look ridiculously good.
