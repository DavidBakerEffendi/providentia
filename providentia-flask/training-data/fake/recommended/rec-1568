This place is small, but it packs a punch. Actually, it's very small. It's pretty much pointless to come here to eat if you're in a group of more than 2 ppl, unless you sit in the back space area. Â The place can get loud too since its small and cramped. Their sangria is one of the best i've had. It's very yummy. Their croquetas are perfectly cooked. They are crispy on the outside, and melt in your mouth on the inside. Caveat that they are piping hot, so you may want to crack it open a bit to let them cool before you stick them into your mouth. The chorizo was flavored and seasoned well. The lamb skewer was okay. It was a tad dry, but it was seasoned well. The gambas al ajillo were very yummy and solid. Overall the food was yummy, and the service was great. I just wish the place was bigger.
