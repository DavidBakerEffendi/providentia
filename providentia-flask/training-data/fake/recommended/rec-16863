I've been going to the bagel place almost daily since they've opened. They used to be absolutely fantastic. I'm not sure why but lately things haven't been all that great there. Firstly, don't bother asking for your bagel toasted. It'll come to you still cold and squishy. They're cream cheese seems to have lost a ton of flavor. It's sad to say I think I'm going to have to take the long way to work so that I can get a hot bagel. Sorry bagel place.
