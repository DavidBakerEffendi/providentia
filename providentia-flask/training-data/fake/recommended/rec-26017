Stopped by on a whim while making a trip through Philly.  It's a cozy place, but with a lot of charm.  The seven course tasting menu definitely wasn't cheap but had some major highlights.  The pork belly was by far the best pork belly I'd ever had.  Crispy skin lines the upper edge of pork that seems to melt in your mouth.  Add a bed of mashed sweet potatoes and you're golden.  I've never enjoyed foie gras until I had it as a soup at Fond.  They serve the pureed foie gras first, then add the broth at your table until the foie gras and broth comingle to achieve a perfect consistency.  The nuts and sprigs that garnish the soup elevate it to the next level. If price is no object, Fond's definitely a great experience.  That being said, I personally only enjoyed a few of the seven courses- namely the pork belly mentioned above and the soups.  Even if it may be out of my price range, I'm glad I had the opportunity to try Fond once in my lifetime.
