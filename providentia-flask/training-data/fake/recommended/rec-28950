the smoothies leave much to be desired. Granted this is not a smoothie eatery, but the menu should clarify the following. Smoothies are made with a few flavor shots of fruit syrups that are usually added to coffees. Not even fruit puree. They add a handful of berries to give the smoothie the appearance of being fresh, followed by a cup of orange juice. Sometimes they add yogurt. The size is about the same as a tall water glass. The real kicker is that the bill came to $8.50. For this price, I could get two of the largest jumbo cups of smoothie made from fresh fruits and vegetables at Jamba Juice or Smoothie King. So, in short, it's not a place to order a smoothie from.
