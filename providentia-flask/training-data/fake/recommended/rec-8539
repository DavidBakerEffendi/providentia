Something has happened to the coffee here - it's BETTER! Delicious, and in contrast to how I used to feel about B2 coffee. This used to be a seldom visited spot for me, as I live in the midst of a coffee shop mecca. Â But now, I gotta say, it's my go-to. Bring your own mug - it saves you a bit of loot!
