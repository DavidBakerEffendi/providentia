Still a good meal, but not the life-changing experience I had thought it was when I was young and green. After coming here over the years, I've ultimately come to the conclusion that the food is pretty consistently good-to-very good, the atmosphere and decor excellent, and the service...acceptable. I took my mom here for Mother's Day yesterday, and although the pace was rather frenzied (as may be expected on such an occasion), the service was still a little brusque - and that is not a word I like to use to describe service in any establishment, whether the corner diner for chicken noodle soup or Bouley for porcini flan. If I'm spending $100+ per head on lunch, then I would like it to come with some graciousness on the side, s'il vous plait. Additionally, at their new location, they no longer offer a full selection off their bread cart. As such, nooooo saffron walnut bread in sight. That's a negatory, ghostrider. This place will continue to be on my list of destinations, however, because their lunch tasting menu is (a) an excellent value (like Jean-Georges) and (b) offered on the weekends (UNlike Jean-Georges). Thus, the conclusion is weekday lunch = JG, and weekend lunch = Bouley. Â Unless you have another destination in mind? I'm open to suggestions.
