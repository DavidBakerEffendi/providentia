I tried to come here once before for Pancake month- arriving at 6 p.m. and was told that everyone was just seated and it would be a long wait. With 2 small children, I left and came back today, arriving at a few minutes before 3 p.m.- thinking it would be a quieter time. I did call in advance and was told this was a better time.  Our children were quiet and not making a peep. The hostess told me that everyone had just seated and they wouldn't seat again as they closed at 4 p.m. I couldn't imagine that it would take an hour to eat pancakes, however, we decided to get some to go (a 15 minute wait). As we waited, the hostess seated a table for one. We had already ordered, but we asked if we could be seated on the two high top seats. We were told no. Then, another two tables big enough for us opened up. After much reluctance, we were given one of the tables. We were seated in a tight two top- but knew the pancakes wouldn't travel well.  Several other tables opened up and the hostess sat all of them- up until 3:40 p.m. I was quite annoyed with this shoddy service. I've never been discriminated against because i had children. Although the pancakes were very good, I couldn't justify coming back to a place that would treat my family so poorly.
