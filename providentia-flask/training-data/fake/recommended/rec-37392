All those folks who think that Lou's is the bee's knees either don't know about Shyrl's or have crappy palates.  In the 2 years that I've been making regular visits to the Upper Valley, I've been rather unimpressed with the food in that region.  Shyrl's is one of the few exceptions. Let me tell you about all the delicious plates you can get at Shyrl's for ridiculously cheap prices.  Grilled cheese and tomato with a heap of potato chips for around $2.  Blueberry, chocolate chip, or banana pancakes from $1.75 to around $3.50, depending how many you get.  The pancakes are big, so I wouldn't recommend getting more than two.  Today they were nice enough to accommodate my request for a chocolate chip banana pancake, which was chock full of gooey melted chocolate chips and sweet bananas.  That's the best thing about Shyrl's pancakes -- they're always stuffed to the brim, unlike other places that only put a sprinkling of blueberries in their pancakes and expect you to like it.  And the hash.  Oh, the hash.  Best.  Hash.  Ever.  The bf and some of his friends like getting the 2 eggs and hash plate, but I tend to order a pancake plus a side of hash.  Either way, make sure your meal includes hash -- it'll make your day. The service is friendly and prompt.  Your coffee cup is constantly refilled.  This place has an authentic small diner feel, and the wait staff knows a lot of the regular clientele.  If you're ever in the Upper Valley, stop by Shyrl's for a satisfying meal.
