I've been to Tequilas twice. The first time was almost 2 years ago, for my one-year anniversary with my then-boyfriend. It was absolutely fabulous. The waitstaff is amazing, they make great suggestions, and are more than willing to explain anything on the menu to you (which was necessary because my Spanish was a little rusty). My waiter recommended a "special" tequila drink. I can not tell you what else was in it because I have no idea, but it tasted like it was made of heaven. They also had a guacamole bar that night, and I think we got guacamole with pineapple and crab meat. Guacamole is one of my top 7 favorite foods, so if I'm saying it was awesome, it was AWESOME. For dinner I got some steak thingy and he got a mango fish dish, both fabulous. My second visit was just as great, and it was with a larger group of friends. We ended up closing the restaurant but they didn't rush us out or hover over us like some places do when it's getting late. I don't recall the food the second time but everyone loved it.
