Holy smokes! This place absolutely lives up to the hype. The Normande crepe (chicken, mushrooms, white wine, swiss cheese, cream, parsley, onions, and garlic) is definitely my favorite, but the Popeye (spinach, egg, swiss cheese, cream, and garlic) is also extremely good. I'm normally not a big fan of sweet things, but the lemon, butter, and sugar dessert crepe is very good with a nice dose of lemony tang. But, really, if you like chicken and mushrooms, do yourself a favor and order that Normande crepe. It's freaking delicious. Â  The whole place is bright, laid-back, and friendly. (For some strange reason I was expecting it to have dim lighting and lots of dark wood; to my delight, though, I was completely wrong about that). Our waitress told us that they have live music on Friday nights at 8:00 p.m., so I'm eager to check that out sometime. Pates Et Traditions is so absolutely worth the trek to Brooklyn! I will be back very, very soon.
