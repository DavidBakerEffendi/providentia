Taste GREAT Malaysian food!  I've had the Singapore Kari Laksa (fish curry soup with noodles) a few times, and it's been fantastic.  The Roti canai that they served is as good (or better) than any roti I've had in india.  One of my friends got a simple ginger chicken dish with white rice that also turned out to be incredibly flavorful and memorable.  The portions are large, the prices are cheap, and the staff is fairly friendly.  Even if you have no idea what to get, it seems like you can't go wrong here.  Amazing!
