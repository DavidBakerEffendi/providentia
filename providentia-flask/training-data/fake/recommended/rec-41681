This is the BEST BEST place to get middle eastern/ Mediterranean food. Every time I've gone here it's been 10/10 in terms of service, everyone is so nice and the place is always so clean. Being a vegetarian, I always order the falafel and it's always delicious!! Plus there are student discounts on your meal. Always great always delicious never get enough hummus and pita company !!
