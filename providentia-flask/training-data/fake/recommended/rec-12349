Ok, I've been to SO many Halal carts at this point that this place is good, but not the best.  There is ALWAYS  line ... always.  The only reason I keep coming back to this one is because when I have people visiting, this place is always on their list.  So, I've been here on different days and at ALL hours of the day ... so believe me when I tell you that there will always be a line. The food is pretty much priced as every other place, but I'll tell you my pros and cons. Pros: + large portions + great hours of operation + you can put as much white & red sauce you want Cons: + long line + no other options (gyros, etc) + different line for drinks + salad gets plated with rice while they wait for your meat preference, which makes the salad warm + they don't label their sauces, which makes room for a lot of ketchup instead of hot sauce =\ + all you get is rice, salad, and meat (other places I've been to would give falafel, potatoes, and etc) In the end I am still going to come back here when I have visitors, but I wouldn't go out of my way -- there are better carts in the city.
