The food is great, especially the steak.  But for some reason they don't mind being yet another Williamsburg restaurant  that takes their business for granted.  I ate here and sat at the bar in front of the cooks.  My wife ordered a steak with no parsley and for the next 30 mins I had to listen to the two cooks go back and forth mocking the ticket with no parsley.  No big deal, I just didn't want to pay 100 dollars for a meal and have to listen to the normal BS that entitled cooks talk about, over and over over. I told the waitress I wouldn't come back and they never thought to make the situation right, they just let us walk out the door and tell all of our friends not to eat here.  They must related to those "don't give  shit" chicks at Salty.
