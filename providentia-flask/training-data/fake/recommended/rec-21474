I was disappointed. :(  I didn't wanna be... the place looks great, with a full bar.  It has a lounge-y atmosphere with cool low lighting and the wait staff dressed in all black. But all I wanted was some good sushi, and I was disappointed because the menu didn't really have many non-traditional options.  I can get my tuna and yellowtail at Wegman's, thank you very much.  Yes, there's some deluxe rolls, but they didn't sound great. Don't get me wrong, it was yummy and fresh, but for the price, I wanted something new and refreshing.  When I was leaving, I noticed that they had specials that would've been interesting, but they didn't tell me inside what the specials were! Also, they had a large beer and wine selection from all over Asia, if they're into that kind of thing. I wasn't, though, so I came away disappointed.
