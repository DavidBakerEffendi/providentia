Outstanding brunch on Labor Day weekend.  We arrived just as they opened and were seated immediately.  Based on Yelp reviews, we chose the Short Rib Hash and Eggs and the Hangtown Fry.  Both were excellent, although we liked the Hangtown Fry just slightly better.  Restaurant was lovely, service was great, overall a fun way to spend a Sunday morning.
