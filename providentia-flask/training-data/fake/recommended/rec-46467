I would take off 1/2 star because of the location but other than that this place is fantastic. The meal my gf and I had was unbelieveable and, in my opinion, flawless. I started with the ceviche- cod in a vainegrette with melon and cilantro- unbelievablely fantastic. The flavors for this work better than just about any dish I've had in a long while. My gf had the salmon tartare in a white gaspacco. Again- fantastic. For the main, I had the flatiron steak and gf had the lamb. Both dishes were perfect. The steak had a spicy sauce, served with onions and fava beans. I wouldn't think this would have worked- but it was amazing. The lamb was excellent, great texture with a kind of sear to it. The potato puree was also fantastic as a side. Silky texture- I mean they were perfect. I rarely give 5 star reviews but I can't recommend this place enough. If you're looking for true culinary artistry- come to Riverpark. I would say this place beats Craft by a long way. Thye prices are totally reasonable for a place of this caliber as well. Wines we had were fantastic. Service amiable and attentive. We will DEFINITELY be back. Bravo!
