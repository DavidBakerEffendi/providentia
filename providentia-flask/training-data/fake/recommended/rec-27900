I don't know any other place in New York that offers such a deal for such tasty bites as Miriam's happy hour (till 8, 7:30 weekends.) We split almost all mezes from the menu, plus five drinks and desert and paid around $60 for 3 people. But absolutely regardless of the price, the food went above and beyond all expectations. We were scooping sauces with forks after solids were eaten, because they were so delicious. Jerusalem Bread, Spanakopita, Burekas, Roasted Beets, Zucchini Cake, Fried Eggplant and Breaded Cauliflower, Falafel, even Watermelon and Feta Tartare(!) were finger-licking good. Bartender serving us deserved probably the biggest percentage-wise tip I've left in a long time. Thanks Colombian place down 5th Ave for having an hour wait while Miriam was still uncrowded and "happy".
