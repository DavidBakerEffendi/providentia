Some coworkers took me here and I really liked it a lot.  I'm not usually a fan of ramen, but I had a change of heart after coming to Nom Nom.  I tried a vegetarian ramen with their original shio.  Their website describes it as: seasoned with salt and white soy sauce, tonkotsu broth. Comes with chashu, kikurage mushrooms, naruto, bamboo, scallions, and pickled ginger.  This one was my favorite.  I also tried pork ramen with the shoyu sauce (savory soy sauce tonkotsu broth is served with chashu, bamboo, kikurage mushrooms, naruto, and seaweed).  The shoyu was a bit too salty for me.  I preferred the shio and will probably get that again next time I go.  As for the ramen itself... the noodles are just the right consistency and the broth was delicious.  The vegetarian ramen comes with mushrooms, which I am a big fan of. I also really liked the pork ramen. Great for a cold day when you need something to warm you.  Definitely recommend it!   Tip: They're cash only!  But they have LevelUp!  Also, it gets pretty crowded around noon, so go at 11 or 1:30 if you want a table.  They also took a while to serve us around 1pm - and we got served really quickly when we went at 11.  So if that makes a difference to you, I'd say go on the earlier side.
