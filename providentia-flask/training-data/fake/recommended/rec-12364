Wow truly an amazing experience at illil, we came here for Saturday night dinner best of all didn't have to wait. Right from the beginning the decor was very welcoming and elegant, we were sited upstairs. Our server was great he helped us pick out the most popular items on the menu everything from the hummus to the pita to the shrimp was juicy and melted in your mouth. The chicken was spiced up well. Overall this is one of the must try restaurants in NYC, everyone was raving about their drinks although we didn't get to try. This is a pricy restaurant but it's worth every penny!!
