Loved Market Table. This is just down the street from my office so I went last night with a group of coworkers. Without a reservation we were seated within 10 minutes, though standing at the rather tight bar space was a little unpleasant. Otherwise, the service was extremely accommodating, the space was unpretentious and beautifully lit, and the noise level allowed for good conversation. We shared three appetizers, which were all great - gnocchi: so unusual to have fresh fava beans in the month of december, but the combination of favas and soppressata made for perfect bites - delicata squash and apple salad: very fresh and tangy, wished there was a little more squash and a little less apple however - beef carpaccio: really delicious! the french fry salad topping was an interesting touch I ordered the sea bream (recommended by my server), which was well cooked, though would've been better with just a touch more acid. My dinner companions had the burger special (great special at $18 for a burger and a pork slap ale), which were served with old bay fries. I'll return!
