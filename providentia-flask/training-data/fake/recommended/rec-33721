I have no complaints about the drink or food selection here. Most of the things I've had have been great. The manager was the definition of cold and aloof. As my friends and I were sitting down at our table the manager comes over and says "you can't do this" in a sharp tone. He said we were blocking traffic, but if he would have approached us in a different manner then he would know that we simply moved the table so our friends could squeeze into our seats then slid the table back. His "cleaning of the table" consisted of wiping a few peanut shells off the table. He left the rest of the peanut shells and drink marks on the table. I went up to him and asked if he could spray the table. He said that we didn't allow him the chance to do so. My main issue is the tone he used. It honestly seemed like he had a bad day and was taking it out on the customers. He took no accountability and sat on his phone in the corner the entire time. I should mention our waiter, Mike, helped save my disaster of a night. He was beyond kind and on top of serving us. Didn't feel respected or welcomed, sadly.
