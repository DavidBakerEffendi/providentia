For the record I was born in Manila and grew up with family members who cook Filipino food very, very well, so maybe I'm a bit of a stickler. Came here after a friend recommended this place over Jeepney. Had the pork belly and sirloin, and I was pleased with both. My friend and I both ordered jasmine rice to accompany the entrees. The rice was dry and not very well-made. Not sure how they messed up boiled white rice, but they did. This was at dinner on a Saturday night, by the way. Also it was $3 for one order of that terrible rice. This was the third Filipino/Thai/fusion place I've tried. Maharlika and Jeepney both exceeded my expectations (and I've visited both several times), while Pig and Khao... well, see above.
