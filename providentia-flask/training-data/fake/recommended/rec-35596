The good: Beer & desert The bad: The food was really disappointing and overpriced.  The double cheese burger looked and tasted _exactly_ like a McDonald's Big Mac.  Do they have a special waiter they send out to grab burgers from McD's up the street?? Not a bad place to go for light fare, but exactly the wrong place to go when you're actually hungry.
