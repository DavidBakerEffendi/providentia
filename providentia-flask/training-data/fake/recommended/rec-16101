I actually found this place on Yelp mobile late night on a Monday after leaving a comedy show at Dangerfield's.  It was our last night in the city, and what a way to go out!  We arrived there after midnight and the place was still fairly busy.  The decor was great, and the atmosphere was extremely romantic.  The wine list was extensive, as was the menu.  However, if you're looking for American-Italian classics like Fettucini Alfredo and Spaghetti with Meatballs....go to Carmines.  This place has a more authentic menu...a DELICIOUS authentic menu.  I had the stuffed chicken and my girlfriend had the penne.  Our waiter was efficient and friendly, not a stuffed shirt like I would ordinarily expect at that type of place.  While I was disappointed that the soda and iced tea we ordered were not refillable, otherwise the experience was wonderful, and the next time I'm in NYC, I will return to Uva.
