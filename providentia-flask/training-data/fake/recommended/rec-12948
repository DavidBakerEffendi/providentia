Came here on a Tuesday @ 11:45am expecting to get Breakfast. After waiting about 20 minutes for a table our server informed us that breakfast is only served until 11:45am:( After getting over the shock factor, we decided to stay and check out lunch options. I ordered the Warm Brie and Green Apple sandwich and my husband ordered a burger. I'd have to say that both meals were completely underwhelming and basic. This was probably my least favorite meal while in NYC. We ordered a slice of Red Velvet cake to go and it was really tasty and not overly sweet (+1 star because I'm a RV fan). The setup of the restaurant and overall decor was cute. Our server was efficient and polite - no complaints there. I'd definitely like to come back for Breakfast / Brunch the next time I'm in the area.
