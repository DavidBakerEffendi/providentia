Luigi's is probably the best pizza in the Fairmount/Art Museum Area. I am a fan of pizza that sits out for hours and starts to dry up and curl until being re-animated in the oven. It's kind of like magic. It is pretty good though and is my favorite place to grab a slicey-poo in Fairmount. I cannot comment on anything else they have.
