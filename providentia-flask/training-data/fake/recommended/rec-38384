Went here last night with my boyfriend we had the Dan dan noodles, spring rolls, the garlic style chicken and the kung pao shrimp. The noodles were fantastic, The spring rolls mediocre, and both entrees were terrific! We ordered our entrees to come with brown rice and they seemed to skimp and not give enough for two entrees worth. No big deal. So I ordered another side of brown rice, and the kitchen was all out and I was told it would be a half hour. No wonder for the skimp. So i took white rice instead. Mind you iit was 7pm on a Saturday night. The service is no muss, no fuss, but we wanting something quick with great good and han dynasty nailed it.
