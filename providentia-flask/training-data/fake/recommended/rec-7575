Um, what the f' was that fresh spring roll thing they served up?  It had some wierd sauce thing on it......it was large.....it looked like a fresh lumpia that my parents used to get as a special "after church treat".   The restaurant made up for the whatever-that-was-"freshspringroll" by having a respectable green curry.  However, aside from the tofu that I requested, there were a few slivers of bell peppers and about 6 eggplant slices.  Whoa nelly, don't go crazy. It was okay.  I guess there is  a better Thai spot up the road a bit.
