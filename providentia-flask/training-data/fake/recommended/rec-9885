We kicked off the meal with the Sheep's Milk Ricotta crostini, which was multiple thumbs up good! The sea salt, herbs and oil really provided texture to the soft cheese and bread. Locanda Verde also gave us some bruschetta which had thin tomatoes and pesto - it packed a lot of flavor for not looking like it did and was fluffy to the bite. And for the piece de resistance I split the garlic chicken for two, which had vegetables and potatoes. If a restaurant can do chicken well it is an indicator to me that they can do everything else and boy did Locanda Verde deliver. The garlic was still on the skin of the chicken so the flavor and moisture were contained and the chicken was effortless to cut into. The house wine was fantastic and we drank it up like water. No complaints on service and for NY the price wasn't so bad for the high caliber of meal we had.
