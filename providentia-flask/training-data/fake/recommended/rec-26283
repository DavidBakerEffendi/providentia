I waited about 45 minutes to an hour in line and then finally got the roast pork with broccoli rabe and provolone sandwich. Is it the best sandwich in America? Probably not, but it was damn tasty and it was pretty big. Bottom line is that it hit the spot and I was satisfied at the end of the meal. I would probably come back if I am ever in the area and have an hour to kill.
