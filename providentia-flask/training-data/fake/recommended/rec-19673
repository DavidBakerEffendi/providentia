The food was good - a year ago. Is it me or the food has gotten more salty over time? I used to crave this place and would go every month to satisfy my cravings but now the food is more salty and the wait is longer and longer, especially on the weekends. I would recommend ordering take out and going to the bar next door (upstairs), since they allow you to bring in food as long as you buy drinks. Plus there is a better chance Â that you will actually be able to hear your group and have conversations at the bar next door versus at the Boil. P.S. Cash only.
