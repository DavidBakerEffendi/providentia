I really wanted to like this place, as I LOVE Indonesian food, but the price points are just way too high relative to the quality of food and size of portions.   WTF - a bowl of soup broth with one scoop of rice and a few bits of chicken for $15?  This should have been an appetizer priced at $5-6.  Expect to order more than one entree, and to spend (with appetizers) $30-40+ per person - in this remote area of Greenpoint So frustrating to over-spend for dinner, and then go to the deli on the way home because I'm still hungry.  It's places like this that ruin and gentrify the neighborhood.
