Kind of an overdue review. This is an awesome place for breakfast! Waited an hour and a half on a weekend for brunch. I would say it is a wait worth waiting for. While waiting, I saw some people wearing pajama did take out: very smart idea if you live close by. I am a huge fan of their blueberry pancakes. They are fresh, soft and buttery...eat it with fresh squeezed orange juice....yum~ ~ The place itself is pretty small and is a bit loud since you will be almost on top of your neighbors. I don't really care so much, just give me the pancakes!!
