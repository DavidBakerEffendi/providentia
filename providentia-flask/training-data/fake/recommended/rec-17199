As a Haitian-American, I was skeptical because my mom cooks thee best food in the world, but my sister convinced my family to go for my dad's birthday. Amazing. My parents are America's biggest critics of commercialized Haitian food but they LOVED IT!!! Food: Absolutely delicious. All of their meet is cooked to perfection but still tender and savory. Each of us ordered a different plate and we were all thoroughly satisfied with the food. Their griot (fried pork) is hands down the best I've ever had. Ever. The appetizer "Belle Capoise" is griot with fried plantains. It's amazing. It's served with flavory sauce that will rock your mind. I had the legumes and rice. Absolutely delicious. Service: Excellent. The waitress was extremely friendly and attentive to us. She knew the menu well and had excellent suggestions. Ambiance: Serene and intimate. This is a versatile spot. It worked well for our father's birthday dinner but I also saw other couples on dates and some families there. The music is low but they play mellow traditional Haitian songs. (They did turn the volume up for the birthday music they played for my father which was fun!) Price: The menu is pretty pricy. Expect to spend at least $27/ person. Overall, I would recommend it. It's a great spot with great people and great food!
