Came here for a casual dinner to catch up with a friend. I had book marked this place a while ago and was excited to finally try it. Cute atmosphere that would be great for a date night or a girls night. Shortly after being seated our waiter greeted us and asked if there were any food allergies. I told her I was gluten free and next thing I know, they are brining me gluten free bread as a started. (win!) I ordered the butternut squash ravioli with the brown butter sage sauce, which was delicious. I loved that they had multiple stuffed gluten free pastas. I was too full for dessert, but definitely want to go back and try for g free deliciousness!
