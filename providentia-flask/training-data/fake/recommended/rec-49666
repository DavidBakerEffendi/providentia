Went to watch the NFL games while I was visiting NJ. Bar is standing room only while the games are on and they could probably use another bar tender to keep up. Speaking of bar tenders... I ordered a bloody mary and a cup of water to start and the guy (chubby, bad attitude and wearing a number 91- Tuck , Giants jersey) tells me they only SELL bottled water. OK I say as I really have no choice but to pay for water in a sports bar. What kind of sports bar only sells water? Well it turns out the other bar tenders are GIVING water from the fountain to other customers. I say something to the manger and he tells me their told to do this during the games!! Unbelievable, I think that's called lying to bump up the bill. As far as food we had a Dan Marino chicken sandwich which was wonderful and a Caesar salad which was pretty good. Â We didn't get a print out of our bill (shocking) but our 2 meals and 3 bloody Marys came to $48 bucks.
