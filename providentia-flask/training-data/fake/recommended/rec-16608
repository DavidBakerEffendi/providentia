Initial Reaction: Very cozy, calm and easy-going.  Great, hip and diverse crowd.  Looked like everyone had been lounging around for hours.  I'm sure the subdued lighting had something to do with it. Food: I've been here several times and gotten the hummus, tahini platter and the pesto pasta and the falafel pita and all of it has been WONDERFUL.  In the summer, it's a great place to lounge with a beer or coffee and people watch.   Service: The waiters are your friends.   Value: You're getting the most bang for your buck.  Everything's priced reasonably (~$10), but I warn you, you'll have trouble holding back from ordering everything! Left Thinking: This is MY spot (lots of others thought this too unfortunately).  If I ever get off at Astor place, I'd be hard pressed not to just stop for a visit.
