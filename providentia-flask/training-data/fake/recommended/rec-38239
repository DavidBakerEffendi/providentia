I went here with my in-laws and it seemed like an alright sort of place. Nothing note worthy, really, but definitely passable. Our waiter was entertaining and personable. I ordered the New Englander Burger rather expecting a patty made of lobster and was surprised to get a gargantuan sandwich with not only a burger patty, but chunk claw meat on top of it. It was really difficult to make a meal of. Judging by the look of everyone else's burgers, I wasn't the only one facing that challenge. The pickle that came with the meals was kind of bland. More like a cucumber with an odd texture than a pickle, really. Highlights of the meal include the sazerac I ordered to kick things off after a day of driving and the truffle fries I got as a side. I didn't finish the burger, but I definitely took out those fries. The meat hooks as light fixtures with old style filament bulbs are a nice point for the decor. Overall, I don't think I'd come back here given the chance. Or if I did, I'd only do so for drinks and apps. We went in for an early dinner, so there wasn't a wait, but I did hear the line gets quite long most nights. To their credit, it's unlikely you'll leave with an empty stomach. But I can't say it was the best burger I've ever had, either.
