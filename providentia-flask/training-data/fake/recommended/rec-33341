I am giving this place four stars because I feel that it's unethical to give a pizza joint five stars, unless it's Mike's Pizza in the Bronx--a total-hole-in-the wall that no longer exists. Roberta's is one of those over-hyped places. And it lives up to the hype. Also, apparently it's gluten-free. Generally, I'm one of those principled people who believes if you're going to splurge, then do it right (as in who cares if it's gluten free?) Well, no taste is compromised. We ordered a few different pizzas, since we were unable to decide amongst our large group which three or four kinds we should order. Each bite of pizza was equally or better than the other. I had to go outside for a quick walk just to take it all in. Ordinarily, two slices of pizza leave me feeling full and overwhelmed. Their pizza does not. If you are in Manhattan, make the trip to Roberta's. See what the hype is all about for yourself and judge away!
