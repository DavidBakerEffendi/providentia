Came here today with a couple friends. We arrived around 1 PM (ish); just after the lunch rush and before dinner rush, so it was perfect: not packed, but not empty. We were seated in a booth by a hostess and got drinks pretty quickly, then placed our orders for the ramen bowls (two chicken and one pork). Took about 15-20 minutes for those, which left us ample time to try the kaitenzushi (or "kaiten sushi" as they spell it). Really cool concept! Basically, a bunch of different sushi dishes go around on a conveyor belt and you just take what you want. The plates are color coded by price; green is the cheapest ($1.95) to purple ($7-and some change). I got a green plate of the avocado roll-simple but a nice, light starter. I also got a california roll (yellow). There was other standard fare, such as rainbow rolls and seaweed salad, but had some other "americanized" dishes I didn't care to try (BLT roll and buffalo chicken roll). One of my friends got a terriyaki chicken roll-we all tried it and didn't really care for it (the texture was off). They also have a chocolate mousse cake (blue plate) which was REALLY good! (I managed to nab two plates, but only near the end of our time there; they kept getting grabbed). The ramen bowls were also amazing; flavorful and just perfect on a cold, rainy day. I got the chicken ramen but next time I'll try the pork. :) All in all, I really loved my first time here. They could make a few changes (such as keeping the sushi truly authentic), and making sure there's ample variety going around, but it's well-executed overall. I'll definitely be back!
