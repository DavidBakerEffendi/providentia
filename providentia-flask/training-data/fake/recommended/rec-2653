I really wanted to love this place but it was just "meh" to me... I got the short rib cheese fries they were just "okay". They don't have Happy Hour specials (I went on a Monday) which I wasn't too fond of. I got the Philadelphia cocktail...it taught me that I'm not built for brown liquor so I won't be drinking it ever again. I'm not a burger person so maybe that is why this place is just not for me....I won't be back.
