I've been on a healthy living hiatus for the last month and come Monday I need to get back on track. John's was my first stop on my last hurrah fat ass tour. Roast Beef w/onions and fresh mozzarella,gravy on the side is my go to. I also ordered fried ravioli's,bc the nice guy making my sandwich made me try one. I thought mmmmm good,I'll order those next time since I have many more food stops to go. After putting much thought into the decision I realized...it will be a really long time before I can have them. So,I did the right thing and ordered them. Mmmmm good. Next time...I need to try the Jamaican beef patty with melted mozz on a roll,the group of people in front of me ordered,sounded interesting..
