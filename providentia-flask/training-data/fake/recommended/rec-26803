I've been trying to find a good dim sum place Â for a while now. After coming here, I still haven't found one. The food, way way too salty. After asking for water the entire time, I eventually got it. I didn't drink it, however, after seeing a waiter pour two half empty cups into a pitcher before bringing it to us. I'm not sure where these decent reviews are coming from. But I had an absolutely deplorable experience, only comparable to customer service of Verizon and food of McDonalds.
