Of the sandwich places in Philly I visited this was the best place for sure. Â We arrived around 11 AM on Sunday morning and there was no line, We just sat down on the stool and 7 minutes later the roast beef with sweet peppers sandwich was in front of me. . I added some additional banana peppers and horseradish and it was excellent. I really like how the additional "gravy" was put on and the bottom of the bun is soaking in it. Staff was friendly and service was prompt. Glad I came here and a must stop for anyone who enjoys a good, hearty sandwich.
