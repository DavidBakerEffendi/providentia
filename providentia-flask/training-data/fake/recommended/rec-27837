At best, food is adequate, prices are affordable, atmosphere is young & noisy.  Nothing special.  However, the real nail in the coffin was their lack of  Latino hospitality.  Our party of 7 was a 75th birthday celebration for my husband's Mom, so we bought a cake with us.  They charged us $2 p/p for cutting the cake.  Truthfully,  the money was less of an issue than their lack of warmth & generosity towards a beautiful senior.  On Latina principal alone, never again!
