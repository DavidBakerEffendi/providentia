Based on the Yelp reviews my family and I visited Soul de Cuba last Saturday evening at around 5:00 pm and were seated right away - thanks Nicolette H.!  The reviews are all true!  We tried the empanada appetizer (exquisite), the Pollo Sol de Cuba (fragrant plantains and flavorful fruit salsa).  Steve had the pulled pork entree which was excellent.  My daughter and husband finished the meal with flan (first time for both) and were quite satisfied.  Thank you everyone for the recommendation.
