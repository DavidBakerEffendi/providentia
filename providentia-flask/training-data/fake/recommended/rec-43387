Not a bad place.  I've eaten here twice this week, mainly because it's open late enough to serve food until rehearsals end. The food is good, but overpriced.  The Cajun Mac and Cheese is really quite good.  The wait staff is generally helpful, but the servers are reluctant to seat people unless the party is complete.   this is fine if the place is packed, but in neither case was is so. If Princeton had a wider variety of later-night eats available I'd probably try to find something else, but this seems  to be about all that's available with the exception of Hoagie Haven after 10.00.
