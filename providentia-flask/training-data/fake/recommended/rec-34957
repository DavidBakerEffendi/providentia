Great establishment.  Trina (the bartender) is kind and welcoming, especially to newbies.  The feel is that of a German VFW hall, and it works, making you feel at home.  The menu is fairly extensive for bar food, is reasonably priced ($6 burger + fries) and tastes great.  We also ordered chicken fingers, which we murdered, seriously good food.  The chef brought our meal out, and was also very sweet.  Don't come here looking for a wall of draft beers (they have 3) but do come here if you like German beers in huge glasses for $5.  Don't forget karaoke, live music, flea markets, and warm vibes, this place rules.
