Truly mediocre. No wonder they have a "no reservations necessary" sign out front, and no wonder they have open tables when Pepe's, the pizza joint next door, has a line down the block. About as expensive as Skappo, for the quality of a chain restaurant and worse service. We ordered two pasta dishes, a salad, a pizzette appetizer and a kid's pizza. The pizzas were so cheesy and floppy and greasy they had to be eaten with a fork and knife, the salad was so forgettable I've already forgotten it, and both pasta dishes were greasy, overcooked, and disappointing. Plus it took an hour for the food to arrive (even the salad), and we had a small child with us. If you're hungry for non-pizza Italian in New Haven, try Skappo, and visit their next door market if they're open. Skappo digs aren't fancy and the food ain't cheap, but it's legit northern Italian, and absolutely divine.
