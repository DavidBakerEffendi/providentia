I could write a simple review for this place, but I think I'll tell a quick story that tells you everything you need to know instead: Curious drunk guy outside Pommes Frites at 2 am: "What's the deal with this place?" My drunk friend waiting in line: "Best f***ing french fries in the history of the world you piece of sh*t." To make a long story short, this did not lead to a fight. Instead, both drunks received their delicious fries, went their separate ways, and lived happily ever after (probably). The end. Note: the fries are just as good sober, but I really appreciate a good late night spot to help subdue the effects of a night of drinking in the East Village. And so did our two protagonists.
