Red Hook Lobster Pound is good, but not GREAT. I came here about twice and both times, I got the Maine lobster roll. The lobster was average portioned, & lobster meat had good consistency...flavor was just OK. Overall, I like Luke's Lobster more. I would come again if I was around the area and craving for lobster, but that's about it.
