I have to say that the food here is amazing, but the service is not. I've been going to this restaurant since I found out about it three years ago, and recently my family was visiting so I wanted to show them this amazing restaurant(or so I thought). Well as soon as we arrived we were rushed through our meal. First the manager comes up and asks when we were gonna order our main course because they had a table coming in at 8:00pm. First of all I don't like to be rushed, especially when I'm trying to enjoy my meal and the company of my family. Second of all we had just ordered a bottle of wine and our appetizers; The bill was already 100 dollars, its not like they weren't making money off of us! I digress, the meal went on and we ordered our main course entrees and another bottle of wine, we finished our entrees and waiters rushed to clear our plates off the table. We decide to order dessert and coffee and more dessert and more wine (We don't see each other very often) and continue to enjoy each others company, and just when we were finishing up the manager comes over AGAIN and states that "The next party that was reserved at our tablehas been outside waiting for twenty min so if we could please hurry." Â Apparently Caseus has only one table they take reservations for in the whole entire restaurant. We paid our bill and left, and will never be back again.
