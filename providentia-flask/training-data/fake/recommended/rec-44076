This is a good, solid place to go for happy hour, and my friends and I have been doing just that for the past few months. The food is quite good, and so is the service for the most part (a little slow as it gets later and the place gets fuller, but still an acceptable wait time.) My only complaints are that there could be more of a turn-over with the menu items, and it's often a tough squeeze when there are more than six people in the party. Â Try the haloumi, the eggplant parm, and the oysters.
