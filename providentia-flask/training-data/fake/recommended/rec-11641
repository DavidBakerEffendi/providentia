Was kind of scratching my head after eating here and after reading this place had a four star rating. As far as the ambiance and vibe inside the restaurant it's great. Friendly staff, efficient, cool people, lively atmosphere. As far as the food goes, it was a let down. Started off with the Fluke which was so drench in cucumber sauce you might as well have given me a bowl of sliced cucumber in water. Moved onto the pork buns after, which to me, pork buns are probably one of my favorite foods in the world. They however were a big let down. The sauces are great on it but the pork itself was far too fatty and lacked any flavor. If you want real pork buns go to Ippudo, their pork buns will literally make your head explode. The only saving grace of the food here was the spicy sausage and rice cake main dish. Spicy but not so spicy you will voluntarily do the ice bucket challenge on the spot to cool yourself off. It's also a hefty dish, worth splitting with someone else and worth the money. This place is trendy and I think people will continue the trend of giving it good reviews for that reason but there's plenty of other similar good food places in the area.
