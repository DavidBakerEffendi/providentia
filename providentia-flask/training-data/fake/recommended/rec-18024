Okay, so my friends make fun of me for liking this place so much, but I stand by it. I've tried all the different types of rolls at one point or another but I stick by the aloo masala and achari paneer, the rest are okay but these two are FANTASTIC. The food is fresh and service is quick, but it is greasy and not healthy, so definitely not a place I go to often but still awesome when I do.
