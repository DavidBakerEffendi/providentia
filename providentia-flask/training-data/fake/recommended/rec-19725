Nice spot, semi-industrial area, tucked way in a building est. 1898. Looks like this place is for Mets Fans too. TVs are large, HD as well. Cozy corners, seating for small and large groups, and large walk up bar, quick and friendly serving staff. Haven't found a bar (yet) that offers Kopparberg Pear Cider...yet just moved to Midtown so everything is a first. The beer menu is diverse, offering bottles for $4-$5, and cans for $5-$6. Range of brews including Magic Hat, Bronx Brewery, Six Point, and standard inter/national brands like Corona & Budweiser. Â Draft beers range from &4-$6 as well, including Brooklyn Brewery, Shock Top, Left Hand. The bar offers a selection of Seasonal Drafts per request and rotating High Gravity/ABV beers each month. Dine-In/Take Out w Free Delivery too! Menu pretty standard American (grease, meat, fats, burgers and dogs). Good selection! $1 Off Beer, Wells, Wine Happy Hour: 11AM-7PM Mon-Sat PLUS Daily Specials.
