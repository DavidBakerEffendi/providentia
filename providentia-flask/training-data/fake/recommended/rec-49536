I've been to this place 3 times, and every item I've ordered here tastes really great. I just went there today to get 2 rolls I've never tried before-- Mighty Mushroom and La Fiesta. So delicious! The rolls taste REALLY fresh. I'm talking ridiculously good flavors here. Â The next time I head over I'll probably call it in first and then pick up the rolls later, because it did take a while for them to make it. But, when the stuff tastes this good, I really don't mind waiting. I also like the openly visible preparation area, so i can see exactly how clean the place is and what they're doing to my food as they're preparing it right in front of me. These guys are artists, and make the food taste great and look really mouth-watering. I also got the Vanilla Chia Seed Pudding. I've never really thought of doing much with chia seeds other than putting them on a chia pet (although I never actually did that, I just saw it on TV commercials), but I have to say it was really delicious. Kind of like a lighter version of tapioca pudding.
