Love this place, just discovered it recently when a friend of mine dragged me here for beer and fried pickles. Admittedly, brunch here could afford to get a little more creative, perhaps a drink special or something to lure in potential brunchers. Have to say though, every time I've come here during the week something random, or awesome, has happened.  Good place to meet people.  Don't forget to check in on foursquare! Deep fried pickles are an absolute MUST.  Great neighborhood bar!
