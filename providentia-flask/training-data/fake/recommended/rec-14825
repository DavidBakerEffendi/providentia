Only can speak to the food since we ordered take out. The grilled wings with honey BBQ chipotle sauce was amazing:) It's under the appetizer menu, but the portions were great - plenty to make it an entree. Boyfriend has a pulled pork sandwich with side of cheese fries and gravy. He said it was amazing. The only reason why they get a 4 star is because their gumbo wasn't the greatest. In any case, tasty food! Planning on eating in next time!
