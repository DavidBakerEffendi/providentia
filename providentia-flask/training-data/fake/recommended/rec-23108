I was very excited to try the new menu and I have to say the food was just subpar. The koftas lamb app was extremely over salty and was promptly returned. The bean soup supposedly had meat balls I never found one. Barely finished it.. Ordered the pasta with shrimp, Mussels, clams and fish.. Very tiny portion of pasta.. Pasta is cheap unless perhaps it was homemade but I'm pretty sure it wasn't  but the big bummer was the the seafood portion  3 clams 2 were missing  2 mussels 2 shrimp  and no fish to be found at all. When I brought this to the waitresses  attention all she did was shrug and apologize.  I asked if she spoke to the manager, she said yes but apparently they couldn't be bothered to come to the table to rectify the situation.. The dish was $19 and I would have paid  more if I could have received a substantial plate with the correct seafood..Totally ridiculous.... The polenta sticks are good but thats about it. The free dessert thing is lame, confusing  and the portion is tiny. I did call the manager after we left  apparently she never even knew of an issue.. Poor communication among staff.. She was nice enough to ask what she could do but I've yet to decide if I want a refund or will i give the place another try..  we were  missing soup spoons, no bread plates. etc The service is fine, but not great considering this really isn't a diner anymore.. The place seemed pretty empty to me  it was once a bustling fun place...  They need a major staff, food overhaul if their going to make it.. I definitely like the idea of the juice bar and grass fed meats  but if its not executed correctly whats the point...
