GourHeave got me through college...but goddammit that place is gross. Â The prices used to change on things depending on the time of day (seriously), and as appreciative as I am for a place that sells $6.00 boxes of newman's own popcorn and fluffernutter mix at 3 AM when you really need it, I'd rather risk the walk to shaws.
