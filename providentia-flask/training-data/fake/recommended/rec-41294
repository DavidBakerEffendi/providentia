Room Service seemed to have good reviews on Yelp so we gave it a shot before seeing a show. The decor is cold and unimaginative and the the tables are a little tight- but the food was delicious! We had curry puffs, pad Thai, and spicy Thai basil with beef- all were very tasty. Also had pumpkin Thai flan which was good. And it's cheap, for NYC. The food and cost make this a 4 star for me.
