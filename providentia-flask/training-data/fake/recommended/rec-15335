When in Philly you've got to have a Cheesesteak. A couple of the guards at liberty bell recommended Sonny's. Thought the Cheesesteak (with Whiz) was 3 - 4 stars.. Fries,,, prob about a 2. I was surprised that at 2:pm on a Friday there were only a couple of customers in the place. I had a very short wait for the food. Sandwich was good but not good enough for me to not want to try others in the area the next time I'm in Philly. Â Make sure to bring cash since no credit cards are excepted.
