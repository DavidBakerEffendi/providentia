A star knocked off for the price and limited menu, but the food was fresh and fantastic and the servers and bartenders were extremely knowledgeable and attentive on a busy weekend night. They described in detail how drinks were made, what was in the food, and made sure we were completely content with everything. So great service, great food, pricey and small menu - but worth the quality.
