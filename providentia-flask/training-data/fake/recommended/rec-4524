OK, let's start with the bread.  Freshly baked (not on the premises, but fresh that day), steaming, with the crust very crispy and the center creamy smooth.  My paleo diet went out the window as soon as that bread hit the table. We had two salads, including one with fresh rocket (arugula, sorry since I learned, last winter, that Europeans call arugula rocket, I couldn't resist) and feta that was some of the tastiest we have ever had.  The other tapas we had were gazpacho (excellent, and I judge all gazpachos against my wife's, which is the best!), cod fritters (tasty), eggplant tapenade (spicy yummy), empanadas (beef and chicken, nice dipping sauces (guacamole with the chicken, and tomato with the beef), crust was a bit too crunchy, more like deep fried pie dough) and anchovies (the only disappointment, too fishy).  For desserts we shared the chirps with chocolate and the dulce de leche crepes (particularly tasty). Excellent wine list! The only thing we were puzzled about was why Barcelona does not have a sign on the building, telling patrons where it is?!?!  It's on the NW corner of Temple and Crown.  Go there!
