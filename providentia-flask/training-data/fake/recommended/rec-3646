A Brooklyn staple- the perfect place to take friends/family from out of town to give them a taste of "real" New York. The prices are great (less than $10 for many main dishes) although you'll need to bring cash or use their in-house ATM. Don't get turned off by the long lines, either --- unlike most Brooklyn brunch places, Tom's cares about you while you're waiting around to be seated. They bring you lots of food and drinks while you're in line, all free of charge -- coffee in the winter time, ice water in the summer, and always plenty of bite sized french toast and sausage.
