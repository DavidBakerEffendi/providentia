This place still smells a little like the punk rock jam place it used to be when it once hosted bands like Smashing Pumpkins- but don't let the odor detract. The outside is like a little hut one would find along the real Khyber Pass (I would imagine, never been) and you feel like you are about to enter someplace really really cool. A little back story- the owner (was) a very cool guy who lived for years above the bar (grew up there really)- he was the catalyst for the bands and atmosphere long ago and was quite the party guy- then he got in trouble- and then got super religious... and then was one of the people behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks- and is now in jail forever. Soooo..... Here is why I felt hip while at Khyber Pass Pub which is now a gastropub with awesome beer. 1. Beer menu is always updated and before they print new ones, they will actually stamp "kicked" on the beers that just blew (I like how I never have to hear "oooh, we're sorry, we're out of that" while it is still on the menu". I enjoyed a Victory Ale (Czech style ale) and a Great Lakes Octoberfest (Marzen- soooo good and smooth) while there and my husband delighted in the cask style ales. A very good selection of very good beers- Reminds me of Mahaffey's Pub in Canton Baltimore. 2. The food - it is like a Gastropub - delicious and interesting: ~Fresh Popped Benton's Bacon Grease Popcorn cajun seasoning - $3!!!! Wowow!!!! Bacon + Popcorn = LOVE LOVE LOVE ~Fried Okra with Alabama white bbq sauce $5 ~Hickory Smoked Barbecue- Three Way three full portions of meat, three sides $36- but worth it- you also get 3 different sauces to dip the meat in: Sauces: Kansas City-style ketchup base, North Carolina-style vinegar base, South Carolina-style mustard base 3. They have a great jukebox!
