Stopped in today and got the 'new and improved' classic. Although I never tried the earlier classic. Now it is meatballs, marinara (I refuse to call it gravy or red sauce), spinach, mozz and caramelized onions. Holy shit! It now beats out the Village Turkey as best sandwich. Also I think their fries seem to be getting better, if that's possible.
