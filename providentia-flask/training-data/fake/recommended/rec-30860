Ordered delivery from seamless on a Sunday at 2:00. Food came quick and despite the rain was still hot. Â I ordered a chicken Caesar salad and fried calamari. The chicken Caesar salad was so delicious, the dressing was amazing and the chicken was really good. The fried calamari was good too, a little too heavily breaded, but still tasted good and wasn't too chewy (I'm speaking relatively because it was delivery so it wasn't fresh out of the fryer). I would definitely order from here again and want to go in for brunch.
