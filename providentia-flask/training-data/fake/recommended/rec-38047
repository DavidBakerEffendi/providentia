Cheers to you darkest of the bamboo, This is my favorite Chinese/American style food around. My absolute favorite part of eating here is that I don't feel I'm going to die after wards. Most other places the sugars and salties take over and I feel I have made a terrible choice and will lose a couple years of life. I have been trying a little bit of everything and its all pretty solid.
