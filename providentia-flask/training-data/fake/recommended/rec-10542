I was lead to this location starry eyed.  How can one not be on cloud nine in such a fantastic area?  I was told we were going to a bar which had basically been around since the beginning of time...well maybe only since the early 1800s.  It definitely was tiny but incredibly charming, with exposed rich dark wood beams.  I suppose we weren't beautiful enough to be seated next to the window at a front table...but it didn't matter in the end because the food was fantabulous!  I had a really yummy salad and the best burger I have ever eaten.  I apologize for my lack of additional descriptive words, but you will be pleasantly surprised with their food.
