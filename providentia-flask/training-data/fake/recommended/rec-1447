Disappointing. My wife is a pescatarian and I am vegetarian friendly, despite my love for meat proteins. Their menu has great variety that can meet the needs of a diverse company of diners. Unfortunately the flavors were either off or just didn't work at all. We started with the clam flat bread (OK) and the tuna tartar. The tuna dish was missing citrus and though fresh and light, it lacked flavor. For the mains- Scallops with linguini and spicy BBQ seitan. The scallops where succulent and prepared well on their own, however they were lost in the very heavy linguini and thick sauce. The BBQ was neither spicy or had smoky BBQ qualities. To be frank, it tasted like bland tomato paste. The couscous was even more bland (but would have complimented a more spicy, smoky BBQ dish). The atmosphere is nice but the wait staff was dressed so casual that you almost couldn't tell who they were, it just didn't go with the aesthetic of the restaurant. The one thing we really did like...the mixed drinks. In the end neither of us finished our plates and it was really hard to sign the $$$ check.
