We went here on Black Friday because they were doing a a special Blackout Brunch event featuring dark beers. The brunch menu was special, featuring "thanksgiving leftovers" themed items. I got The crispy mashed potatoes and country ham eggs benedict and my friend got a build your own omelet( he added Gruyere and house made turkey sausage). The eggs Benedict was great and the crispy lil mashed potato Pattys were so yummy. The cheese in the omelette was not melted at all but the house made turkey sausage was very good. They had an excellent selection of dark craft beers for the event, and they do have a flight option. Our waitress was super friendly, and I really liked the atmosphere. Street parking wasn't an issue (maybe because most ppl are out shopping). I would love to return to try thier regular menu.
