Tried this place for Happy Hour last week and we were impressed. Nice beer selection (on TV's so you can see it all over), great staff and bartenders. The renovation on the old space looks like a million bucks, so trendy! We had limited appetizers during the visit which were OK, but I won't judge yet and I'll be back for dinner soon and base my food judgement on that visit. We are in such need of cool, hip, trendy restaurants and bars in Forest Hills. And more importantly places that serve great food! I shouldn't have to run to Manhattan, Astoria or downtown Brooklyn to get good food. This place has gotten off to a good foot in my book. Keep up the good work and please don't let the food slack, we know better, there are foodies all around FoHi!
