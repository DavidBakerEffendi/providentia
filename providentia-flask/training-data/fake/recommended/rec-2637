Fitler Dining Room has so much potential, but unfortunately it just doesn't deliver. Fitler was on my must try list for Philly so I was really looking forward to my meal there. I looked at the menu beforehand and I couldn't find a single plate that I didn't want to try. The menu is small, but it has a great variety of proteins and seasonal ingredients. My friend and I went on a weeknight with a reservation. The dining room was pretty full but we were seated promptly in a comfy booth. The ambiance is very cozy and intimate, perfect for a date or catching up with a friend. We decided to share a bottle of wine, a plate of fried oysters, a pasta dish, short rib, and fried chicken. Clearly, we were very ambitious. The oysters were ok, nothing spectacular - lots of breading, little meat, good dipping sauce. The pasta was entirely over salted, I couldn't have more than two bites. The short rib was very tender, but the glaze on top was once again too salty. I wanted so badly to enjoy it, but I couldn't get past the salt. The fried chicken had nice texture and flavor. It was served with this gigantic piece of Texas toast that didn't seem to add anything to the plate. Overall, everything that we ordered sounded and looked fantastic, but turned out to be heavy and over seasoned. Our waiter was very attentive initially, but when we asked for a little extra time to decide on our entrees, he disappeared for what seemed like twenty minutes. This led to an undesirably long wait between our pasta dish and our entrees. Honestly I would like to give Fitler another chance, but I don't know if I can risk another overly salty meal, especially given the pricey menu.
