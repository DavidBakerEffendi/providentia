My husband and I had a fantastic meal at Fond. He doesn't usually like swordfish, but his fish was cooked to perfection and the flavors in all the dishes were beautifully concentrated. I love that it feels like a cozy BYO, but it has a liquor license, so you don't have to drag bottles of wine all over the city. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable. We will definitely return.
