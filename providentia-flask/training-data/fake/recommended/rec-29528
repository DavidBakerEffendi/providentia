First of all, Green Rock is not in Kensington it is in Port Richmond. Kensington is a slum and begins on the other side of Aramingo Avenue! Get it right! While Green Rock is a good looking bar, they could do better when it comes to bartenders. Who hires these young girls who do nothing but prance around the bar looking sexy? They can't talk, they can't think, they cannot act as communicators. They are nothing like the classic bartenders--males who acted as therapists and counselors, bartenders who had experience, who "knew" people. Green Rock's bartenders might as well be Dialah's Den strippers. I know that right now the trend (for bartenders) is dumb, fake and plastic, but it is getting tiresome. These young girls know nothing. So, Green Rock Tavern, mix up the bartenders, get a guy in there over 30 who has some people experience. I am sure that the girl bartenders are nice, they just don't know how to converse or have an intelligent conversation.
