There some dishes that are truly amazing and others that left me wondering what the point was. The signatures dishes are the potato encrusted sea bass and the basil ice cream with strawberries. Both of these are wonderful. Delicate flavors, wonderful textures. I thoroughly recommend these. The penne bolognese was average, the gnocchi with slow cooked pork was heavy and over composed. The candied squash blossoms were whack you over the head sweet (so if you like that, go for it). The boar sausage was average to good. The decor is modern and a bit sterile, the service was terrific.
