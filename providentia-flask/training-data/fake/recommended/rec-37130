Came here with my girlfriend, it was super crowded and loud...but fun. Luckily we grabbed 2 stools directly in front of the door so we got fresh air from time to time, it was hot!! The place is not big, but very nice and comfy. Drinks were strong, and a pretty nice sized list to choose from...I would def go back!
