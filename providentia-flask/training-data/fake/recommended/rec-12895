I was searching for somewhere to have breakfast my last morning in the city and came across this place online.  I looked at the menu and was sold when I saw pumpkin waffles.  Luckily when I arrived there wasn't a wait and I was seated right away.  This place is so cute - I wished there was something like it here where I live.  I ordered the pumpkin waffles and was not disappointed.  The table next to me ordered the Nutella french toast which also looked amazing.
