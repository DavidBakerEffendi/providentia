Probably the best pizza I've ever had--delicious sauce, perfect crust, lots of garlic and fresh basil.  While the indiscriminate $3 price for toppings--$3 for shallots? really?--makes me wince, and the $8 artichoke "special" is still harder to swallow, the wine prices more than make up for it, and so I have no regrets about my topping expenses. Giuseppina's is a family-owned extension of Lucali, and serves the same menu, so comparisons are inevitable.  Lucali has been around longer, but while some may continue to assert its superiority, I prefer the more remote Giuseppina's (and confess its convenience to my more remote apartment).  It fronts an old Italian style, which I really like, as opposed to the chic neighborhood-antique feel of its Carroll Gardens predecessor.  And as mentioned above, it sells beer and wine and, when you're teetotaling, the old-school Manhattan Special, which is Special.  Like Lucali, though, the pizza-chef is center-stage here.  With great biceps and a great smile, he puts the pizza in mafia. Cash only, just get over it.
