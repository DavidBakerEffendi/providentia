I wish I could give zero stars. In no way would I ever consider this to be authentic Mexican food. Bland in every way possible. Seemed like someone made a microwave meal in the back and brought it to me on a plate. Terrible terrible and EXPENSIVE. Save yourself a bad experience and go elsewhere. Even taco bell would have been a better meal.
