I really love that they make vegan lassis! Mint and honey has been my favorite combination so far. Very excellent on a hot day with some spicy chaat. This has to be the friendliest cafe in all of Philly. The gentleman behind the counter is so patient to explain the different items to customers who are out of their element. Love it! He's always cheerful (but not in a sleazy way) and accommodating.
