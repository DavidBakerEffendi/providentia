In my epic search for New York City's best burgers, I happened upon Ruby's.  The hype was all about this Bronte Burger so that's what I went with.  When it arrived, I first believed I had the wrong order, because this was no ordinary burger shape - rather, it was oblong. Upon splitting apart and dissecting this creation, I noticed a hamburger patty layered between some greens, tomatoes, and some sort of mystery chili sauce/mayo combination.  This was all sandwiched between pressed bread, which made for a nice touch.  It pains me when places neglect the bread and focus solely on the what's contained within.   Now this meat was no Pat LaFrieda quality, but combined with the bread and the mystery sauce, it was a juicy, succulent combination.  I was actually getting slightly full off the first half of the burger/panini.  Though I wouldn't say it's the best I've had in the city, it is still in the top tier.
