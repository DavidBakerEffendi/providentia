You gadda give this place 5 stars!!! I've ben here few times and for some reason I just never took the time to "yalp" it. soooooo... I never really sat down and had dinner but I certanily had an awesome time at the bar! I am a bartender myself, but it amazes me every time I see the guys mixing the drinks with "love" ! Not only that....they do their job proffessional...I've ben mostly served by two Texas bartenders and the Serbian bald-head lol... It is crewded from the start till the end. Which is obvious that the place is just amazing. They 've got some finger food for the bar and its like having an orgasam while eating lol. on top of it, the bartenders make the atmosphere even better. Soooo... if you like good atmosphere, good coctails and handsom bartenders (talking to ladies) around you, you shd def. go for a drink Â cheers!
