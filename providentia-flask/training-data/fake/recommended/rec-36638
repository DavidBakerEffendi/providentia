This was a great dining experience. It is a BYOB.  I had the Mozzarella in Carrozza to start and it was excellent.  For an entre I had the Cotoletta alla Senese.  It was very good.  In the summer months, when the tomatoes are better, it will be excellent, I'm sure. My friends both had different pasta dishes that they said were excellent.  In all, our dinner check was $93 for 3 people which I find completely reasonable. The atmosphere was adult and lively but it is not a place for children as it is loud inside.  We had a great table by the window which provided for excellent people watching and our server was professional and courteous.  The only thing I can say that was very slightly negative was that I felt rushed at the end of our meal like they were trying to hustle us out of there a little but it wasn't too bad. I will definitely be back to Melograno.
