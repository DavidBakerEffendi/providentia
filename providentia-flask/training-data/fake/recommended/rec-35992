A New York and Soho classic. Despite being so popular that reservations need to be made well ahead, sometimes days, the reception staff always seem to be able to accommodate small parties walking in with a reasonable wait at the busy bar. Great for French bistro classics like pate, cheese plates, international wines. My favorite is the lobster risotto. Â Large or small size. Sadly not always on the menu. Highly professional wait staff.
