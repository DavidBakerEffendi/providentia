Overall, our experience was not as great as we had hoped, and I am not sure I can say it's worth the price to return. How did they get the temperature wrong on a burger if all they serve is burgers? The waitress was on the job 4 days (though had 2 waitresses as back up to help her). She made a bunch of mistakes, but we were very lenient in her mistakes (ex. bringing the wrong beer, no beer glasses, not offering water, bringing us the wrong food, not giving us plates for our appetizer etc). I'm a teacher who has worked in the food industry myself for a few years, so I was trying to be understanding. I think we couldn't take it anymore when my husband ordered a burger med. rare and it came out extremely well done. The waitress kept apologizing, but we had enough at that point. At that point, it seemed that the wait staff avoided our table and all eye contant for some time, making my husband even more uncomfortable/frustrated. We weren't offered any drinks/water or free appetizers as we waited another 15 minutes. When the burger came out, we asked for a box so we could go home. I will say at the very end a Manager came over and offered to cover the cost for the burger, which was $18 (no sides included). I thought it was better than nothing, though it should have happened sooner. I can't say the burger had any flavor, even with the special sauces we ordered, so I am not sure we will be returning. I'll keep hunting in the area for a great burger joint.
