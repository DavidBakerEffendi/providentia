though i do love B2, due to its proximity to my bus stop AND my apartment, i've never been a fan of their awkward set-up.   i'll start with the only thing that really, really bugs me.  when you come in, you get served as if you're at a bar ordering a drink.  while it's nice when you're not in a rush, it's a little frustrating when there are a billion other people trying to order (ie., on a saturday or sunday morning, especially).   they really know how to pull a shot or make a cappuccino.  their coffee, however, isn't my favorite.   the food, however - DELICIOUS!  great bagels, sandwiches, and baked goods.  and the smoothies?  swoon.
