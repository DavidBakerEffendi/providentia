Katja is excellent - great flavorful Austrian food, come prepared to be stuffed.  I've been several times and will definitely be back more; always love the ambiance (not stuffy, intimate, usually not a long wait for a table) - good for small and large parties. I'm not a big beer drinker but apparently it's also got a great selection. Try the pickles and pretzel apps.  The sampler for 2 is huge - if you have 4 it's great to try that with two other entrees.
