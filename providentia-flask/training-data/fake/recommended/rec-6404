Holy smokes, lots of people during a weekday lunch hour! But the wait was most acceptable- 5 mins. Why? A lot of tables. My eyes immediately zeroed in on the truffle burger and truffle fries.You must be thinking: truffle overdose. I did not care, for I shall have as many truffled items as I want! Anywho, why did I only give this place 4 instead of 5? Well, I must say I was a bit disappointed plus the hype did not help. I may eveeeeen dare to say a 3.5. Food always tastes better with good company. And when you're starving. My burger (medium rare-no other way) came out oozing with juice in which the bottom bun was soaking up. First thought: damn, what a small burger O_o. Maybe I'm just a pig like that but YEAH. Second: where's the truffle taste? The juicy beefy taste is all there, but where's the truffle?! Don't get me wrong, the patty was cooked to just the way I like it and it was delicious, but again, where was that truffle taste I so longed for? It was very very slight. Third: the fries. Oh the fries...what a tease your imagination can be. It was a bunch of fries with melted truffled cheese on top, but congealed. I was expecting the fries to have more flavor, and not just the cheese. Blasphemy! I would probably return for a second chance, but I know where I won't be getting my truffle fix.
