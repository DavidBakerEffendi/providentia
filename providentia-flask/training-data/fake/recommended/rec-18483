*This review is for the bar portion only* - stopped in for an afternoon drink after a morning of shopping on Broadway. Good drink selection - I asked for a Caesar (sorry, Bloody Mary...) and the bartender made a very good one! If we hadn't eaten a while earlier, i would have loved to share a few appetizers in here - the restaurant was beautiful, service was great, and the Bloody Mary was great! (downside, it was $13.) Will definitely go back for food on my next NY visit - the menu board listed some good looking Happy Hour specials!
