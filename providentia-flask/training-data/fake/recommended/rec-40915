I was skeptical, being that, as a Cuban American, any attempt to combine two Spanish-speaking cuisines into one truck will turn me off. Sandwich is legit, though. Right ingredients. Even goes the extra mile and adds pulled pork rather than sliced lunch meat. Owner's name is Osmany. That's a Cuban man's name. Seven bucks. Can't be beat. Proceed with safety, young Cuban.
