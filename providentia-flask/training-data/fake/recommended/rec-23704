This review comes waaaaaaay late considering how long ago I was actually here. On top of that, I was fairly drunk by the time I got to Frankford Hall, so I'm surprised I even remember enough to have anything to say here. I've gone to a few bier-gardens now, and I've gotta say this one of the finer ones. The place is rather large, with both a huge indoor and outdoor space. Indoors, I distinctly remember walking by a ping-pong table...awesome! I'm sure they have even more cool cames inside, but we spend most of our time outdoors. It was a pretty chilly day, however, I was not feeling the cold due to alcohol, plus they have a ton of heat lamps to keep warm by. If that's not enough, they actually had several fire pits outside as well, and I believe you could buy chocolate, graham crackers, and marshmallows for some smores! I wish I was sober enough to have actually appreciated the beer and food, however I believe they were both delicious. I do distinctly remember getting a pretzel with a side of mustard containing wasabi, not realizing the mustard contained wasabi, and proceeding to cry (tears of joy) from the level of spice! All in all, a great place that I definitely want to visit again, this time sober enough to remember the whole experience!
