After seeing a review saying the truffle burger was better than shake shack, I had to try it. After just finishing, I can say that it is. While more expensive than my trusted double cheeseburger at the shack, the truffle burger is just as cheesy, tastier and you can taste the quality. The sweet potato fries were crisp, well seasoned and delicious. Great beers on tap too. Umami burger isn't a cheap option, but better than shake shack and minetta tavern.
