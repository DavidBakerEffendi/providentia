This place is awesome! The food is delicious and service is great. It's a very laid back spot with some serious flavor. I love the sure√±a arepa and their guac is out of this world. I love the plantain chips that come with us. If you want a rich chocolatey dessert go for their chocolate mousse, if you love dark chocolate this will be just right for you.
