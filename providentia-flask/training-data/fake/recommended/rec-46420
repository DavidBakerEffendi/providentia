I know there was a whole big hype about this burger so I was so excited to finally try it.  What was even better was that there was no wait! Food: I ordered the truffle burger and truffle fries and my fiancé ordered the manly burger.  The burger was definitely on the rare side, but i would take that any day over a well done piece of meat.  Let's start with the fries.  Almost everyone said order the truffle fries in their reviews and I was not impressed at all when eating them.  They were skinny fries, but all I tasted with the truffle aioli sauce on top.  There were no truffle flavors in the plain fries. They were also very soggy.  Now to the burgers.  As previously mentioned, definitely on the rare side.  My truffle burger was okay, but nothing to brag about.  One pet peeve about burgers for me is when I take a bite and they fall apart, which is exactly what happened with this burger.  The manly burger was way better and had more flavor.  The buns were the best part.  Nicely toasted but remained soft in texture and tasted really fresh.   Ambiance:  very casual and dark.  Has a bar to the side.   Service: pretty good.  Decently attentive. Overall it was okay.  I didn't find it to be worth $40 for two burgers, fries and a sofa though.
