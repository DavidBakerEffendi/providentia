I think this is my first ever review on Yelp.  I've been going to this restaurant regularly for 10 years.  The food is outstanding and the atmosphere, albeit loud, is friendly and buzzing.  If you don't know what to order, get the lobster cannelloni in vodka sauce or the spaghetti with meatballs.  The house wine is terrific.   The mediocre reviews for this restaurant are from disgruntled customers who had one bad experience.  From time to time, I have not been seated timely even though I had a reservation.  No big deal.  I guess if you're in a rush, pick a different restaurant.  However, if you are looking for a delicious Italian meal, it's hard to find better in NYC.
