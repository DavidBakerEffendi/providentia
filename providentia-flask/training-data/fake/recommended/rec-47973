WORST service I've ever had in a long time.  It's a shame b/c I was so excited to try Casa Enrique for brunch because my husband and I loved the dinner but the service just ruined the entire meal. Our waitress could barely speak English so she was hard to communicate with. I'm usually very patient, as many employees in Mexican restaurants may not speak english very well, but our waitress was just SO rude. Our drinks took at least 20 minutes to be placed on our table, meanwhile the restaurant was not busy at all, and the bartender brought our drinks over both times instead of the waitress. I asked her what the special was and she mumbled something about beef soup.  I ended up ordering that and it ended up being beef HEART, which I'd never order.  Though the broth was very delicious....she ended up serving both me and my husband a bowl, even though I only ordered the soup.  Her reasoning for that was another mumble so we just ignored it. Then we asked for the check because we waited for my husbands eggs for at least another half hour and she finally brings out the eggs for BOTH OF US.  UGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I said I didn't order eggs!!  I inquired about them but instead changed my order to soup.  She argued with me and said "You are wrong, you ordered eggs."  I said fine, whatever and we just asked for the check because we wanted to get outta there. Our server was lucky that we're easy going people because it was the worst service ever!! Oh and she never once asked how our meal was or checked on us. I still want to go back, but for dinner only, but my husband refuses.
