I absolutely LOVE this place! My friend first introduced me to Cuban Pete's 3 years ago and I've never had a bad experience! I am very hard to please when it comes to restaurants. I am a pretty hard critic. I love the classic pollo cubano and the steak with the chimi something sauce? Lol I forget what it's called but that has become my favorite. The wait staff are always friendly and helpful. Every time I've gone they've had a wait but it's sooooo worth it! I'm sure it's not that authentic but it sure tastes AMAZING!!!
