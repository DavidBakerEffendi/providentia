This place is a winner. I went there today with a friend. I ordered the Karaka Men with braised pork belly as an additional topping. Similar to other Japanese spots, there is no substitutions allowed. First of all, I love the ambiance. The decor is modern without looking pretentious. The entire staff is friendly, and unless you have a large group the seating is communal. The food is fresh and delicious. This isn't the place to go to if you are on a diet, just go enjoy yourself and work it off later. This place is a gem.
