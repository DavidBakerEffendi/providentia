Yummy spot worth a trip to BK.  One suggestion, if you plan to go for Brunch, arrive after 1:00PM.  We had a 12:30AM reservation (yes, you can get a brunch reservation!) and it seemed like the kitchen wasn't up and running.  I ordered the famous chicken and waffles (red velvet!).  It seemed like the oil wasn't hot enough and my chicken came out oily.  Still pretty good, but I sat through brunch looking in envy at other peoples plates with golden crispy chicken.  Def going back but next time will aim for 1:30PM when the oil is ready for cookin'.
