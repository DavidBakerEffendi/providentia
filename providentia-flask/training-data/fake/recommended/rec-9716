Room Service exhibits a selection of decor that is luxurious and subtly risqué. The Hell's Kitchen location features an over-sized glass chandelier that glows in the middle of the restaurant, creating a pleasurably dim atmosphere. The interior, bold and sexy. Everything from the tiles to the wallpaper follow the same color scheme of black, white, and gray, but tastefully so. This is a restaurant where many young adults like to hang out and for good reason. There is constantly mainstream music that blasts; the volume imitates a club-like atmosphere. Drinks? There is also a full bar. The Mai Thai is definitely a good choice if you love 151 rum, curaçao and orange juice. The 151, 75% proof alcohol, makes the mai thai especially strong. Their mojitos come in a pleasantly ridiculous selection of flavors. Large glasses and strong drinks. Room Service is always crowded especially after 7 PM on weekends creating a sense of exclusivity. If you are going to wait in line for over an hour, go for a dish that is more original. The entrees that differ from other Thai locations can be found under the "Eat Like a Bangkokian" List. My entree was the Lychee Siamese Duck. I would highly recommend this dish! It was flavored with cherry tomatoes, basil as well as pineapples and lychee. The fruit accents were aromatic but not overly sweet. It is a delicious dish however the portion of duck meat was skimpy and unreasonably so for the price of $16. Appetizers: go for the Honey Glazed Ribs and the Mixed Chicken and Shrimp Dumplings! Reservations at least one week in advance are recommended for larger parties. I chose this location for my 21st Birthday. I was one hour late and it was a busy Friday night. I expected them to turn me away at the door however, they allowed me to move my reservation back for a table of 10 without much protest. I just had to wait thirty minutes for the table to clear.
