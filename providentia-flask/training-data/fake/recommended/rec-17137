I love this restaurant. The ambience and look and feel makes you feel that you are somewhere in the Caribbean perhaps Cuba. I have had several dishes at Cuban Pete's and I would have to say that their ropa vieja and churrasco steak are one of the top dishes to have. As a New Yorker I have tried many cuban restaurants and none come close to how delicious and inexpensive Cuban Pete's is. Another plus BYOB, bring some rum and make some sangria.
