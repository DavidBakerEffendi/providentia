If you are looking for authentic, delicious Malaysian cuisine, you have got to go to Taste Good.  The name says it all!  You can not go wrong with anything on the menu.   Taste Good is a whole in the wall, mom and pop run place.  The cute little Malaysian couple is warm, sweet, and all about the food.  They talk about the process in which they prepare their dishes in a very serious way.   The beef rendang is really delicious, and properly slow cooked to perfection.  Of course the laksas are delicious! Their fried tofu is one of the best I have ever had.  I love tofu, but usually do not eat it when it is fried, but the tofu is made fresh, on a daily basis.  It comes out sizzling on a cast iron platter, in a spicy and very saucy dish.   Do not miss this place!
