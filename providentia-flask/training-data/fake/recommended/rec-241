I am rating Stella 34 five stars for one very important reason: my parents like it a lot.  No a lot is too narrow a word.  What word(s) can I use that would convey more than a lot.  I know my parents like Stella 34 As follows if the Seraphim hand sourced all the ingredients and cherubs flitted around and served you = a lot. If you cannot guess my parents are deserting eaters. They know what they like and the love Stella 34. The location is on the 6th floor of Macy's Herald Square. The concept is open and spacious. The space is meticulously clean; which is hard to believe because of how large and how white it is. The servers are also not what you expect: they are professional trained servers and not unemployed actors / actresses. They know the menu every different permutation. Substitutions are not an issue and I have yet to see any order come out not how someone ordered. If you come often the servers get to know you as well as the hostesses and will seat you at the same table over and over. It basically creates a favorite table vibe for the patrons. My parents have relationships with the servers that extend past the restaurant. The food is fresh and well prepared. Everything I have eaten is delicious. I have yet to get something I have not liked. I will recommend that after lunch or dinner order the hazelnut gelato. It is awesome. If you are looking for a restaurant to go to once or twice a week and have great service, great food, and great ombonce this is the place.
