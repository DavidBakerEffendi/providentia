I love my halal food carts and the 53rd and 6th cart is no exception. I usually hit up my usual cart in Union Square but if it's a late night and I want some really really good chicken and lamb over rice, this is the place you'll see me waiting on line. Some days you can go here thinking there will be no line, especially in below freezing temperatures, but don't be too positive about that! Chicken and lamb over rice swimming in white sauce, a bit of hot sauce, and maybe some barbecue sauce. Sex. As some of the 800 other reviews said, watch out for the hot sauce! The first time I went here put a lot and I was sweating bullets. For $6, you can't go wrong. If I was a visitor staying at the Hilton across the street or any of the other hotels in the area, I'd definately give this place a try. It will probably be a highlight of your trip.
