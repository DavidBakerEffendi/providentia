I have given this diner a few tries.. each one just disappoints more. The first time I got a chicken caesar salad, which was good but there was a spider in it and the cheese was molded. The second time I was craving disco fries, you pay almost $9 for the tiniest plate of fries! Yes they were good but so not worth the price! Tonight I gave them another shot, I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. What I got for $16 no less, was a piece of chicken with cheese on it, NO TOMATO, NO LETTUCE and NO FRIES! I had to get a side order of fries when on their menu chicken sandwiches come with fries and is prices at $10.25. Talk about a rip off! I had my husband bring the food right back. Needless to say i will never order from this diner again! So disappointing.
