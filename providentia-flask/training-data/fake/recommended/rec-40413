So, the food here is pretty darned good.  Loved the buckwheat pancakes, and the lingonberry pancakes, and the regular pancakes.  Off two stars though, because we've been here several times and have never had good service.  I know it can't be a local thing, because everywhere else in NJ seems to have great service.  They practically bring the check with your food as if to shoo you out the door ASAP, even when they're not busy.  Also, the last time we were there, our waitress more or less abandoned us, leaving the Fella to try in vain to wave down another waitress to get a glass of water.  :-/  We'll probably be back, but not as often as the Fella wants pancakes.
