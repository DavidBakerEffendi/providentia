borderline 5 stars.  cool little mom and pop.  holds probably 10 people or so. french toast: very thick and good consistency, but too light on taste.  not very sweet. apple pancakes:  small is good because big pancakes = carb overload.  also, they were not spongy, which is often the problem with pancakes.  lots of fresh apples. egg scramble with smoked salmon: eggs were light and delicate.  smoked salmon didnt taste processed or unnatural.
