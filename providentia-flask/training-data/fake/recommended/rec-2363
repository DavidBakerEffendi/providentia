I liked it, but I've had better. Now my friends tell me I'm very over sensitive when it comes to racial issues.  And that may very well be true.  But I still did not like their sign that says "This is America.  When Ordering Speak English."  Although I've read that  Geno's says that they will not turn away any customer for having poor English, but then why have the sign up at all?  Some will claim patriotism, but there are ways to be patriotic and not offensive at the same time.  It just doesn't make sense to me.  The US is a country of foreigners. To me, for that sign to be correct, it should read "This is America.  When Ordering Speak [Insert Native American Dialect Here.]"   It's just the sign makes me upset because of my parents mostly.  My parents are hard working blue collar Americans that immigrated here to give me a better life.   And that sign is just sad and I can see my parents having a hard time ordering there and being sent to the back of the link for not ordering correctly. The cheese steak is good.  But I honestly find the the taste at Pat's and Jim's better.  Regardless of the sign.  And as they have their right to have to sign up, I have my right to not give them any of my patronage.
