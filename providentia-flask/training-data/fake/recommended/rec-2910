I can't give them less than three stars because 1. You can get beer in a liter and 2. Drinking outside is pretty great. Buttttt.... Whether Stephen Starr's fault or not, the bar has attracted an overwhelmingly bro-ish crowd so rather than relaxing with a beer that requires two hands to lift, I have to deal with frat and sorority city. Sigh. When they first opened, the world wasn't clued in yet, and it was marvelous. Now there's a line to get in? No sir. My suggestion? Go early or during the week or when it's cold (they have a ton of heaters and fire pits so you won't freeze...plus, you know, liters of beer). Also, be careful because the benches are not particularly well-designed, and if you are the only one sitting on the bench and very close to the end, the other end will probably fly up like a teeter totter.
