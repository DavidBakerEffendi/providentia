I'll preface this by saying I picked up from here once before and the food is high quality. This time I went to pick up around 7 PM a week ago, and had to wait too long to pick up my order, which was sitting in a bag in front of me.  The owners/managers seemed to have only one person waiting tables and handling the pickup orders - there were multiple tables attempting to flag this poor waiter down saying they're ready to order, others getting up from their table to try and cut him off and just tell them what they want, while I was standing in line to pick up my order (yes, there was a congregation of people waiting to be given their pickup order) people cut in front of me to try and get his attention.  People got a little catty.  None of this was the waiter's fault - it is clear they needed another person there. I left with my food and came back to the office after a 15 minute drive to find out I had been given the wrong soup, which was a huge bummer.  So I certainly didn't have a great experience (didn't get my tom yum gai) but the food is always great here and save for the poor managing the place is a cool spot.
