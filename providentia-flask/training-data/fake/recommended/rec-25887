Really Cynthia D? The thing that stood out that was odd was the size of the menu? If you want unlimited options i would suggest a diner. There you will find numbers next to the entrees to make it easier. This place has everything you want in your local bar restaurant. Incredibly well thought out food with a persian twist, , great cocktails and a solid beer selection. A classic. Â Larry is a world class mixologist just tell him what u like.
