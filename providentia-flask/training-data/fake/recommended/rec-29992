This was our first time at Eno Terra. We wish we lived closer so we could return more often, based on our lunch experience. The atmosphere was calm and understated, the service was polite and not intrusive and the food was delicious! They were helpful in answering gluten free requests, and there were a variety of things to chose from on the menu. Two of us had the lunch special which was a salad with local peaches and greens,a chicken pasta and delicious s'mores semifreddo for dessert. We hope to return before Â too long!
