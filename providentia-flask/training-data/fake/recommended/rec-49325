I think I'm a little bit in love with the idea of a proper cafe inside a bookstore.  It's not just a simple counter with coffee and pastries (although those are, in fact, available to you), but there's yummy food as well!  It's like there was a cafe, and then a bookstore spontaneously germinated around it.  So, I'm sure a lot of my enjoyment was of the concept itself.  Atticus pulls it off quite well.  Given, I haven't really seen very many other bookstore/cafes, and the ones in big chain bookstores are abysmal.   Had half a hummus sandwich (DELICIOUS), a side salad (good...it's a side salad, it's not gonna change your world), and a cup of the soup of the day, which was beef stew (just OK, although it grew a little bit more on me by the time I finished the cup). Service was OK; waiter was friendly.  Dine-in seating is pretty limited, and we were there at what seemed to be peak lunchtime, so it was kind of slow.  It didn't detract too much from the experience, but it would have been nice to have a few more refills, and not to have to flag down the waiter to order/ask for the check. Had a fudge brownie, which didn't wow me, but some of the other baked goods also looked enticing that I'd want to try. A little bit expensive, but still worth it, I think.  I was definitely happily full of food.
