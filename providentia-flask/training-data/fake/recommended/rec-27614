The food here is awesome. That's all there is to it. The crostini are my favorite- but everything here is great. The problem here folks, and this is the only reason I demoted Il Bambino to 4 stars, is that these people only seem to play Radiohead. Every time I have ever been in there (and that's probably a dozen or so times) they're playing Radiohead. I hate Radiohead. They're fucking depressing. Stop trying so hard to be Brooklyn hipsters, Il Bambino. Play. Something. Else! Maybe next time I come by I'll bring you some music....
