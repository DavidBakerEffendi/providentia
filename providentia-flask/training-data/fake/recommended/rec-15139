This place is great. Had a business dinner meeting there last night and really enjoyed ourselves. We knocked back the cheesemongers cheese plate which was very solid then I had the chicken and my guest had the trout. Both very, very good. He said the best trout he's ever had. We also shared the cucumber salad and the beets. The cucumber salad was OK, I'm spoiled by my wife's cooking and awesome salads, but the beets were really nice and recommended. Service was solid as our witty and extremely dry waitress fit her role perfectly. Oh, and their brioche rolls served with dinner are kickass. Go here.
