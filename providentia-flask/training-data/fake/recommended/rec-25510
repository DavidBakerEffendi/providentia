This place is serious about its drinks. This turn-of-the 20th century watering whole is lovingly restored, from its paneled ceiling to the dark-wood covered walls and intricate bar carvings. Some taxidermy is thrown in for hipster cred, no doubt. The music volume stays lower so that conversation can proceed at a comfortable level. Their concept of barrel-aged cocktails works to perfection, and isn't overpriced, as some start at $8. One of the best bar between New York and Boston (and better than most in Boston, to be sure).
