I do not even like vegetable soup, but here at Market Table - it is delicious. I have had it about three times now. The roasted chicken was fantastic. I just adored the hazelnut butter. Â One of my other favorite things hereat at is the apple pie with sour cream gelato and pear with ricotta sorbets. I could eat the stuff ALL day. That is without exaggeration. The service is fantastic. The food arrives how I expected to. Overall, I enjoy coming here! It is right down the street from where I live. All around good stuff!
