I am a slut for patatas bravas. It's the truth. That spicy aioli, the potatoes...crispy on the outside, velvet on the inside. It doesn't really get any better than that. Oh wait, it does! When patatas bravas are joined by a nice glass of wine, the delctable, savory paquetitos (manchego and artichoke mixture wrapped with JAMON), a Â BOWL OF HOT, GLISTENING CHORIZO, and a handsome smiling man...I become THE BIGGEST SLUT IN THE WORLD. What's that touching your crotch? Oh, nothing. JUST MY HANDS. JK JK JK But really, I had a lovely time here. A lovely time that was made even lovelier with my 30% off code from Blackboard Eats. I love that website. The staff got a nice, fat tip off of the pre discount bill, because they were positively PLEASANT, despite the madness that tia pol was at the hour we were dining. A few negatives: - I like chairs with backs, I found the stool situation to be a little uncomfortable - the space is TOOO small! Yes, it's intimate, but I shouldn't have to be grinding with strangers as I wait for seating!
