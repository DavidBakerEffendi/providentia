I went to this restaurant on Sunday for brunch with some friends. We actually had a good experience with the food itself, it was pretty tasty. From the beginning the server was uptight but amicable. We were 3 couples so we asked to pay with 3 cards which I know can be a pain for the server but is usually done at larger restaurants like these. They said that they accept 2 cards max. So we figured it out amongst us and paid with 2 cards and the rest in cash. We then walked outside and after 3 minutes of standing on the sidewalk the manager guy came out and hounded us about the tip. We actually left more than 15% since the service was fine. We never intentionally left a low tip, it was a decent tip. It was very odd and we were shocked that he would chase us outside for something that's voluntary like a tip. We then gave him $5 to end the awkward situation. After 5 minutes as we were walking away a waitress ran after us asking where the receipts were, strange.... And another 2 minutes later...another waitress came out asking for those same receipts that we obviously didn't have. I am never going back there!! It was an awful experience--they are stuck up & don't know about customer service!!
