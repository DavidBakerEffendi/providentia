We went here for dinner with a group of 7. We brought our own wine because they do not have their liquor license. We ordered so much food and entrees that its hard to separate one from the other (or maybe it was the wine). It doesn't really matter because all the plates were good (and we seriously shared about half of them). After all this the bill was a laughable $90.
