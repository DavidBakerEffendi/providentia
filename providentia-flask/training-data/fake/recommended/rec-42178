This place is so amazing that I have come here with three different people since moving to Sunset Park a few months ago, (twice in the last week!). I had never tried hot pot before, so it was a fun experience the first time I tried it. It gets packed on weekend nights, so I definitely recommend making a reservation.  When you sit down,  you first pick two broths. I have selected the pork marrow and the seafood tom yum each time and have yet to stray because they are both so incredibly delicious. My favorite things to cook are the homemade wontons (they come with a fresh noodle that is equally amazing), the live shrimp, beef brisket, fried tofu, and asparagus. The live shrimp is sort of a crazy dish because they come to you alive, in a closed jar, and you hear them jumping around. You take little tongs to put them in the broth to cook, and they jump around! The waiter can do it for you if you are squeamish, or you can get them 'drunken,' where they dump a ton of sake into the bowl before served so that they basically drown before getting to you. A little sad, if you think too much about it, but the dish is sort of an experience, it tastes great, and the flavor is enhances by the sake if you choose to go that route. I have not had hot pot from any other place, but I get the impression that this is the one that I will forever compare all others to. It is all so fresh, the selection is great, and the staff is very friendly. If you have any questions about how long to cook anything, they will happily take the time to explain everything. I highly recommend this place! Come with at least three people so that you can try a ton of different dishes.
