3 stars, as we only had coffee and pie as I was killing time waiting for a bus.   Nice little spot.    Nobody is going to be overly impressed with the decor, as it is sparse at best  (wow I wish I could hear Christopher Walken say that last sentence for me......) I got a tall iced coffee which was pretty deeeeeerish-us and a slice of coconut cream pie.    The crust was a little too hard but the frosting and filling were pretty yummy.   When you walk in they have one of those old school cake/pie storage/display cases that looks like it's refrigerated but I'm not sure if it's just to keep the air out and keep the goods fresh.   Anyways I was there with my family and we split some onion rings too, just to have a snack, and those were pretty darn good !      We were there around 5, so people were starting to shuffle in for din-din.   A good-sized party next to us appeared to be locals as they weren't as wide-eyed as tourists  -  always a good sign when the locals are there.   It's near the highway, it's a real American family restaurant, with meatloaf, burgers, and spaghetti and meatballs on the menu.   I'd definitely go back and try a whole meal of food if I was in the area.
