If you are making a trip to the Corner Bistro, you are most likely going for the Bistro Burger.  The Bistro Burger is undoubtedly one of the best burgers In New York.  I do not know what kind of ground beef they use or what herbs and spices they mix into it, but it is heavenly.  The burgers are then topped off with a generous amount of bacon, a slice of cheese, lettuce and tomato and all stacked on a roll.  The burgers come by themselves and you have to order the fries separately if you want them.  There is nothing special about the fries.  If anything, they may actually be a disappointment as it is hard to believe that those fries are supposed to compliment such a good burger. Just to set the record straight, Corner Bistro is not a restaurant.  Corner Bistro is a bar that just happens to have an amazing burger.  They only have a couple tables in the place and you will almost always have to wait to be seated at one.  If you do not mind sitting at the bar, you will probably find seating there a lot quicker.
