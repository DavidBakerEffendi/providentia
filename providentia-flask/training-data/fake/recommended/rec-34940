Everybody needs a go-to hibachi restaurant when you get a craving for hibachi and this one is mine.   Solid from top to bottom.  Do yourself a favor and get the filet mignon dinner (medium-rare) with fried rice.  You will not be sorry. They have the traditional hibachi stuff but their veggies and noodles are a cut about the rest.  Also try the red bean ice cream for dessert. Izumi super yummy!
