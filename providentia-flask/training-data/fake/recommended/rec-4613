LOML and I were headed to the Wadsworth for some culture and decided hot dogs were in order prior to ogling the Picasso's. We found Woody's on YELP and pulled up to feed. On a Saturday, parking on Main St out front is a snap but even with the address in hand the signage is tough to see, so pay attention or you miss it. Hot dogs are the specialty so if you need a full menu go elsewhere however if you feel like tube steak this is the place. The owners are on site and could not be nicer or more genuine. The hot dogs were terrific, the fries were standard fare but fresh and hot. I gobbled on the Rueben with kraut Swiss and thousand, while LOML had foot long kraut brown mustard and relish. The toasted buns are exceptional and the size is perfect for manageable mouthfulls. Couple of cokes....all of it for $13. It's a destination for me and LOML.
