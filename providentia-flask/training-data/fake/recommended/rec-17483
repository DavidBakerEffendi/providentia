Quicker and less expensive than hopping on a plane to Peru, but this is definitely the next best thing.  Very nice and classy place, and the food was very good. We had the ceviche to start....was really good, but I have had better.  I think they used about 3 limes too many, because it was a bit too tangy.  The ribeye though, was excellent.  Would give it 6 stars if I could!  Been to a lot of good steak places in the area....Morton's, River Palm, Ruth's Chris, Peter Luger's....and I can honestly say this steak ranked ahead of all of them.  The sides were excellent as well; the tacu-tacu, fried plantains, and fried egg were all great. Not too much of an atmosphere; this is more if you want to take your wife or g/f out to a nice, quiet dinner.  Can't wait to go back and try some of the seafood entrees....
