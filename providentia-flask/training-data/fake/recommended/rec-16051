Been here for dinner several times, haven't come for brunch yet.  The food and dinner service is good, try the truffle polenta and various carpaccio dishes.  The pasta is good and the wine selection is very large.  The only detraction is the small waiting area and no reservations.  Every time I've come I've had to wait several minutes, which isn't to bad because it offers a chance to start with a glass of wine.  But, because of its popularity the waiting area is cramped with people and sometimes it can be difficult to get to the bar to order a glass of wine. Once you get to your table everything is very good.  The only dish I have not thoroughly enjoyed are the various bruschetti.  Tried three or four and none of them really worked for me.  Because the menu is so large, however, this is not a huge detraction since there are many other excellent starters.
