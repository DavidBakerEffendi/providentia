Best seafood in Princeton and probably the best restaurant on Nassau Street. Yes, it is tight. Not that many tables, so it feels a bit crowded. But that's fine. I'm glad they don't seat too many people, or else the quality of the food will probably suffer. Came here with family. Ordered crab cakes and lobster bisque for appetizers, both very delicious. Bisque had plenty of lobster and right amount of cream, crab cakes were salted and rich. Unfortunately, by the time we had sat down (later in the evening), some of the fish was already out of stock. I ended up with Barramundi, which was tender and terrific. I'm glad that they were out of Arctic Char and our waiter recommended the Barramundi, which I've never had before. Service was prompt and knowledgeable. Even though we were outside, we never felt forgotten. I will definitely come back.
