I am very sad to say that I hope a Mexican person does not own this place. My husband and I, thought this was going to be an authentic Mexican restaurant and we were so excited! Sadly the refried beans are from a can or bag, guacamole same thing they use in Subway, out of a bag, the rice was not Mexican rice, just a bland make of rice, chips not homemade, salsa not homemade, the chicken in the enchiladas was dry little cubes and had a little red sauce around it though the sauce was Verde (green) on the outside (contradicting tastes), and the pork in the chimichanga was not your typical flavored pulled pork. It was boiled with hardly any flavor. We enjoyed the posole soup and our mandarin jarritos. And of course the service was nice and loved the inside deco. Funny thing my husband noticed that they used, we think the Italian flag to make a resemblance to the Mexican flag. It was missing the usual emblam.     Sadly can't come back here ever again.
