Overall the food had mild and fresh flavors. Nothing was bland because the mild flavors were made with fresh ingredients and the textures were perfect. A friend and I went together and shared four smaller plates because we wanted to try as much Venezuelan food s possible! We had the Field green salad with a crisp goat cheese (so good - the goat cheese was sweet and herby). We also tried the Cachapa (fresh sweet corn pancakes) literally a pancake with cheese in the middle. Topped with a Mild sauce, but very good paired with the pancakes and cheese. The Tostin was fresh with shrimp, peppers, on top of a potenta crisp. This was one of my favorite dishes. Lastly, we tried the Domino arepa - a black bean and cheese mixture in a toasted pocket served with a side of cilantro lime dressing. This was nothing overly tasty, as it was very bland. But it was VERY fresh so I still liked it! My favorite? The jalapeño martini! Delicious - those could be dangerous! He lack of 2 stars goes to the service of the restaurant. I was there on a Tuesday night, there was one other table. Our waitress Never once asked us how our meal (or martini) was. She was much too occupied with her phone. At the end of the meal we finally had to ask for water. She also didn't offer us dessert, instead just gave us the check when she rushed to take our dinner plates (still an hour before closing). To make it worse, the owner/head chef was sitting at the end of the bar on his computer talking about getting an "agent" and watching videos, and not once thanked us for coming,  or asked us how our meal was. You would think with a new(ish) restaurant the owner would want to engage with his customers and ensure great service! It's too bad, because if he had asked he would have been complimented with the fantastic food!
