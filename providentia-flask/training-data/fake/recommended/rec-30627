Ahhh... this is the place for a perfect first date. The right amount of candlelight, the busy buzzy atmosphere providing enough distraction should your date have 'dull chat' ...the atmosphere is A1. The real highlight however is the splendid food. The menu was so tantalising that I almost passed out with excitement (truth be told my dining partner had to restrain me form ordering everything i could see) I managed to fit in 3 courses (the tasting desert plate was YUM! and the accompanying wines were even yummier). I am a major fan of this place. Go Public!
