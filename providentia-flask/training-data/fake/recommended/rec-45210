Finally got around to checking this place out after hearing about it from many of my friends and seeing their mouth watering pictures. I heard the crepes were the best, so thats what i intended on going for. I started with the Dutch Hot Chocolate, which was very average. Didn't taste special by any means, but it was good. I liked the little chocolate chips that topped the whip cream. There were some at the bottom of my drink too, not sure if they sank down or if thats how they make it. I ordered the Dulce De Leche as I'm an avid caramel fan. The crepe itself had a very soft, subtle flavor. The caramel was very thick and had a great caramel taste. there were big chunks of strawberries throughout the entire crepe, which was great. The caramel gelato was good, a bit too strongly flavored of caramel but was definitely a nice touch to the crepe. I tried the Neo Nutella crepe, the crushed nutter butters were too crunchy to allow you to enjoy the nutella. I barley even tasted the nutella. Wasn't a fan of the chocolate gelato. Not sure why a nutella/strawberry crepe isn't on the menu as its so basic and simply good. Creating your own crepe comes with a pretty hefty price tag. Overall, it was a good experience. Not something I would do often but once in a while, its good. Rich tasting crepes, nice atmosphere. You should definitely try it.
