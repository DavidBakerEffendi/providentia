Pizza use to be pretty good but the quality has gone to hell.  If you do decide to order from here and have it delivered make sure you do it in advance as it seems to always take them over an hour to get you your food even if it's being delivered only 15 block away. So expect your food to be stone cold....and I mean cold.  Think of eating food that was sitting on the table for 3 hours then eat it.  Very disappointing considering the food (albeit bar food) didn't  always lack this much in quality from there.
