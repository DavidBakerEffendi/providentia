Been here at least 10 times and have enjoyed great service, coffee and food 9 out of 10 times ...  My only complaint is the ambiance - in the mornings they have the tv blaring, in the afternoons it is usually crap rock radio ... wtf ?   So close to achieving a european cafe/bistro feel, but I can't  quite get there with the omnipresent noise polution.
