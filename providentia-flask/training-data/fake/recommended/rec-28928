This place is packed to the gills every time we go, but the bartenders and waitresses always do a good job even though they seem very overwhelmed. I enjoy the chalk art murals that are pretty much all over the restaurant (outside and inside) and are changed almost weekly. Well done, whoever is doing those. I love the food. Anything they barbecue is nice & smoky & tender & not overly sweet. Any of the mexican-style food they do is fresh & flavorful. Their specials are always unique (brisket quesadilla? yes please) and always taste great. It is a very meaty place, but there are some veggie-tarian & vegan type things. I've had the chicken-fried seitan and been impressed by it. I also want it noted that they have a good selection of hot-sauces on every table, which I think is important for a place that does this kind of food. My first and favorite sandwich ever here is The Chronic. It's pulled pork, mac & cheese, bacon, & jalapeno bread crumbs all together on a bun. It is glorious. But I believe it is called The Chronic because it could lead to chronic heart failure. So I guess what I am saying is, this is not a very healthy place. But if you're the kind of person who likes your meat with a side of more meat and you're not in danger of death by high cholesterol, I think you would love El Camino Real.
