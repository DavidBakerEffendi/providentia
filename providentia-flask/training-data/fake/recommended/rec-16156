i come here regularly and have to say that i prefer this over higher priced/ fancy restaurants food.... i love the spaghetti a la chittara? the fresh pasta cooked just right, amazing sauce, mozzarella and basil... yummy.... the piadine are also very good and a bottle of fallanghina goes well with their pastas as well as their fish dishes.... i cant say much about the dessert cause i always get the tiramisu (love it) service.... italian servers... all male.... very friendly and polite atmosphere... nice...nothing fancy but its great for a date (they also have bigger table for parties but u need a reservation).... good value..... only reason it didn't get 5 stars is cause they dont take reservations for 2
