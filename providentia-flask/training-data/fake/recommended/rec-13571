I have had the pleasure of dining at ilili several times and in my opinion it is the most authentic Lebanese restaurant in the city.  Trendy decor and a great music playlist provide the perfect atmosphere.  The entire staff at ilili is amazing.  The service you get from the moment you check in your coat is 5 stars all around. As for the menu, there's a lot to chose from.  So im going to try and help out with some recommendations.   The Mezza portion of the menu (which I am most familiar with) refers to the appetizers.  The Mezzas at ilili are amazing.  I would even go so far as to recommend skipping the entrees and instead ordering a wide variety of Mezza dishes with some Lebanese wine.  Some of the highlights on the Mezza menu are the Mekanek, Lahmajeen, Beef Shawarma, and Moujadara.  The Moujadara, a lentil puree, might throw some people off, but TRUST ME it's one of the best appetizers.  The Beef Shawarma come as a pair of miniature sandwiches and are a delight.  If you're looking for a Lebanese salad as a side dish select either the Tabbouleh or the Fattoush; both taste great.   The Bottome line: Great service, great Lebanese wine and authentic Lebanese food.
