Fan-tastic. We went downtown to hit Black Eyed Sally's again, but had driven by Burger Baby enough times that we finally decided to try it. I ordered the Waygu kobe beef with pan seared foie gras along with the duck fat fries. It was amazing, possibly - no, probably the best burger I've ever eaten.  My co worker ordered a regular burger and the regular fries, neither of which held a candle to my selections.   Spend the extra buck on the fries, trust me. Add on edit:  I've been back a couple more times, once again went for the Waygu and have nothing more to add about that. I tried the tuna burger on a subsequent visit and found it to be just okay.  3 out of 5 for that selection, but my overall rating of the place remains unchanged.
