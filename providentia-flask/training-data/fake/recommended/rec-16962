Stopped in for dinner one weekday evening.  Found this establishment on Yelp...of all places.. Six people and the tickets was less than $90! Atmosphere is casual and tables are spread far enough apart you are not sitting on top of other guest or moving your chair so people can walk by. Lots of TV's showing sports. Large bar that is stocked well and draft beer on tap There was not a host/hostess this evening so we just found a table to sit at. I don't know if this is the norm but it may be since this is like a local spot. Eventually one of the waiters came to take our orders. Nice guy but I didn't find him very attentive after the meal came out. Kinda seemed annoyed. Mini crab cakes were very flavorful. 14oz ribeye was great as well. Cooked like medium is suppose to be. Came with baked potato and veggies. Half half rack of ribs, burgers and Caesar salad and desert. Add the draft beer and it made for great dining. Two minute walk from the Rahway train stop.   If you are driving through the area it is down a one way street on your right so don't miss it.  Parking is in the back and cost you $0.25 for 30 mins. Not a far drive from that Holiday inn on Roosevelt Ave.   Overall this was a pretty good meal in a nice location. Enjoy!
