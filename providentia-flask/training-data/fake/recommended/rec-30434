Decent tapas restaurant conveniently located in Chelsea. The restaurant is very small so it's not the best place to come with a large group. Of the nine things we ordered here are the things that stood out: Fried Chickpeas White Anchovies Ink Risotto with calamari Service was mediocre at best. The waiter wasn't attentive and he was not engaging at all. The tables are tiny so they should have come by more often to clear empty plates.
