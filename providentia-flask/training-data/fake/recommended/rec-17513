Had a margarita pizza and it was ok. Crust was thin and crispy, I like it soft. But if you like it thin and crispy than you'll love it. The bread they give you is very good. Crispy on outside and soft on the inside. Fiance had beef with onions, peppers, potatoes, on a garlic bread. YUM!! Loved it! Â They have so much on their menu, next time we want italian food we'll be back. Service was good too, but it was a quiet night.
