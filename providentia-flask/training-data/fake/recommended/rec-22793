Been here multiple times up to this point. More than one occasion that I have ordered the kalbi over here on the Korean barbecue table and they were well prepared. The service is average when busy and above average during less crowded hours. They return once in a while to check the BBQ and refill the Korean appetizers (when asked to). They might be careless at times (forgot to serve us our tea & served a dish less), but since they are probably one of the best Korean restaurants nearby, I will still give it a 4 (would have been a 3 @ NYC k-town). (Side note: it is slightly expensive in my opinion as well, 25-35 per person)
