Chicken + rice + pita + random filler veggies + sauce + atomic spicy insane red sauce = heaven! I have dreams about the chicken & rice platter. The best part of this is probably telling my out-of-towner friends who have never had this before to put only ONE baby drop of the spicy sauce on the platter or none at all, and they go on and on about how much they love spicy food and then start crying after their first bite. It's the best. Do I really need to write a full review about this when everyone and their mom's already did? Nah. I think talking about my friends crying from the hot sauce is good enough. So seriously... one baby drop or none at all. Stop trying to be so macho!
