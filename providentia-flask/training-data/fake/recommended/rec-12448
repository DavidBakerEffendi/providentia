Tonight was my last time ordering from Wings Over ****. I don't know if it's just the local franchise, or if the whole chain sucks, but I'm tired of crappy, half assed chicken wings. The order we had delivered tonight SUCKED. They were barely cooked, soggy,  and almost flavorless, despite the shiploads of sauce poured over them.  It was like a bag of Perdue wings that were barely microwaved, with a jar of BBQ sauce mixed with a tiny bit of hot sauce. I'm not going to knock the delivery - I get the impression that they overload the driver, and the quality of the wings suffers (think hot food in a styro box wrapped in a plastic bag - it's going to get sweaty).  Tonight they were really sweaty, and tasted like crap. I hate the fact that I was too lazy to elsewhere tonight.  There are several places in the vicinity with better wings - Joey Garlics and Sliders are two that come to mind immediately.  They don't have delivery, and that's the only reason I went to Wings Over. I'm sure there are more. Oh well, live and learn.
