Trendy ramen joint with long wait. Another one of my food adventures from our previous NYC trip. I've heard many good things about about Ippudo and decided to make an effort to give it a try. Arrived for lunch and waited about 30-40min for a table of 2. Luckily there's a bar by the entrance to keep us entertained. The drinks were good but pricy which was expected. I had a beer and the gf had some yuzu sake infused cocktail. The layout and design of the restaurant was very trendy NYC, we were sat in a long table sharing with others, which I did not like. I ordered the Akamura Modern ramen. Ramen came out in quite a small bowl for $15.00. Although the noodle had a nice texture, I did not like the type of noodle, it was much thinner than I'm used to at other ramen places. The soup base was OK and their soy sauce marinated egg was not runny enough. Overall, the ramen here was subpar (a bit disappointed) but then again I had really really good ramen in Japan and I live in San Francisco, where there are a couple of REALLY good ramen places. This place is definitely over-hyped but is not bad at all. I can just give it a A-OK because I've had much better ramen elsewhere.
