This place doesn't exactly need another good review, but here it is.  I've been twice, and it is simply some of the tastiest and most flavorful seafood I've ever had.  Every single dish is creative, well presented, and just mouth watering.  Of the six entrees I've tried over two visits, literally every single one has been at least no worse than excellent.  And the best, like last night's Jerk Lobster with hicama salad, are incredible. I've been to Bouley, Jean Georges, and Le Bernadin in New York.  The meals there may be more of a production, but it's not any better than what you'll get at Little Fish.  It will be also be twice as expensive.  I can't say enough about this place and the magic the chefs pull of in their little kitchen.  I hope they never change. If I had to come up with one criticism (and it's hard), it would be that the deserts, while tasty, seem slightly less sophisticated than the rest of the menu.  Everything is still very pleasing.
