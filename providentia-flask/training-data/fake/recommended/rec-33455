Classic New York pizza shop ambience coupled with great food, and no-nonsense service makes this place aces in my book. Pies are always fresh and hand crafted to perfection. Only negative is a 30 min-1 hour wait, so I'd suggest getting here about 30 minutes early to save a spot in line. Pizza is well worth it, and I will definitely be coming back!
