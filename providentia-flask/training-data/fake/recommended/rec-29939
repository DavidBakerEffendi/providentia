Warm, lovely little restaurant with a romantic and inviting ambiance! I hadn't been to Saveur Creole in many years, and boy am I glad I re-discovered it. This is a rare gem in Montclair -- service is stellar, and the food is spectacular. The menu features all types of creole, paying closest attention to Haitian cuisine. Each entree comes with a soup, salad and a side dish so while at first glance the prices may seem a bit high, keep in mind the quantity as well! This is an IDEAL restaurant for small groups (4-6 people), but anything larger it may feel a bit tight. This place is also BYOB (with a liquor store next door), which is another huge plus.
