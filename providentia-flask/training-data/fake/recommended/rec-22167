Our server was rude. I'm not convinced she didn't spit in our food. Never coming back. There are plenty of other places nearby to get a good burger alongside friendly service. My boyfriend and I showed up 40 minutes before the kitchen closed. Having worked in the service industry I know this can be annoying, but as a server you should never act rudely towards the customer because they came in when you didn't want them to. Our arrival put our server in a sour mood. She blatantly insulted my boyfriend when he asked for a beer list (he didn't notice it written on the wall). We understood that we were putting them out and we were prepared to tip generously. And we still did, but her actions and the actions of the other staff (someone was literally staring me down as I ate) ensured that we would never come back. She even brought us the check when we were still eating (and we were eating quickly so that we could get out of there), a few minutes before closing time. Food was fine, but not worth dealing with the attitude.
