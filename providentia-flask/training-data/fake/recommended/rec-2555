Delicious! Great cuts of beef, large prawns, and good veggies. The sauces are also tasty and the gyoza is yum. The wait can be pretty long because of the size of the place, but it's so worth it for the fun atmosphere and the good food! We ordered the some kind of combo for two that included boneless ribs, sliced beef, shrimp, salmon, and squid. It also comes with salad, pickled and fres veggies, ice cream, tea, and steamed rice for only $39 for two!
