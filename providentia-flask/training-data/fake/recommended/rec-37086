I love the halal guys. This is the best chicken and rice, lamb and rice hands down in new york city. I wouldnt eat at any other street cart other then from these guys. The food always has the best taste and their platters are so big for 6 dollars. I also like that the rice doesnt have an indian taste like some of the other carts we find in new york city. Its definitely worth the long line wait. Also the lines move fast. Their white sauce and hot sauce is so delicious! Warning the hot sauce is very spicy!
