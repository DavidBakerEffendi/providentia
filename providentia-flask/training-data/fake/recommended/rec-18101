The fianc√© and I stopped in here for the first time this morning for a little Pre-brunch hours breakfast. The interior of the cafe is super cute. Very welcoming. Very clean and crisp looking. There was relaxing jazz playing. Excellent for coffee sipping and taking in the early September ambiance. The waitress we had could not have been sweeter and stayed on top of our coffee and water refills. I love that. The breakfast/brunch menu has a definite Mediterranean/Middle Eastern vibe to it, but there are enough choices that even the most unadventurous eaters will be satisfied. I had the breakfast pita wrap which was scrambled eggs and hummus on pita, served with a banging salad (lettuce, tomato, cucumbers and a dressing that I got notes of oregano and maybe cilantro from) AND breakfast potatoes. The potatoes were a mix of regular and sweet potatoes. The sweet potatoes were melt-in-your-mouth perfect. I was so happy with my meal. The man had a breakfast burrito that was so big he couldn't finish it (a rarity!) He really loved the hot sauce it came with. There was a lack of decent affordable brunch options in the area, and Renata is helping to fill that gap. We will definitely be back. We want to check out dinner there as well, the menu looked tasty!
