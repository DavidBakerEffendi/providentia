Came here as a guest for YELP and would have to recommend the winter sangria!  The food was pretty good as well, the shrimp is definitely something to try if you stop by!  Atmosphere is great, met a lot of people and enjoyed my time there:)  This is my first review and I would totally recommend this place!
