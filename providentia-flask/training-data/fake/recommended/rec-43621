Stake! stake! Even all their food is amazing the rid eye stake for two is to die for. Some of the best stake houses can only dream to serve this dish. Skip appetizer because this monster could feed a small dinosaur and order the creamed spinach and the cauliflower gratin. I really dream about this dish when I am home. The service also is amazing from the friendly hostess to the very knowledgable waitress to efficient bus boys. (Good service in Brooklyn is becoming a rare animal). And if you go for brunch... Meatloaf sandwich all the way and a nice red rooster cocktail!
