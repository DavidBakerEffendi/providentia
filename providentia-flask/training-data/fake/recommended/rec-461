Pho Real pho life! The Pho Real sandwich tastes like Pho! I have taken all of my so cal friends to eat this and they alway get a trip on how much this taste like pho. So far I'm 8/8! Â Two of those 8 being Vietnamese who love their pho! I don't really understand why someone would think to add avocado to this sandwich, but i don't really care because it sure does work! I've tried the turkey with kimchi sandwhich, the korean bulgogi sandwich, and the blt. The blt comes close second but if i'm ever in the neighborhood i'm ordering the Pho Real!
