I have been in New York for two weeks and this is the only place I felt I have to come back to again. The warm atmosphere is coupled with service that is excellent, pancakes with three kinds of flavoured butter... divine. I ordered the two by two by two combo, which combines a side of bacon/pork sausages with two eggs and two very fluffy pancakes... yummmm I wish I could come here for breakfast all the time. Alas, I am heading back to Singapore.
