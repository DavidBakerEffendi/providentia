Momofuku Ssam was a great experience. We shared the pork buns (2 per order) and they tasted amazing. You feel that the pork is only fat since it is so tender but you don't care since it tastes like heaven. The combination with the sauce and the cucumber are just perfect. Then we shared the duck main course dish and it was spectacular as well. It is a fun dish since you have to play with it: get some pancakes, put some sauce on it, some lettuce and the duck. It tasted so good. Afterwards we shared 2 more pork buns since we were still a bit hungry. The atmosphere of the place is nice, and they play good music. I don't give 5 stars because you are not perfectly comfortable (the chairs don't have a back) and it is a bit pricy.
