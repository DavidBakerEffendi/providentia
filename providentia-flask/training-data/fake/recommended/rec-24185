Tried this for the first time on a weeknight recently with guests. Overall it was just OK, and probably wouldn't return. The low point of the whole experience was that it took FOREVER to get appetizers and entrees for a party of five (as it did for all of the other diners within our view). Â Since I don't see a lot of other reviewers complaining about time, I'm not sure if FDR was unexpectedly overwhelmed with diners since it was a nice night. However there appeared to be one waitress and two chefs for a nearly full restaurant. And when I say slow, I'm talking several hours for 2 courses, probably the slowest service I've ever had dining out. We had to ask for bread which wasn't offered despite the prolonged wait for our appetizers to show up, and it was never refilled while we waited the next 45-60 minutes for our entrees. We were in all honesty on the verge of sending someone to get a few slices of pizza at a nearby takeout joint while we waited (a few of us had last eaten about 8 hours prior and one of us is pregnant). Course size was small for the price. Food overall was average to good (but then honestly almost anything tastes good when you are near-starving while waiting for it). Roasted beet salad was really yummy. Some sort of eggplant filled ravioli-esque pasta was not great -- the smoked flavoring of one of the ingredients overwhelmed most of the other flavors (including the delicious garlic sauce it was served in). The hanger steak was small. Someone ordered the "Trout and Mussels," which, contrary to what the name suggests, does not actually contain mussels -- we were told after the fact as he searched for his mussels, that it has a "mussel jus folded into it." I'd suggest they either rename or explain ahead of time about that one, since he had opted for that choice based on the expected combo of trout and actual mussels. In sum, lots of other tastier and more efficient places to try out or revisit before I'd consider this one again.
