A wonderful experience with flavorful food expertly made and served. Service was attentive without being intrusive.  The intimate atmosphere of the restaurant, the lightning and service, the open kitchen, and the scents and tastes of a great tapas bar in the East village all serve to enhance the experience. Still, I did not find the restaurant to be five-star fare.  Very good food taken together with the amazing ambiance, however, and I'm definitely a fan. Being ensconced here is like: Returning home for the holidays, your mom is in the kitchen, the whole place is glowing, you glow, the food is all the better for it, yay.
