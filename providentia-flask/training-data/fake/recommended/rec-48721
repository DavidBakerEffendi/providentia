Went there with my husband for a romantic date . The d√©cor is beautiful, the space a little bit small but nothing crazy. The food was a tiny bit bland. I may be spoiled because I live near two great thai-fusion restaurants. I just expected more. I would say, if you are around, try it out. Otherwise, getting there is a hassle that wasn't worth it to me.
