Prepare yourself for flavors you're either very familiar with, or not familiar at all. Beck's offers delicious Po Boys, anything from chicken, steak, and seafood, to GATOR! And they are all uniquely delicious in their own way. But I'm only going to write about the ones I've tried. (+)The GOODS: Their spread. It's almost on every Po Boy, and if it isn't, ASK FOR IT!!!! DO NOT MISS OUT!! Fried Mac n Cheese Balls are unlike anything I've had before. It's simple, it's tasteful, and most importantly, it's FRIED MAC N CHEESE!! The Fried Shrimp Po Boy is SO good. The shrimp is super fresh (Gotta love reading Terminal Market), and each bite bursts in your mouth with so much flavor. I also got to add fried oysters to mine, and as heavenly as it was I wish I got the two separate sandwiches. The Train Wreck is MIGHTY delicious. Who would've thought Salami and Andouille added to steak would add SUCH a kick!!! It's cheesy, it's meaty, and it's messy!!! Just writing about it is making me drool... (-) The BAD: The Gator Po Boy could have been more exciting. I love their Gator Gumbo, which is insanely delicious, so I automatically assumed the Po Boy is going to be off the hook. But I have two problems with it: 1. Too many green peppers. 2. And too much spicy mustard. (I was expecting their delicious spread to begin with, so I was already a bit disappointed to see mustard in there.) These two problems just took away the flavor I was looking for; GATOR! --------------------------------------------------­--------------------------------------------------­-------- I'm going to give Beck's Cajun Cafe 4 Stars because their staff has always been SUPER nice, and somewhat entertaining with their shenanigans. And you can see everything if you sit there; from the first step of the food being prep'd, to cooking and serving of it.
