When I brunch I tend to brunch in the city, but I woke up in New Jersey, so New Jersey is where I brunched. (That sounds so pretentious. I'm sorry.) At any rate, it was a decent brunch. Points for the cute cafe atmosphere, cheaper-than-Manhattan prices, speed of coffee refills, and my friend's chai. The food was pretty average, though. I had the salmon benedict and it was tasty but not special. And that pretty much described the rest of my group's food, too. A solid breakfast/brunch place with standard menu options makes it easy for everyone to find something they like, so despite the slight crowdedness, I'd recommend it for groups. I'd come back for the chai, and to try the sandwiches, so four stars.
