Great sushi! It is tiny inside but they have a nice outdoor seating area in front. The special rolls are quite large - we liked all of the rolls we tried (special salmon, macrobiotic were my favorites) and the hijiki salad was fantastic. I am definitely planning to come back to try one of the bowls. Fantastic addition to the neighborhood.
