Good environment, simple but friendly service. But the quality/price ratio is too low. I ordered the number 1 on the menu, the hakata classic "set". I chose the rice with roasted pork as the "side". The rice arrived first, which I did not prefer, I prefer to eat all dishes simultaneously. It is a very small bowl of rice (appetizer size) with very few slices of pork and a bowl of some leafs. I mix the leafs and the rice together and finished it in 3 bites, nothing special. The noodle came, the bowl is very big, but the inside, not much content. soup is very thick, noodles are good texture, but the pork is not tender, and dry like wood. I finished the noodles in 4 bites, the soup is tasty because of MSG's. Total cost is 18 dollars. Afterwards, I went to Chinatown's Dumpling house and ate another 8 dumplings, because I was not full at all. This place is good for petite-bourgeouis who want to be very fashionable. But for filling stomach, it is poor.
