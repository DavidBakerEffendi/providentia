I was super excited to check out Modo Mio which is right in my neighborhood. The atmosphere was great, the bread which they make there amazing...but the food was REALLY salty...the meat was cooked perfectly and tasted great but everything else was so salty, that's all you could taste. I would go there much more if that weren't the case because everything else about the restaurant is great.
