What a wonderful experience. On a quite residential street was a discrete door that opened into a warm large room with filled with diners. It seemed like people were flocking from all areas to have dinner here. We were seated right away (love that about Brooklyn). Started with the Southside coctail, which I have to say is one of my favorite drinks ever. Gin, cucumber, lime, mint and a bit of soda water. Yum! Also had the duck confit tartine. Huge portion. I'd recommend sharing it, but I ate it all. Had the cod for my entree. Very fresh and flakey and flavorful. Service was spot on. Everyone work as a team, dishes were timed perfectly (I hate getting my entree when I'm still working on my app and there's no room on the table!), service was attentive. Great spot to go for a sophisticate evening with friends, or a romantic date night. Menu was inventive, but nothing really stood out. Maybe we'll be back for brunch...
