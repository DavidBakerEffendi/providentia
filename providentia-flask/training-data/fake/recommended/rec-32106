Always, always, always a great meal. Worth the wait. Everything is good. One times, when they brought the food, they were smart enough to put the plate of food for my toddler in front of ME so I could cut it up before giving it to her. In general, they are as accommodating to children and babies as they can be in a small space. Beware: really busy on Sundays. Also, I'm usually paleo, but I will eat their tea biscuits.
