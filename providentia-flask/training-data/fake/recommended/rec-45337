We live around the corner and want so badly for this to be our neighborhood spot. The place is very nice and cool and dinner is delicious - really very good. Brunch is just such a disappointment, we have been for brunch/breakfast/lunch about 10 times this year and for the prices the portions are just too small. One egg for 10 -12 bucks, today it was chicory salad, with chopped egg so fine you could barely see it, 2 fingerling potatoes cut in half and three 2 inch by 1/2 slices of house smoked salmon for $14. I always leave with my pocket much lighter and still very hungry. Mixed drinks are very small for the standard NY prices..$12-14. The only other thing is that if you sit in either of the two aisles be prepared to get knocked, elbowed, smacked by a purse or water spilled on you because they have not left enough room for the customers to sit and servers to comfortably work. they need about a foot more room on each side - this alone has ruined my expensive meals before. For perspective I have lived in the East Village for 14 years and Brooklyn for two, I am fine with small spaces and paying premium...but sometimes I just feel like i am being taken advantage of here. I will go back for dinner, but I think I have given up on going any earlier.
