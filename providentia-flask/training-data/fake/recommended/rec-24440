We had a fabulous dinner here for a party of 6. We talked to the Chef, who is  handsome and charming as well as a food artist. Our waiter guided us through and we had:  baked goat cheese, patatas brava, anchovies, paquillo peppers, arroz murciano, crispy artichokes, great wine  and all in a beautiful setting. Thank you, Salinas,  for a very special evening.
