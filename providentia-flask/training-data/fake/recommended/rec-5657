Added Update: Returned to Frankford Hall again last night.  Had the Poutine Burger while sitting by the fire. Sounds romantic, huh?  It tasted like fall. Open faced dry-aged beef patty topped with fontina fries and an awesome foie gravy. I am bumping up my Rating to 5 Stars because of the excellent fall atmosphere of this place.
