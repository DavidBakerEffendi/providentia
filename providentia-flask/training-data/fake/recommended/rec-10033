Came here with a group of 10...& it was my first time having Peruvian food. It's a two story restaurant & I love the interior. It has a nice touch with the tea lights on the stairway. You feel like you're in Peru. :) Good for groups. Very loud with loud music & loud talking. Very hard to hear your dining companions talking. My boyfriend & I had the Peruvian combo. The chicken was so juicy! The skin was seasoned nicely, with no overkill & tasted so delicious! The avocado salad wasn't much, as it's sliced avocado, sliced tomatoes, served over a bed of "american" salad. The fries could have been cooked a bit longer. The green sauce....mmmm! Had the strong taste of green peppers. I poured it on my salad, chicken & fries! This combo enough (& then some) for two people. The water even tasted good; no chemical / metal taste.  For my cocktail, I had the Pisco punch - wow, one of these & i was feeling good! It was pretty strong. For our group of 10, (total order of two matador & one Peruvian combo), it took quiet a bit of time, but it was Friday night & they were busy. Additionally, there were four birthdays while we there. The wait staff were friendly & attentive & we never had to worry about our water / drinks running dry. Place is very clean & quick to clean off tables & set up for the next patrons.  The prices are reasonable, especially for the amount of food you get. Next visit I really want to try one of the ceviches.
