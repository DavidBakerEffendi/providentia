For me, the word "brunch" denotes overrated and pretentious food while listening to The Sex & The City theme song. This is usually a turnoff and I'd rather eat a bowl of cereal then drink a few beers to get my buzz on. Well I can be a hypocrite once in a while. I enjoy this place for breakfast and sometimes brunch when i can go with my wife. Items such as the Nutella french toast, pumpkin waffles and penny egg sandwich on a croissant are my favorites. Be warned the brunch isn't one of those all-you-can-drink soirees; you're here for the food, complemented by a cocktail. The secret is to beat the crowds. Come early, enjoy the comfort foods and leave happy. IFHTP 3+
