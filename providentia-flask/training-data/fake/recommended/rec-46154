It was Restaurant Week in New Haven and we wanted to try a place we haven't yet visited. Goodfellas was our choice. The decor is upscale. Our server Tony was attentive and helpful with our questions on the menu. The Prix Fixe menu did not disappoint. I enjoyed tomato and fresh mozzarella for app, the pork shank ossobucco with risotto for main dish and biscotti and black coffee for dessert. Our reservations were for 8p. The best part was that we were not rushed through the meal, so each course was enjoyed. I would go to Goodfellas again and look forward to the next meal there.
