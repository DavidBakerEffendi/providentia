This place is a well-kept secret.  My friends and I had reservations for pre-matinee brunch.  It is hidden against the water.  We thought we were walking into a hospital parking lot and suddenly the building Riverpark is in appeared. The building is very nice, the staff was incredibly friendly, and the restaurant itself has an elevated atmosphere. I immediately thought "I want to bring my boyfriend here."   The menu had a great variety of breakfast classics with a twist and more unique plates.  I had a Mexican inspired pulled pork dish.  The sauce was a little heavy but it was very delicious.  The avocado bread appetizer was incredible.  Who knew something so simple could be so delicious!?  Everyone's meals looked and (they say) tasted amazing. I definitely want to come back -- maybe for dinner.
