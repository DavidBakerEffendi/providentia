Went to Walter Foods a few weeks back and was pretty impressed. We sat out back, even though it was a bit chilly (it was about a 30-minute wait for a table inside on a Thursday night, I believe). We started with a few appetizers. The Crab Artichoke Dip was a bit overpriced ($14) and didn't have particularly large chunks of crab or artichoke, but it was cheesy and tasty nonetheless; could've used a bit more bread with it, though. The Pigs in a Blanket were made with chorizo and were fanTASTic. Loved. We also tried the Crispy String Beans (crispy because they're fried). I can't remember what the dipping sauce was that it was served with, but that really made the app for me. I think I even dipped the Pigs in a Blanket in that sauce. I really wanted the Iceberg Wedge salad, but I couldn't bring myself to pay $10 for it. Of the four of us at dinner, three of us got the Short Rib Burger and were quite happy. It was juicy and flavorful but didn't fall apart or drip too much. The fries were pretty standard. The fourth got the Grilled Butcher's Steak and wished he'd gotten the burger. He wasn't too impressed with the quality for the $$$ paid.
