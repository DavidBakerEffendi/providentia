Finally got to this place after being discouraged from going on several weekends by the long wait. On a summer Friday at 1pm, there was still a 30 minute wait. I had the blueberry pancakes, which were amazing and were served with what tasted like a maple syrup and butter mixture. Also had a side of cheese grits, which were nice because they weren't too runny and the cheese was blended well. Would have given it 5 stars for the food, but the prices are a little high and when my friend asked for some more maple syrup, they tried to charge him $2 for it. Oh, and they are cash only - I'm alway skeptical of cash-only businesses.
