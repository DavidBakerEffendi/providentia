After wanting to try this place for a very long time, finally went this past weekend with my fiancé. We got there and immediately got seated (on a Sunday night) and were both excited to try a few things off the menu. Of course we got the pork buns after reading a billion reviews on how incredible they were, and they did not disappoint. I was licking my fingers after I finished the last bite. But overall, I was severely disappointed in this place. First off, I'm big on service and the service in this place SUCKED - to say it simply. We had to wait 15 minutes before someone even approached us and then awhile longer before our order got taken. Considering the prices in what feels like a bar-type atmosphere, better service was expected. In the middle of our dinner, since there are tables with shared seating, another party of 3 came and sat down with us (that part is kind of annoying, not going to lie) and we heard their waiter, who was different than ours, read them off some specials. My fiancé and I looked at each other and said "Specials? We didn't hear about any specials.." so our waiter forgot that part too.  All in all, I'm happy I tried it and he seemed to like it better than I did.. "it's more of a guys place" he said to me, but I won't be rushing back. If I want some pork buns, I'll be picking them up at the Milk Bar next door.
