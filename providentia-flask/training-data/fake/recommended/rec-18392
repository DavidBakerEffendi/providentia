My family is from Houston, TX and we take our barbeque very seriously and Percy Street does not dissapoint. The first time I went to Percy Street I had the Rib Tip sandwich with mac and cheese. The sandwich was awful and has since been removed from the menu, but the mac & cheese was divine. The cheese sauce is sharp and the breadcrumb topping is buttery and adds great texture. I live a block away so I've returned a few times since. The PORK BELLY! Amazing! Eat it with the raw onions! Thank me later! The ribs are amazing, too. Big ribs with a great dry rub and smoke. I eat eveything here without suace. Their sauces are not bad, but I have grown-up with dry barbeque and I'm not changing. Fantastic whiskey list and if you live close by and love whiskey as much as I do, you should join their Whiskey Club.
