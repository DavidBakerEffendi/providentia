One of the top 5 BEST dining experiences of my life.  The food is delicious, the service is sweet and gracious and the atmosphere is marvelous.  I came here alone on a Thursday night in the bitter cold when I was really craving some hot soup and pork buns.  Ippudo satisfied all my desires.  The wait was only about 15 minutes and after that I was whisked away to the bar where I was sat opposite a crazy flurry of Japanese shouting and delicate food plating.  I was absolutely in Japan at this moment and I just kept smiling stupidly as I ordered my Sapporo and buns and classic ramen,  I devoured everything immediately after it was served, the food is that good.  And to top it off, they give you free tea with the bill, ADORABLE.  I'll come back here everytime I get a cold day soup craving from now on.
