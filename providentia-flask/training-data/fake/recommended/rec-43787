I have been to Locanda Verde 2 times and loved it both times.  Ate at the bar- which is also a great seat in the house.   Lamb meatballs!  Delicious.  Pesto ravioli-great.   Warm, cozy atmosphere.  High dark wood ceilings.  Beautiful women's bathroom- it's bigger than some NY apt.   Weekend brunch to begin soon Great service.  I will be back numerous times.
