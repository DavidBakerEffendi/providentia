Amazing flavors is what defines this place. While this is Mexican inspired, it doesn't come close to any Mexican food. This is the place to go if you want to impress and have some extra dollars to do so. Do not pass on dessert either because the flavor tour continues. Everything is so light but still filling if you get 2-3 dishes per person. Really great wine list but wish they highlighted their tequila and mezcal list with a cocktail menu.
