Never got to try Umami when i lived in LA, so was excited they opened in NYC. I really enjoyed it here! All I can say first is to go early because the wait gets quite long. We came probably at 5:30pm on a Thursday night. Apparently it's truffle season, there's a separate menu w/ an assortment of truffle based items that are so worth the try!!! My bf got the truffle special... It had a sunny side egg that was slightly runny, had a bed of arugula, & the truffle was the perfect touch. Delicious. I ordered the regular truffle burger from the regular menu, it had a yummy aioli sauce & the truffle touch was tasty, I was a bit disappointed there was no veggie in it. The bread is perfectly toasted on the inner part of the bun, stamped w/ the umami 'U' Both burgers appeared small in size, we were nervous we'd still be hungry, but honestly we were stuffed! To avoid a truffle overload, we had a side of the sweet potato fries, it had a little bit of sweet cinnamon, but balanced well w/ a little salt too, addicting. They served 4 different sauces served in Chinese soup spoons which were tasty! Garlic mayo, special ketchup, blue cheese, & a spicy creamy hot sauce. I saw the doughnut ice cream sandwich on Thrillist, so I was excited to try it. Unfortunately it was a disappointment. It was kind of a kill joy to our umami experience. Its a pre-frozen ice cream sandwich, so the doughnut was frozen, stale, & didn't taste how a doughnut should be eaten: soft/fresh. Ended up just removing the ice cream & ate it separately.
