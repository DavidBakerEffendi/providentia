Nom Nom has some of the better ramen in Philly in my opinion, which unfortunately doesn't say much because decent ramen is hard to come by in Philly. I have talked to some friends who have tried many more places and they agree with this statement. I lived in Japan for 2.5 months and I miss all the delicious ramen there so much! It was like cheesesteaks are to Philly as ramen is to Tokyo. Every Ramen shop (there was many) had their own slightly different variety whether it was the type of broth or noodle. So while Nom Nom's ramen is a few levels down from the best stuff I had in Japan (near Hiyoshi if you are Japanese or curious) I would go back to Nom Nom next time I am craving that delicious salty, porky and rich flavor and don't have 1.5k to spend on a round trip flight to Tokyo. Regarding the service: Â I have read some of the other reviews talking about slow or below average service during peak lunch rush. Nom Nom is located in the heart of the downtown / financial district so weekday lunches could definitely be insane, as with most other tasty quick lunch spots in the area. However, I have avoided the most crowded times during my visits and have never had less than good service. The workers have always been nice to me and my friends when we have been there.
