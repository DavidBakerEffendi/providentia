Very good food, a nice inexpensive find. Hell's Kitchen is filthy with Thai joints, but we felt we made a good choice for what we wanted (solid food, not uptight atmosphere). The decor is weird but not bad and they do a brisk take out business, so clearly a neighborhood favorite. As a non meat eater, I was disappointed I didn't have a ton of options, but what I got was good. They don't have a veggie larb and my husband wasn't into that, so we didn't try one of those dishes or a special. They gave us direction on ordering in a utilitarian kind of way, so don't expect touchy feely service, but honestly it was perfect for our needs and it is definitely in our list of good food stops in the city.
