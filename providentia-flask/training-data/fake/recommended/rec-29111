As the one fine dining restaurant we went to when visiting New York, I am so happy I chose Gramercy. It was AMAZING. We went for lunch, ended up all choosing the special which was a roast beef sandwich. It was probably the best meat I have ever tasted. Melt in your mouth and so flavorful. It was so awesome. There is a wood fire grill that makes the entire place smell wonderful too.
