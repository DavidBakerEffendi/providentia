Swift is a pretty awesome neighborhood bar.   At risk of being ambiguous, I would describe it as an adult dive bar.   Its dark bar look and smell make it feel like a dive but it has an awesome selection of beer and scotch, so it tends to draw an older crowd than some of the other dives in the area that cater more to NYU and post-grad crowd.  Good place to meet a friend for a quick drink or two if you are in NoHo.
