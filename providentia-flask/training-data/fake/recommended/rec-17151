Went in here for a quick dinner. Food was really good. Very cool and peaceful environment. I had the salmon which was fantastic. Wish it was a little bigger but it was delicious. The fresh hand cut fries are just as good with out ketchup. Next time i go i hope to try the burgers which i hear are great. Friendly waiters who check up on you and constantly refill water without asking which is a plus !
