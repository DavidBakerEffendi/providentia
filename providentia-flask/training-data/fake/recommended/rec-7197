In terms of authentic Italian food, Malatesta sets the bar VERY high. I would even argue this is the best Italian food I have ever eaten. We stopped by here on a Friday night, and were assigned a 1 hour wait for a 2-person table. Not too bad, consider it's the West Village and the restaurant was packed with people. Once seated, we were served a lovely bread with balsamic & olive oil--so GOOD! I could have made a meal out of the bread alone, it was fresh and had the perfect amount of salt and crunchy/chewy ratio. We ordered a delicious cabernet, which was EXCELLENT with the food even though we didn't get any red meat. We opted for the balsamic mushroom mozzarella appetizer, a meat tortelloni on the special menu and the spaghetti alla chitarra. While the mushroom appetizer and tortelloni were excellent in their own right, I have to say the star of the show was definitely the spaghetti. AMAZING SPAGHETTI. I'm talking the kind of spaghetti that Julia Roberts wolfs down in Eat Pray Love. Such a simple combo of al dente pasta, tomatoes, basil and olive oil, but absolutely incredible. I devoured the whole plate. And I didn't regret it. All in all , a wonderful, romantic and intimate restaurant that feels very comfortable and "homey". Grab some spaghetti and wine and you'll be set for an excellent experience.
