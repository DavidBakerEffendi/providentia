My first Khyber Pass visit was years ago and it was quite possibly the scariest moment of my life.  Out on a pub crawl and completely overwhelmed by Philly's excellent beer, I staggered  into this place only to find Hippies, patchouli oil, a Grateful Dead cover band, and warm New Castle.  I actually thought I'd died and gone to hell. Since then the place has undergone a substantial attitude adjustment and, as the reviews clearly indicate, it's become a solid stop for a beer or three.   My recent visit confirms this and I have no complaints except for one...the bbq ribs.   Beer section was great, we had awesome, attentive service, but the ribs were almost inedible.  They simply had too much salt in the rub and too much rub on the ribs. And the sad truth is that if it weren't for that one thing they would have been good, maybe even great?  Good smoke flavor, moist, not over-done, but they covered every inch of the ribs in a thick layer of spice that was nothing but salt and heat.  I made it through three before I gave in.   For an $18 half-rack I expected better and with decent alternatives not far away (and with Fette Sau now in the mix) they should seriously take a look at the rub recipe and prep-work.
