The meat & cheese platter was exceptional, I enjoyed every bite. I would recommend to anyone coming to the area and will try and stop by again if I am every in Philadelphia again. I also had the gnocchi, which was made in house & very yummy. The portion for the pasta was small, which works for me but I wouldn't recommend someone with a healthy appetite get just one dish. I had a few glasses of a very good merlot & enjoyed the atmosphere. The bartender was very pleasant, funny and attentive to all the customers.
