Best tap list in town.  Haven't seen this many belgians in Burlington anywhere else. The food matches well - easily the best burgers in town.   The menu is bit too much on the comfort food side for me.  But then it's a "farmhouse" style menu, so I guess that's to be expected. It can get loud - so if it's nice, try and get a table outside if you want to have a conversation. Don't miss this place if you are in town to sample what the West Coast of New England has to offer.
