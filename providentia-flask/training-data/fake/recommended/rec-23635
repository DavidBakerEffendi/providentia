I just got back from Bridgid's tonight and...wow. The bf and I thought it would be a nice neighborhood place to get some fried food/beers/burgers.   First of all... The place SMELLS dirty.   The appetizer (flatbread) was pretty gross and floppy but we decided to stick it out for our entrees (burgers) Our burgers were DISGUSTING.  I'm writing this while my bf is next to me after throwing up.   DON'T EAT ANYTHING HERE.  I was even glad that I got a bottle of beer instead of a draft.   AVOID THIS BAR AT ALL COSTS.   I will never go back.   It honestly felt like I was Gordon Ramsey sitting in a terrible restaurant before it got made over.  It was ridiculously bad.
