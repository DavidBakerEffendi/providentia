I found the truck near my office today after reading rave reviews about it on Midtown Lunch. I ordered the lemon chicken cous cous. I waited about 7-10 minutes for my meal to be ready, and then had my platter topped off with the white and red sauce. For $8, I got A LOT of food. The cous cous was light and fluffy, the vegetables were tender, and the chicken was cooked perfectly. There wasn't a lot of chicken, but I didn't really mind as I'm trying to cut back on meat anyway. I didn't get any bad (chewy) pieces though. The platter overall was very flavorful. I only ate about half of it for lunch, and then I took it home and used the leftovers to make stuffed peppers for my boyfriend and I. They were also super tasty. I will definitely return!
