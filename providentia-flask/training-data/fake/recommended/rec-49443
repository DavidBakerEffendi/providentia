My mom visited this weekend, and we wanted some food before catching the movie. I made reservations for 7:45pm, but we arrived about 20 minutes late. We were seated immediately, even though it was pretty busy -- Saturday night. My mom ordered the flounder with a side of mashed potatoes. I had the fried calamari with a side of french fries. The food was HORRIBLE. We tasted each other's dishes. The flounder had no flavor. My calamari was topped with marinara sauce, but I could barely taste the tomatoes in that sauce. Clearly, these cooks don't know how to season or marinate. I didn't even eat half of it. Even the french fries, which I finished, kinda sucked. They tasted stale, and weren't even crunchy. How can you mess up fries??!!
