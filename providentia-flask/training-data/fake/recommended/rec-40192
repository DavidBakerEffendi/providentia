I have been coming here since 1998. A few things you have to know going in, this is a small place. Groups of 2 or 4 great. Groups of 6, it's pushing it. I never understood why people came with a large group. These people clearly didn't read the reviews of the size of this place.  They have other locations for larger groups. Never been, but am aware. My dh and I get almost the same thing every time. Depends if we bring people or not. Greek salad, no greens(lettuce), half humus half baba, shrimp scampi (sometimes we get shrimp pil pil, but usually not) and octopus.  Sometimes we don't do shrimp and get 2 octopi. We haven gotten the lamb entrée when we go with other especially if we can't convince them on no entree. Why get an entree? What a waste. So what you get rice and gross greens. No need. The small plates are plenty filling and amazing. The shrimp has this garlicky oil that is so good we dip the pita in to soak up the goodness. On a day we are watching calories, the octopus is grilled and less oily. It is especially good when a little more done. I love picking out the well done pieces. The chewy pieces are great as well. This is cash only and BYOB. Bring a good one!
