I dined here last night with my good friend from college and her mom, who were staying at the New York Athletic Club and chose this restaurant per a recommendation from an employee of NYAC. It was absolutely excellent. This restaurant really capture what Little Italy should be. A table that utilized the open air setting, service that took advantage of every minute to make our dining experience more enjoyable. I had a linguine dish, and the pasta was clearly fresh, and the sauce was decadent, creamy, and perfectly executed. My favorite part, though, were the freshly steamed vegetables. The asparagus was especially soft and delicious. For dessert I had a piece of lemon cake, almost like a lemon bar, but with a bit more substance. It was served a la mode with a scoop of banana ice cream. Heaven? You bet. Nothing makes a meal better than having great company, great service, and delicious food.
