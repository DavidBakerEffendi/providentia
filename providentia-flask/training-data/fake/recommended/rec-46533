Walking into Robataya for the first time can be described with 1 word: STRIKING. What is this crazy looking bar with 2 people sitting in the middle of seemingly random dishes of veggies and meat and beer and sake and seafood?  We were discombobulated, but luckily our waiter came by to explain the menu to us.  So the scoop is - there are 2 seating sections "bar" and "back."  There are also two cooking styles "kitchen" and "grill."  Anything made by the grill is done by the 2 dudes sitting in the middle of the bar.  You can point at food to order it or order with the waiter.  Also, everything from the grill is served via a long wooden paddle.   The verdict on the food is that it's (1) a tad overpriced (2) good.  But remember you're also paying for the experience!  I agree with other reviewers that it's ONLY worth coming here if you're at the bar.  Otherwise, you're just at an overpriced Japanese restaurant.   Favorites were (from the grill) Okra, Kobe Beef (we got 1 order each for $11 per pop... it's a thin kobe slice cut additionally into 4 or 5 pieces), L.I. Duck, mushrooms.  Also ordered the Uni and it was tasty, though small and kinda hard to share.   -1 star because the waiter wasn't helpful in suggesting sake, like at ALL.  All we said was we wanted smooth cold sake... the waiter didn't even make 1 direct suggestion (he kept asking us if we liked certain brands... which we don't know... and we'd just repeat we want smooth... and it became a circular conversation).  Next time, I'll just get Sapporo or do some sake research before! All in all - great experience, good meal.  I would definitely recommend it for a date!  It's fun and interesting... but not a great value and definitely not good for groups.  I would definitely recommend this superstar robataya bar!
