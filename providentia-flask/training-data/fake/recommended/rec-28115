Sweet Afton has a good beer selection and those dangerously addictive fried pickles, not to mention fantastic burgers. I also love the decor and low-key ambiance. The backyard is lovely in good weather too. I have to credit them for introducing me to the Old Fashioned and making me into a fan of applejack. There's always something interesting afoot on the menu. However, timing is everything if, like me, you seek the low key Sweet Afton. When the bar's not packed to the gills, it's great. Other times, the buzz is a bit much for me. One particularly busy night I literally could not hear anything my friend was saying--and she was sitting right next to me. Overall, it's most definitely worth a visit. One of my favorite neighborhood bars. I'd also say it's a contender for best neighborhood burger--and that's saying something with the competition in these parts.
