For all if the hype, I thought both the cheese steak and Italian hoagie were average. After having their steak I think I prefer larger pieces of meat like Jim's or Pats where here they dice it to the point where it's almost ground. Plus mine was salty and had a ton of gristle. It's still a good sandwich and the restaurant had an awesome feel, just didn't think it was anything overly special
