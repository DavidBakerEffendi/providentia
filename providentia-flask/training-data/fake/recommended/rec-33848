I recently found this place to be a hidden gem for on the go indian delights. The dosas are delicious and very filling and a good selection of choices and combinations that let you have it your way. I think the service was fine , alot of times, i come in there and people are spaced out on the board trying to figure out what they want so, if you dont say anthing the counter person will let people zone there .  too many choices and combinations can make you think they are not interested in taking your order, but this is what happens when i come in and not sure what combination  I want to have . the chutneys are amazing and I suggest trying all of them to see which one you like the most.
