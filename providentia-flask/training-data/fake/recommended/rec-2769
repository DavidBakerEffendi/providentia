This is the cutest place that ever existed. Cute and yummy, what more do you want?! I got the Chevre Crepe for brunch and it was delicious. Every bite was just as good as the last, the taste didn't get tiring. The salad that comes on the side was refreshing and cleaned your palate well. The one downside, I was still slightly hungry after devouring my plate.
