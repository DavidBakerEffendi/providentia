the food was so good! we ordered the hummus with freshly baked bread, grilled swordfish kebabs with rice, grilled chicken with rice, shephard's salad and some baklava for dessert. I ate until I had no more room in my stomach. the food is reasonably priced and generously portioned. atmosphere is very crowded and cramped. I loved the kabobs and baklava! I also tried the mezzes platter which is highly recommended and their grape leaves is so addictive.
