Easily one of my favorite restaurants. I live in Chicago, but whenever I visit my sister in NYC, multiple visits to Graffiti are a must. The food is so carefully prepared and thought out... and DELICIOUS! Make sure you try the dumplings, shrimp, and pizza. But really, no matter what you order, you can't go wrong. Jehangir, the owner and chef, is absolutely fantastic. If you haven't been... you're missing out.
