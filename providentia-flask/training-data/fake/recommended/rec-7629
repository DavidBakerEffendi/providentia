great brunch spot!  I loved my veggie omelet and my husband raved about this french toast.  friendly service, clean and quiet atmosphere, organic local ingredients, great selection of teas, and they actually have soy milk!  I thought it was perfect, even if it's a little out of place for the neighborhood.
