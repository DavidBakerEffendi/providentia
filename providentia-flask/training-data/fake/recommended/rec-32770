The menu is almost entirely gluten free.  So many gluten free options that they put an star by the ones that AREN'T gluten free.  It was so amazing to be able to chose from the entire menu with freedom and knowing I wasn't going to have to ask for anything weird.   Had a margarita (good) and three or four tacos.  The tacos were good, not great.  The fried oyster taco was super unique, but a tad dry.  The baja fish was definitely the best one I tried.  Excellent flavor on the fish and well cooked.  Some reviews complained about size, but they were the size I was expecting - small.  This ain't Taco Bell, y'all. Their service method was unique and I liked it a lot.  Our server was so incredibly sweet and just did a great job all around.
