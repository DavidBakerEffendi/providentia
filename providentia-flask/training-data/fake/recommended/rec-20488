Not ALL that. Four of us dined there and most of it was good. Some was super meh. First the good, my friend's NY Strip was cooked PERFECTLY, was beautiful and a great piece of meat. The potatoes au gratin were yummy. Very well done and cheezy. Broiled tomatoes were also surprisingly awesome. The desserts (chocolate explosion and cheesecake were AH mazing!). The bad... My petite filet and shrimp was not cooked well. It was not overcooked (well instead of medium as ordered). Our waiter was also not awesome. He wasn't around much and was a bit of a jerk at times. Did NOT love! The ugly? The lobster mac and cheese was not good AT ALL. It was watery (not gooey) and the lobster was chewy. Bleh! What a waste of good potential. The pace of the meal also kind of stunk. It was paced quickly and we were rushed a bit. Not the best meal I have had on any level. Not even close. Doubt I'd go back. I get better service and steak at Outback for less than half the price.
