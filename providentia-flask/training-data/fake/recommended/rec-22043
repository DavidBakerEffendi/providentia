I love this place, but I took off a star because the entrees are not that good. Why do I love it, then, you say? Because of the drinks. If beer is not your thing, do not worry, my friend. Though they have ample amounts of beer, they also have other tasty selections. They make BADASS spritzers. And they have cider. Really good cider. And I am of the impression that really good cider is hard to find, unless you cross the pond to Great Britain. Appetizers= good stuff. Go for the nachos. Always my favorite. Waitstaff always looks like their trying REALLY hard to accomodate everyone, but they are so busy. Have some empathy when you see them running back and forth. They'll get to your table as soon as they can.
