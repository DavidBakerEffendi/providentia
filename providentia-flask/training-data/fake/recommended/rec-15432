The food was excellent. We ordered the Calamari Grigliata as an appetizer, which was a nice fresh take on calamari (grilled and served atop a bed of salad). Our pastas were equally tasty. You can't go wrong with tiramisu for dessert. In terms of service, we made a dinner reservation and were early so we waited about twenty minutes to be seated since nearly all tables were full. The female hostesses were polite and helpful when we requested the outdoor garden seating in the back. The male that seemed to be in charge wasn't so accommodating. He told us the garden was closed, even though it clearly wasn't, and insisted we sit out front on the sidewalk tables since we wanted to be outside. The hostesses seated us in the garden anyway where we enjoyed the cozy ambiance. Our waitress was friendly and quick to respond. Overall, it was a nice night.
