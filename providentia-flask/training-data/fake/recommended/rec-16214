My family and I have dined here after going to the theater many a time.  The food is consistently good and the portions on HUGE, every dish is served family style.  This place is GARLIC HEAVY so if you are thinking about kissing someone after you've dined here you might want to have your head examined. It's a great place to go with a large group of people. In fact, I'm thinking of coming with a bunch of friends for my birthday this year because it's great but you really need to go here with a large group of people.
