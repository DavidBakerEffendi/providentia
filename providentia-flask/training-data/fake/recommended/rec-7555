Casual old-school restaurant--awesome if you like big portions of red-sauce Italian. Service is good and efficient but not there to give you preferential treatment. The exception was that the chef personally served our pizza to our table. Not sure why, but she ran it out, and that was kinda cool (she said I know there's no [x] on it because I made it--she was smiling when she said it and very friendly.) Cash Only!
