I've been to song twice now. As someone mentioned, the decor is modern and deceptively high brow in appearance. Darkly lit and cozy, it creates an intimate setting that good for a first date or public break up(no space to make a scene here). The first time I went to song I fell in love! There portions of calamari are massive, delicious and won't break the bank. I am far less adventurous in trying new foods than I would care to admit, so both times I've had the Pad Thai. The first time it was a dream, very flavorful and rich. The second time I also had the pad thai and it was very disappointing; perhaps they had a different cook but my meal seemed sloppily prepared, with ingredients added that aren't in a traditional P.T. Very disappointing. Overall, I probably WILL go back to Song because my overall dining experience there is quite pleasant...I just won't take my chances on the Pad Thai.
