I've never experience Thai food before but going to Spice II was a great experience. The food was incredible as was the service. I had the calamari as an appetizer it was lightly breaded and had a sweet dipping sauce. It was my favorite part of the entire meal and I would go back just for that. For my entree I had the pineapple chicken. It was also sweet which I enjoyed and it was very good and had a lot of vegetables. I didn't order anything spicy but the chicken was slightly spicy which someone with no tolerance to spicy food would notice. I tasted my mother's entree, which was the the Royal Duck. As someone who's never had duck before I really enjoyed it. Parts of it were a little fatty but my mother and I both loved it. It's a small cute place and I would recommend it for couples or small parties. I would definitely go back to Spice II.
