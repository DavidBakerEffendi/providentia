We saw Good Dog Bar on Food Network and had to give it a try. When you first walk in it looks insanely tiny, but they've got three levels. We ate on the 2nd floor. It was pretty packed so we had a drink at the bar first. The bar tender was very nice. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes to be seated. As per Food Network's suggestion, we tried the Cheesesteak Empanada appetizer. OH MY GODDDD - amazing!! I'd never had fish sauce before, so I was hesitant to dip my empanada, but let me tell you, the combination is amazing. You've GOT to order the empanadas. We also tried the duck pot pie (eh, it was ok); the baked macaroni and cheese (interesting taste from all the different cheeses); and a cheeseburger and fries. The fries were pretty yummy. Overall, it was a cute city restaurant. However, the only reason I would go back is for the Cheeseteak Empanadas. If, and I mean IF, we go back, I would order 2 or 3 orders of the empanadas and eat only that.
