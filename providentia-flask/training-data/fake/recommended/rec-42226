I've been to Blue Ribbon Brooklyn a few times, most recently on special occasions as they're not what one would call cheap food. But as I've never, ever been disappointed by anything served, its well worth it. My husband and I made a reservation for my birthday dinner there and I went with a dish in mind; I had to try the beef marrow and oxtail marmalade. I LOVE oxtails and ossobuco and the appetizer was featured on 'The Best Thing I Ever Ate' on the Food Network. It was super tasty, mellow but flavorful with an extra punch if you sprinkle on some of the sea-salt that its served with. We also had the pu-pu platter which was a sampling of shrimp, skewered chicken, bbq ribs (a pleasant surprise), pierogies and spring rolls which were good, but not as amazing compared to the former dish. For the entree we shared the oxtail fried rice (yes, loooooove oxtail) which was nothing I could have imagined and quite delicious. For drinks, hubby had a Brooklyn lager and I had a French martini. Excellent, excellent stuff! Our server was attentive but not cloying and the atmosphere was quite and relaxing with none of the snooty that comes with some of the places that know how good their food is. Highly recommended.
