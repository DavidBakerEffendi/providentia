What a cute little place, I can't and won't comment on the sushi. I will however talk about the spicy seafood soup that was really good. The broth had tons of flavor and a good amount of heat. It had all kind of seafood in it as well as celery. I also had a bottle of the un-filtered sake that had hints of coconut. Overall a fun place with yummy soup&sake.
