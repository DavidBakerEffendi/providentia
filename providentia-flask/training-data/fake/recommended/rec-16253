AMAZING! I have worked in restaurant establishments my whole life and I know a great restaurant when I see one! The decor is cozy and welcoming, the staff treats you like family, the food is incredible from their appetizers to their desserts, highly recommend to look at their daily special board where they put the hidden gems of Vite from a fabulous risotto, daily steak and fish along with special appetizers that are just fabulous! Excellent wine selection, great service and overall a very joyous dinner! By far one of the best ones I've personally experienced. Thank you Vite! You have won over out hearts!
