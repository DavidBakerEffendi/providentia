I love The Smith! I diner here with friends about once a month. Its always good, fun atmosphere, not too expensive, and good location. Pros; not too expensive, easy to have a good dinner and a glass of wine for under $35, fairly easy to get a reservation on Open Table, great menu of American foods, good wine selection, near the movies Cons; can get loud at dinner, at little crowded at times but thats to be expected
