I am surprised to see so many negative reviews because I came to Uva 5 years ago, before I even lived in NYC, and it was so memorable that I keep coming back. I've brought several different groups on different occasions, and no one ever complained, and they all returned with other friends as well. It definitely gets crowded but that makes for a cool ambiance. I always order the beet gnocchi which is delicious - and I am first generation Italian so I am very picky :) I also loved the truffle dishes. Perhaps those who commented negatively just don't like truffle, because it is a very strong flavor. I am just sad I don't live down the street anymore.
