I live around the corner from Cookshop and it is really one of the best restaurants in the neighborhood. Very consistent and very seasonal. The menu changes almost daily as many of the ingredients are sourced from local farmers/suppliers. I will say that my only complaint is that the price makes it hard to make it a true regular spot. Even so, my girlfriend and I are always looking for an excuse to go! "Friends in town? Let's go to Cookshop!" "Out of milk? Let's go to Cookshop!" "What? Today's Wednesday? Let's go to Cookshop!"
