Love this part of Philly, Old City is a great place to go walk around and people watch, absorb some history and get a bite. When we used to live there I would have been so happy to have this place open. The food was pretty good, we had a couple orders of the 3 street tacos, (chicken) and a salad with a yummy cilantro-lemon Vinaigrette. The decor is very cool, festive colorful accents with dark walls. The outdoor seating is great for people watching. So why the 3 stars? Service was terrible, or muy mal if we're keeping it real.  We sat down and at least 15 minutes went by without a drink order. Finally the waiter comes by, takes our drinks order, we order chips and salsa (and really? It's a Mexican restaurant and there's no gratis chips and salsa? But whatev!) (then he never brings them...) 15 minutes later I'm parched and our drinks arrive. Another 20 minutes, our food arrives, it was pretty good, the mini accompanying salsas and pico was delish. But, want another drink or another order of something, forget it, our waiter like died or something. It's like crickets there... Then miraculously he resurfaces like 30 minutes later, we ask for the check, which shockingly takes him another 15 minutes to produce.  Food A, service F. But other than that, bueno.
