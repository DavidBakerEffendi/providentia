Seriously, the best Chicken & Rice I've had in the city! Something about the rice and the sauce just makes it so good! Plus the fact that it's super cheap! Usually we come when we're a bit tipsy after a night of drinking, and it tastes like the best thing ever! But I actually did stop by during the work week and it's still just as good my friends! If you're in the area, or even if you're not, and you're craving Chicken & Rice, you should totally check this cart out!
