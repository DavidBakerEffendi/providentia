TGI Fridays is your typical chain bar and grill. Food was good, nothing out of the ordinary.  They do currently have a deal $10 for unlimited appetizers, but you can only get one type. This was a pretty good deal for us since we just went after work for happy hour. We got several different kinds and shared them all. But none of the options were very healthy, Mostly fried and/or cheesy. The drinks were pretty good. They had some specials going on. I had a firey apple, which is Sumer shandy, fireball and something else maybe. But it was pretty good and only $5.   Some of the people in my group ordered long islands. Apparently they have two kinds, one for 6 and one for 12 which has better liquor. They were charged for the more expensive one because they didn't know there was a difference. They asked the waiter, he explained the situation. They then offered to pay for it, but the waiter changed the price for them without hesitation. I thought that was great, he ended up with a nice tip. Even though the food was nothing special there was good service and drinks at decent prices. It's not my first choice, but it was a convenient, easy option that wasn't too bad.
