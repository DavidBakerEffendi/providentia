This place is so good! I'm from NYC and have tried almost all of the famous bbq places,  but this little spot in CT we just happened to stumble upon while driving past was such a pleasant surprise. We had the full size beef brisket over fries with sweet and tangy sauce. Amazing! Incredibly tender and oh so flavorful. It was so good we ordered the pulled pork over Mac and Cheese to go. Wham bam seconds please m'am! Damn good. The customer service is excellent and the decor is simple but clean. If you happen to be on the neighborhood,  do your stomach a favor and stop by this joint.
