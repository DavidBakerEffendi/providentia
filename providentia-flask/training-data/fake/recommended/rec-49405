We came here for brunch on a cold, gray Sunday, after we'd been walking around outside for a while and were chilled to the bone. I ordered the Poached Eggs with Bacon Cheddar Grits and it was just the perfect comfort food to warm me back up. The idea of soft eggs on top of grits seemed a little strange to me at first (I worried about the lack of textural contrast), but it was really nice to be able to tuck into a big deep bowl of warm, creamy, salty gooeyness. My hubby had the Biscuits Benedict, which was exactly what it sounds like-- the lovechild of eggs benedict and biscuits and gravy. He gobbled it up. I also loved the idea and flavor of their whiskey Bloody Mary. Even the coffee was particularly good.
