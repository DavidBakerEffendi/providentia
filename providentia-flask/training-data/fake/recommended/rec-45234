Drove by this place on my way to the car wash where I get my oil changed. I decided to walk over and see what this place was about. I shocked on how gorgeous the place is. Looks very high end. I was greeted at the door. When does that ever happen anymore. Your lucky if someone says hi to you at Starbucks or panera. I sat at the nice coffee and Internet bar they have. I order based on a recommendation from the waitress something called a freddo with toasted marshmallow natural flavoring. Along with the Greek salad. Keep in mind that the Greek salad has no lettuce because in Greece it's not served with lettuce. I'm sure if you ask they will add it if you want because of how accommodating they are. Â I was blown away by the quality of the food and service I received. Prices are reasonable for this type of quality. I will be back many more times. This time I wanna try something with Nutella !!!
