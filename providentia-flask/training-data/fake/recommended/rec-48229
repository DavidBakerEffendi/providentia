Late night came from picking up a friend at the airport, we were hungry as hell so we stopped by on a cold cold night. the line wasn't too short but we got our orders in and out. the steaks.. great ! nice and hot with a side of onion rings and fries which i wasn't really a fan of but the steaks made up for it.
