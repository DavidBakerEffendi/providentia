I just enjoyed an absolutely fresh and delicious lunch of 5 different vegan sushi rolls and a few delectable bites at this new restaurant today. All were wonderful, but I liked the soft, chewy texture of the Spicy Mang roll. It was so nice to see Tom at the counter express such pure enthusiasm for the food and the sustainable practices and it was fun to see him handing out the menus outside to pedestrians in a old-fashion gentlemanly manner. His polite and attentive service is quite rare in New York. Jay (spelling?), sushi chef, did a superb job creating our nourishing food with a beautiful presentation. I'll be back with more friends!
