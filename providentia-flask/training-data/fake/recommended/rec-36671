Definitely, the best Lebanese food I have ever had outside Lebanon. Although none of the staff were Lebanese, they were friendly and accommodating. We started off with hummus, baba ghanouj, tabouli and stuffed grape leaves, then followed by the makanek, fried potato cubes, Â and finally the mixed grilled meats (chicken, Lanka chops, beef, and kafta) Like I said, this was the best Lebanese food I have had outside Lebanon. Thanks for reading or not...
