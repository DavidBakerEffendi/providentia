Ordered online so I could pick up dinner on my way home from work. Food was ready when I came 15 minutes before my scheduled pick up time (awesome) and still warm when I got home. I had the lamb curry and gulab jamun - both were delicious. Lamb curry included chunks of tender lamb and gulab jamun was sweet, and the (2) pieces were large. Definitely going to make this my go-to place to pick up dinner and hope to try the lunch buffet too!
