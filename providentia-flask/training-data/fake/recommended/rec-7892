So glad I got to try their food during the Baltimore dollar stroll! I got their tofu summer roll and the nam salad - both were really yummy! The only thing was I got the salad thinking I needed to get my daily need of veggies, but the summer roll ended up being more veggie heavy..the salad was still good! Just lots of fried things so it didn't feel as healthy as expected
