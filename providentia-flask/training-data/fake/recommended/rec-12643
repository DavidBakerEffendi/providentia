Located just outside the Times Square Marriott Marquis south entrance, Juniors has great indoor/outdoor seating just up off the sidewalk to help you avoid the hustle and bustle of Times Square.  They are a great young family alternative for a pre-show meal and are also great if you want to escape convention traffic or food. Waiters /waitresses are friendly struggling actors and actresses as you might expect so make sure to ask them what they've been in or about the shows you are going to see. I was at a conference and just wanted to get out for a bit so my colleague and I walked over.  We likes our lunch so much that we even came back later for a light dinner when we had even less time!   For lunch I went for the classic grilled cheese on thick Challah bread.  It was perfect, crispy and airy!  I had been enticed by someone's onion rings that I saw on the way in so I ordered those too.  I got this huge platter of them and could barely eat one.  The batter was so thick that they weren't crispy onion rings but rather cake-like.  Too much for me so we shared them with some fellow conference attendees at the next table.   Later that eve (the night Robin Williams died) we came back for a quick meal as we only had 45 minutes.  I had a craving for a pastrami on rye and I was not disappointed!  Piles of pastrami along with spicy brown deli mustard on a nice rye was perfect!  Service was great.  Our waiter humored us as we debated the greatest female Broadway star (my pick is Bernadette Peters). I'll definitely be back when staying around Times Square, although for non-business I try to avoid the noise and traffic in the area.
