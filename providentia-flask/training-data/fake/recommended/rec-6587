I never rate restaurants based solely on their waitstaff, but in this case an exception is necessary. Recently I had a one day trip to NYC, just enough time to go to a meeting, eat some food and hop back on a plane (YUCK). Luckily for me, my co-worker picked Kefi and I was blown away. Ok, the food was very good. Great Greek food, very reasonable and super fun atmosphere. But the highlight of my meal was my waitress. (I feel terrible, because despite my love for her, I've already forgotten her name) She was another NYC aspiring actress, but instead of making my meal a living hell with self-absorbed narcissism (like most actress-waitress combos) she actually used her considerable charm and charisma to make my meal something of a performance. Without distracting from the wonderful food (or my not particularly interesting company) she entertained us and made us feel welcome. Always available yet not hovering -- a very hard combo to come by. Not mention she was ridiculously hot. I mean, easily a 10 -- EASILY. Long blond hair, great smile, awesome personality? I only wish I lived in NYC so I could frequent Kefir more often!
