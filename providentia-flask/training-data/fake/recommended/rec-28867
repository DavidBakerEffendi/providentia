One of the few places in university city you can go to where you actually feel like you are in a nice upscale bar. During the summer and fall this spot is great with the roof top outside area with Bon fires. The bar is huge, I have never had a problem getting a seat. The options of seasonal and craft beer are the best I've came across in ucity. If you don't mind spending 60-100 bucks for two people I recommend coming here for a chill night. That's my only con, the prices.
