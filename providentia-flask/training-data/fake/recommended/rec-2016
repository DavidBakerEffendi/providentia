I have to say my new favorite crepe place. Sorry Beau Monde but my heart belongs to another. On a day walking around Temple I stumbled upon the hidden treasure. Looking at there menu I sat there for a least 10 minutes. Just too many options for me to go with. Finally I pick the blueberry cheesecake. And it was the great choice. The crepes are freshly made to order and all the ingredients are fresh and tasty. The finished product is Â a huge delicious mass of goodness and served in a some kinda pizza shaped container. Too bad I don't go to temple because I would be there everyday. They need something like this on Penn's campus. Until then will make the journey to Temple.
