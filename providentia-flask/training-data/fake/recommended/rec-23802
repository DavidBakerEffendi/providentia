I don't know. I feel like the buzz about this place should have worn down by now considering there are so many better taco places in the city. It's turned into more of a social establishment than a food one, with people being more enamored with eating "there" rather than quality of food. $19 for guacamole makes me feel like rubbing habaneros all over my wallet to make sure I never come back again.
