What a delightful place!  We arrived for Sunday brunch and there were only two other people there.  When we left, the place was packed and there were people waiting at the door.  Although, by that time, the noise level was getting up there as well.  There is a lovely view and the decor is charming.  There are benches against the wall that were somewhat uncomfortable though:  not enough back support. Food was excellent and the service was as well.  They have delicious freshly squeezed OJ too.  I had read in an earlier review that the croissants were wonderful, so I ordered one to add to the breakfast.  My husband thought that it was great....me, not so much.  Don't get me wrong, it was definitely good, but it wasn't the best I'd ever eaten.  We also had a fruit salad which could have had more varieties of fruit.  As it was, it had pineapple, apples, oranges, and strawberries.  Blueberries would have added a nice touch.   The only odd thing that I feel that I must mention is the bathroom.  They had lightbulbs that were as dim as night lights!  Seriously?  What's up with that?  Very strange. Just a note:  it was pricey.  Brunch for my husband and myself came to almost $50 and we didn't even have any alcohol.  While the food was very good, I'm not sure that it was THAT good.
