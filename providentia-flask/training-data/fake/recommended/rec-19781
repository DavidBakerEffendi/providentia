There are no words to express how happy I am that Umami is in NY! Love love love this place!  I was disappointed that my favorite burger, the Port and Stilton, isn't on the menu here.  However, the Umami Burger (called the Original here) and the Truffle Burger are delicious.  They also have a really good beer selection.
