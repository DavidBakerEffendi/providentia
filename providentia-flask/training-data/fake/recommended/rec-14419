The only reason I gave this place 3 stars (2.5 stars in reality) was because of the enchilada verdes sauce and friendly waitstaff. Having lived in California for 4 years, I would say my standards for Mexican food are very high. We ordered guacamole which was the worst guac I have ever had. I felt as if the chef had poured in half the salt shaker. It was so salty that we had to leave it after the first bite - something I have never done before when it comes to guac. For the entree I ordered a cheese enchilada verdes. The sauce was phenomenal but it was completely ruined because there were probably 2 slabs of cheese in there. I had to call for a separate quarter plate and pile it high with the cheese I picked out (yes there was THAT much cheese). Now I understand I ordered a CHEESE enchilada but a good chef knows that ingredients are supposed to be used in the right quantities. Who knows, maybe they were trying to justify charging me $15 for my entree with the quantity of cheese.
