Really enjoyed my first visit to Riposo 72!  We came in after a business meeting, and chose to eat at the bar.  (TIP: eating at the bar is almost always the best choice, because the service is fast, the bartender often can suggest good menu choices, and will usually offer you a sample of wine to try.) The bartender, Ian, was friendly and knowledgeable.  We ordered warm spiced olives to start (FABULOUS, btw). We split the Baby Arugula Salad with ruby grapefruit, Parmigiano Reggiano, and  citrus vinaigrette. The grapefruit was refreshing, and the vinaigrette was light and flavorful. We also split the Grilled Prosciutto & Fresh Mozzarella on crusty baguette. The prosciutto was lean, salty and delicious, and the mozzarella creamy and gooey. I like white wines, so Ian suggested the Anjou Blanc "Le Chenin" '08.  He gave me a sample -- it was a party in a glass!  My husband had the Castel Del Monte Melograno, which was also delicious. We struck up a conversation with another couple, and chatted for hours (one of those true New York moments)!  We were not pressured to leave, in fact, Ian offered us a sample of a sparkling Pinot Noir to round out the meal -- a great evening, and a great place!
