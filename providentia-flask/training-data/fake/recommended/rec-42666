Whenever we tell people that we "went to a Brazilian BBQ place," they always think that we went to Braza.  I've been to Braza a couple times and the quality of the food is probably comparable, but the value is on a completely different level. At first, I always got food from the "buffet" just so I got better pricing on the meat, but after a couple trips, I've grown to appreciate the variety and the flavor of the extra food they offer. The meat is always pretty good, if not a little salty.  I love the lamb there!  The most amazing part of getting meat there, is often they'll cut off the fat, and if you get ribs, they cut the bones out!  I usually avoid getting ribs, because I don't want the dead weight, but they take care of that for me! They also have some desserts and what look like Brazilian sodas.  I'm usually too full to get desert from there, but they look really good.  I've never tried the pizza. The food here is probably 3-4 stars, but with the pricing and how much food you get in comparison with a similar restaurant, I feel that bumps this up to 5.
