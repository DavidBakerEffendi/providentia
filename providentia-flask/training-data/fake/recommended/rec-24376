Being from LA, I've definitely had my share of good Chinese food. But there's something about Chinese food on the East Coast that makes it pretty special. I ordered a steamed vegetable dish and chicken chow fun. Both dishes were tasty and affordable (~$12 with tip), and delivery was pretty fast, even though they say it takes ~45 minutes. They take credit card orders under $25 over the phone. The place seems to be busy all the time though. When I called to place an order, it took me a few tries to get through, because I kept getting a busy tone. Maybe it's time to consider online ordering or something!
