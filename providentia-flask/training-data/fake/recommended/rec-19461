One of the best pizza places I've ever been to. The crust is a nice mix between thin and Neapolitan style as it's a little chewier than the typical thin crust and a little thinner than the typical Neapolitan. What really sets this place part is the toppings. As our table sat down, one of my dining companions started to look over the menu and let us know that she'd need a few minutes to really study it. Instead of your typical pizza menu, Paulie Gee's offers more "composed" offerings of combinations of unique deliciousness. I got the Lacinato Red with housemade vegan fennel sausage (because kale and vegan is like speaking my language). The sausage was amazing with an excellent fennel flavor unlike anything else I've ever had in vegan cuisine. I also loved the ambiance of the place, it was dark and comforting with that beautiful pizza oven standing out in the back. Just a fantastic place!
