I honestly believe that anyone who is NYC whether visiting or local must try this place! I seem to get good vibes from small hole-in-the-wall places who specialize in one thing, and one thing only. In this case, who doesn't love fri(t)es made really really well? This is a great quick stop for a snack with some friends. So if you're ever in the area, this is a must to visit! The sauces are what dress up the fries nicely. I tried the Organic Truffle sauce. It was pretty good, but I wouldn't say it was awesome. I didn't get too much Truffle-ness out of it, more just a creamy white (mayo-base) flavor. Nothing as special as it sounds... yes, I would say they played it up with "organic" and "truffle". Unfortunately, I didn't get to try any of the other sauces but look around on here for some recommendations. Try ketchup? Just kidding.
