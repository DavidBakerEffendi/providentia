I have been wanting to visit this restaurant with a special friend but he was unavailable at the time. So me and my bestie went together and were immediately impressed by the quaint, dimly lit restaurant and smiling staff that greeted us at the entrance.  The waitress took us to the back of the restaurant  where we were seated on the outdoor, enclosed deck..Beautiful!!! We were pleasantly greeted by our waiter which offered us bottled water (6 dollars).  We pondered over the menus and wanted to order all the popular items.  Red velvet waffles and organic chicken, skirt steak, mac and cheese, Carolina rolls, apple cobbler, sweet potato pie and we had sangria's for drinks...Everything was presented so well..And came out extremely fast.  The Carolina rolls were Delicious!! Made with short rib and sushi inspired!! The Skirt steak had a sauce on it that was so good!! Have no idea what it was..but it was great!! I look forward to visiting again. The atmosphere is really intimate and nice place for a date...Plan on treating a special someone in the near future :) Oh!! Check in on yelp and get 10% off!!!
