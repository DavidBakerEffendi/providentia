I enjoyed this Pio Pio 8. It came highly recommended by a friend, who actually said this was one of her top 5 best meals ever...so expectations were high to say the least. I'll be honest, my first impression was lousy. As I was handed a menu by the hostess she alerted me that they "were not serving chicken tonight because the machine was broken"...ummm...what machine do you need in order to make chicken? Clearly they are not using whole, organic products, eh? BUT luckily the dish that friend insisted was a "must try" was a beef dish, so we were still in business. I started with one of their Pisco Signature cocktails, with fresh cucumber and jalopeno...delicious! I then had an avocado salad, nice, not remarkable, and finished with the Lomo Saltado: stir fried beef with tomato, onion and potatoes. Very tasty. Overall, not best meal ever, but definitely got the job done and I would eat there again if I was a local. Seeing as I am a visitor, I would probably opt to try something new rather than return.
