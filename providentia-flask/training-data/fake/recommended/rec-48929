As others have said, go for the Korean food. The stone pot bibimbap is freaking addictive, I'm dreaming about it as I type this. Don't be afraid of the raw egg on top, by the time you toss it around in the hot stone bowl it's fully cooked. The assortment of condiment dishes that come with the Korean items are a joy unto themselves (kimchi!). I don't usually order the same thing every time when I go to a restaurant, but this place is one of those few exceptions.
