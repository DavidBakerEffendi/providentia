I'm not sure it's traditional, but the food was delectable.   At the request of my bf, we ordered the polenta appetizer. Not being a polenta fan, I agreed to be a good sport and tried it. O.M.G. It was luscious. It appeared to be a potato soup, but was actually chunks of polenta sitting in a tantalizing cream with tons of mushrooms providing texture. Unless you're strictly dieting, this is a must-order. (yes, dear, you were right). I had a homemade pasta dish (papardelle with tomatoes, mozzarella and basil), which was also wonderful. The paperdelle was a bit toothsome and had a perfect hold on the sauce, which actually turned out to also be cream-based.  I'll enjoy it for lunch a couple times this week too since I have so much leftover! The bf had a veal lasagna, which he also enjoyed although he mentioned that it didn't have the amount of veal he had expected. Our chocolate volcano dessert was pretty good, but didn't really stand up to the rest of the meal. There was a really strange musical note on the dinner plate that was made in BBQ-like sauce (I think) that was a mistake... I would have been really disappointed if that had wound up in the dish itself by accident, tainting the food. I almost forgot the breadsticks!  They were odd but in a wonderful way, and were accompanied by a terrific herbed olive oil. Service was really nice and attentive, without crowding us, although at times it felt a bit uncomfortable even though I couldn't quite put my finger on why. The bill for the 2 of us was around $55 - not bad!!!  The restaurant and restroom facilities were clean and simple. Parking on the street was easy, but there's also a lot in the back. Why not 5 stars? I just can't get there for some reason. Don't get me wrong, it was great Italian food in a nice setting... I think I was missing the "wow" factor or something. I'll be back to reassess!  Absolutely check this place out if you're in the area.
