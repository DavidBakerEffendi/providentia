I've eaten here many times now.   1. They've got the best burger in NYC.  Trust me -- I've tried everything else. 2. Their wine list is great and affordable (their mark-up is minimal). 3. Things are always impeccably cooked to order.  You want it medium-rare?  It comes the best medium-rare you've seen. 4. Service has always been excellent. I'm not always crazy about the atmosphere -- Tribeca 'cool' for the IBanker set -- but I've never felt too bad in my Adidas and t-shirt.
