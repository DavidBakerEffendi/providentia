Small and friendly restaurant. I have been coming here for a few months now and the food never disappoints. The hummus platter is great and I always get the combo platter. The service is great for both dine in and take out. The bread is amazing. They always bring out fresh from the oven. This restaurant has been my go-to place every time I'm in the area.
