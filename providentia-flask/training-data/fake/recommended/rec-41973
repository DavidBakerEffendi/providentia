Am sitting at Santucci's right now....and everything we've ordered is so delicious, I couldn't wait to post a review and share it with everyone.... Santucci's opened less than a week ago but don't be confused by the name....this place is much more than just a pizzeria....real, authentic Italian foods...great, fresh salads, amazing flatbreads, unique sandwiches, a handful of delicious pastas, AND the best pizza I've had in a long time.....top it off with a few adorable, friendly knowledgable waitresses...and it's just a matter of days before you won't be able to get a table here....luckily they deliver to all of south Philly and center city.....
