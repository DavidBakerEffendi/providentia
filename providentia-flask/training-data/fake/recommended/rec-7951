It was a little overwhelming when we walked into Mood Cafe and saw 60 lassi options and about as many options for chaats (which we'd never tried before), but Hassan was quick to alleviate our obvious first-timer concerns. He asks you what you've had before, what flavors of fruit/spices/etc. you like, and offers up suggestions based on his most popular lassis. And best of all, assures you not to worry because if you don't like it, he'll make you a different one at no extra charge. We were given the same guarantee for chaats, which rather than ordering off of the board, he simply made to our preferences with respect to heat level, etc. As promised, the chaats were a strange but perfectly orchestrated blend of flavors and textures: spicy, sweet, crunchy, creamy, salty... an unexpected symphony of deliciousness and variety. It's clear that Hassan is a businessman who justs GETS IT. He even says that the reason he'll replace anything you don't like is because he wants you to enjoy your food/drink so that you come back, which is the type of common sense/logic that many restaurants somehow fail to use. Not only will we be going back, but we'll tell all of our friends and family how great the food and service was. Hassan's style is simple, smart, and much appreciated by the consumer. Will undoubtedly be regular spot for my girlfriend and I, seeing as we're now hooked on chaats and only have 983987 more menu options to try.
