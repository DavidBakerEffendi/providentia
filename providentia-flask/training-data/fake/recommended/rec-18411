Went for dinner- great food, plates are good for sharing too. The babaganoush was the best I've had in the city. Mushroom ravioli was delicious as well: the sauce was perfect, although the dish was really heavy. The portions aren't huge, but still very filling. The food took a while to arrive, but the waiter was extremely pleasant. A bit on the pricier side, but the ambience was worth it. Crowd consisted mostly of 20-something's that you'd expect to find in East Village - cute, intimate little place compared to a lot of the neighboring restaurants.
