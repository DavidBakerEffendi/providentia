One word... Sangria! Do not pass up on Yuca Bars red sangria. A pitcher is a must for any group dining here. It will have you giggling after just one glass. The ambiance here is very laid back but loud. They have music blasting all the time and the bar tends to fill up quick. They don't do reservations on Tuesdays, Fridays or Saturdays so make sure to arrive early. It's worth it. The food is delicious! Loved the croquettes and the espresso ribs. The menu has signature items of many places in Latin America which I loved! Definitely will return for tapas tuesday when appetizers are half off.
