I had a simple Salmon Roll. Rice, seaweed, salmon. Easy, right? Not so fast. The salmon was not a fresh cut of salmon, it was more of a ground mush of fishy flesh. I'm always skeptical of sushi places that don't offer up whole cuts. Who's to say that they aren;t cutting their salmon with a cheaper fish? A MYSTERY fish! The flavor of the salmon was not quite right and I left feeling nauseous and disappointed with the affordable but slightly 'off' sushi. Will not go back. File under: MEH.
