I stopped in here with 3 friends on a busy Friday night. There was a wait to get seated and a significant wait for our entrees, but it seemed reasonable given how busy they were. Our server was polite and attentive and the general atmosphere was nice. As a vegan, I was pleased to see that they had several vegetarian and vegan offerings on the menu. I ordered the tofu scramble, which was generously portioned and very good. The prices were also very reasonable. All in all, I enjoyed my dinner tremendously, and plan on going back!
