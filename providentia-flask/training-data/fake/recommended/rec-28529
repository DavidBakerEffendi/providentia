Tres hurras por Tres Carnes!!! I like this place so much that I've paused my chowdown to write this review. I've wanted to try it for the past month, but I'm not in that area much. Between Tres Carnes and Rickshaw Dumplings, I'll have to think of more excuses to go to Chelsea. Their sign and atmosphere drew me in, even though you'll probably grab-n-go most of the time. I was greeted as soon as I entered, and all 3 people I dealt with we're really friendly. I have to disagree worth the folks who compare it to Chipotle. The main similarity is the set up (go down the line and pick your goodies). I love Chipotes, but these folks really are doing something original with their food and design here. The cuisine is totally DIFFERENT! Tex-Mex is its own thing, loves. They aren't trying to copy Chipotes, and I'm so glad for it. Plus, I must deliver the news to all you 20-something's: Chipotle did not invent the cafeteria line. It's been around since before I was a wee one. Tres Carnes is set apart by its: Delicious Smoked Meats (brisket, adobo chicken, and barbecue pork shoulder) Weekly Smoke (each week, they feature a new smoked meat. This week, it's bone-in lamb) Array of fun adult beverages Double Smoked Churro Doughnut (YES!) Brisket Burnt Ends Chili Cotija Cheese Smoky Guacamole Roasted Chipotle Squash Welcome to New York, Tres Carnes! I hope you make it here!
