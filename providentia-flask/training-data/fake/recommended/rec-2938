Ekta is my go-to Indian joint. It's in the neighborhood, BYOB, and typically easy to snag a seat (or just grab some take-out). I generally opt for the vegetable samosas, garlic naan, and chicken tikka masala... All of which are awesome. Only taking a star off because the dining area leaves much to be desired. It's a bit grungy, but they did just paint it the last time I was in. Sometimes, it also has a bit of a musty smell which is odd. Regardless, I will be going back for sure. The food is consistently good.
