If bacon is your thing, this place has AMAZING bacon! Personal favorite is the lamb bacon, but the jowl bacon is a close second. However it is not so good after that. The service is really slow (over an hour wait for food after it was ordered), they ran out of over 1/2 the items we ordered and didn't bother to tell us about it till afterwards, and the waitress didn't seem to care. Not too excited to come back.
