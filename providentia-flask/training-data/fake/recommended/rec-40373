Excellent.  Had the pumpkin and sage ravioli off the specials.  It was great.  Service was warm and friendly.  Atmosphere very smart casual.  The best part... BYOB!  They definitely run things well there and the dessert was also yummy.  Can't wait to go back.  TIP:  Look for parking across the street near the church.  It's tough to get a spot out front.
