Got here at 10:55 on a Friday morning. We were seated at a little after 12:10. Do not underestimate the wait. But don't underestimate the deliciousness of the blueberry pancakes either!!! They are the best I've ever had. Also shared the southern breakfast. The bacon was delicious but the rest wasn't anything TOO special. A good, large side of hash browns rounded out the meal. I will definitely come here again next time I'm in the area...but I'll be sure to wake up bright and early. And maybe come on a tuesday.
