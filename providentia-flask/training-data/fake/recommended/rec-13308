this burger lived up to its hype. i wish NY was quicker on food than cali, but at least we got it. i got the truffle speciale and it was delicious. it was messy to eat because the yolk exploded and started dropping down my wrists and arms but it didn't stop me from inhaling it. the biffle ordered the truffle shiitake royale and the sauce on that is delicious as well. the truffle fries were good but ours had little cheese on it. i guess this depends on who's eating it; biffle thought it needed more cheese and i thought it was too salty and avoided the cheese. service was whatevers (there were LOTS OF SEATS open but we had to wait for "the servers to catch up") but the burger is so good, i'm willing to overlook those minor flaws.
