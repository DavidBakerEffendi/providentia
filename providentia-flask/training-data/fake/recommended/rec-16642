Was looking forward to trying Meme for an early dinner and earlier reviews were encouraging. Tastiness ended with the olives. Tried the chicken tagine which came out rather fast for tagine---was cooked well but the taste was average and it was undersalted. My husband's couscous was a disappointment--lacked flavor and more stewy than is typical for a Moroccan dish. Actually, my tagine had more couscous than his entree. We went early and sat in a corner booth seat since we were with a toddler who was pretty well behaved during the meal. Our waitress was nice and friendly with our son. But we felt the manager wasn't happy to have us there from the start--shooting us looks (even though inside seating was more than half empty) and not responding to my "thank you" on my way out the door. That's just rude. I expect a more welcoming attitude if you open a sidewalk cafe-style resto in the west village across from Bleecker Street playground...it could pay to be a little more child-friendly...especially during quiet hours. It's cute but there's better food in the area. I doubt I'll be back.
