This place was really fantastic. The minute you sit down, you get a bunch of regular bread, homemade garlic bread and a huge salad (if there are lots of you, you get two salads!!). Then you get the menu! My husband and I had the seafood paella, which was a HUGE portion. They also bring you homemade potato chips with it. It was pretty good. We also had the red Sangria, which was pretty good. The reason why I am not giving it the full 5 stars is because the dessert was not great. We ordered the crepes. They came with a flaming bowl (alcohol) and doused the crepes with alcohol, which was a bad idea. Also, when the bill came, we realized that they charged us $10 for sharing the meal. It would have been fine if they said it right off the bat, but when they sneak it up on you, it makes you feel like they were hiding something. You do get a very big bang for the buck, so the extra $10 is not really the issue.
