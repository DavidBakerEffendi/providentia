Great place for tea and sweets. Located on the second floor, seats are limited here. List of teas is extensive; teas aren't only Japanese. Dessert menu was just as big. I had the black sesame seed mochi, which was one of the specials of the day. There are also macarons, which are different flavored based on the day of the week. Will be back !
