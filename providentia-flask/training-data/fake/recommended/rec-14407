Came here and got the breakroom burger an order of 3 tacos (two fish and one steak).  Everything was excellent! The burger was sloppy and falvorfull as it reads on the menu. My only critism was that the bun was a bit boring.  Call me snoody but I enjoy a toasted bun with a bit of a crunch. The tacos were even better than the burger i thought.  The fish was cooked perfectly (and by cooked, I mean fried) and the condiments that accompanied the taco were spot on.  The steak was a nice medium rare and not well done or so scraps from other dishes like over steak tacos you might get. This is a great place to checkout before or after the oh so fun Whiskey Tavern
