I was hesitant to even try this place because there were so many mixed reviews.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  The service was great and the food was good.  We started with the mussels in white sauce which were ok, next time I would try them in the spicy sauce.  We also have the tomato & mozzarella antipasta which was tasty.  For my main course I had the sausage and peppers....it was absolutely delicious!  I will definitely return to this place to try the pizza!
