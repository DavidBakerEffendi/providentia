I am a big critic when it comes to bagels, but holy cow this is one of the best bagels I have ever had (and believe me, I've had A LOT).  The bagel was huge, soft and had amazing flavor. You could tell it was hand rolled. The great part is that it's right up the street from me.  I will be definitely visiting this bagel place going forward.
