Nothing new in this review other than what everyone else has been saying. This place is never a hit or miss. It's always a hit! The line could get pretty long (especially on a weekend late night) but its definitely worth the wait! If you don't want to wait in line (Especially now with the cold winter coming in), you could visit the location early (7PM)! You could mix the meat from Chicken and Lamb over rice to just Chicken or just Lamb etc. What a combination! Chicken+Lamb+Salad+Pita with some white/red sauce combo. Just makes my mouth water just thinking about it. I've heard that the cart across the street (East Side) is owned by the same owner. I'm not sure how true this is but I've seen them transfer supplies from one cart to another, use the same bags, and the lines are way shorter (if there is one). I went to both and they seem very similar. If you do not want to wait in the line, you could get the same deal right across the street!
