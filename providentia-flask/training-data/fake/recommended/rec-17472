We went here for dinner on a Saturday evening.  Wasn't overly crowded so got seated pretty quickly.  Our waiter was not very attentive to us/our needs at all. Had to call him over several times for just about everything.  I ordered a t-bone steak and my partner got the filet mignon that you cook on the stone.  Our salad arrived by a guy that literally dropped it on the table and said "salad.. enjoy" in the dullest monotone you could imagine.  The salad was not good at all.. way too oily.  One of the other waiters (not ours) came by and asked if everything was okay.. I'm guessing he saw us picking around the salad.  We told him the issue, he apologized and said he would bring a new one.  Great, right?  Well, we never saw him again or a new salad.  When dinner arrived we were very anxious.  My t-bone was terrible.  It wasn't seasoned at all, was under cooked for medium and was extremely tough.  I took a few bites and gave up on it, as it wasn't going to get any better.  The filet was actually very good.  Was very good cut of meat that cooked up well; the garlic butter was a particularly nice touch when cooking.  During the course of our meal our waiter, consistent to his earlier behavior, never came over to check on us.   Summary- they seem to do one thing well and that's the filet you cook yourself.  Other than that, really was a big disappointment.  Oh, the sangria is pretty good there.
