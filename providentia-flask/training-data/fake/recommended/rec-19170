This place was pretty cool. I went here with a friend for breakfast one day and it was packed. We had to wait 10-15 minutes. But there's a "bar" area where you can just seat yourself so we just sat there. I don't know if it's because we ordered typical breakfast food (challah french toast and omelettes) but there wasn't anything special about it. I could make this at home if I really wanted to. The food was good though.
