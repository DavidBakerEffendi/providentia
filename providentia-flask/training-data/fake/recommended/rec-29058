Once again, "why don't we have this in DC?" Ok.  Admittedly, I'm on a pre-Thanksgiving binge thanks to Thrillist.  But who would have ever thought of a Turducken Sammie?!  It's brilliant.  If you thought that Thanksgiving Balls (see Blind Pig) were the end of all Thanksgiving Comfort Food then you have a strong contender in the Turducken Sandwich.  Because let's face it, the only thing better than turkey is turkey+duck+chicken.  Throw in cranberry spread with apple sausage stuffing and you got the basic foundation.  The creme-a-la-creme, however, is the fried hash browns to add a crispy texture and warm childlike feeling. Why are these chimera creations so brilliant?  Because that's who you'll end up eating a Thanksgiving Feast anyway.  Nobody just eats the turkey by itself and then the mash potatoes separately.  You mix it all together and stuff it in your mouth.  It's just that Jake's Sandwich Board and Blind Pig figured out a more efficient delivery mechanism.  It all ends up the same anyway. Brilliant.  Just brilliant. Overall, skip Thanksgiving dinner.  You've got everything you need with the Turducken Sammie. [Original Visit: November 2014]
