okok, so im writing from the vegan's perspective. I have heard lots of great things from people about their meat and other nonvegan food but I am vegan, so: I get very excited when places are vegan friendly and even will pay the extra money in order to enjoy a vegan coffee milkshake, because how often does that happen? not often at all. I loved sketch, and never stopped recommending it to people. BUT I have finally had it. Too many times I have gone into this vegan friendly joint to be served something that i thought was vegan with non vegan items on it. For example, I order a vegan burger, its served on a nonvegan bun, or they change their sauces from mostly all vegan to only two that are and not mention it. So I find out when im re-reading the menu while i wait for my boyfriend to finish. I am no longer going to spend 22 bucks on a grain based burger (THAT TASTES DIFFERENTLY EVERYTIME) french fries, and a milkshake. I was a sucker a few times, but no longer.
