Read the reviews, and since I'm around the corner, I decided to try takeout. Walk in and people were standing at the door waiting, Very small place, so I slipped over to the bar were someone looking like the cook greeted me and said someone will be here. Ordered the jumbo fried shrimp and the crispy grits. While I was waiting, the barkeep gave me this homemade lemonade that was amazing. When I get home I notice the food isn't hot. It isn't cold, but a little less than warm, which tells me my food was dying in the window ( I'm one block away). The shrimp were cook perfectly, but they weren't hot. The crispy grits were just weird. Â I grew up on grits, and that was just weird. Maybe they would have been better if they were hot. The cornbread tasted more like cake and was delish. The slice of bread was kinda hard on top, like it's been sitting out. And the sweet pickles made the end of dinner almost alright. Ill go back, but dining in. And going to try the chicken.
