Rancho Grande used to be my family's favorite Mexican restaurant in the area.  But we went this evening, and things have gone downhill unfortunately.  Our favorite server, who was always so kind, attentive and friendly, has left; when I asked why, I was told it was over "differences."  The difference is that the food and service are substandard.  The frozen margaritas were watered down and flavorless.  There was a lack of air conditioning.  When I voiced my concerns, the server politely apologized but didn't seemed concerned in the least.  We'll be looking for a new favorite Mexican restaurant.
