I look forward to the daily soup specials to enjoy with the soup-sandwich combo every time I visit. The corn chowder and spicy sausage is a personal favorite. The turkey club and Cuban sandwiches are remarkable. Very lively atmosphere. A great place to sit and enjoy a meal and coffee. Expect crowds around noon on nice days. During wet weather, choose your table to tuck into and surround yourself with books and local art. Atticus achieves the perfect model of a small city cafe surviving in a transforming city moving towards high end fast food chains.
