This place at lunch is usually busy inside and outside (during warmer days) but it's just average. Been there so many times, have tried salads, tacos, burritos, there is just no flavors that pop. They give you chips and salsa when you dine in, which is nice and the food is prepared pretty quickly. The chicken burrito is probably my favorite, I really like how they flavor the chicken and the size of the chunks. What amazes me is how similar the burritos taste, like I said the food doesn't pop. The serve the burritos with a fresh side of greens, and some dressing (I do like that). The chicken and beef tacos are terrible, just don't taste right to me after trying then twice. The fresh quac has never been that great, if rather make it at home, there's is so bland, would definitely say to pass. They offer various jarritos and soft drinks, the staff is very friendly, the decor and music work well. I do like sitting in to eat there but honestly the good is not all that special, I would definitely check out other places around the area.
