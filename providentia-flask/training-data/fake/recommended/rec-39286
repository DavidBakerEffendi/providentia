Went here for lunch because I had a JumpOnIt and wanted to check it out. The lunch menu is ridiculously overpriced - my salad was $11 and wasn't even a meal-sized portion. My wife got the lobster risotto, which was about the only reasonably priced thing on the menu. Even the beers were Boston prices ($5 for a Switchback). The waitress was spacey and not all that attentive. I didn't really mind, but if you're trying to go for the expensive bistro atmosphere you damn well better have good service. The food was good, but I can't say I'll be back - there are better restaurants for a lot less money in Burlington. And if I am looking for a nice meal, there are far better restaurants for that (The Whip in Stowe & Windjammer come to mind). I really don't see this lasting for all that much longer in the competitive Burlington market with so many other options.
