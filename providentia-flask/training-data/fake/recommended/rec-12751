Yup, it's bomb. They give you so much moist chicken and perfectly cooked rice for $6. And we haven't even mentioned the sauce yet, even though I think I could eat just the perfectly prepped chicken and rice. The white sauce and spicy sauce are to die for and surprisingly didn't cause stomachache (I have a sensitive stomach when it comes to fast food). The white sauce is not too creamy or heavy (may be a yogurt base?) and the spicy sauce has quite the kick. So glad I made it to the cart. The 20-person line was only a 10 minute wait by the way!
