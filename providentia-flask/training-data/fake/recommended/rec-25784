Brought my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner. The restaurant was kind of empty when we came at 7PM on a Tuesday night. But I did run into a friend here. Anyhow, the waiter and manager were very polite. We ordered the seafood tower, which at $180 is pretty pricy for two people, but the bf loves seafood so who am I to deny it to him? The food was delicious. I love the sweet ceviche because usually the ones I have are more tangy. The oysters tasted fresh and the king crab legs were, unsurprisingly, huge. Love the oyster shooters, too - very spicy. Supposedly we ordered the last available seafood tower of the day. We found out later that if you make a reservation through Groupon you can get 20% off your check. That would've helped significantly, but we reserved through OpenTable. Spoke to the manager about this and he said they had to pay Groupon to promote the deal so they need to show Groupon proof of receipt. I don't get it...if we're doing it through OpenTable and they don't have to pay Groupon or OpenTable, then what was the big deal? Nonetheless, they gave us a complimentary flan even though we said we were too full for dessert... I really like the food here, but it is a little too pricy if I'm not coming here for a special occasion.
