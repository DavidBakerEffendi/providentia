Staying in NY for the summer and go to this place almost daily with my roommates. Staff there is great and meat portions are huge. Healthy and good price. Thought I lost my sunglasses a couple of days ago and went back to ask if they found them. Steve(Owner) and my man Nick took 20 min out of their day to go through tapes to find out what exactly happened. Nick even followed up later to see if I found them (I left them in a different place). Bottom line: Awesome food, great staff, Nick is awesome and says hi to us every time. Definitely come check it out. Hope it'll be huge and expand to California so I can get it when I'm back at home.
