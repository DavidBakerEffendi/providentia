Best pizza, awesome fries and surprisingly good salads. If you feel like eating delicious food and not spending too much money and you don't mind waiting in line for a seat (Grab a beer while you wait!) or eating on paper plates, definitely head over to Star Tavern. This is also our favorite place to go when we're hungover: We're confident the staff couldn't care less about how terrible you look and you'll have limited communication with your server- you probably won't even feel obligated to make eye contact them. However, if you're trying to have a drink to cure your hangover, make sure you're of age & have your ID because they will ask you for it and they will most likely quiz you on what your astrological sign is just to make sure it's really you. Â The dim lighting and lack of any sunlight will be good to your eyes and won't worsen your headache; the booths with very high backs will make you feel like no one can see you and there's a slim chance anyone cares what you look like; the food is awesome, fast and cheap and is ideal for a rough morning/afternoon. Try ordering Amstels or Red Stripes or a fountain soda, a big glass of water, a pie and fries.
