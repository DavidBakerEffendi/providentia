consistently good. eaten here a lot. its the kind of place that i can take my very picky parents. i do have to say the service can be borderline horrible. one thing my european parents dislike is being rushed and we had a party of 8 for a big event and a very big dinner. the server, a tall guy with a black beard was really unfriendly, he rushed us through our dinner and at the very end, after already processing the cards for a pretty high check above $700 he realized that he had forgotten to add a salad - HIS FAULT - so he made us pay a second check for like $15 - not coming back - this kind of service is just ridiculous and incredibly rude!
