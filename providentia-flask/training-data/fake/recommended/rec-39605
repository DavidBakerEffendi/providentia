Yum! there food is delicious i am looking forward to going back soon everything was fine.. the food, the service, the atmosphere i had a grate experience here and will definitely be returning.i came with a few friends so we has the small shared plates which were all good and an entree which was very filling. i always look forward to dessert but some how never get to it, they did have some stuff on the dessert menu which seemed appetizing, i will make room next time i go for one
