2 stars one for decent portion and price 11.99 spag/3 mbs. They lose stars due to a 3.50$ delivery charge? And then I have to add a tip now I'm paying 18-20$ for a tin on spaghetti which mind you had a horrible raw onion taste, probably due to the huge onions throughout like nothing I have ever seen or tasted. Had to drown it in parm cheese salt and pepper
