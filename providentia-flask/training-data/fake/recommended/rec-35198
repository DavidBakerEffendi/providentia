Really good food. You will not have anything left on your plate. I kept asking for more bread to dip into the sauce. So good. People seem to be complaining about the owner who is rude. I found him to be fine. There was definitely some banter but being english I like banter. On my third visit the food was as amazing. I assume they freeze everything and warm it before hand. This time I could taste that "freezer taste" in my food but it was s tilll good. The dish was just warm not hot like the other times.
