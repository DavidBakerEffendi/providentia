The Ear Inn is a great place for an informal meal and a drink, kind of a neighborhood bar & grill.  Food is very good, and prices are quite reasonable for NYC.  The place is small and crowded, but in a friendly way (i.e. you don't feel squashed).  I've only been here twice, but both times the food and service were quite good.  Note that the dinner menu and specials is not available until 6pm, prior to that you can order from the lunch menu (burgers, appetizers, etc).
