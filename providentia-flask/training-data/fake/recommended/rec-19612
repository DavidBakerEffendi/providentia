I tried Joy Wok for the first time a couple of nights ago. I have to say that whenever I try a new Chinese take out place for the first time, I always do it with my fingers crossed - hoping and praying that my decision was a good one. Thankfully this time it was! The first thing I like about Joy Wok is that you can order online. The menu is standard for a Chinese place but note that they also have some Thai dishes available if you're looking to change things up a bit. We got Chicken with String Beans, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Vegetable Fried Rice and Â Masaman Curry with Chicken (Thai). The food was very fresh tasting and well prepared (no excessive oil or sauce -- it tasted great but also felt healthy at the same time!). The meal was reasonably priced and the portions were very large compared to the 'norm' for take out. Very happy with Joy Wok and it will be my staple for Chinese Takeout from now on
