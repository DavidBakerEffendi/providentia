Great salmon feast.  Nice atmosphere.  I was really full after the 9-course meal.  The starters were smaller and came out very quickly.  Then as I was starting to get full, the main dishes came out and were larger.  My favorite were the wild king salmon en papillote (comes wrapped in clear plastic and they cut it in front of you) and the sockeye taco (salmon skin taco shell with guacamole on the bottom).  The goat cheese mousse was good also.  It is a bit pricey, but considering it is a 9-course meal,  price is reasonable.  Would go back for a birthday celebration.
