So I was really excited to try out this place after reading great reviews. I got the arepa with pernil (roast pork) and the tres leche cake. The sandwhich was good but not worth 9 bucks! The cake wasn't very good and tasted old like it had been refrigerated for days. I was also surprised that when I asked for hotsauce they charged me 2 bucks for a small spoonful of their fresh hotsauce. Any other place would not have charged for this. This place is a rip off and caters to people with a bigger budget. arepas and empanadas should not be this expensive. so if you're looking for cheap good eats -dont go here.
