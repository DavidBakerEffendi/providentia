Well this was my first time here after I've been hearing about this place over several months. Upon entry the staff I very warm & greeting. The ambiance is fantastic. My waitress was very delightful & informative when it came to ordering a cocktail. The California shrimp rolls are to die for & the chicken red velvet waffle just melts in your mouth. I certainly will revisit & I recommend everyone to visit.
