I'm still daydreaming about the pancakes, three days later! They put the "topping" right in the batter, so it's more like (topping... like banana) pancakes, instead of it just being some pancakes with whatever on top. The portions were awesome, I couldn't eat all of mine, and took it home. My friend ordered an omelette, and it really looked like they used twelve eggs. The service was really great. Very friendly. OH, and they serve RC cola, which is SO HARD to find, and brought back memories of my childhood. This place is so. worth. every. penny. I cannot stress it enough.
