This place is such a gem. I knew nothing about it before I went there for Sunday brunch, and was totally won over. The decor is amazing and warm. The food is crazy good and the service was spectacular. We had a server named Annie and she was tremendous. Everyone is extremely attentive and my coffee cup never went low, let alone empty. Didn't have to wait for a table. Extremely calm setting. Alice's arbor is the real deal.
