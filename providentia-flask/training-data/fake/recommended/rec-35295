We decided to go here because someone said it was better than Din Tai Fung. TOTALLY NOT TRUE. The waitress was very rude. We came in and asked how long the wait was and the waitress said it would be able 5 min. While we were waiting, we overheard her complaining (in Chinese) that a customer was staying too long and that they should hurry up and leave. When my mom asked 5 min later if we could get a seat (since there were some empty ones), she rudely replied, "I told you to wait 5 min. Please be patient." Normally, I would've already left at this point, but we stayed for the food. Finally seated (we were grouped with random people at a table), we ordered the xiao long bao and a few other dishes. It was definitely very mediocre food. Maybe New York don't have authentic good Chinese food or something, but I have no idea why this place is rated so high. Our group of 4 people were all from the SF Bay Area in CA and agreed that we would never come here again. Also, this place was not very clean. Our plates had dried food crusted on.
