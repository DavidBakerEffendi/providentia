Two things my son loves: pizza and Man v Food. After seeing L&B on Man v Food, he and a friend ventured out to Bensonhurst to try the pizza. My son has has pizza all over the world but said this was the best, by far. We live on the same block as House of Pizza & Calzone, which also makes the squares, so for him to say this really meant something. Because of his rave review, I decided to venture out there with him to see what all the hype was about. It's not hype! This is definitely one of the best pizzas I have ever had. It was tasty, moist on the inside yet crunchy on the bottom. In other words, prefect! While my son ate a couple slices of our half sheet that we were taking home for dinner, I got a Vanilla/Chocolate/Pistachio Spumoni. Holy crap that was delicious!!! So creamy and flavorful. All in all it was a great experience and we can't wait to go back.
