I would say, just like Sushi Yasuda, Ippudo's is worth the wait.  It's not as ridiculously expensive, but an appetizer, standard ramen, and dessert as well as drinks (tea) ran up to about $50.  Still, it's pretty standard for NYC.  If you come to NYC, be ready to throw down.  Photos here: rammiegirl.wordpress.com .  I can actually do a pros-cons list for this because there were only 3 things that I ordered: 1.  Ebi-Kani (crab-shrimp) croquettes 2.  Hakata Classic ramen, plus one egg (not recommended but my personal staple for ramen) 3.  Hirata Milk dessert Ebi-Kani Croquettes PROS good to split for 2 (4 pieces each) goes great with the grape tomatoes awesome texture: crispy on the outside, not burnt and then soft and creamy on the inside great ratio of crab and shrimp (kani & ebi, respectively) CONS: not much, maybe price for some people but it is snow crab and it is NYC. Hakata Classic Ramen, plus egg PROS -amazing broth, very flavorful and super savory, pork based -good quantity: I'm a pretty light eater though so don't quote me on this. -request for extra ramen noodles applicable: for those of you who want extra carbs to go with that awesome soup. -egg was perfect. perfect.  Not too salty either. CONS Personally, I'd like more pickled ginger and menma, but that's just my own preference.  Not a carb-heavy girl here. Hirata Milk Dessert: First a brief description literally word for word: "green tea ice cream parfait with red bean, shiratama mochi, matcha (green tea) jelly, and almond-coconut milk". I think I just died retyping out that description. PROS -perfect combination of flavors and textures. -you're supposed to dump the milk into the parfait: Admittedly, I was the dumb noob who was sipping it out of the shot glass. Still tasted good though! CONS - Again, my own personal preference, but it needs more matcha jelly haha. AMAZING.  So amazing that some of my ladies at Hopkins and I booked a trip in Jan for Ippudo's again.  :) Cant' wait for round 2!
