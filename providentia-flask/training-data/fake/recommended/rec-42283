Very good place to go if you want to get decent Thai food fast.  It is dirt cheap given the food but I think they make their money on their drinks and on table turnover.  Good pours on the booze and average cost for drinks.  Don't be surprised if your food comes out in less than 5 minutes.  Overall stick with the main menu.  The Specials (especially the fish) seem to be pre-cooked or are made super fast.  Outdoor space is particularly nice.
