As an option for eat out night while on vacation, this was a pleasant surprise. The pizza was really good. Nicely sauced and cooked well enough so the veggies on the onion, pepper and mushroom pizza did not make it soggy. The vegetables were nice and fresh. My daughter enjoyed the cheese ravioli and the garlic bread was nicely seasoned and not overwhelmed with cheese.
