An amazing dining experience. The wait staff was attentive and helpful. Their cocktails were outstanding and I highly recommend their signature martini. The Foie Gras mousse and kimchi were out of this world! The Five Senses Pork was quite possibly the best bossam variation I'd ever had. A friend of mine asked me if I'd ever take my parents (who are also Korean) to this place...my answer is yes. And they would love it.
