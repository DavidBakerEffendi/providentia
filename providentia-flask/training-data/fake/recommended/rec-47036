If you are craving the best fried chicken ever, this is the place for you. The unlimited popcorn you get is also delicious. Their menu is unique and makes for a wonderful night to explore exotic food. Their deserts were different but nothing I would die to try again. The atmosphere and neighborhood were nice as well.
