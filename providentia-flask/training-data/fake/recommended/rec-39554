Pretty decent I must say. I went after reading all the reviews. Wasnt sure how it will turn out as I approached the neighbourhood...but the place was buzzing at 4:30 pm! (Always a good sign). The food was good, the price reasonable and service alright. And oh even medium hot...was super hot...and we pride in eating spicy! :) so go easy on spice levels.
