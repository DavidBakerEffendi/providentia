I love the concept of this place. It has a great atmosphere and crowd. It's communal to the extent that the seating is shared and you just might strike up conversation with the party next to you. The food was good and so were the frozen margaritas. The pricing was very reasonable and the staff was pleasant. Only four stars because of how difficult it was to find seating and that you're basically on your own to make things happen.
