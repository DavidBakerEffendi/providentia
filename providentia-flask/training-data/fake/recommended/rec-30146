Wonderful quaint little place that oozes tons of French charm- hadn't been to Buvette in a long time and it was nice to see that it hasn't changed and still has the same cozy ambiance. We were lucky to snag the last two seats at the bar and that was actually perfect as we could see all the different dishes that were coming through. We decided on the Pesto Di Noci, Grandade Du Morue (cod) and one of their specials. All dishes were excellent but the cod was outstanding, it came pureed/mashed in a small jar with pieces of bread and was more of a spread. Really unique and delicious! Don't know why it took me so long to go back to Buvette again, looking forward to the next visit.
