Woorijip has good selection of Korean food. It really reminds me of local restaurants back in Korea. You get those street foods that I used to love. I like their Korean rolls. There are so many flavors and choices from vegetarian to brown rice. I like how you can just pick the food-purchase-eat. Sometimes you are so hungry you just wanna EAT! I think the food here is better than some of the restaurants in K-town, seirously!
