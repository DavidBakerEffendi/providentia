Not what you're thinking when it comes to BBQ. Nothing is drowning in sauce, and you can ask for the meat "naked" (without bread) and without BBQ sauce, if that's your thing. I love the smoked sausages, veggies, pulled pork and brisket. Oh let's face it, I just love meat. Don't forget the pickled veggies. The homemade iced tea is also excellent. Grab your meat (which is sliced fresh for you at the counter), grab a seat and chow down. Why four stars? I've had inconsistent cuts of meats, specifically brisket (sometimes it's simply way too fatty for my taste).
