saturday brunch, 11:00 am, twosome I went back to market table for brunch within a month from my last visit, I was that anxious to try their brunch menu.  Glad I did because market table now ranks at one of our favorite brunch spots in the city buttermilk pancakes - as soon as you set foot through the door, you smell the butter; instantly makes you crave pancakes.  It's everything you can ask for in pancakes, they were aH-mazing.  The fresh toppings for the day were shaved almonds that were honey-candied (I think), strawberries and blueberries.  For sweet, go with the pancakes poached eggs - the eggs were cooked perfectly.  The bite of the ham, eggs, and yolk soaked biscuit made it one of the best eggs benedict I have ever tasted.   sides: asparagus home fries - nice touch to our meal staff was once again fantastic; laid back and kept the coffee flowing. would i go back - yes, I really loved market table
