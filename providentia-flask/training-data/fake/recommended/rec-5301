Perfect meal for a wintry day! The beef brisket hand drawn noodles were savory and delicious. The meat was tender and the soup was flavorful. Nonetheless, the noodles had a more elastic texture because it was hand drawn. My boyfriend and I also ordered pig ears! Sure it might sound gross at first, but it goes really well with rice!
