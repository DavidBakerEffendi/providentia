Celebrated my husband's birthday here last night with my parents. Our antipasto sampler was just delicious. Our entrees of lobster ravioli, veal and seafood were all excellent as well.  We never felt rushed and our server was very attentive and altered our entrees to specific likes or dislikes.  Busy and lively atmosphere.
