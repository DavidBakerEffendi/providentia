Oh where do I begin with Alta?  Love the food, sangria and atmosphere!  It is a great place to cozy up next to your date or to gossip away with your girlfriends.   You may ask why the 4 star instead of 5?  Well, here is why...  I have been coming to Alta for years and not once was I disappointed until a month ago when I visited with the husband.  We made a reservation in the afternoon and when we arrived for dinner, we were told there was no such reservation under our name.  The hostess seemed slightly annoyed and questioned when we made the reservation, who we spoke to, etc. Message for the hostess if you experience a similar situation in the future: - Do not attack your customer with a string of questions because at that point, it should no longer matter when the call was made and how.  The "blame game" was not necessary and yes you did make us feel as if we were lying - Be nice and cordial.  Understood it gets busy on weekends but there is no need to get impatient - Tackle and solve the problem fast.  If you can fit us in, great!  If not, a simple no with a brief explanation would've been fine   Anyway, one negative experience will not alter my overall view on Alta.  The food, to be honest, is fantastic.  If you are visiting for the first time, I highly recommend the following: - Fried goat cheese with lavender infused honey.  The goat cheese is slightly fried into balls and served on a stick (think goat cheese skewer) - Crispy brussels sprouts - Squid ink paella (sorry Sacarrat - I do enjoy Alta's paella more) Looking forward to our next visit to Alta and you better get our reservation right this time :) !
