Food (5/5)   Decor (4/5)   Service (4/5)   Value (4/5) The crepes here are amazing.  I had the matcha stripe chocolate crepe and the strawberry plus chocolate chunks plus thin wrapper worked together harmoniously.  The wrapping of the crepe is also very innovative.  They fold it up into a cone shape and wrap paper around it so you can hold it and eat it like an ice cream cone almost.  The paper is perforated so that as you eat, you can keep peeling the paper away in a neat and orderly fashion.  The yuzu lemonade, which was being offered as a free promotion when I went, was also really tasty and reminded me of a normal lemonade with an extra citrus burst. The service here was only so so though.  The person taking our orders was a little brusque and rough around the edges.  Also, they were doing a buy one crepe get one yuzu lemonade free promotion, and when they forgot to give us our lemonades, I asked for mine only to be greeted with a look and tone of suspicion.  Thoroughly off putting.  Also, if you plan on coming with a group for brunch, you might have to take it to the park across the street to eat as the place does not have any place to sit. I would certainly come back to this place for the crepes as I feel the taste alone has merited that.  Just don't expect to stellar service. **UPDATED 8/18/2014** Since I last wrote my review, I found myself coming back to this place over and over again. Now that it has become my hands-down favorite creperie in NYC, I feel it's time to increase the rating to 5 stars. Service every time (other than the first time) has been just fine. I highly recommend the BLT crepe, though be prepared to wait about 5-10 minutes as I think they prepare the bacon fresh upon ordering.
