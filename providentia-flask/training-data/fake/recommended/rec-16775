Stopped in here while I was dress shopping in NJ, looking for Stein Mart.  Before getting to my original destination, I went here to eat lunch.  I ordered a chicken cheesesteak with american cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo.  I believe it was the smaller of the 2 sizes.  Tasted really good.  The bread was toasted just right and there was plenty of meat.  I enjoyed it and ordered one for my husband, for when he arrived from work.  He also liked it.   Price-wise, it was average.  I've been to other places that have charged me more for the same type of cheeseteak (what can I say?  I'm a creature of habit), and tasted bad. The place was nice and clean, and service was good.  No complaints.   Would definitely stop by, if I were anywhere in the area.
