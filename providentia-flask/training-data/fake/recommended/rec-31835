Average American food and a laid-back atmosphere, but it stays open quite late and often tolerates or even invites live music played by customers late at night, making it the favorite landing place after the local Wednesday night contra dances.  It has a friendly and lively atmosphere (but can be quite loud).  I like it anyway.
