I see many people have given A & B some shabby reviews so I'm here to say... it's actually rather good! I spent V-Day lunch here with my... significant other... and I'd most likely return. We chose to sit on the porch, which was warmed by a fantastic mock fireplace, and was sprinkled with cute attributes. To start things off we ordered a soup and salad, which came out quickly, no big surprise here considering the lack of expertise to produce such dishes. Fortunately though, the quick delivery was also teamed with tastiness! From there we ordered wraps that were reasonably priced and packed a wide spectrum of great flavors. They were served with homemade veggie chips that I still dream about to this day (big sweet potato fan!). So overall, my experience here was definitely a positive one. Oh and definitely order the hot apple cider if you find yourself here on a cold day! You won't regret it =)
