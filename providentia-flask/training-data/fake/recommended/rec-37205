Came in on a weeknight after picking up my car from a repair shop on a Tuesday night, wanting to let the rush hour traffic pass before heading home.  I really like this place a lot and the atmosphere is very authentic to its cultural roots.  I always enjoy the warm bread basket, served with a plate of olive oil.  Salt and Pepper on the side.  The Paella is usually excellent.  However, the pan that my wife and I shared this evening was just "OK".  The seasoning was non-existent...I remember it being much, much better.  I LOVE spicy food, but my wife does not at all, so she was okay with it, although even SHE said that it tasted a little bland this time.  I actually hesitated between choosing a rating of 3 or 4.  Would be a 5 if the Paella was what I remembered.  I would still highly recommend Costa, and hope that I can recover my experience on my next visit.  I like the recommendation made by Linda L. for the "Parrollada de Mariscos"...wish I had tried that instead!  They have a very cool bar area with limited seating.  The owners make it their passion to make rounds to the tables to inquire about their guests experiences.  A great place to check out.....
