Unfortunately while the food is okay and well-priced, they are TERRIBLE about communicating the actual time that food will be ready. We called on a Friday, gave our order, and were told 20 minutes. My husband showed up 20 minutes later, paid, then waited an additional half an hour for a burrito and bistek tacos. In addition, when he got home, he realized that they gave us SOMEONE ELSE's ORDER! Not worth the hassle.
