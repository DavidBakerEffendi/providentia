The kale salad, as others suggested, was excellent but the chicken was the highlight. My wife had the roast chicken and I had the chicken and egg sandwich, each of which was perfectly cooked -- crisp on the outside yet moist and tender. For dessert, the wafers that came with the cheese plate were exceptional. On the drink side, the wine selection was reasonable without being overwhelming and was complemented by a good cross-section of craft beer. Finally, we looked at the market on the way out - the pickles were tempting, but too heavy to cart around on a weekend night.
