In NYC there are pretty much restraunts on 9th ave! But I really liked review on yelp for this place! And it's true! We came here on saturday night it was pretty busy! I really liked decor, with mirrors all around which makes place visually big! Food was yummy! I started up with spring rolls which I liked alot! By main course I got Phad Thai Chicken which was a bit sweet! I didn't like that part! But it was eatable! My friend she got chicken salad which was ok! Her main course Pineapple chicken was good better that my sweet dish! Portions were huge which we never finished! Service was ok cuz our waiter came only once, when we ordered food! After that not even once! Only reason I'm giving 3stars is the tables are to close to wach other and they tiny for food portions they give! I had had to move my table each time when someone comes and goes! Â  Thai tea ice cream was delicious! I really enjoyed it!
