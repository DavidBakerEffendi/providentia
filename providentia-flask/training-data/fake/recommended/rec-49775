Even at 10:30 on a Friday night, I had to wait 30 minutes for a table for 4, but the great beer selection made the wait seem short.  The communal tables in the back can get crammed, but enough space for the massive portions.  We got biscuits with mushroom gravy, very hefty and flavorful but got a bit too salty after the first few bites.  The burgers looked good, the orange zest country sausage was refreshing, fish tacos were ok, and the fried chicken that came with the chicken bacon egg and cheese was decent.  If you can make a reservation or have the patience to wait, I'd go back for the joyous environment.
