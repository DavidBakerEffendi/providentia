We went to this restaurant for lunch and it was pretty good. I got the lunch box (which apparently was NEW!). It had a lot of things in it for $15. I got soba (hot or cold), a bunch of vegetables, some baked fish (salmon), salad, and tempura. All was good and hit the spot. The place looks mainly like an udon house which also did taste like udon normally does. Anyway, the decoration nice and the service was good. You are brought hand towels when you first sit down. Keep the outside germies away.
