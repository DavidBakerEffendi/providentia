Nothing about this place is "hurry". Three appetizers took over 15 mins. And the food is horrible. I wonder how this place is still in business. Especially when there are so many good Indian places in NJ. Avoid this place. Food sucks, and takes forever. Moreover the guys behind the counter seemed to have no clue about food industry. Don't give out pagers if you are going to check receipts every time the pager buzzes.
