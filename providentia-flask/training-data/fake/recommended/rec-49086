My favorite brunch spot in my neighborhood (and probably the entire city). Don't go with more than a few people because they only have one table for a party of 4. Expect a wait but it will be well worth it! GREAT staff, always very friendly and helpful. The food is always amazing...everything from the homemade jam of the day, to the always delicious fried chicken sandwich, to the specials...it's all good!! Check out this place when you have time for a long brunch or a great dinner!
