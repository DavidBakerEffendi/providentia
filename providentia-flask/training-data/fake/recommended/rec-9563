I have ordered from Pio Pio dozens of times and love the lunch special, however, lately, the deliveries arrive cold, so I Â have decided to strictly dine at the restaurant. Two of my recent deliveries were accompanied with a wait of more than 60 minutes and very cold food. Why order delivery if you have to use the microwave to warm it up? When I tried to complain to the manager, I was told he was unreachable and not at the restaurant. Customer service is clearly not a priority.
