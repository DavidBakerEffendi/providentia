Yemen Mocha. Dumpling sampler. I don't know what drugs they put into those two delightful items, but I end up craving them multiple times a week. Everything about this place is lovely. From the woman owner, who is sweet as pie. To the sugar cookie that comes on the side of your tea or coffee. To the adorable doily the cookie sits on. To the unique plates and mugs your order is served with. Just.... adorable.
