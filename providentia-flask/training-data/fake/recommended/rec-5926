What you see is what you get. This is a steak and chops heavy restaurant that could be situated anywhere in America (except in a city that knows real dining).  Luckily, we had an outside table.  The inside music was just too loud for normal dinner conversation. My steak was nicely prepared, however my "wild mushrooms" on the side were decidedly canned.  I suppose my hopes were too high. Salt Creek Grille has a nice wine list and it is probably a great place for large groups on a week night.  Otherwise, I wouldn't try it without a reservation.
