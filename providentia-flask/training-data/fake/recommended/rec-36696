What should've been a 5 minute walk from the subway to Grimaldi's turned into 20 minutes of being lost... in the cold 20 degrees weather!  But the daunting weather seemed to work in our favor.  It was probably too cold for people to be out that day--mind you, it was a Saturday--so there was hardly a line.  Our wait was probably a little over five minutes!  Heck yeeeah!   So... three girls tackling  two pies--a large and a small.  For the small pie, we got extra mozzarella and mushroom.  For the large, we got sausage, extra shredded cheese and garlic.  Boy, that extra garlic gave that pizza that extra kick!   We killed 'em both!  The thin crust was deceiving enough.  It makes you think you could eat five slices of pizza when your tummy only has room for three.  Or you could do like what my buddy Lor (who's a fellow Yelper) does... don't eat the crust so you could eat more!   Definitely a place to try when you're in Jay-Z's 'hood! P.S. You could always walk the Brooklyn Bridge if you feel like a glutton after!
