I was hungry for some meat on Sunday night and I was looking forward to some good BBQ.  I had one of their combo meals where I got some ribs and brisket with sides of Mac & Cheese and root beer Chili.   I know that Texas BBQ is sometimes served at room temperature but it should not be cold.  The ribs were still tasty but the Brisket was overly fatty and just kind of knarley.  Actually the Mac and Cheese was quite hot and amazing!   My friends sides were also good, she got the Black-eyed Peas and the Vegan Chili.   I also have to give the place points for atmosphere and decor.  I look forward to going back and trying out more of the menu.
