I like this place. It reminds me of old school box car diners (yes, it is literally that small). I wouldn't bring a client here, as it caters to locals (not that I don't love Hightstown, but its just not fancy is what I'm trying to say) I had breakfast here with my husband about 2 weeks ago (we were playing hookie from work :), the staff was friendly, the coffee Â perfect and always filled, and the food yummy. The prices were a good, but we ending up spending $40 on breakfast for 2 somehow, maybe we are just greedy lol, oh and HUGE portions! I had enough for leftovers for breakfast at the office!
