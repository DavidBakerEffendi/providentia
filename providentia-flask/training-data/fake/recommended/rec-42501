I got a round of soup dumplings, a bowl of braised beef noodles, and a plate of Taiwanese style noodles. The soup dumplings were pretty good and cheap - comparable to what I've come to expect in NYC. The soup was flavorful and the skin was thin. The braised beef noodles tasted pretty much like any other beef noodles that I've tasted, which is good. It's pretty hard to mess this dish up though, with all the soy sauce in it. I was not as big of a fan of the Taiwanese style noodles - they were pretty standard fried noodles - very oily. So overall, a pretty good experience, as long as you know what to order.
