I'm not sure why so many people in NYC feel mediocre about this place.  I've been to Pok Pok both in Portland, OR (my native town) and in Brooklyn (where I've resided for years).  Both places have impressed me greatly.  The food is traditional enough tasting to satisfy my Thai food cravings, but is creative enough to excite my palate.  There are a lot of people complaining about the portion to price ratio, but I've always felt that I've been overfed here and undercharged.  So I'm not sure where that comes from... maybe people in NY have odd standards that I'm still not accustomed to 13 years later.  Try the drinking vinegars... amazing and something I never would have thought to try.  I've always had great and most importantly honest service at both locations and continue to recommend this place to friends.   And get the wings!  The best I've ever had.
