The food at this restaurant is out of this wrold.  I especially recommend the spare ribs and the fried plantain stuffed with pork.  My boyfriend and I have been to Yuca 3 or so times, and it's always great.  The only thing is that they don't take reservations, so expect to wait a while to get a table.  Once you do get a table, the service is kind of slow, but it's worth it.
