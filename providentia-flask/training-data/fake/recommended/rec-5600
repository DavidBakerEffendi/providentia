Just glance back at my review for Brahaus Schmitz to get a good comparison of how salty I get when a beer hall isn't done right.  Stephen Starr did it again with Frankford Hall.  Huge, open areas with long picnic tables meant for sharing with perfect strangers: now that's what I'm talkin about! To top it all off: they have the ritualistic German band that plays the "cheers" song every so often--brings me right back to the motherland.   Insider's tip: don't forget to try out the vegan sausage over a liter of beer and a *friendly* game of drunk jenga!
