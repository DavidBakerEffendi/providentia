This place has typical diner offerings and also many specialty items including a wide selection of vegan and vegetarian options. The staff are super nice and I love the retro diner atmosphere. No great desserts but I would go again for the burgers made with meat from Lafrieda's and the delicious hummus and eggplant appetizer plate.
