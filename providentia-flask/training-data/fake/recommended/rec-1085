Either Alka J and I have very different palates, or she'd had the linguine on an off day.   When I had it the sauce was actually quite spicy (as advertised).  Also, I didn't experience the overcooked pasta.  Everything about the dish was excellent, in fact, and I'll call out the shrimp as being particularly tasty.  I didn't, however, particularly care for the farro soup I started with; it was rather bland.
