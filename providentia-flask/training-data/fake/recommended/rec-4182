I am convinced that the chef has never been to Cuba or other parts of Latin America. The food is prepared in a way that is tailored to local Philadelphians who have never traveled other than to Mexico for an "American" vacation. The only saving grace for this place are the drinks. The mojitos are pretty tasty and strong--you'll need to be drunk in order to get through your meal. The Latino-fusion idea is ridiculous. It just means nothing on the menu is authentic. Reminds me of going to an Asian restaurant that serves Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Thai and does it all poorly--the only people who think it tastes good are those who really have no clue. The locals love Alma de Cuba, so if you're dragged there, begin drinking immediately. It will make the dining experience much more pleasant.
