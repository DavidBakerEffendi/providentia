So I've been eating at the cart for 5+ years.  I'm gonna give it to yall plain and simple.  6 bucks for chicken or lamb or both with rice. When people think of "the halal cart on 53rd and 6th" they think of the specific cart next to the fountain.  That specific cart is only there after 7:30 pm.  There is a cart in this spot during the day time (which isn't bad either) but isn't the "famous" one you came for.  However, the other cart on the opposite side of the street (under the scaffolding) is owned by the SAME people and is there from at least 12pm noon every day until the early am (I've also tried both at the same time).   A cart owned by the same people has actually expanded to the immediate area (I want to say around 51st street and 5/6th). One way to tell if you're getting the right platter is by the umbrellas- these guys use umbrellas that say "halalguys.com" on them.  Another way is by the yellow bags the food comes in that also say "Halal Guys" or "We are Different."   Eating It:  Use lots of white sauce and very little hot sauce. If you eat it to "stay" you can always ask for a cover (if they don't give you one) and a bag if you decide to take it home.   Also just fyi there is no public bathroom (that I know of) in the immediate area).  And when it's cold out sometimes I'll go into the Apple Bank and just sit in there and eat it. Lastly, the line can get long but it goes by quickly. Happy eating!
