I'm extremely torn on my thoughts on Honeygrow.   The first few times I've went there I absolutely loved it.  Fresh salads, prices are a little high, but good quality, portions are decent (maybe a little on the small side for a salad).  I have a lot of food allergies, so I've leaned to go early or late to avoid the lunch rush, to make sure a little more detail is put into my order.  On several occasions I've tried to get the attention of someone working behind the counter to verify that certain ingredients weren't being used (i.e. no black pepper is being used on the grilled chicken, because I'm allergic) and if they acknowledge that you're talking to them, they seem less then interested in helping.  One time I was practically shouting "excuse me" to get the girl behind the counters attention...which I never seemed to achieve (she was about 3 feet away), when the owner heard me from half way across the restaurant and came over to help.  He was very helpful and was able to get me just what I wanted (and was able to eat).  However, had he not been there I don't feel very confident my order would have been handled the same. The Honey bar was also great the first time I got it.  However the last 2 times the cup has been only about 2/3 of the way full and the berries were mushy and on the edge of going bad.  Not really the "fresh" approach I was looking for. I also wonder, what is locally sourced and from where?  Avocado's simply don't grow in PA...and in April, you aren't exactly getting fresh local strawberries and blueberries either.  It would be nice if they let you know what's local and where it's coming from.
