It started out a great night, we didn't need reservations and we've been wanting to try this place for awhile. But sadly, I have to agree with R.S. below... "This place is all attitude , without the quality to justify it!" The facade is trendy, hipster, trying very hard to create that atmosphere. Unfortunately, as they succeed on that front, they fail on everything else. Upon arrival, the service from everyone on staff was slightly less than indignant. Â No eye contact, almost reprimanding. We started out with the chicharron, which I was most excited about as I've had my share of chicharron. As it came to our table, I knew instantly it would be a disappointment, it was slathered in a peppery powder but most importantly, it looked and tasted as if were from a store bought package. And even worse, just as stale. This was a huge embarrassment to say the least. Our entrees were the sisig and the pork adobo. Aside from being 90% made of PURE fat, the portions were tiny (Will someone tell these people this isn't Dufresne's WD-50!) and incredibly overpriced. The halo-halo was maybe the biggest disappointment. After spending a summer day walking around, I was excited to try the Halo Halo that was given a great review in NY Magazine. 3 thumbs down, if i had an extra thumb. It was a bowl of ice, milk and a scoop of ice cream with a few pieces of flan and banana. It surely was not made of love, and sure was not well thought out. Let's just throw these items together and call it halo-halo. Certainly not worth the name, unfortunately. Overall, I regret my having to spend close to $200 on a place that clearly called me a "sucker" when I signed the bill...
