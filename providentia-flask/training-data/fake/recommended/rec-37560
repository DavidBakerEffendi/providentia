My boyfriend and I decided to try all the ramen places in the city and rank them. We brought 2 other friends. Word to the wise, order a large. The regular is not enough to fill anyone up really. Their large is the same size as other places. It was good with the tofu and bok choy and egg added. Tried all the broths between us and they are slightly above average but we found 2 other places that are better (so far...we have yet to try one more) so we probably won't come back.
