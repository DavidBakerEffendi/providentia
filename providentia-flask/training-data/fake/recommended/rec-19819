Yesterday at work we started talking about fatty delicious foods and french fries came up.   One coworker would not stop talking about Pommes Frites.  She eats very healthy and said she will only go there when she wants fries because it is that good.  So after all the raving we decided to go last night after work.  Seriously the best fries ever.  Now I know what she means when she says she will never waste her calories on crappy fast food fries again.  Fries were thick and crispy with the perfect amount of salt.  I had never heard of this place before yesterday.  I guess their selling point and the main thing that makes this place different is the assortment of dipping sauces.  They have so many unique combinations.  I didn't pick anything wild.  I got roasted garlic mayo and curry ketchup.  Can't wait to come back!
