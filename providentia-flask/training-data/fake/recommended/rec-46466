Went for Sunday brunch a couple of weeks back. French Toast and Omelettes were the order of the day. The menu looked more enticing than the food tasted. that may sound overly critical but look if you're going to soak bread in eggs and sugar and douse it in maple syrup i mean shoot, it's gotta taste good, so i was hoping for a little more perhaps. The restaurant is beautiful but very casual, terrific comfortable environment. As much as I wanted to love the place given the decor and the reviews, was a little underwhelmed. that being said, i will definitely give it another chance, if for no other reason that the convenient location (for me) and the atmosphere. if that doesn't do it, i will continue looking for other weekend brunch places. worth a shot though, lots to try on the menu.
