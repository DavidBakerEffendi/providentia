This was a sudden stop for us. It was late on a Sunday, and this bright beacon just beckoned.   Ok, so that's a little dramatic. We were driving around, got hungry, and this place just happened to be on our way. We ordered, sat down in this stark little place, and were amazed at the traffic the place had.  The phone rang non-stop, and there was no end to the people coming in to pick up.  Ok, so we stumbled upon the right place to eat.   We ordered a small platter of ribs (because their famous chicken had run out - sadly). Harumph.  Small?   It was "small" enough to feed 3 people!!!   Great food, generous portions, and fab prices.   The staff is really nice and the place is spotless.
