We took two families in for lunch while touring in the city. With 11 people to feed and a long line, we were worried. But the cheesesteaks were amazing!! The lady taking orders was busy, and even made a small mistake on our order - but then she fixed it and gave us a free sandwich to boot! You can't be that kind of service. We all went away happy and full. Can't wait for the next time we get to Sonny's!
