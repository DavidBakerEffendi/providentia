We headed to Coppelia desperately in need of a drink at about sunset. This is what happens when you join other manhattanhenge revelers on 14th st trying to get a shot of the setting sun whilst cars/bicycles/traffic gunn you down! Coppelia's margarita certainly did the trick. Jalapeno was a prominent ingredient in all the cocktails -- definitely a menu aiming to please. The service was friendly and warm. We had no issues getting a table for apps and drinks. Cuban corn, guac, oxtail empanadas (absolutely amazing), made this a lovely meal fitting for manhattanhenge :)
