This review is almost entirely based on the service. The food was fine, but it was not nearly enough to overcome the service issues. First, we asked to sit in the back. When the host went to check for seats, we heard the waiter who was working the front section tell the host to lie and say there were no seats. Then we heard the waiter complain about how everyone wanted to sit in the back, and we were his only table. But somehow, despite having only one table, he still managed to total ignore us. I had to actually standup and waive my arms around like an idiot to get him to come over so we could order. This place must be fine normally based on all the other reviews, but if you walk in and happen to have a lanky guy with saggy jeans wait on you, just leave. He's bad enough that it will definitely ruin your experience.
