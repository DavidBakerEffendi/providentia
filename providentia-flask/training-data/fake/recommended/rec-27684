BEEF RIB! I love me some good beef rib and this place definitely delivers - tender, juicy, bursting with beefy goodness inside the caramelized crust. Ohhhh yeah! The smoked wings are a definite hit as well. Large, piping hot, crispy, juicy and oh-so-smoky. The other BBQ was mediocre at best - sausage was OK, but the pulled pork/baby back ribs/St. Louis ribs and even brisket were sadly quite dry. That's ok though, I'm happy enough sticking to the wings and beef rib. The sides are good as well. Service is just OK, not the friendliest but we've never had a long wait either for seating or for food. The live music & events are pretty cool. We will definitely be back again and again.
