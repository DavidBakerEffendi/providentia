I love Graffiti!! It is probably my favorite restaurant in New York City and everyone who I have brought here has loved it just as much (if not more if that's possible).   Without writing a 20-page review I'll highlight the best things about Graffiti: 1. The service - The wait staff are the nicest people and explain every component of every dish, which makes it very interactive and interesting if you like learning about food.   2.Amazing Food!! Unbelievable - tapas style so you can pretty much try everything on the menu.  I recommend the scallops (they're unreal and very original), graffiti burger, zucchini hummus pizza, and the buns (tomato or pork), but anything you order will be good!   3. Cheap Wine - Every bottle is $25 and it's decent stuff.  Can't beat it. 4. Flexibility - I went on a double date and both girls didn't want a lot of meat, so they allowed us to combine the buns with 2 pork and 2 tomato (even added an extra bun and were only charged the marginal amount) 5. Lychee martinis - So fresh - it's like summer in a glass and so much real fruit, but not sweet - perfect end of dinner drink! 6. Atmosphere - it's so cute!  Yes, it's small, so don't go there with 10 people.  Be prepared to share your table with another party, but in my opinion it makes it more fun since everyone is friendly and clearly thoroughly enjoying themselves. Overall, amazing.
