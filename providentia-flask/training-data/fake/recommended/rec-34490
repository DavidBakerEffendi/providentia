A great place to grab lunch. The price for two rolls is about $10 which is an appropriate amount for lunch. We tried the paneer, aloo, and the mixed veg. Of the three I would rank the aloo the absolute best, paneer is a close second, and the mixed veg is third but still finishes strong. They will also make the wraps spicy if requested. They differentiate the spicy ones by double wrapping them. We also tried the mango lassi and the masala chai. I think the chai is a little too thick for my liking and is not sweet enough, needs a touch of sugar and more spice. The mango lassi is wonderful, refreshing and tastes clean, not too sweet. Overall, great place for a quick bite that is filling and tastes great.
