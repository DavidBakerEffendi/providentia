Yummmm...Can "fries" be a food group, too? Thick cut.  Crisp on the outside.  Soft on the inside.  Delicious. We shared a large between the two of us and got the combo of 3 sauces.  We tried the Sweet Mango Chutney Mayo, Parmesan Peppercorn, and War Sauce (frites sauce, peanut satay, & raw onion).  All were delicious, however the parmesan and war sauces got a little overwhelming if you put a lot on your fry.  Though delicious, I probably wouldn't order any of these flavors next time. I need to come back and find my favorite sauce....so are fries a food group yet?
