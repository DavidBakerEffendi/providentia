Me: "OMG, they have a fireplace...with REAL wood!" Sean: "Uh, yeah...I can see that." I don't normally frequent places that have fireplaces with real firewood. So whenever I see one, it's like someone from the west coast seeing snow for the first time. They also have a huge wooden bench in the middle of the bar. Come to think of it, the place was decked out with wood. We came after dinner around 9ish...or was it 10? There were people gathered at the bar...but we decided to sit on a tall table with stools instead. I looked around and the white lounge chair on the elevated stage by the window caught my eyes. We moved our seats...and people watched until we finished our drinks. Speaking of drinks, they have unique names for their cocktails. I got something called the Persian Kiss, and it looked like apple cider. It had Prosecco and pomegranate juice -- SO GOOD. He had something called the Bijan, and I just remember it being awesome and having some sort of spice and cucumbers, kinda looked like eggnog. The place and atmosphere is very friendly. They even let a couple of bike riders park their bikes by the fireplace. I instantly fell in love with Bijan when they started playing 50's music. The Supremes, The Temptations...WHAT! We didn't have a chance to check out the food menu but I'd love to come back for it.
