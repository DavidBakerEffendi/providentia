Sat upstairs at the bar. The food and drinks were tasty (though for some reason a lot of the drinks on the menu were 'unavailable'). The night was seriously hampered when the bill came and two unordered drinks were hidden inside. I want to give Dead Rabbit the benefit of the doubt but in the best case scenario, I almost lost $35 to bartender neglect (unacceptable at a top-tier place like this) and in the worst case scenario...
