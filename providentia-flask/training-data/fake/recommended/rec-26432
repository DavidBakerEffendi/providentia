Came here for truffle season and got in my email a 'special' free truffle fries coupon that was supposed to end 1/12. However, came here on 1/11 and they told me that the truffle fries ended a week ago.. luckily, the store manager was kind enough to give us their regular truffle fries for free! Regular Truffle Fries (4): Must order. The fries was sooo good with just the right amount of truffle in it (maybe a bit too much cheese) Truffle Burger (3.5): Burger was cooked really well but there wasn't much taste of truffles in it Classic Burger (2.5): According to the menu, this burger should have shittake mushroom in it, and we got about 4 small slices of shittake mushroom, barely any to even taste them in the burger had we not looked inside. the sauce with the burger was also just mediocre.
