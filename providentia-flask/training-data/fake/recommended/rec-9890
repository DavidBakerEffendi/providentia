Had high hopes for this restaurant, but was greatly let down. I came here with a friend and we ordered the avocado toast- I'm an avocado lover and this was extremely bland and I didn't even want to finish it! I then had the chicken and waffles- or shall I say raw meat and bread. The chicken was significantly undercooked with visible blood, which made it inedible. Highly do not recommend!
