Came here with the BF for his birthday dinner. Wasn't incredibly busy and we were seated promptly and attended to fairly quickly. My meal, the matsu pork loin was good but not amazing and my BF's sashimi was pretty good. The menu selection is very curry centric. The ramen selection was rather poor. Overall, the place is good for a casual meals but nothing amazing.
