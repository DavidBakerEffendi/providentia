Went here for the first time two weeks ago and have already been back. This is by far and away the best Thai food I've ever had outside of a big city (New York, D.C., etc), and certainly the best in the area. So far I've had the Pad Thai and the Ginger Beef. Both were very good. Prices are reasonable as well.
