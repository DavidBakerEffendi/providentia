3.5 stars First time coming here even though I've been meaning to try it out for some time. I ordered the lunch special 2 rolls for $8.50. I got the spicy salmon and peppered tuna. I didn't really like the seared peppered tuna but that's probably just my preference. The other roll was pretty good. I don't like rolls with too much rice and I know this doesn't matter, but I hate squared rolls! My coworker had the sweet and spicy chicken with white rice. He said it was probably the best he ever had. We both had a miso soup, which came with the lunch specials- we both liked it a lot. There's something uniquely good about it. Good: Good lunch specials, miso soup. Really nice restaurant and bathrooms! Friendly staff! They give you friend noodle chips to snack on. Not as Good: too much rice on the rolls and the rice was borderline stale. I definitely will go back to try their entrees
