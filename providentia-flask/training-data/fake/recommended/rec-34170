YUM YUM YUM. Banana & Nutella Empanadas. I've eaten empanadas from here twice but have never been inside thanks to Ben W. :) Â The pesto empanadas are my favorite things to eat just before devouring the B&N empanadas. We tried the desserts last week.. they have some kind of ice cream looks homemade? Delish
