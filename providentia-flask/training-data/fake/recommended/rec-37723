Wow! Stopped in today for brunch and was so impressed! My boyfriend and I ordered a selection of small plates and salads -- each one flavorful, interesting and delicious. The four plates, including falafel, "crazy baba", smoky beet and lentil salad, were more than enough food. And yes, the grilled pita (white and whole wheat) is perfect. Will definitely be back.
