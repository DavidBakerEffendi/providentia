I am really unsure why this place is rated so highly. I was taken here for a dinner on a Monday night after a long day of interviews. The place was cute, with the historic homey feel, but the food was not worth the price! For 28 (but not on my dime, thankfully) I got the "Seared Barnegat Light Jumbo Sea Scallops" which consisted of 5 scallops barely larger than bay scallops on top of 2 greens and a smear of cauliflower puree. When I see "sea scallops" I think 2 inch diameter seared meaty goodness, instead I got less than 1 inch diameter barely cooked scallops with absolutely no wow factor or flavor. It was a good thing I ordered the "artichoke bacon risotto". However when I think of a good risotto, I think something a bit creamy but not very heavy - just slightly heavy. While it was tasty (if you got over the slightly undercooked artichokes), this risotto was DENSE, with cheese acting more like glue than being creamy. The positive comment I do have is the cheese platter was good, cheeses paired with fruit/nuts complemented well. For the price, there have got to be many better restaurants in Philadelphia.
