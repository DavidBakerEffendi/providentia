Updating my review from last time: Had an amazing night at Pates et Traditions. It took the fois gras (very good) and a pasta dish with chicken which was amazing. For dessert, I took a crepe. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was great. Service was better than last time. Definitely an improvement from my last visit.
