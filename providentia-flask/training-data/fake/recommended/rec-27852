Went there for brunch with a few friends.  Small place, but if you get there early, you'll sit right down.  Because it's so small, the servers can only be so inattentive.   The menu is set up really cool where your omelets/breakfast sandwiches are basically a la carte in that you add your meats/veggies/cheese/etc.  You get it just the way you want it!   Pretty cheap, too!  I had a saugage, (fresh) mozzarella and egg on a bagel for about $6.   CASH ONLY!!!
