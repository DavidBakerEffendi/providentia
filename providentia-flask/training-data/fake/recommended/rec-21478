We came here for the 7 course meal but it turn out to be 6 1/2  since we have to share a dessert.The place is nice. It was an ok  value but mainly because of the Livingsocial price. I could see spending $35 plus tax and tip for this meal, but at $70. (regular price is around $120. it's not worth it.) I asked a waiter for a regular cosmo cocktail instead of white peach cosmo that's on the drink menu. The waiter said it's not on the cocktail menu we can't make it. My friend and I looked at each other. Is this for real?  you can't make me a cosmo, really?  the place is nice food is good service is ok. I will go back but not anytime soon. I would go try other places first.
