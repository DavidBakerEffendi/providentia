Great taps, but that's Philly. Food/Brunch: Better show those IDs for that pancake or be prepared to be told to go to hell! Smarmy dude will kick you out if you don't have your ID. Conversation will go something like this: You: "My ID? I'm not drinking" Him: You need your ID anyway, in case you couldn't tell this is actually a bar. (he's gets really proud of himself at this line) You: Hey, thanks for pointing out this is a bar I had no idea! Him: Hey, its not us, its Philly! Really! You: Really? I find that hard to believe. I'm having trouble remembering the last time I had brunch in Philly in a place that wasn't a bar. Can you even tell me a brunch place that's not a bar? Him: No, but Philly created special laws just for us and we're just following them! We swear this isn't our own awful managerial policy! You: Hey, what about that person over there with their kid, did the child show an ID? Him: No, he's in the in crowd and a regular, you're not, go to hell (or at least to city taproom). Law's the law!
