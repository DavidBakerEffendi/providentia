Excellent restaurant with exceptional service and yummy food. Obao gets it right. It's delicious affordable food with a fantastic setting for any occasion. Met a friend here last night to catch up and started with the sugar cane spareribs- delicious. Great choice and have to agree with the yelpers on this. We then ordered two more appetizers (dont judge)- pork belly salad and the salt and pepper shrimp. Both were great but the Michelin starred shrimp won my heart the whole evening. Huge succulent shrimp with award winning flavor. I'm still dreaming about that shrimp. And that chili salt. Our entrees were both the traditional beef luclak and pork belly chinese broccoli. Both delicious and Id recommend both. Nice size portion, even distribution of vegetables and meat- no short changing on the protein. I look for that! I personally did not care for the sticky rice, so switched to steamed. For dessert we had the green tea ice cream and spiced apple cake. Didn't fancy the ice cream so much but the cake with the condensed milk sauce was divine. Service was excellent, and we were politely greeted as we left- Im a stickler for hospitality. Great experience. Will definitely go again.
