I need to visit again and again. My randomly selected courses from the 5 course options were all fantastic. I felt like a judge on Food Network savor info each bite and trying to find some fault, but nothing came to mind. The amuse-bouche was a trio of celery paste followed by beets then a stuffed truffle. The. Appetizer was smoked trout with quail egg yolk. The fish was local bass which was so delightful with a sauce on side of tapioca white cheese and whipped light over white asparagus spears. Alas I don't eat beef so I skipped that course and had dessert. A coconut ice cream with chicory coriander in a frigid bowl so no melting until it hit my mouth. Yum. I do want to come back. And soon.
