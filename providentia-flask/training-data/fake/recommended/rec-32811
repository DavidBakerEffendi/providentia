This was a nice surprise. I read on Zagats site that the service was bad, and I almost didn't go, but the service was far from bad, it was exceptional. The food here is great and they graciously honored my "no salt" request for everything I ordered down to the Guacomole. The Paella was exceptionally fresh tasting, the plantains were to die for, and the dishes were all generously sized. The servers were friendly and attentive. I loved everything about this place and highly recommend it.
