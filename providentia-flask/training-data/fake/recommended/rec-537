The staff was really friendly! We got half a pitcher of mango sangria. It was delicious but a bit expensive for $16. But I learned that if you go Mon-Wed they have full pitchers for $20. The food was good. We ordered 4 dishes and dessert. Our favorite was the garlic potatoes. Next time, i want to get 5 plates of that. So delicious! The grilled chorizo was good. But I would not recommend the crab stuffed crepes or the pork cutlet dishes (sorry, i don't remember the exact names). We got the creme brulee to share and it was heavenly. I deducted a star because it was really loud in side. While I enjoyed the entertainment (a lot!) they could've turned the volume down just a tad. At the end of the meal we were stuffed and all for about $40! Overall, my bf and I enjoyed it and would go there again.
