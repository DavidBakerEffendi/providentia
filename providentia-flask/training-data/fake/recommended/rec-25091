It was crowded on a Friday night, and the wait was too long for us so went elsewhere. We walked by later that night, and the open mike night looked very cool. We came back the next morning. We sat right down. The service was friendly. They were a little slow, but nice about it, so we were happy. Â We all enjoyed our food. The coffee was strong and hit the spot. It's the first time I've tried poutine, and it was very tasty... the best I've ever tasted. We all enjoyed our food. There was also a falafel sandwich, a cuban sandwich, and a crab benedict in the mix. We enjoyed and shared them all. It's a very cool laid back place with good food.
