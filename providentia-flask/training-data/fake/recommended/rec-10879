Why not to go there...let me count the ways. First off the website sends you to Carroll street stop for the shuttle, but fails to mention where the actual shuttle waits. I tried calling again and again as my friends and I waited for a shuttle to arrive. No one answered the phone...Finally we shell out the $ to get to the restaurant via taxi since I've read great things only to find a 2 hour wait, but no worries there is a "bar menu" with 4 options, most raw..Still completely famished bar menu it was! After a 20min wait we scored seats at the downstairs bar only for our bartender to tell us you couldn't order from him and everyone upstairs to tell us go order from the bartender. After a complete disaster for my out of town guests and myself we got the free shuttle back to Carroll Gardens in time to redeem myself with an awesome dinner at Vinny's. P.S. I'm still waiting for them to call me letting me know that my table is ready
