OMG.  We were visiting from NYC and decided to try this restaurant which was recommended by a friend. We are pizza aficionados and we totally were blown away by this restaurant.  It is better than any Neapolitan pizza that we have had in Manhattan or Brooklyn.  The dough is amazing,  All of the pizzas we tried were great - from the traditional Marguerita with homemade mozzarella to the special of the day with asparagus and goat cheese the day we were there.  Loved the salads too.   What a gem of a restaurant.  We will be there for sure the next time we are in VT.  Love the ambience too.  Sophisticated but homey.
