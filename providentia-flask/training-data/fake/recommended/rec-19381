Holy crap. Out of all the Mediterranean food I've ever eaten (and we're talking A LOT) this has to be in the top 3.  I mean, they stuff they're own homemade grape leaves. AMAZING. Never had grapes leaves like this. Whatever you do, you HAVE TO order the eggplant salad. Doesn't sound too exciting but it's unbelievable. It's roasted I think and it's swimming in this marinade that is to die for. We also ordered the fattoush salad and a sampler platter that had hummus, tabbouli, baba, and some other stuff. Everything was wonderful. The falafel was some of the best I've ever had. I think there was a hint of cinnamon in it. I wish this place existed by me. I'd be there all the time. I hope to go back some day and order that eggplant salad and those grape leaves again. YUMERIFIC.  It was an accident that we wound up here and a happy accident it was. We were staying at the Hyatt nearby and the place we were originally going to go to was closed for remodeling. We passed Sahara on the way and looked at the menu in the window. I'm a big fan of Mediterranean food (being a 20 year vegetarian you're probably going to be) so I was game. I checked YELP to make sure the place wasn't a dive and it had 4 stars so that made me even happier.  I think it deserves 5. The atmosphere is fine, nothing too fancy.
