Took some friends here and I'm glad I got to re-evaluate the food. On this visit, I found the food better (either because I was hungry, I was tipsy or the food was just, really good). Here's what was ordered: -basil noodle ($8.90): I love noodles so this was already a winner in my book. Lots of big, basil leaves -pumpkin curry ($11.90): chunks of pumpkin and the curry wasn't over powering -chu-chee salmon ($14.90): moist and flaky...delicious -lychee siamese duck ($14.20): moist and juicy. served with the skin on -jasmine rice ($1): standard The food was definitely better than the last time I came. I would definitely re-order any one of these same dishes. Definitely enough food for 4 people. Bathroom was clean and of course the decor is awesome.
