Came here with my friends family and it was very good. We ordered: Pollo a la Brasa (with tostones and fries) - which was very good but a little dry. Chaufa de pollo y chaufa de carne - I only tasted the chicken one, this is like stir fried rice, but it was very good, not too oily. lomo salteado - which is my favorite its steak frites, fries, tomatoes, and onions tossed in one dish with great sauce. Â It needed a little salt but with the green sauce it was perfect. We had a sangria for the table which I wasnt expecting to be that greatm but it was surprisingly tasty and the had fruits i like to enjoy at the end. Theyre green sauce is not as flavorful as in some places, like Pio Pio...but for Paterson, this place is really good.
