We searched out this china town spot due to a recommendation through Best Thing I Ever Ate on the Food Network. It look a good smart phone app to find this hole in a wall location. In the window are photos of celebrity chefs eating here, which gives it a vote of confidence. Inside the small establishment offers about 5-7 tables. We ordered a noodle dish, dumplings and a chicken dish and two sodas. Service was quick and the food was decent. I didn't really feel that my noodles were necessarily fresh hand pulled, a little too much tooth to them. Over all the meal was good but we felt that we probably could have had an equal experience in any of the hundreds of other noodle and Asian places to eat in the area. I would not run back to eat there again because it just didn't stand out as a remarkable place to eat in the neighborhood. What I will say is, it was a cheap meal $22 for us and in NYC I consider that a bargain.
