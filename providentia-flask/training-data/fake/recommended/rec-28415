Wandered in here freezing, hungry, in need of a cocktail! cool vibe inside - totally chelsea.  grabbed a couple stools at the bar, friendly service. 6 dollar lichee mimosas always get's my vote.  had the green dumplings, very tasty and generous app size serving. imitation duck tamarind chili sauteed over veggies was sooo good, spilt it with a friend, could have topped it off myself! we both had a key lime pie martini for dessert came with cookie crumbs on top! between the two of us we have 5 cocktails 2 apps and 1 entree and the bill was like 60 bucks plus tip- totally do-able and worth it! go with friends or even on a cheap date night.
