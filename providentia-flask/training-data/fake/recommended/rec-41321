I went to Sunshine Co for brunch just after the new year before they had a liquor license and it was ok. I had the chicken fried steak, which was a little tough...but that happens with chicken fried steak. I decided to try the dinner menu. Sadly, my meal was quite disappointing. I started with the crispy garbanzo beans. Bar Corvo does those MUCH better but they were still tasty. The tagliatelle that I ordered as my main course had so much potential, but alas, it was poorly executed. The pasta was WAY overcooked, which is shocking considering I was the only person in the restaurant that didn't work there (Hello, AWKWARD!) and it was way too salty. The staff was all very friendly, including the ones that were off duty now that brunch was done, but were still hanging out. And I might go back to try a non pasta dish, but I sincerely hope that the kitchen does not think that now people can drink, they don't need good food. That being said, the bartender did make one hell of a vodka martini.
