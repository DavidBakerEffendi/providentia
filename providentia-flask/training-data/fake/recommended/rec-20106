Have wanted to go here for ages and sooo didn't disappoint!   6.30 res. on a Weds night.  Service is best i can remember anywhere in a long time.  Waiter gave me great descriptions and 2 tries of wines before i decided.  It was my friends birthday and at least 2 of them said happy b'day,  at the end they asked us what we had, did we enjoy and thanks for coming!  you just don't get that attention in most places. Appetizers - Cavatelli with Rabbit particularly good as was the forest mushroom brussels salad.  Amazing flavors  having those 2 as a main course would be perfect.   Arctic Char fingerling potatoes with leeks and cream v nice and great sized portions. Wasn't sure about the ginger with that dish, it wasn't bad at all just different. Several of the desserts appealed but just didn't have room.
