Amazing place we had the crispy pig ears and the charred head on shrimp both were perfectly cooked. Then onto the real reason to go Smoked Goats Neck!!!! I have smoked many things my heyday following the Grateful Dead around but nothing illegal ever tasted as beautiful as smoked goats neck. I did get a laugh at the server telling me it's for 2, I am a  6'4" 250lb eating machine, I don't get full I just get bored with what I am eating. Although I suppose a hipster dufus from Brooklyn in skinny jeans with his Asian glam boyfriend may for a change think it's too much meat, a more manly man with a manly appetite can finish it or if your with a date who doesn't chow down, it won't leave you hungry when sharing, after all sharing is caring.  Granted I felt was stuffed and struggled to finish it off but I did because after all the goat done stuck its neck out
