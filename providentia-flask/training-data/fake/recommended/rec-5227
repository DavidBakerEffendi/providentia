Got there at 7:45am for and 8:08am tee time. Guy in the pro shop sent us right out and we no one ahead of us or behind us all day on a Saturday on Memorial Day weekend. The greens as said before were very fast but to a average golfer after the first 1-2 holes you got the hang of it. Fairways were a but unkept but made the holes interesting. With some better upkeep this course would be a must play especially for the price. I would recommend this course to anyone that is looking for a reasonable price and fun day. Also one drawback is there is no food stop or snack stand after ninth hole. So bring some snacks...and some adult beverages
