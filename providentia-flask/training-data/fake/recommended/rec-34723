Best Brunch place in New York, and that's a strong statement coming from a big bruncher (if that's not a real word it should be).  The only bad part of this place is that they don't take reservations, and your wait on the weekends is going to be an hour.  Fortunately I live in the hood so I can wake up, walk a block over, "check in" for a table that will be ready in an hour, and go home and get ready...I know what you're thinking and yes I do brush my teeth before walking over, don't want the host falling over with my toxic (usually alcohol from the night before) breath. by leaps and bounds my favorite meal for brunch is the penny egg sandwich. I often will call in and order it and walk in and pick it up at the bar and eat at home.  Yeah i'm paying 10 dollars for a bacon, egg, and cheese on a croissant...but I swear the eggs are made by the Dairy Gods because they're so good!      Side note, the chicken meatballs on  anything there are amazing for brunch or dinner. The prices are great too, average price is about 12-13 dollars for a brunch entree.  The staff is extremely nice, no pretentiousness in this place at all. If you want fun, friendly, and fanstastic all mixed up in one brunch spot and don't mind the wait (btw free coffee while you wait), then this is the place to be, trust me you will be coming home and clicking the useful link on my review and writing me a creepy stalkerish message telling me how amazing and right I was.
