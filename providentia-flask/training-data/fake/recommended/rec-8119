I came here because I had some time to kill before a hair appointment at the Beehive down the street.  I decided I had just enough time to casually nurse a nice beer or glass of wine while reading my book.  When I got in, I took a seat at the bar, which was about half-full.   I decided on what I wanted, then I waited. And waited.  I kept looking over at the bartender at the other end of the bar, who was deep in conversation with a waiter there.  Every once in a while, she would refill the drink of some dude-bros who seemed to be regulars, and ignore me.  I'm not really the type to shout across a bar "HEY LADY!", so I politely waited until I could catch her eye.  Mind you, this is around 6 on a weekday, not exactly peak hours.   She eventually saw me and gave me my drink for free, but at that point I had about five minutes to guzzle my beer before my appointment.  Even with the free drink, it left a bad taste in my mouth and I don't think I'll be back.
