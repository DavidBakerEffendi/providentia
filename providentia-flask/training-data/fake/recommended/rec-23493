I've literally been coming to this restaurant since I was a baby, 22 years ago. When my family moved to the area they discovered it and we've been eating there ever since. I often cite it as my favorite restaurant, and I've chosen to go there for many birthdays and celebrations. The staff is friendly and despite the fact that the management has changed several times in the last two decades (I first knew it as "El Bandido"), it still remains an awesome place to go. Occasionally they'll have musicians walking around. They have plenty of options... from seafood to vegetarian. Great guacamole. Great place overall.
