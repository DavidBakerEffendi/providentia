I've walked by this place so many times on my way from work to Kips Bay theaters, and I never paid much attention to it - thought it was a regular deli! Last week, over a work lunch at Artisanal, a client told me that he prefers Lamazou's cheeses to the stuff at Artisanal. I went there the next day, and I've been kicking myself since: why didn't I come here sooner??? I got the "Lamazou Favorite" sandwich - proscuitto, fresh mozzarella, and peppers, all on fresh, WARM ciabatta bread. I really should had gotten just a half sandwich, as it was so big and packed full of fresh deliciousness that I saved half for dinner (toasted it a bit in the oven before digging in for dinner... mmmn!). The sandwich was $9.20, while any other "gourmet fromagerie" in the city could charge up to $20 for it. If you love fresh food, fresh bread, and most of all AMAZING cheeses, DEFINITELY check out Lamazou. I've since planted their menu in our office menu collection. They'll be getting calls from us very often!!
