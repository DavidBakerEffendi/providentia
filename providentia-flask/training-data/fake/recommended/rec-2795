As far as Chinese take out goes, Cheng's is a great place. The food is cooked on premises very fast and the staff is personable. I'm not the biggest fan of take out but my daughter loves the food here. The few times that I have ordered, beef fried rice, sweet and sour shrimp, egg foo yung, it has always filled my tummy. Four stars from me.
