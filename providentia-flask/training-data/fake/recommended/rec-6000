my hometown dinner...it sucks very dirty the food has no taste the staff is rude, rude, rude there is no reason to go here when there are other great dinners in the area. i grew up going to this dinner becuase it was the only one walking distance from my house, in the 4 years that iv been driving iv only been back once and nothing has changed.
