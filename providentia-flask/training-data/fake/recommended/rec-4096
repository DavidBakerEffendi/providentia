RPH is a nice neighborhood breakfast/lunch spot. The French toast, pancakes, waffles, are all very good. The eggs Benedict alone gets a good 4 out of 5 stars. Why only 3 stars? The skillets and egg dishes are way over priced for the portion. It looks like you're getting a single scrambled egg with a ton of potatoes thrown on the plate to compensate for all the white space. Honestly, it's the saddest looking thing ever. The plate gets put in front of you and you're just left speechless. "I thought it was supposed to be 2 eggs?", you'll ask yourself. The service is pretty good. We've been here 4 times so far and have only had to deal with slow service once. Overall, we like this place. We'll come back again. But we won't be ordering an egg dish unless it's an omelette.
