The burgers are my favorite in Park Slope (more than Corner Burger, Burger Bistro, or any other place for that matter). Â The veggie burgers are real good too, and I'm not usually a fan of them. The wings are SUPER GOOD, better and cheaper than Atomic Wings. The place is often busy and they don't deliver, but they are always on time when I opt to pick up. Not great to go to if you have more than 4 people, and 2 ppl is probably best. It's casual and the food is reliable. The spicy cole slaw is good. Chipotle mayo is good on everything. I've also had the veggie chili and carrot-ginger soup and was totally satisfied.
