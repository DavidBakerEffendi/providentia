Some of the best authentic Italian I've had in NYC.  When you first walk in it doesn't look like much, but once you sit down and start to eat you're amazed.  The servings are huge, so you don't need to order a starter if you're not starving (however they are very good).  Also, this place only has wine & beer so heads up.  Can't wait to visit again.
