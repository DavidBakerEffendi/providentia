Amazing experience, the food was decently good. I love their brick oven pizza! the only downside is it's very hard to find parking when the place is packed. Waitresses tend to have attitude when busy. which is why I gave this a 4 star. overall, great place to watch sports with unlimited TVs and great vibe.
