Holy shit this place is AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING My frist time in NY I came here with my 2 best girlfriends to celebrate my 24th birthday. We got here at the right time: 7pm on a Sunday night, seated immediately. We ordered: +Arepa vegetariana +Croquetas de cangrejo +Salmon Ceviche +Cubano sliders +Pomegranate Mojitos allllll around baby!!! EVERYTHING was gobbled up within minutes of the server setting the plate down. Conclusion: Â Although the price is a little steep, its worth the $$$ and no regrets. Next time I am in NY, I will come here during happy hour!
