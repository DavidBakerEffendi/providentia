I came here once because I had heard how yummy everything is. When I went with a group of people, we all ended up ordering the same thing. Overall, we were just less than impressed with the menu. Everything seemed too heavy, or just unappealing. At least what we did order we enjoyed. On the upside, the service was fine. This location's layout though is just too cramped. I wouldn't rush to eat here again.
