The very same night that I tried my first cheesesteak ever, I also tried Pat's.  A Philly-born friend told me about both rivals, across the street from each other, and it was perfect that the meaty corner was walking distance from the restaurant that served us our first dinner of the night. We didn't know whether to choose Pat's or Geno's when we walked up, and both places were almost equally busy.  Maybe it was just my aversion to the way too bright lights of Geno's that made me want Pat's, but I was happy with the choice! We ordered a Mushroom Cheesesteak wit, with both whiz and provolone.   Now, my first cheesesteak ever - and just before this, that night - would have looked so sadly impotent next to this fat baby that they handed us.  It was HUGE.  And LOADED.  And HOT. We were too full to eat it while it was hot, so next time I'm back, that's what I'll do.  But even eating it later, I realized this was much better than the previous one I'd had.  The portions were obviously crazy generous, the meat was way more flavorful, and though the mushrooms & onions blended in with the whiz & meat & provolone so you couldn't really taste them, it was good.  The bread was all gooey cheesy meat juicy, in a very good way! Not that this should have surprised me, but it was also greasy, very very greasy.  But, I guess it should be that way! So yes, I'm a fan, and I'll be back for a hot one next time I'm around!
