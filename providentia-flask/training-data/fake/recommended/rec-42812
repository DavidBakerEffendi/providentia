This is the 2nd time I have been to Highlands now and it was just as good as I remember. We always get a bunch of little plates to share. This visit we ordered risotto, blue crab on toast (YUM), the sausage rolls and there was a cold octopus salad that hit the spot. Highlands also does great cocktails and you really cant go wrong with any of them.
