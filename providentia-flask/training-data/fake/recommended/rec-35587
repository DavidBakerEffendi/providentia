A couple of my yelp friends had reviewed this place so it was on my list for must try. Luckily we were able to have lunch there recently. Hubby had the shrimp stir fry with added veggies & I had the beef soup. The soup had incredible complex broth-  who knew that so much flavor could come out of broth?!?!?! They make broth magic. Now, I still don't have the  a clue how to each the noodles with chopsticks & the spoon and all but I managed & they were SOooOooOOOooo Good!! The stir fried noodles were also very flavorful. The servings are huge too so come hungry because you will leave stuffed. I can't wait to come back with friends because this place is right on the money. Plus its a BYOB so what is not to like! Go! ENJOY and be ready to eat!
