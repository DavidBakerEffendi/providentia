Kalustyans doesn't open til 10am and I was in dire need of a bathroom and breakfast, so I popped into Penelope to have breakfast and wait it out til 10am when the famous spice shop opened. It's cute inside - very shabby chic - but the seats aren't as cozy as the decor. No cushions anywhere which lends to a sorta cold feeling. Oddly the guy that seated me asked, "So would you like a single or double espresso?" assuming I wanted espresso. It was an odd way to seat a person. Presumptuous at best. Limited breakfast entree menu - I settled on the 2 egg breakfast with toast and "home fries" and a cup of "decaf". There are some interesting sides on the back side of the menu Â - one was a coffee cake that sounded intriguing. Coffee wasn't very good and was not hot. They give you milk rather than cream, so you wind up diluting your already cold coffee to sub room temperature. My breakfast arrived served with "french fries". $8 for two eggs with FRENCH FRIES? Please, if you're going to call it "home fries" on the menu but they're really "french fries", for god's sake, tell me so. Getting french fries with my breakfast when I am trying to eat somewhat healthy makes me a bit mad. But I was hungry so I ate them, resentfully. Took forever for a 2nd cup of coffee and also had to ask the guy that seated me for jam - waitress just never checked back with me until it was time to clear the table and bring my bill. For all my griping, it's cute and the food "tastes" OK, but there's just nothing special here that I saw today. I'd give it a 2nd try to see if anything else on the menu was stellar, but it's just not a breakfast destination spot. I don't "get" why there's a massive wait for breakfast unless there really isn't anything else in Murray Hill. (Maybe that IS the case?)
