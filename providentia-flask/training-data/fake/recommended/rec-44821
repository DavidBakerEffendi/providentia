Outstanding food and equally great service! This place is a hot spot for dinner so I expected to be treated accordingly at the door.  You know, the catty "You don't have a reservation??" - with no eye contact given by the maitre'd at any time during the exchange.  However, we were greeted by Theresa who was super personable and on top of things.  While it was busy, she made our relatively short wait as nice as can be by offering us a drink and letting us know she was doing her best to accommodate us as soon as she could.  Nice! We tried a lot of different things.  All were great especially the pork chop and the lobster risotto.... oh and the Mexican corn!   love this place.
