They're chicken Caesar salad is so good filled with a lot of chicken. the buffalo chicken Pizza is also good. And they  have specials every day of the week but not for Saturday. But Sunday is deals on pizza and every night is busy up till closing. Temple students and police officers and businesses far and near eat at this location. The parking is not good if you park in the wrong spot they will tow your car or give you a ticket. If order a pizza that cost $7and you come back to your car with a ticket on it  for $35. And you say to yourself damn that was an expensive pizza.
