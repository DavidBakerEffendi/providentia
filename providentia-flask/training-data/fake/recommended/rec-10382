Barry is the greatest bartender/person who has ever lived. The EAR INN is one of the best/most historically awesome bars in NYC! Went there for the first time on Tuesday night with my boy toy and my bestie and had a WONDERFUL experience. I also really appreciate that they don't have a deep fryer. I ate some delicious spicy shrimp and an amazing turkey burger (which may or may not have been a hamburger, but who's counting). A cool, happy place worth checking out. The kind of place you want to be a regular at! 5 stars!!
