The garlic shrimp appetizer is amazing. I could have pretty much ate that for my entree as the shrimp were so large, but I had the salmon piccata following which was very tasty. Â I would definitely go back again - maybe try the pizza. It has a fresh atmosphere and is pretty decent for a date night.
