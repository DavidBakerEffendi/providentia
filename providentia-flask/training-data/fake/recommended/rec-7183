This place is really trying, and I respect their ambition and creativity, but I just don't think they're that great (yet). The uni toast was the exact same thing as what they serve at Marea, but just not as good uni and not as well executed (maybe Marea copied them, who knows--in any case Â theirs is better). The Berkshire pork belly appetizer was just OK--well seasoned but actually a bit dry and lean. The shaved foie gras was unbearably salty, even for foie gras, and did not get along well with the ultra-sweet Mandarin oranges it was served on top of. The duck breast entree was perfectly fine, but I have had better prepared duck elsewhere. All in all it just wasn't anything to write home about, even though I was hoping it would be. Still, their recognition is bringing legitimacy to fine dining in Queens, so I really hope they continue to do well and build their reputation (while improving their dishes).
