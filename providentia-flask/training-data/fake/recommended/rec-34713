For a concept restaurant, this is about as good as it gets. Ordering is fun and the meatballs (all variations of them) were savory. Sure, the place was packed with people "more-Brooklyn-than-thou", but everything was still great (as was the people watching).  As I could feel disapproving eyes cast upon my average clothes made to fit an above average waistline, my meatball sandwich turned my focus to a meal that made all the negatives worth it.  4.5 Big Stars.
