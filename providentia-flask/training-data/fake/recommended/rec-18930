I've been here many times, and it's never been my pick. It really comes down to the customer service for me. The wait staff (usually 2 bartenders running all tables and the bar) is far from friendly or engaging. I don't think I've ever recieved eye contact from anyone OR even a response after I place an order- more like a silence and then walk away with nothing to let me know you just understood or even HEARD what I ordered. As a former waitress myself, I find this extremely peculiar. This might be that thye're really busy, and and just trying to be really efficient.. but I have to say, a "sure", "okay, I'll get your order in", OR maybe even a "thank you" wouldn't kill anyone or take more than 2 seconds to speak. Bizzare. And not a one time experience.
