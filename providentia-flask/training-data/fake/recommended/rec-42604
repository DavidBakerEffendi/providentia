I'll start by saying nothing was offensively bad here or anything like that, but I was sorely disappointed by what I got for my money.  If I spend $50 on dinner for two, I'd like to leave full, not making plans to find the nearest pizza place as I head out the door.  Some specifics: - $5 leek tart was literally the size of a Chips Ahoy/oreo cookie (could be finished in one bite) - $13 lentil "entree" consisted of a small bowl of cold lentils with a few carrots (albeit cute ones) on top - $8 squash ribbons with pecorino had only 3 pieces of pecorino in it and sorely lacked seasoning - $4 sweet potato wedges with maple creme fraiche were excellent.  The creme fraiche sauce was divine and was the sole reason I didn't give this place 1 star General feedback: I definitely expected bigger portions sizes for the cost, and it would be nice if they served complementary bread and butter, or something comparable, instead of charging $4 for it.  While the vegetables were all very fresh, I left too hungry to call my experience there satisfying.  If anything, I would recommend going for tapas (since that's basically what it was) and cocktails, but certainly not for dinner.
