So good! I work in the neighborhood (kind of) and was getting bored of the same old lunch stuff, so decided to head over to the Food Truck oasis near Temple. The Creperie was a great first stop - as a vegetarian, there weren't a million options, but I had the Very Veggie (basically a chopped up veggie burger with sauteed veggies, feta cheese and a feta-like sauce) and it was pretty great! I'll definitely be back. Pros: Super cheap - $4.50 for a big crepe, which my non-profit salary loves; filling; the lead cashier dude bears an uncanny resemblance to John Travolta (I count this as a pro, don't judge me); good/fresh quality food; solid music choice - oh hey, WMGK; getting hit on by college boys while you wait. Winner! Cons: Kind of a longish wait if you go during prime lunch hours; potentially having to listen to emo college kids discuss the meaning of life while in line. And that's it. Do it.
