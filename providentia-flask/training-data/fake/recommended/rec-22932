Love this CUTE and Glamorous little restaurant right in Hell's Kitchen.  So glad they opened.  The shrimp penang curry is wonderful, I order it constantly and it looks so pretty in the modern bowl they use with the wonton chip fan.  Love the restaurant decore!  Service is Great!  Food GREAT!  Delivery GREAT!  Has a small sexy little bar too.
