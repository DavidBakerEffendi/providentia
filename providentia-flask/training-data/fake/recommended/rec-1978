Geno's gave me my first authentic cheese-steak experience about a week ago, and i'm still craving another one.  The service was lightning fast while preserving the quality of my sandwich.  I must admit it's purely junk food, but I didn't feel like I overate after I was done.  I would have given it 5 stars but at $9 a sandwich Geno's might be overcharging a little to much.
