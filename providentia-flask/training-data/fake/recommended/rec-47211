Ordered the roast beef, as I don't eat pork. Â Had it with greens and sharp provolone. The good: The bread was good, crisp crust, doughy enough to not get completely soaked by juices. The cheese was sharp and flavorful, and nice and melty. The greens were garlicky, plentiful and complemented the cheese. The "eh": The beef was somewhat bland. Based on the reviews, I expected the MOST flavorful, well-spiced beef ever, and was pretty disappointed. The service was only okay.... but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and hope that they're nicer earlier in the day. =)
