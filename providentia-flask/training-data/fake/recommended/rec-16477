Fantastic! I think you have to be a real New Yorker to appreciate it though. It's loud, kinda small space, and you're at a table with other people. The food is five-star, the staff there was friendly and knowledgeable. The chef gave us a complimentary appetizer, the drinks were great, and the atmosphere was electric. Word of advice, take a cab. Parking in the East Village is brutal.
