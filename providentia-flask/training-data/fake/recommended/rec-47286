Horrible! We walked in after making a reservation via OpenTable. Little did we know that two Italian places were essentially sharing the same address. Very confusing. Anyway, we walk in and are greeted by a guy that looked like he was a bit stressed out. He said "we don't do OpenTable... you must mean the place next door" ... well, we said "if you have an open table we'll just stay here"... Eventually we got seated, and I was bumped into atleast 4x by passers by, including wait staff. The spaghetti was $18.00!!! After perusing the menu and being generally dissatisfied with the place, my wife and I just got up and left. We went next door, and had an excellent time, a better food selection, and friendlier staff. This place sucked.
