I didn't want to like Barbuto. I'm an "outer borough" person and tend to find these types of restaurants a bit too pretentious. But I absolutely love this place. Yes, it's pricey (my hubby and I shared a JW chicken with crispy potatoes, broccoli and a half carafe of white wine and it was close to a hundred bucks) but the food was good (potatoes a little too salty though, but everything else outstanding - including the wine - Lugano, I believe it was) and the ambiance, though loud, was pretty cool. Jonathan Waxman walked around a bit and it was nice to see him - looks like a regular guy; don't know what I was expecting - lol. So you get the great food, "look at me I think I'm a celebrity" vibe and a close yet off the beaten path West side downtown location. Must be awesome in the summer with the doors open to the elements Â and the people watching. Luckily my good friend gave us a gift card to try them out and they're good enough to go back again WITH OUR OWN MONEY - haha! The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I have to take out a loan to eat there, but worth it every few months.
