The place was impecable in both its presentation as well as its execution. My lady and I had the sweet potato ravioli and the baked mac with bacon. Both of the dishes were a nice twist on the old comfort food staples. The starter was a wonder garlic cheese bread with cheese actually running through it as well as grilled on top. Service was quick and friendly. Ambience also was very warm and comfy. Love this place!
