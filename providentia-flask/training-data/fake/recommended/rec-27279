I don't often give 5 stars and I feel it's lame when reviewers do. Cut the crap, it should be an excellent without a doubt the best place you've been to. None of this "it was really good but...." then give them 4 to 5 Stars...4 to 5 Stars is for a restaurant that is a standout, a must go to place where you are not disappointed in the least. This place hands down deserves all 5 of my Stars. I went with 3 other friends and we each tried different sandwiches, amazing! There is a wait but it is so, so worth it. The photos uploaded by other reviewers so true! Thank you, thank you! I dream about your sandwiches and thank my waistline that I do not work near you or my hips would be in sooo much trouble. I can't wait to go back!
