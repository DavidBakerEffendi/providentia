This place really deserves a shout-out. I work about 5 mins away and I'm often hard pressed to find a good meal that doesn't involve a crappy chain restaurant, pizza, or a deli. Estrela Da Serra proved to be my savior this past Wednesday. Now I was actually here quite some time ago, yet I sorta forgot about it. Why? I don't know and I may have well wasted the last year of my life. OK maybe not to that extreme but damn this place is awesome. Enough of my blabbering. Let's get down to business. Their lunch specials can simply not be beat. For roughly $7.50-10 you can get your choice of chicken, pork, sausage, ribs, or steak served with rice and french fries. The amount of food that you are given can easily be enough for two meals. I chose the pork cutlets but instead of fries, I swapped a salad. The guy behind the counter was super friendly, was making suggestions, and couldn't have appreciated my business more. He didn't even charge me extra for swapping out the salad. Let it be known that this place is take-away only. Upon entering you will get a whiff of the sweet aroma of charcoal. That's because the meats here are cooked to perfection using charcoal grills. I would recommend calling ahead and placing your order. I walked in without calling and it took about 15 mins for my order to be up with no one else in the place. Ahh even as I type this, I can't help but salivate just a little bit thinking about that pork. Next time I stop by, I will surely be trying their rotisserie chicken as I hear great things. For delicious food, great prices, and guys who really appreciate your business, Estrela Da Serra should be your pick of choice.
