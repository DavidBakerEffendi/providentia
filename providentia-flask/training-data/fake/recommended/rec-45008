More than 3,000 miles away; I dream about this burger. Dare I say it? Yes, I think it may beat out Neiman Ranch meat from the Bay Area. I grew up with vegetarian parents. My mom's version of Friday night, meat night was throwing two slices of pork cutlet into the microwave for ten minutes with a bit of soy sauce. Needless to say, I have absolutely no taste for steak, and I can't tell a good cut of meat from an amazing one. Hence, I don't really discriminate when it comes to burgers; I just know if it is better than McDonalds or if it is better than IN-N-OUT. Restaurant burgers tend to be better (for the most part), but Ruby's burger is far beyond just better. PERFECTION. Plus, I love the cute wooden benches and intimate decor. I can't wait to go back!
