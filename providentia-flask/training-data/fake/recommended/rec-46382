OMG this place is amazing!!! It was my first there and I immediately fell in love, the food is just absolutely amazing. Everything I tried was delicious, from the beet salad to the lobster chili to the filet mignon, even the bread!! Might I add, our waiter was wonderful, very knowledgeable and great with recommendations. I definitely recommend this place for date night or something low key with your girlfriends!
