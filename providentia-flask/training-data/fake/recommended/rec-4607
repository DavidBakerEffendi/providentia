In years past Country Kitchen has been the place for a quick and well priced breakfast in East Haven. However, the last few times I've been there it has taken over an hour to get our food. On my last visit my bacon and cheese omelette took 40 min to come out, while my girlfriends bacon egg and cheese sandwich took an hour. The waitress gave us an excuse that someone else took it, but based on the fact that there was no one else in the restaurant when our food finally came out..I'm not buying it! Country Kitchen, shame on you! You have obviously lost your way. Time to find a new breakfast spot!
