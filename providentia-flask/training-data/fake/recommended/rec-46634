I want to like this place. I really do. It's close to my house, I saw it on the Food Network, and the Yelp reviews are good. But I just don't see what makes this place special. Their brunch and dinner menus are smaller than more "popular" places, like Green Eggs and Sabrina's so it was a bit disappointing. The food was good, but nothing about it makes it stand out. The Sidecar burger was pretty boring (they offer a bunch of toppings, but the patty itself could've been better). Their beer menu was the only thing that I really liked. It had lots of crafts, but I wouldn't come here just to grab beers with friends (the vibe is more of a "sit and eat" place than a "stand and drink" place).
