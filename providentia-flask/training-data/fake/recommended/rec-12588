Umami Burger known for their many locations in California. They have now moved East and opened a location in NYC, so last weekend my friend Jill and I decided to see what all the fuss was about. Umami Burger is "The art of creating that perfect mouthful...Experience it for yourself..After one bite you'll accept no substitutions." They like to call it "What you wanted before you even knew that you wanted it...Where YUM is the new WOW!" I couldn't agree more. After a short wait we were seated and started studying the menu. After reviewing all of the unique burger combinations, I decided on a bacon cheese burger called Manly Burger. Jill went with the Umami Burger that was topped with shiitake mushrooms, caramelized onions, roasted tomato and crisp Parmesan. ill and I enjoyed these burgers so much! Umami Burger is located at 432 6th Ave. NY, NY 10011. Go get your burger on!
