What Posto sets out to do they execute in most reliable fashion. Posto "is" fine thin crust pizza with a large variety of fresh toppings (roughly 25) that can be mixed and matched on individual 9" pies or 16" pies that serve two nicely. The crust is crisp (those familiar with St. Louis style will know the resemblance) and the well proportioned sauce to cheese ratio is dead on every time. Add to this good salads, so-so appetizers and a nice selection of wines by the glass or beers and you have a great stand by. I remember when they opened (in a space that was one of those black holes for a business on 2nd Ave.). I so wanted them to succeed cuz it's just so depressing watching an independent place do something well on a bad block(s) and not get the business they deserve. This is a situation where they have succeeded and now other businesses around them may just be doing the same because of it. Oh, one last tip, their fountain sodas are usually pretty flat - get a bottle of Stewart's instead.
