I live down the street from this place and love it. It has a rather unexpected combination of things going for it: On the one hand, they have great coffee, a quirky sense of style (see: weird industrial-looking light fixtures, steel ceilings downstairs) and a good atmosphere for sitting and studying (not a lot of seating, but if you can grab one of the tables or bar stools, it's a nice hide-away during finals week). On the other hand, they have GREAT Ethiopian food. Like, my favorite in the city so far. Â I don't eat meat so I can only vouch for their vegetarian dishes, but their tikil gomen and misir are so good...and their injera is always so fresh. For two non-meat eating people, order the vegetarian combo and the foule and you'll be happy campers. The thing that really makes me love this place the most are the owners though. They are so incredibly nice, and the service is amazing...I would still go there even if the food wasn't as good as it is.
