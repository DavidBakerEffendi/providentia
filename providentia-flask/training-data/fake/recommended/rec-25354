The best thing to happen to Cedar Park all year and a piece of good news after Elena's and Cedar Park Cafe were destroyed by fire/sloppy demolition. Most everything is great Szechuan, but my friend who is an expert in this area recommends: Double cooked pork, dry cooked beef, fish in chili sauce, cucumbers, string beans, greens.
