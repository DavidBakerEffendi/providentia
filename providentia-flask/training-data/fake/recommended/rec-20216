I was excited to try this new-ish spot in my hood; the windows especially look so inviting! I was disapointed and would advise you to get your eggs on somewhere else. Service was slow and lacking - took over 15 minutes to get water and a drink order, food came 45 minutes after we ordered. No follow up to check how the food was, came to ask about drink refills about 30 minutes after the first drinks came. My friends were also not pleased that they charge for coffee refills. The food was mediocre- our table had the baked eggs (they were out of feta at 11:30am) the salt cod (a few small pieces of cod was disappointing)and pancakes which were just ok. They took it upon themselves to auto charge us a 20% gratutiy for a group of 7, which is typical for the group size but unfortunate when you feel like you've been neglected for 1.5 hours. Overall, we had consensus that this was a thumbs down. Meh.
