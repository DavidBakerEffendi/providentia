Way overdue, but I remember everything about this last visit to the Big Apple. On our last day in the city we had to grab something for the trip back. So, of course we Yelped near our hotel, the nearest place with decent reviews was Nish Nush; Plus, we asked our concierge and they said they eat here practically every fine day, thank you very much. I'd say avoid getting too much food.  It happened to us, and trust me, although it's pretty tasty, falafels were too hard in my opinion, but i guess you could drown em in sauce or dips... good thing we got other things too... oh yeah, that's the problem too. you want to try a bunch of stuff because you don't live nearby (in our case) so you get what you think you'll like but you're gonna feel silly tossing away perfectly good food because you're getting on an airplane... The bottom line, don't overdo it.  Take your fave snacks on the plane, like a black and white from Dean and Deluca's and good bread... man love their bread... carbs count begone... love em.  I think I need to update the Dean and Deluca review in NYC. It's almost easier to get there than the only west coast option in Napa Valley. Anywho, Nish Nush, not a bad option. Enjoy.
