A work friend of mine recommended I try this restaurant. I came with my in-laws to be and fiance after an afternoon at the Intrepid. I can say that the food is great and the inside is very pleasing. The only iffy part are the prices... a bit more on the expensive side. Then again, it's Manhattan. It's a nice place for a first date or group dinner. Make reservations as it can get crowded very quickly.
