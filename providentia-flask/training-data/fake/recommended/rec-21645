I had such high expectations for this place, sadly i was a little let down, the food was good but nothing amazing, we had the apple kimchi that was def the standout dish, all the ingredients went really well together and it was delicious, the infamous pork buns were good but tasted just as good as other buns i've had, anyway check it out its a cool place
