a friend of mine took me here for brunch. all i have to say is OMG. the mac and cheese is just off the chain....meaning, i have craved that mac and cheese since I left NYC four months ago. it is simply amazing. Kudos to naming each of their dishes after prominent leaders, but my heroes during my visit were the Gregory & Gloria Page (waffles with blueberries). Some of the best waffles, corn bread and mac and cheese I have ever had. Its the kind of heroism that only food can provide. yum.
