This place is new and will be my go to pho spot whenever I'm in the area. I accidentally got my haircut at Benny's with a friend nearby and decided to get dinner here. We shared the a bahn mi and summer rolls. I ordered the the P1 large ($8.95). Sometime's when I'm at Saigon Pho I always wonder where's the beef?! Well, it's in PTH! The P1 also have hefty amount of offal (tripe and tendon) that I eat up. I also ordered the mango shake. It tasted really good but the tall fancy glass it comes in is a little bit longer than the straw. The shake itself was really tasty and not overly sweet. Saigon Pho's monopoly on pho in the area might be over if this place keeps up the good work. There's 2 TV's inside as well. It was airing Monday Night Football when we were there. We chit chatted with the owner and the Indian guy who was running the show for now. I asked if they would consider making a chicken pho. The chicken pho that vietnamese people eat. Just like the pho from San Francisco. But, the owner said he would check with his wife. yelp.com/biz_photos/turtâ€¦ I'd ignore the fake 1-2 star reviews and try this place for yourself. I'm also glad this place replaced the TCBY that used to be here. NJ needs less Froyo places!
