Wonderful, cozy restaurant with great food.  The service was ok, a bit slow at times, but our appetizers and dinners more than made up for it.  The fries are great and they have vegetarian options and will even omit the fish sauce.  The owner and chef was on iron chef!  Try her cooking classes if you have the chance.
