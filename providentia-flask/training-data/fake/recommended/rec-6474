Interesting trendy and fancy Thai restaurant in Hells Kitchen. I got the Room Service Pad Thai, which is Pad Thai inside of an omelet. This novelty added a little bit to the experience, but what really pleased me was the seafood in the Pad Thai. They were generous with shrimp, mussels and squid... and they were cooked to a level of perfection I didn't think possible. So tender and crispy. Yum. For that reason alone, they get 5 stars.
