First time in my life that I tried a Falafel. I didnt even know it existed haha! I love this place. I love the falafel sandwich. It is big, I cant even eat it all ( but thats because I am a woman). Delicious! $3! The staff is great. I only have good things to say about this place. Will try the Shawarma and see how it goes, because that I can compare with the ones I used to have in Rotterdam, made by the indian-suriname people. real stuff...Anyway! its the kind of fast food that I like. Not too fatty, cheap and delicious! congrats!
