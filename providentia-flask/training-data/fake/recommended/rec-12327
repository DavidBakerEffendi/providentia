Umami Burger, thank you for taking my burginity. That is, I haven't eaten a burger in about 5 years. (Born again burger virgin.) I got the original and my friend got the truffle burger with the egg. We ordered both of ours medium rare, and it was done perfectly. Let me start with the meat, so juicy and falls apart right away once its in your mouth. It has the perfect fat content. And unlike your typical burger, (Shake Shack, I'm speaking to you...) it wasn't too salty. The original is the perfect balance of savory and sweet. Can't really name all the components but my three favorite were the shitake mushroom (what a creative and delicious touch!), the parmesan cheese crisp (added the perfect amount of salt), and the bun. Oh yeah, those soft, fluffy potato buns are amazing. so so so good. I really enjoyed the burger. We also got a pickle platter, and I definitely recommend if if you're a pickle slut, which I am. There were 4 different kinds of in house pickles (cauliflower, cucumber, okra, and string beans!!) I wasn't a fan of the fries, and in my opinion, they could be skipped. But if you do insist on getting fries, don't forget the garlic aoili :)
