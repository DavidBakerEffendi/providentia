Let's try again: Food was excellent, portion size was mixed (wife's hanger steak plate was filled, my home made capanelli (sp) & Sausage was pretty small). Service seemed rushed : We ordered drinks and apps and wanted to wait on ordering dinner, but 3 minutes after taking app order and before drinks, server was back asking if we knew what we wanted and seemed pressed for time (It was New Year's Eve, so tables were going to be at a premium, but not while we were there).  Server was extremely freindly though! So: Food quality   5 Food Quantity   3.5 Service persona   5 Service pressure  3 Atmosphere  5
