Before I start, on food alone, I'd give this place 4 stars.  We shared the calamari and fig salad apps, gnocchi and hanger steak mains, and an affogato to finish.  Everything we ordered was tasty and came out quickly.  The portions were big too and we left stuffed.  The pricing was also very affordable. The service wasn't bad, but wasn't great either.  It took a little while for our server to greet us after we were seated.  We also had to ask for water.   Otherwise, this is a nice BYOB with great food.  I'd recommend to friends.
