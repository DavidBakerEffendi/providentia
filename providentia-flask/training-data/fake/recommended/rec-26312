I just love this place besides the tofu soup (which I prefer mild ) I love the la bbq galbi. With any korean food its all about the banchan and bcd's banchan is just perfect (love their kimchi) and now that it's summer omg the cold noodle nyeng myun (my favorite korean dish) which bcd does very well. Wish it was all year round. Overall bcd has delightful dishes thats not to strong in taste as for the prices not bad for the portions.
