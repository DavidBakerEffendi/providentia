This place has DELICIOUS authentic Japanese food for extremely reasonable prices but its decor (and clutter) and slow service explain why a restaurant with this much potential is practically empty during lunchtime. I was severely craving tonkatsu so I found this restaurant in my neighborhood. I have pretty high expectations when it comes to tonkatsu and ichibantei really delivered on great tasting but not fatty tonkatsu. It came in a full meal with warm (but a bit too salty for me), rice, and shredded cabbage. I also tried the chicken nanban which was recommended by the chef and it was delicious as well! The tartar sauce was perfect, not too creamy. The portions were so huge that I took the rest to go. This is coming from someone who NEVER takes leftover food home which shows how much I truly appreciated the food. I had it for dinner/snack and it was still delicious! Could be the best tonkatsu in east village! I'm definitely returning. Just sad how this place could have had a lot more business had it worked on some things that should be common sense.. Not that I'm complaining since I wouldn't want this place to get crowded.
