I don't think Sunny or Annie actually run this deli. Has anyone actually met them? Nope, didn't think so. You know who I think actually runs this place? An evil mad scientist or another. How else do you explain the crazy combinations? Think about it. Couldn't you imagine some crazy evil scientist, preferable Dr. Horrible, hungover, hungry and tired of Subway. So instead of his usual ham and cheese sandwich, he decides to put his favorite hangover cure, pho, in a sandwich. Oh yes, you heard it right, he put the PHO IN THE SANDWICH. Unspeakable. He even decides to add hoisin and Sriracha just to prove his madness, of course. The sandwich turns out pretty good, incredible even. So he decides to abandon his plans of world domination and decides to sell some sandwich and profit. Or maybe it's some crazed alchemist who's been trying to bring back his dead mom, like an Edward Elric. His transmutations haven't been working recently, like he lost an arm or something. Â He's considered an alchemy genius and he's hungry so he draws some transfiguration circle, puts some kimchee, bulgogi, and bread together and gives you a full Korean mean in a wrap. Or maybe it's just two honest to goodness proprietors that are extremely creative, working out a modest corner deli, delivering cheap and inventive sandwiches to the general masses.
