Just came back from dinner from this restaurant. While i did like the decor of the restaurant that's just about all i was happy with. Actually, the service was good too. However, when it came to the food i was disappointed. The food isn't bad but it's far from good. My fiance and myself ordered 1/2 carafe of sangria $15, scallop civiche ( special for the day $9 ) , Pabellon Criollo $16, and the Hallaca $16. The sangria was slightly watered down and had very little fruit or fruit flavors. The half crafe was small imo. I love scallops and i love civiche, however i didn't like the scallop civiche here... the scallops tasted fresh however, it failed to have any flavor resembling civiche. I was really looking forward to a good civiche... tooo bad. I had the Pabellon Criollo ( shredded fland steak with rice black beans and sweet plantains ), the beef was ok... but kinda reminded me of cafeteria beef goulash, the black beans were lacking any additional flavor. Tasting like it was straight out of a goya can. I did enjoy the white rice and sweet plantains though. The white rice was cooked nicely, not to hard not to soft and the plantains were slightly crispy but not burnt. My fiance's Hallaca was the same, all around lacking flavor. The most enjoyable parts being the ham and potato salad. The cornmeal cake and mixed shredded meat were surprising bland. Every dish we had tonight was bland, bland, bland... lacking any of the spice and flavor the decor represents. None of the dishes are horrible but they are far from desirable. For their price points it's really bad however. If you just walk to any of the Alphabet ave's you'll get plenty of flavorful, satisfying latin cuisine for a fraction of the price. It's Sunday night and maybe we went at a bad time. None the less we will not be returning and i wouldn't recommend this restaurant for dinner unless of course you like bland spanish food...
