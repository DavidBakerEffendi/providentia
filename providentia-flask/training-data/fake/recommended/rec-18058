I get the same stuff every time. Dan Dan Noodles, Pork Belly, and Spicy Cucumbers. Eating these comfort food items in the grandeur of a steak house style dining room (used to be) is a great quick dinner, and fun addition to Old City. But other than that, I don't get the hype. The first time I went to Han Dynasty was at the small hole-in-the-wall across the street. I wasn't in the know about what to get then, and though we thankfully did order the Dan Dan Noodles, everything else was awful. I was floored that it was basically Chinese takeout thrown on a plate, but with a much higher price tag. What a rip. Since then I've never deviated from my now informed choices, but from what I see of the food going out, 90% of it looks to be the same cheap quality. I'm sure there are a few other treasures on the menu that I haven't discovered, but I don't want to investigate when they don't put Dan Dan level mojo into every dish. However, when they get it right, they reeaaalllly get it right. Quality does vary though and I've had a couple of soggy noodle experiences. C'est la vie.
