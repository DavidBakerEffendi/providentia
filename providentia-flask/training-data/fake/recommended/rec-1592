Like others, I have read much about how great these dogs were so I went a little out of my way to try it out. I entered through the stand up counter side. It felt like I was in a rest stop from years ago. I asked for one 'Ripper' and one chili dog. The server replied that they "don't serve chili dogs but I can order a side of chili". So I just ordered 2 Rippers. He looked at me and said, "have you been here before?" I said no, he replied, "you'll want to have the relish". The relish was okay, the dogs were juicy. Good but by no means great. I don't see what the fuss is about.
