I don't know why there's no mention of the amazing pear cake in other reviews. Â I just had to mention it. PEAR. CAKE. SO GOOD! So sad that she doesn't have it on Mondays... that's when I crave it most after the weekend of NOT having it. I'm definitely addicted! My other favorites are carrot cake and chocolate chip cookies. Yummm.
