I ate dinner here while visiting family in NJ. The food is amazing! Everything is really fresh and delicious, from the salads to the desserts, you can't go wrong no matter what you order. Oh, and the portions are huge! By the time I left, I was stuffed but had Â enough leftovers to take home for another full meal. I wish there was an Appian Way in Texas, where I live, I'd definitely be a frequent customer. The staff is also great, super nice and attentive. Peggy especially!
