My all-time favoriate restaurant in NYC! the entire experience is just right.  it is chic and casual at the same time.  it's a must for every visit i make to the city (now that i live in LA).  something about sharing a bottle of red wine with friends on a weekday afternoon when the rest of the world is at work adds an extra zing.  the oysters are delicious, as well as the moules frites. i've had moules frites at many french restaurants, and this is my top pick.  the chicken paillard is fantastic for those looking for something lighter. the bouillabasie (on fridays) is a memorable dish, particularly for the aromatic broth. of the different plates i have tried, the pate was one of my least  favorite. service is great, diners are chic and decor is lovely.  the flavors and seasoning are just right, and they have fantastic coffee (in flavor, texture and consistency) which is a great way to end an afternoon visit!
