I went here for my small birthday brunch with a group of 5 women. Previously, on the phone, I was told the space is small and not conducive for big groups but was advised that I should arrive later for a better chance of getting a table (since they don't take reservations). I arrived at 1PM and as soon as my full party arrived they accommodated 5 of us in a very packed bistro! Fantastic and reliable dishes across the board including highlights like a croque monsieur with ham and poached eggs with lox & hollandaise sauce including a large variety of healthier options. I even dropped my phone behind the tall couches and the waitress was kind enough to try her luck and inch her way in and get it out of the crevice. Wonderful service and lovely people. I would give 5 stars if it weren't for the dirty and cramped bathroom and lack of attention to our water glasses.
