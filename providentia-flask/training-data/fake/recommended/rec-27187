0 STARS Upon entering I was feeling the decor & vibe although only a couple of tables were dining. A friend informed me of an awesome New York rose tuome was carrying so I decided to stop by for an after dinner drink. Yes, I did eat prior to arriving but to get the feel of a new restaurant I prefer to have a few drinks at the bar, chat up the staff, and peruse the menu. I attempted to sit at one of the empty bar stools when a staff member informed me that "chef" prefers only diners at his bar. WHAT? It's the bar I wanted to sit at, not a table, and the restaurant was just about empty! I thought to myself: chef should then remove the bar and replace it with tables. While deciding what to do I was given a brief speech about the restaurant by a knowledgeable employee. I checked out the menu to see if there was something light I could order and immediately noticed the high prices, especially for the East Village. An owner should know that just because you hire a line cook from a Michelin restaurant, that doesn't mean you're a Michelin restaurant and can charge the same. Anyway, it turns out the rose is off their list so this was all moot. Don't waste your time and $, I sure won't.
