They have an amazing salad bar with generous portions, large choice of good quality ingredients, and all for a really reasonable price for a midtown location. The food buffet is pretty good too (both hot and cold). That's all I've tried but they also have ramen/noodles/sushis/sandwiches. Bonus: nice upstairs seating area in the back.
