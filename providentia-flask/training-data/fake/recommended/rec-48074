Came here for restaurant week. I've been wanting to stop in for awhile, just never had the opportunity. Restaurant week is one of those iffy things. You're never quite sure what kind of service or food to expect. Ilili was definitely out to keep the new business. Our waiter was courteous, the water glasses never went empty, staff seemed to know just when to take your plate. Not quite too soon, but not sitting in front of you for 20 minutes as you wait for the next course. Appetizers were delicious and varied. Lamb kebob was worth the extra $5. Asked for medium, and it was cooked perfectly. Yum... (I'm waiting for my lunch to get to the office, and thinking about last night's meal is making me even hungrier!) The space is simple and classy. Dimly lit but not *too* dark. Loud but not *too* loud. Four stars because it's only restaurant week. I hope to bump it up to five when I return :-)
