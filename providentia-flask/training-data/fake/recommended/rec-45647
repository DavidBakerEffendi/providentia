great, affordable sushi place. i come here all the time with my friends! good service too. my only complaint is that my friend ordered a sashimi dish and the chef sent out a frozen piece of fish...not cool. we sent it back and they apologized. i just thought it was strange the chef would sent it out at all. try the rock n' roll roll...its AWESOME
