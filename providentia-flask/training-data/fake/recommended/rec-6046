I was recently here for dinner and the food is amazing. We had 2 appetizers, the pitakia kaisarias and the meatballs, both are great. Then for the entree I had the pastitsio which was to die for, and my friend had the lamb which was just delectable. Overall I will definitely come back and try other dishes.
