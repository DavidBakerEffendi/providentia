Great for a stop if you're in the mood for a traditional sit-down Indian cuisine dinner or a take-out buffet.... Service however leaves MUCH to be desired and was slow and inattentive, even for this quiet Friday evening. Food is not what I'd call blue ribbon Indian cuisine but hits all the primary marks. Mild to super spicy is available for most dishes. Worth a try if you're in the mood for Indian and happen to be in this area of town, but give yourself some extra time in case the service is slow.
