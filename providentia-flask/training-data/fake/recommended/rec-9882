Normally I go the upper east side location on 1st avenue where their service and food is great! However, since I now work in midtown this location is more convenient. I called and order the lunch special (green plantains, quarter chicken and a side order or rice and beans) for delivery at 1:39 PM. (I only order green plantains because I was told they don't have anymore yellow). Then I asked how long would it take to be delivered? And was told 30 - 40 minutes, which is normal. After I noticed an hour went by I called and was told the delivery man was on his way. He finally called me at 3:06 PM to come down for my food. I tip him and was on my way. Normally when you order food the container is usually warm/hot but this time is wasn't. I then opened the container and realized the food was cold. My plantains were hard and disgusting! So I called Pio Pio to inform them that they delivered cold food. I was transferred to a horrible woman who was very rude! First, I confronted her about delivering the food about 1 hour late. Her response was "well that is an estimate, so"... Secondly, I said "well the food is cold". She then said again "well it's an estimate so we don't know the exact time". Then I asked, "so you think it's OK to deliver cold food?" and she said NOTHING! No apology, no sorry for your inconvenience. So I informed her that she "just lost a customer" and i will never order from them again and hung up! I was livid!!! Definitely a waste of $14.70 and $2 tip. In the future when I want good food, i will order from Havana Central. There food is much better and they have better customer service.
