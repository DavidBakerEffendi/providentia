If a weeaboo is someone who wishes they were born Japanese (Go look it up on Urban Dictionary or Encyclopedia Dramatica if you don't believe me) then I think I'm a greeaboo - I wish I was born Greek so I could eat food like at Stamna all the time. Pithari and Greek Delights do what they do well, don't get me wrong, but Stamna has tons more to choose from on the menu, a lot more special dishes, and overall most of what we had was far, far better at my family's monthly dinner gathering.   Appetizers: spread platter (taramosolata, tzatziki, skordalia, and three other dips) - absolutely wonderful.  Needs at least three people.  Also a Greek salad - light, delicious, fresh.  Not swimming in dressing, but just enough. Grilled bread (not pita bread, but a nicer, darker breadier bread) and olives with a wonderful lemon flavor were also on the table.   Entrees included lamb kabobs (they got the doneness perfect across the board; some people requested well-done, some medium rare, some rare), gyros (perfectly seasoned, nice and crisp, and rabbit stew (NOT TO BE MISSED BY THE TABLE).   We didn't order dessert, but they brought out a plate or two of loukomades on the house.  Look, I know they're fried dough - same as a zeppole - but drench 'em in honey syrup and sprinkle them with cinnamon and I'm a happy camper.  I always fail to get them at the Piscataway Greek Orthodox Church's annual Greek Festival and now I know to get them next time. This should be way, way at the top of your list for amazing Greek food.  I'd recommend going and just ordering a few of the appetizers to make a meal.  I saw someone who had ordered the grilled octopus on the way out.  It looked so freaking delicious.  TENTACLES!   It was packed on a Wednesday night.  Outdoor seating is wonderful.  BYO.
