Passed by here for the second time tonight and decided to stop by because it looked intriguing. Well, I was directed around the corner to their retail window, and there was quite the little line that had formed! I guess SCRATCHbread is getting its name out there. I only got the pizza bread, which was amazing!! Extremely flavorful and filling. I saw that they had a chai sticky bun, which I have to go back and try. I'm very excited that this place is a short walk away from my apartment, and even more excited that it's down the block from the YMCA. I can get a fattening baked good and then hop on down the block to work it off! In an ideal world that is what would happen, but I know with such a great place nearby I will be popping in far more often than I will be using the gym :X Oops..
