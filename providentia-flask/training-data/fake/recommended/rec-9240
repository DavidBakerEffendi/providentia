This place is charming as all get out. When we sat down the waitress presented each of us with a colored, hard-boiled egg in honor of Orthodox Easter which fell that day. Like I said, charming. That said, I can only rate the coffee and desserts, but will certainly go back on the strength of those and the lovely service. A friend and I wandered over seeking a quiet spot after dining at the somewhat raucus Zum Schneider. We had a luscious chocolate walnut cake and delicious crepes filled with apricot and berry preserves. The coffee was strong and rich and came with a square of chocolate. A great spot for coffee and dessert - can't wait to try it for a meal.
