Frenchican food? oh-kay...not really something i'd ever thought i'd be in to, but its a hipper and more laid back version of the old Jolie and they've recently opened in the heart of restaurant row on smith street. had dinner last night with a girlfriend, we enjoyed ourselves, but they're clearly still working out the kinks. waiter forgot to bring us salsa, then i asked and he was super apologetic and rushed some over. then, our cabernet sauvignon was served cold, VERY cold, so we sat around waiting for it to open up for half the meal. waiter was of course, super nice, and brought us free port, and even topped off our wines as they were running low. we ordered the mexican revioli and carnitas tacos, also very delicious. as a warning, portions are small, but the prices are fair. overall a good place, i think they just have to work a few things out but they're clearly working hard at the customer service angle. im the kind of person who can forgive mediocre food if i get great service, but crappy service and forget about it. dining is a human experience, and part of it is being made to feel welcome. so i will tell you, jolie cantina is good for that, just be patient with them as they dont really know how to serve red wine and they're still figuring out the whole food thing :)
