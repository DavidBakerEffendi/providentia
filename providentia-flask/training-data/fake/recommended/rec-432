~*~*~*~**** 200th REVIEW****~*~*~*~*~ How long did I have to wait you asked? 2 hours. How long was I in front of the restaurant waiting? 30 min. So what did I do the other 1.5hrs? To find a place to drink. Why? Give them your number and they'll text you when your name is about to come up. That should warrant at least 3 stars right? So the next 2 really comes down to the below - service, food, and ambiance. I arrived with a girlfriend of mine and sat at the bar. I think that when it's just 1 other person sitting at the bar is probably the best option. You can chat with the bartender if he's not too busy - maybe even flirt a bit if he's a good looking guy. And just really have a great time. No one is bothering you or rushing you which is the great thing - especially when there's such a long wait outside. Also what was amazing was that the second we sat down and ordered what we wanted - all of our appetizers and burgers came out within 5 minutes. Our bartender was still making our drinks! We ordered the fried pickles, cheesy tots, sweet potato fries, truffle burger and the original. I love pickles. So fried - who could say no? I mean it was a tad upsetting that the crispy skin was slipping off the pickle but it served as a nice textural contrast. Cheesy tots - mm not bad when it's scalding hot. Once it's cooled off to room temperature - meh not that great. So keep in mind to eat all of it the second it arrives on the table as oppose to letting it last throughout the whole meal. It's a tater tot with cheese in it. Nothing marvelous folks! Sweet potato fries - crispy, sweet cinnamon sugar. Nothing new or crazy extravagant either. But definitely a nice little add to the burger. And finally - the truffle burger. Yes the original is good. But the truffle burger. All of the haters of truffle oil couldn't even deny this burger. The truffle is actually quite subtle - especially with all of the different appetizers - once you take a bit of the burger that hint of truffle is a nice welcome. The meat patty cooked medium rare was perfect. It was pink and moist. The bun was light and airy. Really - the truffle burger is heavenly. You really can't compare to like...micky d's or BK. (duh!) No words can really describe the deliciousness of the truffle burger. Go try it. You won't regret it. In fact - it is so great that in a few days I am going to have the truffle burger again. ~happy eatings!! p.s. I forgot to mention the ambiance - it's not that bright - not too loud - slightly snug but comfortable.
