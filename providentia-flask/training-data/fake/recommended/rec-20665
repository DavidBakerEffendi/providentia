You spend 15 minutes trying to figure out where this place is located, only to discover that the restaurant is, in fact, that unmarked orange facade tucked into the street. The chefs scream "いらっしゃいませ (irasshaimase)!" the second you walk in. Even when you pop in for lunch alone at the bar, you don't really feel all that lonely. And then it happens - the mera mera dip comes out. Maybe you've added chicken meatballs. Maybe not - doesn't really need them, although they're a decadent touch. You tuck in. Is it sprinkled with crack? Probably. Is that why you've eaten here 3 times this week? Most likely. Is it normal that you start craving the mera mera dip the second you leave the restaurant? Yes. But at less than $12 a pop do you care? Not at all. Bring on that sweet, sweet crack, my friends.
