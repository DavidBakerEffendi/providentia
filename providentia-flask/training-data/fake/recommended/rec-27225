You can't go wrong with their menu selection. I came here for lunch and dinner, and ordered a sandwich and their organic chicken (respectively). The food was simply delicious. The wait staff is friendly, warm and Â professional. Then ambiance is very intimate and inviting. I highly suggest making reservations as they tend to be packed even on weekdays.
