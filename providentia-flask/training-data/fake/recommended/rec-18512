Came here for brunch on weekend and really, really loved it! So why is this place so fabulous? Let me count the ways. 1. You can use a scoutmob here even for brunch! So that's 50% off your meal. AMAZE. 2. The atmosphere is great and the service was even better. We were seated towards the back in a separate room and it was very cozy inside! Love the decor. 3. The prix fixe brunch comes with muffins/bread, entree, fresh fruit and a mimosa/bloody mary. ALL for $16. It was already a great deal and then when you add the Scoutmob in, it's basically free. 4. Food's YUM! Got the benedict and was not disappointed. Will def be back soon.
