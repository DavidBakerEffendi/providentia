5 stars for a $14 bowl of ramen.  I know that's a high bar but Ippudo is as good as it gets.   Yes it's salty, yes it's pricey, and yes there's a huge wait if you go at prime time.  But it's worth it.  Fortunately I live just a couple blocks away so yesterday I walked by for lunch when there was no line.  I didn't have much time and was able to be in and out in 30 minutes.  It was my first time having the lunch set.  $17 for the set ($14 for just the noodles) -- I had the spicy ramen (I forget the name), plus it comes with a little salad and a rice bowl with your choice of something (I got the fried chicken, but u can also have roe or pork or eel I think).  After finishing up, I wanted to chug the remaining ramen broth and eat the leftover rice in my bowl but held back.  I had to cleanse that night with a juice-only dinner though.  Lots of salt, lots of carbs, mega calories.  Tip - go before 11:30 for lunch or after 2 on weekdays to avoid the lines.  I have been here maybe 7 or 8 times, and twice in Tokyo, and I think I enjoy it more every time.  But what's it with the prices that keep going up?  I want to say that when they opened a few years ago, it was $10 or less.
