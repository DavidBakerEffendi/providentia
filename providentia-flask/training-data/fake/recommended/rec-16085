Oh, how I wish I could love this place! I walked by this restaurant after hearing rave reviews from a friend. The chandelier, the modern, eclectic flair. It looks like a lobby of a boutique hotel. But that's the decor...what about the food you ask? Well, it was a cold, dreadful, after the snow day, so I placed the order from Delivery.com. Excellent service from them. The food came roughly 15 minutes after I placed the order. Granted, I'm only 2 long, icy blocks east of 9th. And typically the ordered food isn't as good as eating in, so I have to adjust my expectations a bit. Lunch special price is quite good: $6.95 for an entree and an appetizer. I ordered vegetable dumplings and spicy basil noodles with chicken...and a side order of Tom Yum soup. Sounds delicious isn't it? The vegetable dumplings were good and fresh. But gosh, the tom yum soup was so salty I pulled out the shrimp and tossed out the rest of the broth. The noodles, while spicy, was just ok, ordinary, although well seasoned with garlic, tomatoes and onions. There are loads of thai restaurants on 9th...so it looks like I'd have to choose another restaurant to try. Pure I hear is a good one- or maybe the chef at Room Service just had a bad day and dropped the entire salt shaker in my soup:-)
