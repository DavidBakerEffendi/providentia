I've had the pleasure of eating at Lot 2 about two dozen times, and it's consistently one of the best food experiences in town.  Hands down, my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn and possibly all of New York City. I highly recommend Sunday Supper, which has a $30 adult prix fixe (3-course meal served family style), though really you can't go wrong with dinner any night of the week.  Ingredients are supremely fresh (and often very local -- for example, they're big fans of Project Eats and often feature greens from there), and the lovely people running the place couldn't be nicer or more helpful.  (They were even kind enough to let me reserve a table for 14 for a special occasion meal.) The burger, which is one of the few mainstays on the menu, is top-notch, and the cocktail list doesn't disappoint.  Try a Phyllis Gomez. As Eric F. said elsewhere in these reviews, it's not worth giving too many specifics about particular dishes, as the offerings are largely seasonal, but I have particularly fond memories of their fried chicken, pork chop, and farro with vegetables.  Desserts are straightforward but tasty, and I have no idea how they make their greens/salads as delicious as they do. The space is simply and cozy, and I find it's rarely if ever too noisy.  There can be a bit of a wait during prime dining hours, so on the earlier end or later end is recommended.  Typically, though, you won't wait more than 20 minutes for a table in the worst case. Writing anything more is useless -- just go there and be happy that places like Lot 2 exist.
