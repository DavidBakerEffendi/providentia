I'm a huge fan of this place, especially when it comes to eating wholesome food before ComicCon. Yeah, I know. This has been part of our Three-Year-Strong-Plan when we attend NYCC. Stop by for breakfast here, gather our strength, and wade into a space of 80,000 other fans. The food is reasonably priced, the food is, for lack of a better term, retreated for your order, and served in a practical container, and you can get a whole brunch meal for under $7. In Manhattan. That just doesn't happen. So very solid.
