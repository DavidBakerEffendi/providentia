Once again the yelp family was able to steer me in the right direction. Found this cool place while visiting pcom school. Great spot that offers authentic Italian pizzas cooked with fresh ingredients. Started the night ordering a nice meat and cheese platter. One thing that sets this place from others is the fresh and good selection of salami. Have the waiter explain the various options before you go plunging on head first. The menu isn't kind to unknowledgeable people to say the least. We followed that up with their rib sampler. Ribs where cooked perfectly, fall off the bone yet still tender and soft. Great accompanying sauce that's poured over it and guaranteed to have you licking your fingers off. The highlight of the night was the four cheese pizza, the cheese and bread you can tell was of quality just by the smell that lingers in the air as they bring it out.caution, the red sauce packed a punch and was a disappointment. However nothing to deter you from ordering it.
