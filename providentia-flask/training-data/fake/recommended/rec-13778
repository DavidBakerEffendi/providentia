It really is delicious, but the service is not great in my opinion (if big boobs in your face is good service, this place is the the best service on earth; if you want accurate and fast delivery of your food- no good).  The meatballs are good but not as great as grandma's, the bread for the smash sandwiches is great but the bread for the hero is just ok.  The food can be inconsistent- sometimes the mashed potatoes are rich and creamy and very good, other times I have found them to be dry and lumpy.  For the price you still can't beat it, but it's not as great as it was when they first opened.
