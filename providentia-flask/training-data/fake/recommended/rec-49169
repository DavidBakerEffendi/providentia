I had the best meal I've had in a long time at Joseph Leonard this past Saturday.  My husband and I got there around 10 and we were able to get a table immediately at this no reservations West Village eatery (awesome start).  The vibe was very relaxed and cool and  the food was AMAZING.  I had the chicken...how can you make chicken amazing...not sure, but they did, and my husband had the salmon which was equally delish. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars in total was b/c my waitress was a bit...let's just say weird (everyone else was great though) and the wine by the glass list was not the best (we had one glass of every glass they had on the list and they all pretty much had the same consistency...very acidic).  That aside, the evening was amazing!!
