After reading all the people yelp about the brunch, I strategically went there like 915 the first time. I thought the wait was worth it after seeing all the people wait outside after 10. The blueberry pancake was really fluffy; good homemade jam, the biscuit was on the greasy side. The bus boy refilled coffee efficiently. Then 2nd time with mom, we went there later than 10, really waited a long time. The blueberry pancake shrunk; the deck was not as high as the first time. And they put 18% gratitude on the bill automatically. What the heck???
