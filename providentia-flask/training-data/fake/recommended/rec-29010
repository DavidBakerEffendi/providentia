Soooo I was very excited to try the Original philly cheesesteak! It was freezing cold, and I hated the fact that the whole place is open to outdoors. The kitchen takes up almost the entire "restaurant". They can perfectly make a few indoor seating! For the food, I made a mistake and got provolone cheese rather than Cheese Whiz, so my sandwich just tasted like a steak sandwich. It was alright, but not much different from the ones I've tried in other places.
