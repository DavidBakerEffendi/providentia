Plenty of people have reviewed here. But I would say the following: 1) I used to not like their food (circa early 2009). I, personally, believe it has improved very much since then. If you haven't been in awhile, give it another shot. 2) Sweet Potato and Cactus Burrito 3) House margarita with patron 4) Pitcher of house margarita with patron 5) Go during the day if you want to be able to have a conversation (spacious and it gets very loud at night)
