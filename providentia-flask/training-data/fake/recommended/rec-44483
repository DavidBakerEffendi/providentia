Went to maharaja for the first time last night and had a very enjoyable experience.  Maharlika provides traditional Filipino dishes some of which are prepared with their own special flair.  They always have happy hour and drink specials and the staff is very friendly and accommodating.  Pancit with shrimp and crayfish was delicious as was the crispy pata.  They have some slightly different appetizers such as spam fries and banana ketchup which were very tasty.
