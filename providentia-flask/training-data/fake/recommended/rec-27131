My co-worker took me and my girlfriend here for a our birthday lunch. What a great Choice! I absolutely loved it. We arrived around noon for lunch and the place was not packed which was great. We were sitted right away and waiter came right away as well. Waiter was very nice and told us about the menu and recommended a Pumpkin Beer which was delicious. For Appetizer we order the shrimp cocktail and the mac and cheese. Delicious!!!! Set the bar up for me and excited for the entree. I chose the Roast chicken which I loved. This came with potatoes and spinach and the combination was just perfect with the chicken. I was very impressed with the resturant and the service. My co-worker mentioned that it is very cool to go for dinner and when you go towards the back you can even enjoy the Billards. Which I think is very cool.
