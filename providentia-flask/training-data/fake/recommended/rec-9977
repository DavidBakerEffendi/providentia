Love this place! It's great to come with a group so you can all share and sample each other's dishes. The pad thai was amazing as well as the basil rice. Wish I remembered what other dishes I had but they were all phenomenal. The decor is very trendy and upscale and not what you would expect from a typical thai place. Drinks are delicious and fresh too. This is probably my favorite restaurant in hell's kitchen. Def make a reservation before coming.
