Tasty food, cozy ambiance, attentive service.  The patrons are primarily families and out-of-town visitors.  Staff doesn't rush you out of here - it was nice to linger over Saturday brunch catching up with my friend and feeling like I could take my time.  Food is tasty but not inventive - hence the 4 stars instead of 5.
