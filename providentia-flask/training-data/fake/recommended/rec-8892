I've been here a couple of times and have gotten pretty much everything else except the Bo Ssam. And boy was I missing out on life. Some people will argue that David Chang invented the Pork Bun, but his aren't all that great (I like Ippudo's much better) and I don't really remember anything on the menu. The Bo Ssam on the other hand was AMAZING. It's a shame that you can only order it through reservation and have 6 or more people with you because this was to die for. If you come here, come with big group, order the Bo Ssam online and come hungry because its a lot of food.
