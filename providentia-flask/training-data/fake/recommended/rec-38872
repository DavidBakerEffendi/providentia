I've only been here once about two months ago, but never got around to writing a review.   At this point, I can't remember decor or anything like that, but I remember that the food was exceptional and that the help was friendly.  It is in a mall.   We went there to have dinner before attending a concert at the State Theater. For an appetizer,  I had Escarole Portabella made with escarole, portabella mushrooms, pine nuts, &  raisins sautéed with garlic .  Delicious.  Many of their appetizers come in two sizes.  That's a great idea.  I got the small size and had plenty of room for my main course.   They had some unique veal dishes on the menu, but I opted for my old stand-by, veal saltimbocca.  Was not disappointed.  At first, I thought that the service was a little slow.  But it wasn't.  It was us.  We didn't want to miss the show and kinda just went there to eat and run.  We even skipped coffee and dessert. When we got to the State Theatre, there were many places in the area where we could have eaten.  But I am glad that we traveled a few miles and made it to Luca's.  It is definitely a five star restaurant.  Hope that there is another event that I want to see at The State Theatre.  Next time, I will give myself enough time to sit, eat and enjoy this fine restaurant before attending the show.
