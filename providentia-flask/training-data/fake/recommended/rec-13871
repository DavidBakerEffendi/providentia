If you're from NY then i shouldnt have to say anything else, you dont even have to read this... But if you're not from NY, chicken and rice is a Halal chicken stand where they serve, well, chicken and rice.  Lightly seasoned chicken all cut up served over some yellow basmati-ish rice, salad and a few slices of pita.  It's taste ok, but once you put the secret white sauce on to it, it wakes the chicken up and the party starts!  It's a secret combination of a special yogurt, a little mayo, maybe a touch of lime and some other stuff.   With some suicidal hot sauce that they also have.  It makes for the perfect meal after a night of partying. Lines can get up to 30 min long, even if its 10 degrees outside and all of the women are wearing skimpy mini skirts and men are wearing sweaty shirts.  It's just that good, and for $6 bucks how can you complain. Head to the corner of 53rd and 6th avenue and try it out yourself, tell me when because ill go too!
