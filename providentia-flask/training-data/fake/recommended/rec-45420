This was the first time we went to this restaurant.  The atmosphere is nice. Parking situation during a wedding is terrible. Food is extremely pricey. Service was ok, not great, just ok. We went on a Saturday night And we got a table quickly. They where very busy. I really wanted to like this place. The food was not great, but very expensive! Fish and chips for $20?   Over priced and the food isn't that great. Sorry.
