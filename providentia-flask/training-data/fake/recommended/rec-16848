Amazing amazing food!!!!  The best thing about his place is that the food is fresh and tastes great!  Their sauces are also a perfect  complement to the food.  There is no one best dish....I end up ordering a mych and taking some home... Although the Chinese bhel is something I always always order.  This is a must go!
