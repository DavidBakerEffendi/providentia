Mezcal has the best Mexican food I've had on the East Coast.  I go there every time I'm in town to visit my sister.  The food is fresh, authentic cuisine, and they have a plethora of options.  I enjoyed the ceviche, soups, enchiladas, tacos, and chicken mole.  The margaritas are perfect: not too sweet, too strong, or too salty.  They also have micheladas - one of my favorite drinks.  The staff is super friendly and and even gave us tequila shots and tres leches cake when we celebrated my sister's birthday.  I consider this restaurant one of my family hangouts.
