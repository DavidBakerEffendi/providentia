This place opened not too long ago but already is packed with loyal customers because the quality of food and prices are unbeatable! For lunch I had their combo, which I remembered was under $10, and had a meat dish and veggie dish with naan bread. The naan was soft and chewy and the cauliflower dish was so flavorful! But the chicken tikka masala lacked flavor. The chicken also was overcooked with a weird grainy texture. To wash all this down, I had the Mango Lassi which is AMAZING. You definitely don't want to miss out on this delicious mango smoothie here.
