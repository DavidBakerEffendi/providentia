Heard about Umami Burger a few months ago and was crushed to find out they were based in LA. So, imagine my excitement when I passed by 6th avenue and saw this!! Obviously I made it my mission to eat here and I did. Thankfully I waited 5-7 minutes, sat at the bar, ordered the truffle burger and a brew to wash it down with. It was good, no it was really really good. Definitely a burger I would happily plunk down $12 for. What I didn't get was that they didn't do "add-ons". Someone next to me wanted a bunch of stuff on their burger and staff said they would bring it out on the plate instead of putting it on the actual burger. I thought that was odd, but I still enjoyed my tasty burger. Get the burger medium rare, like they suggest. It is moist, juicy and oh sooooo damn good. Truffle burger, you are forever in my heart.
