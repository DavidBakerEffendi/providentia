We thought cool, Food Network chef's restaurant.  Go here if you must, but you will come away feeling hoodwinked.  The staff is pretentious and rude.  We felt so rushed, the place was loud and dark, bring your flashlight to read the menu and your voice will be gone by the end of the evening from yelling across the table to talk.  Then there was the food...it was either salty or bland.  We were with a group and had about 10 tapas so we had a wide variety.  Out of all those only 1 (the octopus) was worthy of a 2nd time.  Then the highly reviewed Paella, do not waste your money, it was so salty we could not finish. In a word this place is DISAPPOINTING!
