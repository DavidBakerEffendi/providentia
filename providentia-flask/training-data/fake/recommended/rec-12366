My bf loves Halal Guys so we got chicken over rice to go on the way to a party. It was sooo good after drinking, so a few days later I got it again. After buying it a second time around, it just tasted okay. It's good but not the best. The white sauce definitely makes it better. Add a bit of the hot sauce and you're good to go. The hot sauce can get a little spicy so be careful. For $6 it's worth a try.
