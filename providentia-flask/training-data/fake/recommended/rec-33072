Where do I begin? Apparently Kafka was the head chef for the evening because the entire meal and service was surreal. Our waiter was clad in a white t-shirt and sweatpants and eventually sat our table of five next to the kitchen in the sparsely packed space. At one point, the waitress locked herself in the bathroom for nearly 15 minutes after some bizarre exchange with her sweatpants clad boyfriend. Since our table was close to the bathroom, we were treated to some light dinner theater as the boyfriend continued to knock on the door in order to cajole her from the water closet. Besides the rampant amateurism and lack of professionalism, the food was okay since the appetizers were obviously just frozen and reheated in the oven. The amount of actual cooking in the dishes was minimal and not worth a trip. Stay away and go to Topaz in Belleville.
