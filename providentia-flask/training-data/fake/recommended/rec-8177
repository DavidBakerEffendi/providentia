mmm, pots of mussels. They've got a whole bunch of beers on tap, and no wasting time with the American standards. Their list of beer is pages and pages long, but the waitress was helpful in choosing a good one (La Chouffe). The upstairs was way too dark for the afternoon, but downstairs, though dim and cramped, was a nice refuge from the cold. The beer is expensive ($5-$8 or more) and high alcohol (Belgian beer, right).
