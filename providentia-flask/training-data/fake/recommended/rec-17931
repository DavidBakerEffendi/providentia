Simply put...the pork sandwich (brocc. rabe & prov. cheese) is one of the best sandwiches in the city. I didn't say "best" on purpose....not that I have a favorite, but how can one really say which sandwich is the best in Philly...so many diverse choices. One tip....wait for your sandwich then take it over to the beer garden and wash it down with an overpriced beer of your choice....the ability to eat this sandwich sitting down is key....washing it down with a cold beer in moderate privacy....is a joy.
