My first ever Five Star rating goes to Umai Umai, and it is more than well deserved. There is no fluff necessary for this establishment, everything you are about to hear is true, and no names have been changed to protect anyone. Hands down a must taste in Philadelphia. The ambience is modern and cozy, make sure to get a reservation, and remember it is BYOB. The service was great, they were a bit behind with only one sushi chef visible, but still got the food out in plenty of time. Make sure to order around the menu, and ask your server for suggestions, they know their stuff. Creative rolls and fresh fish made for quite a meal. I really enjoyed the "hot rocks" appetizer. Do yourself a favor, and order a round of oyster shooters, you will not be disappointed. For atmosphere, creative menu, great fresh food and excellent customer service FIVE STARS and 3 cheers for UMAI UMAI in Philly!
