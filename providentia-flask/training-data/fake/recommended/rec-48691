Came here after work with my favorite coworkers for a celebration! We got to Umami Burger a little after 7 and there was only a few minutes wait (~10 mins) before we got seated. The decor of the restaurant was really nice! There is a bar in the center of the first floor and there's a ton of seating as well. There's also space available upstairs but I never got to see what it looks like since we got seated near the entrance on the first floor. Service was really good and the waiter did not rush us to order. Here's what we ordered: Fried pickles- I normally don't like eating pickles but I decided to try these out and they were really good! Truffle fries- Hmm I wasn't a huge fan. I like crispy thick cut fries and these were the complete opposite. They were kind of limp since they had the truffle sauce (tasted kind of like a sharp cheese) on top. Sweet potato fries- I also normally don't like sweet potato fries but these were surprisingly good! They come with 3 types of sauces (ketchup, garlic aioli, and a spicy sauce which I forget the name of...) All 3 sauces were really good but I think I liked the garlic aioli the best! The Royale- Although I didn't get this (and my friend offered me a bite of her burger which I politely rejected!), people who got it said it was really good. Five Spice Duck Burger- I got this burger and thought it was pretty good. The patty was cooked exactly the way I wanted it (medium rare) and there was duck skin layered on top of the patty that gave the burger a great crisp to it (it sort of had a bacon texture to it). The only thing that I didn't like is that the Chinese 5 spice was a little overpowering but if you like really sour sauces then you should definitely try this out! Overall I really enjoyed my experience here at Umami Burger! Service is great, decor is cool, and the food is awesome! Definitely recommended!
