Pros:  Our waitress was fabulous and the nicest ever. The burgers (hillstone and veggie) were great. I especially liked the bun.  The spinach dip appetizer was also delicious. Cons:  We had reservations but had to wait 25 mins. The hostess was very rude and we were given no compensation for our wasted time.
