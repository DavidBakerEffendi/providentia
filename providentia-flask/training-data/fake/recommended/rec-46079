Normally I don't review street cart food, but I want to share an experience that I had. So my friends have been telling me about this awesome "chicken over rice" which got me curious...what's so special about this anyway? Well when I got there the line was LONG. The wait was about 30-45 minutes standing outside. Luckily, I came at a pretty good time on a Sunday night otherwise the line would be even longer. When I finally get up to the front, the guy says "next". I tell him what I wanted (chicken over rice) and proceed to give him the money. I received my food in literally 10 seconds or less and he signals at the next person already. I proceeded to eat this outside on the street which other people were also doing. So I finally get around to trying this food and it was perfect. Or at least I thought so until my friend suggested that I try the white sauce, which almost gave me a heart attack with it's awesomeness. The food lasted a good two meals...for $6 you definitely get your money's worth no question about it. If you can wait at least 30+ minutes for food, this street cart is worth it.
