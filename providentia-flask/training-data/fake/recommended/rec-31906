Amazing sliders. They are fairly simple with their onions, cheese and bread, but don't let that fool you... they are packed with delicious taste. The fries are fluffy and golden, and the sauces would make Pomme Frites' mouth water. Take both items and mix them in a cheap package and you have heaven. This is a staple in my book.
