Wow. Just wow. Best nachos I've ever eaten, huge portions. My boyfriend and I split an order of chicken nachos and we were both stuffed. All the ingredients were super fresh, and the service was fast and friendly. The only issues I had were I wish there was a bit more seating, but I get it. East Village so space is limited. My other beef: $2.75 for a can of diet coke?! Really!?
