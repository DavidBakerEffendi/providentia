The noodle dishes are delicious. But the only problem is the service. It feels like they are not welcome Asians. The short hair host at the register been giving  me a hard time to seat in a booth seat. No matter how many people we are, she never take ask to the booth seat. Everytime i required, she always give me a really bad attitude. She might be the boss in the restaurant, but she definitely being racist.  very dispointed.
