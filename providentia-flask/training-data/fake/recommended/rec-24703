ok....slow, slow, slow....food is good, very heavy feeling after we had the dessert. we went for lunch and it took them forever to take our order.... so this was the situation, lunch time on a weekly day: our waiter was finishing his shift and he was waiting for the next waiter to arrive. please Osteria Morini, clarify to your staff that when there is only one table with 2 people in the all restaurant, service should be fast and with less attitude. we will try again, but just for dinner next time.
