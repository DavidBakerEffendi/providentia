Fantastic brunch! I am sorry that I didn't notice this place earlier, or else I would have been a frequent visitor in the past. My friend and I were quickly seated on a Saturday at 11:30 a.m. in March - prime brunch hour. The wait for Honey's was over two hours and we happened to see the Ants Pants sign, so we wandered inside. Best decision of the day! The cafe was busy but not packed, and we were promptly greeted by a friendly hostess. We split the spinach, goat cheese, and caramelized onion omelet and the french toast. I did find it odd to be charged an additional $1.00 for syrup, which should be included in the french toast price. I've never been charged for syrup before? Food was delicious, arrived promptly, and our waitress was attentive without being disruptive. Part of me hopes that Ants Pants Cafe will become more of a Philly brunch fixture, but the other part hopes it will stay a secret so I don't have to wait for delicious brunch on the weekends.
