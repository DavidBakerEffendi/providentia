4.5 stars from me. Like other reviewers have said, I LOVED the duck meatballs!! I also had the risotto side dish which was unbelievable as well. The tasting of pork was decent and my gf had the skirt steak which was decent as well. We shared the key lime stuffed doughnuts, which were delicious. So overall, there were some really great dishes i.e. risotto,duck meatballs, doughnuts. And other dishes which were good but not great. I will come back though for the duck meatballs and risotto as well as to check out the other dishes on the menu!
