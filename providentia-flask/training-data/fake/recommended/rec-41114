The ramen here is to die for! Came for lunch today and actually did not have to wait! The place filled up within 10 minutes though. I got the pork bone ramen with spicy garlic oil and my friend got the soy ramen. She has been to Korea and Japan before and says this ramen is the closest to the real thing she's had in the states. I definitely recommend this place! Just be sure to bring cash because they don't take cards.
