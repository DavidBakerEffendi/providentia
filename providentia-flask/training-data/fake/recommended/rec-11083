This is my go to burrito place in Philly. It's more California Mexican than anything authentically Mexican (think a better tasting Chipotle or Qdoba). I like the fresh and flavorful ingredients and the price is on par with the not-so-tasty chains, so it's definitely a great place to go when you are in a rush and want something flavorful and slightly spicy. I've been coming to this place for 4 years and the only reason I didn't give this place a better rating is because the staff is just so rude and unfriendly. There are 1 or 2 people that I like, but the majority of them seriously need an attitude check.
