The food and environment are great, but it's a bit overpriced. Portions are generally quite small (not easy to share), except for the flatbreads (the pear/ gorgonzola one is very good!) The place is BYOB (no corkage fee) so you can easily make a meal more special here. I really liked this place and would definitely go again. I think it's best for a girl's night out, but there are many options here that make it suitable for dates / family events/ etc. I've had the brussel sprouts (very good!), fig tart (good), risotto (good but bland), and several other items on the menu. One thing I wish they would fix is that their bread is almost always served cold and is very hard. It would make a huge difference if it was warm! Also, be prepared to wait for a table. I don't think they take reservations in advance and the place is quite popular.
