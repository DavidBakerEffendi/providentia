Really one of the best meals I've had in the city. It's a local neighborhood spot for us, but tend to consider it a "treat" to go. The breakfast/brunch is great to tuck into especially during the weekdays if you have time. I love the eggs served with small fresh tortillas and homemade guacamole. The pork quesadillas were excellent to. We finally made it and sat at the bar for the tasting menu and splurged that night and got the wine pairing too ($32, I believe but well worth it if you can drink a ton of wine, they'll keep pouring it). The chef and sommelier really pay attention to what they're serving and work together on "pairings" checking in on the next course's ingredients vs. the grape. Each dish was better than the next--the chef is careful to listen to your likes/dislikes. We told him to serve up anything. He started us out with delightful seafood dishes and graduated to heartier meats, etc. before finishing us off with a light salad and dessert. A couple sat down next to us mid way through our meal and he began serving them an entirely separate menu which shows he really takes pride in offering Â these "tastings".
