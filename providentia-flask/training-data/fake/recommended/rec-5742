I liked the wishing well but I didn't LOVE the wishing well. The food was good but a little expensive for what you got. It was really crowded when I went with my friends and there were a bunch of bone-headed individuals having a SCREAMING MATCH across the bar. If I wanted to get into a bar rumble I'd go somewhere where I can get a $1.50 PBR. I'm giving my rating an extra star because the waitress was so nice. I will give this place another shot at some point, but for now 3 stars it is.
