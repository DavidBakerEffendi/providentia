Ate at Mercato with some girlfriends and appreciated how no one was pushy about us arriving in intervals on a weeknight after work. I got there a few minutes after the reservation and my friend had our table locked down with her bottle of wine already opened. Our other friend arrived about 20 minutes later after we'd ordered our appetizer. We started with the meatballs, which I thought were delicious. They were moist, had some yummy melty fontina cheese inside and were topped with a delicious red sauce. We each ordered something different for our entrees to share. - Pyramid pasta, t I found it fun and I could taste the seafood inside. - Fish special, honestly can't even remember what kind of fish but the outside had a great flavor and texture - Rabbit ravioli with nuts and ricotta special, (Easter bunny special!) it was good. We shared the molten chocolate cake for dessert. The flavor was a bitterweet chocolate which was yummy but I'm not even sure I could tell there was anything molten inside. It was a good ending, but not like OMG. I'd order all three entrees again. Everything was cooked well and by the time I ate, I had a great wine buzz going and we were enjoying our conversation, so the food was the perfect accompaniment to a great night. Didn't realize it was cash only - so 2 of us had to pop next door to the ATM. It was a great night with solid food. I'd definitely go back. Especially if you don't mind getting really really close to hear your friends or date over the noise vs. size of the place.
