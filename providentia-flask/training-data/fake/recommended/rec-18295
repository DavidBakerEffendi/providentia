Here's the update after eating the pork sandwich:  It's every bit delicious as I'd hoped.  My only critique is the peppers.  I didn't get the greens because frankly broccoli (rabe or any other sort) and I have a hate/hate relationship.  I got a mix of sweet and hot peppers and I wish I hadn't.  The peppers completely over powered the taste of the pork, provolone and bread.  After I took the peppers off the sandwich came alive.  I could still get the great flavors of the peppers and some of the heat, but with only the juice now seeping into the rest of the sandwich, all the flavors popped and complimented each other.   Get one.  Truth.
