Penelope gets better everytime! Went here on Saturday..obviously there was a wait - 35-40 minutes..which is not a big deal by Penelope standards. My mom's vegetarian so we both ordered veggie dishes to share.. she had the veggie burger and i ordered the spniach pie. the burger was really delicious, and quite the mouthful and yet flavoured well - not bland at all. The pesto mayo is really superb (i think they use something similar on the penny egg s/w). As for my pie - it was heavenly, something like a quiche but less yellow in colour, with lots and lots of spinach and lots and lots of richness... I highly recommend. So basically, somehow Penelope manages to make every single item on the menu flawless. Why don't increase their prices is beyond me ;-)
