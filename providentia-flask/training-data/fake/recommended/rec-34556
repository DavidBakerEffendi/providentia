I wanted to give this place 5 stars because the truffle popcorn alone is one of the best bar snacks I've tasted in awhile. The loss of a star comes in that there is this cocktail master but he is only there on certain nights and the night I went, he wasn't. Boo :( I'll keep trying to catch him, but why isn't this guy a full time employee? Lol
