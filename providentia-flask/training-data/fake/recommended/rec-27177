A year ago, my friends took me to some sort of korean grocery store to get even more drunk then we already were.  I don't particularly remember the soju, which makes me think it was very effective soju.   I never figured out what store it was until coming here today (sober) for some spicy boneless chicken and clear noodles with vegetables.  The get-it-yourself-on-a-cafeteria-tray Korean food is unmistakable, and definitely hits the already-ate-dinner-why- am-i-still-hungry craving.  they close at 3am everyday, so you can always get your fix of Korean goodness.   and yes, they're still selling soju.
