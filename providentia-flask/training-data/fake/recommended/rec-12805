I went to this place for dinner (breakfast for dinner can be fun) so I didn't have to wait too long before beeing seated. The food was, overall, very good. Props to the banana-walnuts pancakes! I think it was fairly priced Service was OK, I just regret they won't take cards for payment. LES has too few bank branches for that.
