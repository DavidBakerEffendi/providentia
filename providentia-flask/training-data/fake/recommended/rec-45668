Can't speak for the dinners as much, but the bar food is very greasy, usually gives me a stomach ache. The burgers are tasty, but have ordered medium and received very bloody! Bartenders are very nice, typical bar selection. I like the atmosphere in the bar and in the dining room. I would say have a nice dinner and skip the bar food and you'll enjoy your visit to the Venice.
