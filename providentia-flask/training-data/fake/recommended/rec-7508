Been ordering from here for over 6 years. They recognize my voice on the phone, which is probably a sign we eat too much pizza. They are always friendly, and the service is fast.  The crust is excellent. Very fresh salad. If you're tired of pizza, try the pasta with vodka sauce.  You may consider asking for less cheese on your pizza, as they put the amount which would be called "extra cheese" at other  places.
