A large group of us stormed our way into Pommes Frites (clearly the staff is used to it, as no amount of goading, needling or ribbing managed to faze "Jason", who was behind the counter taking orders and frying up frites at a furious pace) after a long night at Apothek√© and it was the perfect end to a smashing night out. I dipped my fries in both Rosemary Garlic Mayo and Parmesan Peppercorn sauce, and perhaps even a blue cheese somewhere in there, although I can't quite remember as the dress code at this place is "drunk." We each ordered different sauces and sort of tangoed our way from sauce to sauce. Yummy, yummy fries, a decent size and just the right amount of zing in the sauce to soak up barrels of previously consumed alcohol. I also somehow managed to become embroiled in a heated debate about the (perceived) lack of importance of the Canadian art collective Group Of Seven with an (alleged) oral & maxillofacial surgeon. I think the dude was full o' crap.
