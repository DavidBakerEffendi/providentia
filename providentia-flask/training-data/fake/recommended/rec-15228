Went last night with a large group. Chilled inside with some beers till an outside table was available. The beautiful weather and the atmosphere were great. Service was awesome... but the food... WOW. Fries and pickle sauce, Pittsburgh cheesesteak and a roasted pork sandwich with ricotta and avocado were the things I got to try and they were all amazing. Cheers ASB!
