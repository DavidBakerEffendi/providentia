WOW. Restaurant week is usually not fantastic but this truly was. Squid app in pesto, crispy pancetta sea bass and some chocolate cake with warm chocolate goo in the middle. I tasted everyones meal..Short rib ragu (8/10) Â For 35 bucks I thought it was well worth it. For what you get here, the regular menu is reasonably priced. The cheese pairings are special... although I can't recall the cheeses specifically one came with a chocolate carmel sauce that was delicious. Would definitely go again, and would definitely go for restaurant week.
