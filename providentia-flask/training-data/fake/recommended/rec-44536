Great Filipino food. Pork BBQ- very good Adobong Pusit (squid marinated in soy and vinegar) - amazing Ginataang Sitaw & Kalabasa(string beans & squash sautéed in coconut milk with shrimp) - excellent Kaldereta (beef stew) - masarap I have been here years ago with a friend and more recently have had take out and dinner with my Filipno Wife.  The food has always been excellent.
