You've got to be kidding me, this place is just... a dream! I was told by several Fishtown locals that I would fall in love with the crafty, artsy aspect of Sketch; I feel like they totally undersold the burgs! Toasted yummy bun with delicious and diverse burger patties (turkey. Kobe, beef or chicken breast for the meatheads and bean burger or seitan for the less inclined) plus I really value a place that has customizable toppings, fresh ingredients, juicy meat patties, and the option to add a fried egg on a burger. There's even a few different fry selections, like sweet potato or fried green chili cheese! I gobbled up a beef guy w cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, grilled onion and pickles with hand cut Belgian fries. And the sauces! I don't see anyone talking about these sauces! The Harrisa aioli AKA 40 cloves from hell, is the most amazing and garlic-slathered creation I've even consumed! The little chili kick is a perfect compliment to anything I will ever want to eat again. The fries were mere peasant sticks on which to further enjoy that aioli! I'm going to sample The Cyclops Burger next time! This is detailed as a burger w cheese, bacon and a friend egg all hanging out together; what glorious pain! There's a large, floor-to-ceiling chalk board that has updated specials with some pretty exciting stuff. Quite a few people around me ordered milkshakes, so I have my work cut out for me. Some customers ran in and out for just a shake or one of their baked desserts! This place seemed to be doing well, I sincerely want to make it back as soon as possible! More to explore at the fabulous Sketch!
