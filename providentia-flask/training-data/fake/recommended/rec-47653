First of all, top marks for the ambiance. Rustic, warm and refreshing, Buvette makes you feel like you're in a French farmhouse. It's a delight in the West Village. I sadly have to deduct a few stars because I was not impressed with the food. The waffle sandwich seemed popular, but it feel shy of my expectations. The waffle itself is perfect, but the combination with the honey, bacon, and egg surprisingly was not as savory as I had anticipated. Their tomato salad is pretty simple, with little heirloom tomatoes,, but it could have used some salt. The ginger soda was a bit flat, too. With the line and the bustling service, I was expecting outstanding food. The atmosphere was worth the visit, but I feel that the food could be better.
