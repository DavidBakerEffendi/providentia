We came for a party and were a slightly rowdy bunch, and while they handled us well, I'm still a little confused as to why they took my wine glass away.  They'd been topping us off throughout the meal and then suddenly took my glass, but others were still drinking.  A friend then pointed out that she had hers taken away an hour earlier.  I'm not sure if they "cut me off" (I WAS imitating the aliens from the War of the Worlds remake) or if we'd had a pre-determined number of bottles bought and we'd run out & I was on the losing end of it.  I don't know, but perhaps it was in my best interest. Now, the food is great!  I went way out of my comfort zone here & was rewarded for it.  I sampled mushrooms and Octopus (so good!) and Branzini!  All amazing and none of the stuff from the sea was too fishy.  The pizza was quite good, not the best, but very enjoyable.  My entree was some sort of Ragu Bolognese and it was very good.  Oddly, I'd say it was a touch greasy, but just the way I like it.   I'd been hearing about this Nutella Calzone thing for a while and when it didn't come out immediately I started to have a tantrum.  Ok, so the Vanilla Pannacotta is fine and all, but Nutella is what I LIVE for (ok, Nutella & steak).  And then it arrived.  Like a warm, precious baby on a tray and covered with powdered sugar (I'm not maternal).  People.  This is what life is all about.  This is what makes life worth living.  This is the most glorious regret and angry-feelings-the-next-day-when-you've-gained-3­lbs-overnight that you will ever have.
