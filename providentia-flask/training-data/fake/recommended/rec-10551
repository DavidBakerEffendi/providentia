Balthazar is such a beautiful room.  It is designed so meticulously to seem not designed at all, and they pull it off.  It really has atmosphere, there is always a tinge of excitement in the room.  I love the casual sophistication of the place, great place for meeting someone for brunch.  Food is good, but it's beside the point.  It has lost it's big time scene but I last time I was there, I saw a fat Alec Baldwin smoking and cursing at someone on his cell phone outside.  Ewww, I guess it's really lost it's scene.
