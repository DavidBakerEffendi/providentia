Fantastic date night spot, intimate setting, fantastic service and delicious plates! There's a small bar to wait at while you're table is made ready and the staff throughout the restaurant is exceptionally friendly and welcoming. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to guide our orders in exactly the right direction. The entrees lean towards smaller portions, but not in a bad way at all. We each ordered a snack portion, appetizer, and entree, with dessert being split and it was the perfect sized meal. I can't think of anything that would warrant less than five stars, I'd give it six if I could!
