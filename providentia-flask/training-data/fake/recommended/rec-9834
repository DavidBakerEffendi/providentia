From their website "Arepas" are: "a Venezuelan specialty. Corn based dish (wheat free), highly nutritional meal, split in half and filled with cheese, delicious meats, dressed with toppings. We offer great variety of tasty fillings." If you have never had arepas, which we hadn't either, you are in for a treat. To put it simply, they are a delicious meal in a "pocket." The arepas shells are made of crispy corn that somehow manage to be waterproof and house the filling beautifully until you chomp on the last bite. I ordered the Arepa Pabellon, which is filled with shredded beef, black bean, fried sweet plantains ad sprinkled with aged white cheese. Each is served with two sauces: a mild "green goddess" type of dressing and a HOT sauce. But what a feast for the palette! Every bite offered a different combination of flavors. The plantain really stands out as the flavor maker in this sandwich. My hub ordered the Pollo Mechado (shredded stewed chicken) and said that is was also delish. I just love it when I try something entirely out of my realm of experience. This place does not disappoint. Save some room for desert or order it to go, as we did. They have two choices: Torta tres Leches: three milk cake and Quesillo Creme caramel cake (Venezuelan flan) which was out of this world!!! The place is small, warm, and cozy, so try to come in the "off" hours. They do not take reservations. It is a little out of the way of the Manhattan eateries, but nothing like it exists in the "City." I am craving Arepas now....I wonder if they Fedex??
