I came here with a friend on a Tuesday night. Our server was very welcoming and recommended great dishes. We ended up ordering the grilled octopus salad, sheep milk dumplings and braised lamb shank. The grilled octopus salad was amazing. I have never tasted octopus this way before, it was very meaty and tender, not al all octopus-like. The braised lamb shank was decent, but it wasn't tender enough. My sheep milk dumplings were delicious, but a little heavy. I would come here again for just the octopus though!
