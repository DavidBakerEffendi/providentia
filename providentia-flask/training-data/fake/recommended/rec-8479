Let me start this review by saying that I think the food is the best thing about this place. The ceviche is always very fresh and well prepared. Tacos and burritos are great, try the goat! I can't say anything bad about their Â menu and the drink prices are right in line for a joint like this. $3 for a miller lite bottle, great! But...the service is horrendous. It's absolutely the slowest moving wait staff on the planet. The crazy thing to me is that there are always 1000 (obviously exaggerating a little) employees. This place is losing tons of money on drinks. On multiple occasions, my group would've ordered one or two more drinks but they were no where to be found. I've also experienced that I was able to order by second beer and it took 20 minutes to get it. Not cool Cantina, not cool at all. I like this spot a lot but the only time we go anymore is when we are grabbing last minute din. The is a fixable issue and I'd live to be blown away next time and have my mind changed.
