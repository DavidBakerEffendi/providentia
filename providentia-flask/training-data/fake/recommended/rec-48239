I've been coming here since I was a little kid. When someone has a problem with this place it is usually because they don't know what they're getting into. You order pizza by the pie, not slice. The pizza is also cooked well done so if that's not your thing then move on. That being said the food is always delicious. The staff is decent and the wait time is reasonable considering how busy they usually are.
