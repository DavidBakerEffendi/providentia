I've only been here three times, but every time I was the only customer. I'm not sure if that's good or bad, but service was very good lol. I usually order their gyro, fried eggplant and Greek fries. The gyro is always stuffed with all the goods. I always want more of the fried eggplant when I'm through. But the fries are just mediocre. This place is a little pricey compared to other Greek places in the area, but it's worth it.
