The roast pork hoagie was fantastic. But is it better then the Philly cheese steak? Absolutely not. It is definitely up there in my favorite edibles, but they just don't compare to each other. It's like apples to oranges. Â The pork was juicy and everything came together with the addition of the gravy. I've never had broccoli rabe before and my wife was worried that I wouldn't like it, turns out on this sandwich it is a welcome addition that worked with the flavor of the sharp provolone. Did I enjoy this? Very much. Will I be abandoning my Tony Lukes' Cheese steak? No. But it was damn tasty.
