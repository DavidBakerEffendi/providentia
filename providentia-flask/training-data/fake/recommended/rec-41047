Overall, very good experience. Nice decor and excellent service. A little loud but not so loud that I couldn't enjoy myself.  It was lively!  We had the lettuce wraps and calamari appetizer.  Both were very good.  The filling in the lettuce wraps had a nice hoisin sauce flavor. It was a tad salty.  The calamari was cooked perfectly and came with a nice dipping sauce.  It should have come with a little more but I didn't ask.  I'm sure they would have given me one if I asked.  I ordered the dragon roll, which was delicious.  My dinner mates had sushi too and they were pleased too.  The only thing I didn't love was the spicy tuna roll.  Otherwise, an excellent experience. I'd go back again.
