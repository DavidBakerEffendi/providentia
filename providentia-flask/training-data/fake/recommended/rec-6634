this place makes you want to be Caulky MacCaucasian--all Cape Cod-dy, white pants, silver coffee mug, fleece, volvo, loafers/new balance, and mayonaise to put on everything including the family labrador! this place is blue, not as in depressed like the little paxil cloud. the interior is pale blue. it's a small space not a ton of tables. it has a very warm/coolish-by-the-ocean feel to it. the food is comforting without being overly heavily. it very much has a pacifying feel to it but not in one of those con artist Â holistic mumbo jumbo ways. this is the real deal. i have had dinner and brunch here a bunch. chicken meatballs, mac-n-cheese (white cheese, i believe--nothing like the chester cheetos ORANGE about this pasta and fromage), artichoke dip, etc. are in perfect portions and very delicious, especially the chicken meatballs with pesto! the curry chicken salad is badass, but may not be everyone's cup of chai tea. grilled cheese, the BLT, and the chicken meatball sub on a baguette is rockin'. the red velvet cake and cookies-n-milk are nice ways to sweeten the ending moments of your dinner. this place is good for a light dinner date and it can accomodate a fairly large group of 6 people at some tables. the theme to this restaurant should be: "Blue his house With a blue little window And a blue corvette And everything is blue for him And his self And everybody around 'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen... I'm blue, da ba de, da ba die Da ba de, da ba die"
