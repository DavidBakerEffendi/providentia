These dumplings are tasty, but what makes them special is their price. Super cheap, as all the reviews point out. It was below 30 degrees when we went there on a Sunday afternoon, and the place was still packed. There are six places to sit along the wall - that's it. We ate in, but take out is probably best. All in all, you can't beat their prices. 50 dumplings for 10.00.
