We found this place on Yelp when randomly found ourselves in TriBeCa on a fine Sunday morning. From the outside, it look more like a place for a romantic dinner rather than for brunch. The interior is decorated with wooden furniture and lit with candle lights finished with dark color curtain. We didn't have a reservation but got a seating for brunch right away and got to order after a little while of waiting and enjoying their delicious biscuit. Per our waiter's recommendation, we ordered (asian-style?) chilli lobster and egg benedict which we enjoyed immensely. The lobster was tender, almost indistinguishable in texture from the baked egg it came with. The dish was subtly spicy and slightly creamy. I think was a great combination of harmonious texture of comfort food and vibrant flavor. For our egg benedict, the perfectly cooked poached eggs (almost like sous vide egg texture-wise) were contrast with crispy proscuittos which add much flavor to the dish. Overall I think the food is top-notch and the service was excellent. The portion size is too not large (which is what I like for brunch) and each bite is so full of flavor. It's a relatively expensive brunch for us but totally worths it. I am looking forward to coming back here again for more of their delicious culinary inventions for special occasions :).
