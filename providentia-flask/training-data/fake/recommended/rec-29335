The beer selection is spot on but the liters are pricey$$$, I guess you pay for the atmosphere. They should have at least 1 domestic beer like Yuengling and charge $8 for a liter, that would be a good alternative. But I know, it's a Starr restaurant and he controls the scene. Â I found the food to be quite good, I liked the brats and fries. The kids were kept occupied as well with the games. I would love to see more live music here in the spring and summer, I think an OOMPA band on Saturday and Sunday afternoons in the summer would be perfect with rotating ecclectic bands at night.
