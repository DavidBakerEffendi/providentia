I don't know if this place is overrated. I don't know if it's *reallyreallyreally* the most authentic Chinese beef noodle soup. But I love Nan Zhou hand drawn noodles and that is enough for me to know. The broth is really satisfying and that the noodles are extra springy since you can watch them being made. Anytime I ask for the first thing on the menu - which would traditionally be the 'simplest' of all menu items - I receive a good, delicious portion of all these cuts of beef. Sharing tables with other customers, the Chinese TV in the background, sitting on generic furniture, and being hunched over my bowl makes me think I'm actually at a small storefront in Asia. I gladly give NanZhou five stars any day because it's authentic enough for me.
