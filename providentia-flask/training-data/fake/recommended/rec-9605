This place is a favorite for my coworkers and I to venture to when were craving some especially delicious food and a great old school atmosphere. It's exactly what you think of when you imagine a New Jersey/New York Jewish deli- and I mean that in the best way possible. Family owned and has been around since "before you were born." The sandwiches are out of this world and I plan to make my way through the entire menu. Can't wait to come back again and try the desserts!
