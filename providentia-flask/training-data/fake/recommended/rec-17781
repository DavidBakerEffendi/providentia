Good place and my girlfriend would give it 4 stars but a bit too frou-frou for me. I'm a meat and potatoes kinda guy and when I go into what I'm thinking is an Italian style local bar I'm expecting some basics. When I order olives as an appetizer, I'm not expecting "citrus zest, rosemary, [or] fennel seed" (especially citrus zest). I just want olives. And when I'm looking to eat a hearty Meatball sub, I'm not expecting jalape√±os or whatever spicy peppers were in it. Don't get me wrong, I do native spicy Indian food and barely break a sweat, but that's not what I'm looking for in a Meatball sub. It just seems typical of many restaurants these days that they go over the top w/ exotic ingredients to try to differentiate themselves and the end results, for a meat and potatoes kinda guy like me, is a place I'd like to give 4 stars to but can only give threee because its a style that just misses with me. That said, if you're into this kind of food, go for it. The atmosphere is great, the staff works hard and the food, while not to my personal tastes, is well prepared and cooked.
