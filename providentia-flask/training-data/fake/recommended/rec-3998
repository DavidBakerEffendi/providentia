This was really good.  The Vegetarian Platter was excellent (minus the very average hummus...i was disappointed) and the Lamb Kebab was crazy good.  Do NOT eat those green peppers they put on top that look like sliced green peppers, unless you can handle the hottest of the hot.  Painful.  Otherwise, service was eh, I felt a little rushed, but I'll be back.  Very very reasonable for excellent food in nyc.
