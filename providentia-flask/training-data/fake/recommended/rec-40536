Grabbed a quick late lunch here while traveling for business in the area. Pop in and order a sandwich from the counter or select premade items from the cooler. The sushi and asian noodles I selected were fresh and hit the spot. This place also hits the jackpot on snacks. If you are hungry and don't have time to sit in a restaurant and don't want connivence store style food than Old Nelson Food Company will hit your sweet spot and quench your thirst. Great selection of fancy sodas and juices. Several tables and chairs outside on the patio to chow down. Not on the chairs ... on your purchase.
