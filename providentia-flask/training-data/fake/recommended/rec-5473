This place was literally EMPTY.  No one sitting at their tables or bar and we got denied a table because we didn't have reservations and they were "all going to be filled in 30 minutes."  We could've finished an ENTIRE MEAL in 30 minutes!  Oh well, we didn't get to try their over-sauced, over-priced rolls!
