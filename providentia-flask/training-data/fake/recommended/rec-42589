LOVE! My friend and I were wandering the streets of Chinatown and came across this gem! I usually judge a place by it's outside, and i'm glad I did this time. Service was great, the lady that helped us was very friendly and very helpful as we were new. Get the mango yogurt drink. I thought it was going to be disgusting but after tasting my friends, I fell in love. Even got an extra one to drink around the city. We got Appetizers, Ramen and Dessert. I asked the waitress which Ramen was the best, and she pointed me towards Terakawa Ramen which is their signature. I was beyond pleased. It looked a little funny at first, and when I sent a photo of it to my mom she asked if I was eating Pigeon egg. (It's not... it's just a little bit of soy sauce!) The noodles were awesome, the broth was amazing, ah, it was just so tasty. Wish they did have a few more bamboo shoots though, love those things. The pork was also cooked well and was mighty tasty. For appetizers we split: Shrimp Tempura Shu Mai - which was better than I ever imagined. mmm. SO good. Gyoza - Pan fried. Perfect. Pork Buns - my friendly gobbled them up but said they were the shining star of the meal. Tender and delicious. Karaage Chicken - incredible with the spicy mayo that comes with it. We also got mochi for dessert. I would probably skip the Red Bean Mochi, as we felt it didn't have enough flavor but the mango was out of this world. I will definitely be back.
