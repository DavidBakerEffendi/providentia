Ate here last week, it was my first time having shabu. We got the basic setup as recommended by the waiter. When they brought everything out, it was quite confusing, but the waiter was very unpretentious, and gave us the run down despite him being very busy. A big complaint is that there was no AC in the place, and all the cooking at the table creates a lot of steam, which made us very sweaty. Make sure you get the selected prime rib-eye beef slices, not the normal... we got both, and it was a world of difference. So much more tender!! (though the weight conscious at out table liked the normal just cause it had less fat marbling)
