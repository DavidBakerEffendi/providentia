I've enjoyed meals here since 2011, as well as tapas in the cozy bar area. From the beginning it was clear that quality products were at the forefront of chef Luis Bollo's kitchen. My last meal there was truly spectacular. The gazpacho with lemon granita was heavenly. The razor clams were fresh and delicious. The embutidos like jamón ibérico and the chistorra were as good as it gets (in the US). The shrimp dish was not  made from the same shrimp-farm shrimp you're most likely to come across. They were true prawns! These were ridiculously flavorful without much need for anything else. The conejo (rabbit) with AMAZING fresh meaty scallops in an unforgettable tasty rice dish. Desserts are all very worthy of a try. The charming staff is knowledgeable about the food and wine. I've never been steered wrong. If you're not familiar with the gastronomy of Spain, do yourself a favor and have the servers suggest a few courses (or all) and enjoy it with the beverage that the Spanish enjoy their dinners with WINE!! Never sangria.... The place is decorated lovingly, apparently by the owners wife with flowers galore. The tables are far enough apart that I never felt that I could had been a guest at my neighbor's table, as I do in so many of NYC great restaurants. Particularly at those 'food temples", which I only go to once, kicking and screaming, never to return. I'm talking to you Pastis and Morandis, among others. Salinas on the other hand is a gastronomic delight, enjoyed in peace and comfort.
