Can I give this review more than 5 stars? The food was just so good beyond words! I saw a few reviews about this place being overrated before coming there, but after my first bite of the blueberry pancake I was convinced that it was the best pancake I've ever tasted. So fluffy! And so perfect! The maple butter is the stuff dreams are made of, and the eggs benedict was an explosion of flavors in my mouth.. The hollandaise and the biscuit was absolutely perfect. I've never known that brunch could be this good!
