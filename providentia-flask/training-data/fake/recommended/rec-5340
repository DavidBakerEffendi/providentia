Been going to plenty of starr's restaurants throughout the years and im very disappointed in the service I received on a Wednesday night.  Ordered the steak frittes, which I tend to order at continental in olde city, and it took about 45 minutes to get the food, which is rare.  It wasn't even all that busy. It came out with double the amount of fries and about half the amount of steak I am used to. I ordered it medium and it came out well done.  I will go back to olde city to get the frittes from now on.  I will give this place benefit of the doubt, but cmon, its the same dish as olde city, this shouldn't happen, you guys are much better than this!!!
