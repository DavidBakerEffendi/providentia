Let me just say this - I'm southern; I know grits, and Char No. 4's seriously disappointed me. I can tell they use good quality grain, but they were SO unforgivably under-seasoned, along with the rest of my dish. Our server was kind of absent, so I considered 3 stars, but gave 4 because the rest of the food and drink we ordered was so good I smacked my palms on the table and scared our neighbors. We went for brunch around 1 and it was a mad house--for good reason. They have an incredible wall packed with every kind of whiskey you never knew existed, and they know how to use 'em. I had a brilliant bourbon cocktail with grapefruit juice, mint, lime, and honey. My date had the bourbon mary, and the pork sandwich with AMAZING mustard BBQ sauce, and baked beans that put my Texan dad's to shame (sorry, dad!). This girl will be back, y'all.
