After an entire day of walking the icy streets of an eerily empty Manhattan in mid-January, we decided it was time to find a place for dinner.  We were walking along Canal and It was still early, but I promised my girlfriend we would find a good place within half an hour so we could fill our stomachs and empty our bladders... ...forty minutes later we're at a bar.  I'm having a beer and pretending to watch the game on tv while our brains defrost and we come up with a better plan.  Yeah, we'd passed a bunch of places, but no, we (I) were not satisfied with the menu, ambiance, whatever... ...later still, after having stumbled across an awesome used books store in SoHo, we're walking east 'cause I'm positive we'll bump into this Mexican place I'd walked by with a friend a month earlier.  I guess my brain has frozen up again, 'cause my girlfriend asks if what I'm looking for is Barrio Chino and I say with great conviction "Yes!" Needless to say I was wrong, but Barrio Chino turned out to be a good choice.  The welcoming ambiance and tasty dark rum mojito makes for good combo to start the evening.  Add in their sweet and flavorfull ceviche, and chips with a good guacamole and you feel ready for a new take on a traditional Mexican dish to top it all off. Unfortunately, the main course did not follow expectations.  The rice that accompanied my otherwise tasty tuna was boring, while my girlfriend's enchiladas de mole was a bit more exciting. Not great Mexican food, but good starters and tasty.  Recommended if you're in the neighborhood.
