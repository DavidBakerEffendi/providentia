Revamped and relocated from their smaller location, Kefi, now on the Upper West Side, still offers quality Greek and Mediterranean faire that rival anything from their more expensive counter parts. They used to have trouble with limited seating for the crowds of hungry diners, but now there are more than 130 seats, a new brunch and lunch menu, and a Kefi Burger which is made with a beef and brisketpatty, and sandwiched between ciabatta. Definitely go for the addition of feta.
