I gave this restaurant a two star rating because of how slow and bad their service is. I ordered a grilled chicken salad from there on a sunday they told me it will take about 10-15 minutes I got there in 15 minutes I had to wait a total of 35 minutes for a salad. They also do not answer their phone it took 4 tries to get someone to answer. their food is decent but not good enough to wait 35 minutes for. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!! Unless you have plenty of time to kill.
