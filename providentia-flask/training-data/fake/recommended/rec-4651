Disclaimer: I have never had authentic Cuban food. We switched our reservation around numerous times (including a few hours before the actual meal) and had no problems. Soul de Cuba is fairly small inside, but very comfortable. Â Service was very attentive and our waiter was charming . We had the ceviche app which was delicious. I had the 'pollo soul de cuba.'. The mango salsa was perfect with the fried chicken, and everything was cooked to perfection. This is one of the best meals I have had in a restaurant recently and I would definitely recommend it.
