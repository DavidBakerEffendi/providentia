Really fantastic dining experience. Authentic Mexican food - no chimichangas, gorditas or other faux Mexican food. Their guacamole is the best I've ever had, and it's one of my favorite foods. I got the enchiladas mole, and it did not disappoint one bit. Prices for lunch do not exceed $15 too! You gotta try it out!
