One of my favorite restaurants, Cafecito strikes the perfect balance of casual atmosphere, delicious food, and reasonable prices.  This is a regular of mine for both delivery and eating out, and I have very little negative to say. The prices are quite reasonable--most of the entrees are around $13, and the appetizers are very reasonable.  The interior is unpretentious and comfortable.  Tables are close together, but generally the space is adequate.  While weekend evenings can get a bit crowded, you can usually get a table without to long a wait. The food is fantastic.  Favorites are the Churrasco, Vaca Frita, and Masitas De Puerco.  Appetizers are all good, although Empanadas and Papa Rellena are highlights.  The tostones are a standout among the sides, mainly because of the delicious garlic sauce. While a little out of the way if you don't live by Alphabet City, the next time you find yourself nearby I recommend stopping by.
