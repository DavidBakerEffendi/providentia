Finally went to try this place after some late night drinking.  Line wasn't long, I got the combination on rice and pita bread for only $6.  I put on some white sauce, some BBQ sauce, and literally only a few drops of their infamous hot sauce.  I knew better cause I read and heard so much about their hot sauce, so figured I should go light for the first time. Mixed it all up together and started chowing it down.  Oh boy!  With no exaggeration, my tongue felt like it's burning, and tears started coming outta my eyes.  Yet, it was sooooooo good and I couldn't stop putting more in my mouth.  Both the chicken and gyro are really tasty; their rice is smaller and a little drier than the other halal carts.  Along with the lettuce and pita bread, all go very well together.  That's the best halal food I've tried!
