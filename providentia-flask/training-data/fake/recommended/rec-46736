For Chinese takeout, this is the best place in the Woodbridge area.  We have gotten food from here several times and it has always been better than we had anticipated.  The vegetables are always fresh, not overcooked.  The place is clean and the staff is friendly.  I wouldn't say their English is the best but at least they try.  :)
