The majority of reviewers have praised the prices and have touted the establishment as such a memorable dining experience. When I searched Yelp for Brazilian steak restaurants 'Churrascaria', Villa Brazil Cafe came up as the most well reviewed by number of reviews and highest grades in the form of stars. When I walked in, I was initially very enthralled with the decor and layout but upon reaching the buffet area, I was a little perplexed as to the process of helping myself to a plate and how the paying/pricing was to be handled. The buffet was very welcoming in amazingly fresh looking food colors and how the large serving plates were piled and stacked with options galore, so I dug right in. Brazilian BBQ was on my mind and the sign for the options in the left read corner of the cafe did not deliver to me a clear cut idea of what was available. I stacked my plate high with many items that passed the eye test with flying colors, but were less appealing to my pallate. The veal was tough, some cuts of beef suffered the same charge however the sause's and juices they were sitting in had loads of flavor, so go heavy on the liquid at the trays bottom. One full, but shy of heaping plate, non salad bar ran $13 and change, I do not see that as an amazing deal, but price for food value is relative. My 2nd time up, I did try the BBQ portion, the hangar steak was excellent as was the sausage but the sirloin and ....sorry, I forgot my other choice, was old, tough and really poor quality.
