Some would argue that a review of a place experienced while completely wasted should be invalidated because of bias or some kind of lack of clarity. I would argue that those people are morons. I landed here after my colleague and I had just been dethroned as beer pong champs at Off The Wagon. Our five game winning streak now snapped, we needed a break from the relentless chugging of beer and we sought out nourishment. She has promised me that Corner Bistro was indeed "all that" and I was willing to give it a shot. When we arrived, we waited for a good twenty minutes in line for a table until we spotted an opening on the bar and seized it like a disputed territory. I don't recall us asking for beer, but the bartender served us each beers with our burgers and fries (and I think he hooked us on the fries by only giving us two orders for three people), but goddam that was a burger. It comes out a bit small and covered in cheese (as if the cheese was scared of leaving and decided to attach itself to all of the meat). It was juicy, moist, and oh so flavorful that even a drunk man like myself could savor the flavor of the meat. The fries, crispy and crunchy, accompanied the burger perfectly and reminded that some food combinations are simply too perfect (pb&j, burgers and fries, burritos and Corona, etc.). When we left here, we were still staggering. Granted most of that was the booze still in our system. But I definitely remember the satisfaction that coursed its way through my veins after finishing that burger. It was a slice of sinful delight. And if loving that burger is wrong, I don't wanna be right.
