Ok so a nice spot for a lunch date or even dinner. I am sort of hard on this review because I came in at 2pm and the service is extremely slow and the server was accommodating but not very friendly. On the other hand the food was good and reasonable. Â burger, fries and an appetizer for 17 bucks... In New Haven county???
