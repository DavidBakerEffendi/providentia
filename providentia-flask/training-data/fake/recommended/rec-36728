The best French fries ever!! I don't know you but I love a big piece of rare meat with French fires and this place makes both REALLY good. One time made the mistake to order some salmon in puff pastry - was OK... never again. Great wine list from reasonable to in-debt-for-life. Desserts are OUT OF THIS WORLD - order profiteroles for yourself and ask your companions to get something else so you can taste theirs. Â  View is great and fun and lively. Service is very good too - make sure the lady that seems to have come out of The Incredibles takes care of you - she's excellent and French ;) Ahh... make your reservation if you don't want to spend 1 hour+ outside.
