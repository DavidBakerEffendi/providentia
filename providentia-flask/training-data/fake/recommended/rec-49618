Vegan or not, you should definitely give these guys a shot.  Their rolls are fantastic, all the ingredients are fresh and bursting with flavor!  The Mighty Mushroom roll was fantastic, as well as their Spicy Mang roll (which apparently is their most popular roll).  Be sure to ask about their monthly special!  Their salads and rice paper wraps also looked very good, but I haven't tried them yet. They also have freshly made juices with no additional sugar.  I've had their watermelon mint lemonade (very nice on a hot summer day) and their blueberry lemonade (which is perfectly tart and has some blueberry pieces in it). I highly recommend this place to anybody looking for something a little bit different.  It is a cozy, but not cramped, place on a relatively quiet piece of 14th St.  A cute place to bring a date for lunch. Last time I went, I met Guy, the owner and executive chef.  We discussed how he got started, and what some of his ideas for the future were.  The man definitely focuses on quality.  They are 100% vegan now, but when they first opened a few items were not vegan.  I asked about what the non-vegan ingredients were, and Guy explained how he used to make his own mayo for some of the rolls' sauces, but with the move toward a 100% vegan menu he experimented with several different types of tofu before finding a good substitute for egg in the mayo.  A little bit of obsessive perfectionism is a great trait in a chef, and I hope this review has convinced you to patronize this restaurant so that they can stay in business and maybe open a location in HK so that I won't have to venture so far!
