Have never eaten here, so this review pertains only to the bar. Huge selection of bourbon, whiskey, and scotch. You can have an affordable one oz. tasting pour if you want to try something new, and there is something in everyone's price range. The bartenders on weekdays are very friendly and talkative (and usually attractive). The bar, as to be expected, is packed on weekends, so I generally avoid it then. All in all, it's one of my favorite bars in Brooklyn.
