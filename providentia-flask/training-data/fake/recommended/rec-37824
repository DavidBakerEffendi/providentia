This place was o.k.  Nothing really extraordinary, maybe an off night for them.  I had a jalapeno-chocolate blend that was middle of the road.  The music wasn't anything fun and there didn't seem to be much atmosphere.  The goings on in the street were more lively than this place.  The hostess didn't seem too interested in us.  So we had our one glass of wine then left.  With so many cooler spots why bother...
