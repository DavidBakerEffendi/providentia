With its outrageously seductive menu and the lovely rustic/chic room it is understandable why this place was an instant success.  Always had a great time whether sitting at the chef's bar or at a table and will definitely try the patio when the weather breaks.  The rabbit and sweetbreads definitely my kind of dishes but I do have a problem with 12 inch pizzas for 19, 20 and 22 dollars especially since the ribeye fiorintina for two comes in at $35.00? The food is always just barely too rich though usually very well prepared. If Vetri has become the darling of the region's culinary scene, he is probably the pinup of the area's realtors for single handedly jump starting the north of broad real estate market.  And if watching Jeffrey Lurie double park his Mercedes one cold evening to run in and pick up is any indication of patron loyalty, Osteria will be here for a long time.
