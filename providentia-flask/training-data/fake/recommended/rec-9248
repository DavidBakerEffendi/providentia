Yummy, I love you lucky peach! First time I came: Had the Lemon Grass Chicken with the noodles, perfect summer time Sunday afternoon late lunch.  Light, flavorful, and filling.  Couldn't get better Send time: Ssam--with pork (duh of course I LOVE pork), it was good, but I didn't dig the kim chee, I think maybe I'm just not a fan.  The rest of it was great though. Cannot wait to go back, enjoy!
