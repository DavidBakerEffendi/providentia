Continental Midtown is definitely one of my favorite restaurants anywhere. I've been to the one in Old City, as well as the one in Atlantic City, but this one is the best. Sure it's got a somewhat cheesy atmosphere, but I really enjoy it. I've been there for every possible meal time.  Brunch is my favorite though. I've never had a problem with the service and I like the uniforms.  It makes it seem like it probably isn't as awful to work there as other restaurants of similar quality. I'm not too into crowds, so I didn't love it during the Friday/Saturday night party time. Also the hanging chairs are kind of annoying so, as fun as they seem, I would recommend sitting at a "normal" table. The two way mirror in the bathroom is also kind of odd. I would recommend the string fries and the breakfast quesadilla.
