I haven't had the chance to dine at this establishment however we have gotten take out several times.... Delicious!!!!!! On my top ten list of Indian Cuisine! Korma, masala, naan, samosas! Yum yum and yum Can't wait to go back and try something new! I also like you can specify the heat. Medium is what I prefer!
