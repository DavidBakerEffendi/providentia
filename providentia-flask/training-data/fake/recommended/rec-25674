Nice little find in Old City. We came here based on Yelp reviews looking for a cocktail lounge for drinks before our late dinner reservation elsewhere. Yelp did not steer us wrong. It's a small cozy joint. Good ambience, has an old school international vibe to it. Check out the coffered ceiling. We were able to score a 2 place high top across from the bar at 6 on a Saturday. There are some booths in the back. The place filled up as we were there. The drink menu is interesting and different. Wifey was very happy with the French Snap. I had a Classic Margarita and a Dark and Stormy. Both were tasty and easy drinking, but I feel like they were a little light on the liquor. Maybe it's just me. Drinks were about $10 each. It's not cheep, but pretty much expected prices for a downtown bar. Another nice thing is it wasn't loud. I don't remember if there was background music at all. There was lots of bar noise from the other patrons but it was pleasant and not overwhelming like other places where you have to shout to hear the people you are with. Wifey and I were able to have a nice conversation. One thing we were confused about is if you were supposed to go up to the bar if sitting at the table. We entered, sat down, waited a bit. We were discussing if I should just go up to the bar when the bartender came over to get our order. Then the place got busy and we didn't get any attention until a second bartender came on and checked on us. When we were ready to leave we has to flag down the bartender for the check. Maybe I'm getting too used to table service. I dunno.
