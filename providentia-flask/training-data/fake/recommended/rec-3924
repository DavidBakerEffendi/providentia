All I can say is that the owners of this place were striving for awesome. And they nailed it. The food is top notch, especially the eggs Benedict and the French toast. I love the waiting room in the back near the bathrooms, ad I love the souvegnier soaps cascading across the wall in the water closet. The only thing leaving something to be desired was the service, but I hesitate to generalize to the entire staff since I keep getting the same braindead, Prozac dumpster of a waitress. I'm gonna keep going though because this is on eplace where the food and decor make up for the service. Ps: get a bloody Mary
