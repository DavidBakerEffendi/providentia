The penne chicken was great! It had the perfect balance of cream and sauce. It also helped that it was cheap (think it was $12?). The bread was burnt on the crust but I still liked it anyways because the oil (or whatever oily thing they put on it) gave it a good flavor. And I probably also liked it because I'm a carb fanatic. The mint tea was surprisingly good, very refreshing. Bill came out to $30 for 2 people, which I think is pretty Â cheap. Definitely would return!
