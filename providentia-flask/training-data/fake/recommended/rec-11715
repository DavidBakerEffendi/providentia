Service was questionable; the food was okay. I know this is a popular brunch spot, but we arrived pretty early, at about 10:30 on a Sunday. They first tried to seat us right by the door (it was cold that day), so we asked to be seated further back, and they squeezed us into a corner with a tiny table. I got the duck confit hash, which was okay. The sunny-side up eggs on top of it were pretty overcooked. The potatoes in the hash could have been a little crispier, and I felt there could have been more duck (after all, that's why I'm paying $15 for this entree instead of the $10 for the rest of the entrees, right?). My friend got the spinach and goat cheese croissant, which she enjoyed, but her sunny-side up eggs were pretty undercooked. The whites hadn't set. She asked to get them more cooked, and the waiter stuck the eggs under a broiler-- but then brought them back warm and with the whites still runny! Our waitress then got an attitude with us-- "Well, this comes with sunny-side up eggs, which are supposed to be runny." Okay lady, we know what a sunny-side up egg is, but we're not trying to get salmonella, so please don't get an attitude. They finally just replaced the eggs, but it was more complicated than it should have been.
