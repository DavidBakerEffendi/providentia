a cute west village spot for small groups. the menu was small but everything we ordered - which we all shared - was super tasty. the short ribs were real tender. the pasta was spot-on. the bracciola was very light, yet flavorful. the atmosphere is what you expect from a west village spot - cozy and hip.
