This is the first time I'm taking the time to write a review since I've been here numerous times and have yet to be disappointed. The combination of food, service, and decor is what makes this place so special. Great ambience and great energy from the staff. I love almost every dish on the menu. My all time favorite drink is their 'Sipping Emotions' drink. So good!!!^^
