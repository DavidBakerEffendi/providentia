My coworkers and I visited this spot at least once a week! Their lunch specials are amazing and the portions are filling! Their French onion soup is the best around. Burgers are huge and tasty. Sometimes they offer the chicken pot pie and it's so good! The gravy on it is so delicious. Love love love this place!
