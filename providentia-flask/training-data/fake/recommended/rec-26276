Medium priced, but excellent food and service! Started with (free) appetizer of fried fish (very delish), and then all these sides came out with a bowl of rice each! Free refills on all the sides (kimchi, kale, turnip, etc), but $2 per bowl of rice. Unfortunate, but expected. The food itself (galbi and daeh ji bulgogi) was superb. At first it seems like a little, and then you start eating it and you're already full before you eat half of it. It's like magic! Or maybe just all the scrumptious kimchi... Steaming hot coming out, so just put it on the cold kimchi, and you got yourself a little bite of heaven! Went with 10 people, very accomodating (quickly moved tables around, rearranged utensils for us). It was like 11:00pm, but the food came out just as fast as normal speed.
