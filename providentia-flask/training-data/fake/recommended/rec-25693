This is the second place I ate at when I visited Philadelphia before moving there. The soup here is absolutely delicious. I've tried my fiancee's various soups and they've all been great, but I can't pull myself away from the roast pork soup with the hand pulled noodles. The texture of the noodles is great and you're lucky to finish the bowl. At least you can take it home. My fiancee has gotten the shaved noodles and they are also very good. They have pretty decent appetizers (cucumbers in garlic, lamb skewers, sauteed vegetables, dumplings) as well and their smoothies and bubble tea are some of the best in Chinatown, with their taro and vanilla(!!!) smoothies being particularly good. It can be quite packed, but if you go for lunch you may be the only person in there, so the noise and level of service can vary, but I'm not going to complain. Either way, the food is always delicious. It is very cozy for a lunch spot or a place to run to to get out of a cold night. Nothing better than enjoying a nice hot bowl of flavorful broth perfumed with roast pork and cilantro after dredging through a night of snow and frozen wind. All this for quite the paltry sum. I'm currently not in Philadelphia, but I'm very much looking forward to going back here and having cold noodles when I go back. That is... if I can pass on the roast pork soup.
