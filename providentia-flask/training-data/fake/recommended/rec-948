After much anticipation, we finally decided to give this place a try. The coconut calamari is nicely battered but many of the pieces were stuck to each other. The spicy basil noodles were very well prepared and had a decent amount of spiciness to them. We also had beef pad chilli..... This dish sucked! The beef was overcooked and the veggies were bland. The service here is relatively lousy but the drinks were great. Would I come back? Yes.... The "late night in Bangkok" won me over. We had the flourless chocolate cake with green tea ice cream.... It was a good attempt at an "Asian restaurant classic". They should've been safer and did the lava cake instead. Hopefully next time they will do a better jobswith the service. Would've loved to been asked to order a second a drink.
