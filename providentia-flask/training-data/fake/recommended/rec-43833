This might be my new favorite place in the whole wide world. I walked in having never heard of it before, and not knowing what to expect or order. I settled on the first item on the menu - the Chicken Thigh Wrap. The gentleman who rang me up was friendly and funny and I liked him immediately. Good sign #1. I paid for my food and decided to dine in. They began to cook the food to order. Good sign #2. The place smelled like your Grandmother's kitchen (if your Grandmother is/was a good cook). Good sign #3. After about a 12 minute wait, the wrap came out. The chicken was cooked perfectly. It was warm. The cabbage was tender, the onions were perfectly pickled and the tomatoes were fresh. The mayo and sauce was good. Indescribable. I have no idea what it was, but I'm certain that the wrap wouldn't have been nearly as great without it. It also came with a surprise pickle. Even that tasted awesome. Seriously. Go there. Get that, but I'd bet money that the rest of the menu would measure up just the same.
