So I've tried this place twice now.  First time I had the Thai red curry which was pretty good. The second time in had the Chef's sushi sampler which was The second time though, I had a Yuengling which wasn't very cold,  so I asked to change it to a Magic Hat No. 9 which the bartender did promptly and politely. It was kinda warm too. Hopefully that was a once off.
