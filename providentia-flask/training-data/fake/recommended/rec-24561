The food is solid- dips are good, great salads and fish.  But there is such an apparent management problem, it ends up overshadowing the dinner.  I've been twice now- long delays between courses, harried waitresses, we were given someone else's food both times.  You ask for a second glass of wine and 20 minutes later you tell the waitress to forget it.  I don't know, is the food worth it?
