Being a recent transplant to Woodside, I had been looking for good restaurants in my neighborhood. My fiance had walked by and glanced at the menu, and told me to check it out. After taking a look at the menu myself I knew I had to come. as everyone says the popcorn you get to start is some of the best I have ever had. Whoever thought of popping in bacon fat was a genius. and even better was that our waitress refilled the bag twice! after that we had the yellowtail, the foie gras, the pork belly (not currently on the menu, the oxtail , fried chicken, and the steak. in ascending order of awesomeness Steak Fried chicken Foie gras Yellowtail Oxtail Porkbelly My fiance would probably flip the yellowtail and the Foie gras, but I am the one writing the review. Anywho... everything was great so don't think that the steak being on the bottom wasn't very good; it just wasn't as phenomenal as the rest of them. i could go on and on about the different aspects of each dish, but that would take forever, I am at work., and they don't like me not doing work when I should be. needless to say if you get the chance, go. It will be worth your time.
