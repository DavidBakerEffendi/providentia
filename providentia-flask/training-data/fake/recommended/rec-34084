SERVICE Â - we went in at a time when there weren't that many patrons and still took forever to be seated. food also took much longer than expected to come out, even when we specifically asked for food to come out as it was done. will say that the server was quite friendly, but doesn't make up for the rest of the lackluster experience. FOOD - about 133% overpriced. at this price point there are better options. mexican margherita pizza - concept is intriguing (salsa, bacon, jalapeno), execution less so -- not fresh mozarella, salsa was blah (drowned out the other tastes), etc. meatloaf - supposedly a signature dish. this one was pretty good, but the fries it came with were supposed to be truffle fries, although there was no taste of truffle anywhere. fried chicken & waffles - warned ahead of time that it would take ~30 minutes; not worth the wait. waffles were soggy. anyway, will not be coming here again.
