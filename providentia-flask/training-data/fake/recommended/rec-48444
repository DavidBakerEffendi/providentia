I am going to be a regular at this place and luckily they are on 38th&Broadway thrice a week and its just 4 blocks walk for me. Well about the food, quite delicious, flavorful. I had the Lemon Chicken Sandwich and the Chicken Rice (had a Groupon deal today and got both these for 6 bucks which was heck of a steal). The chicken tasted nice and had some kind of seasoning, probably Moroccan and had a nice different flavor. The rice was nicely cooked, caramelized onions and veggies on side were pretty good. The sandwich had more or less same contents and enjoyed it a lot. The best part was although its a meat truck it ain't greasy and will give the greasy ones a run for taste. The spicy sauce is pretty nice too. Although the turnaround time is close to 5 min, I would say its worth it and hopefully it might get better. Will keep on updating this review as I keep going back here.
