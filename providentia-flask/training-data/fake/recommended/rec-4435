It was a cold and stormy night.... My friends and I were starving, so we were hoping for some good CHEAP food.  Well,,,, the cheap was right on. Good? Not so much. We got variants of soupy noodle, fried noodle, barbecued meat, and fried rice.  Let's just say... I've definitely made food in my kitchen that would strip Ivy Noodle's reputation.   Not that there's much, apparently. Everything was overly oily, BLAND,  BLAND, and did I say, BLAND? I literally, literally used up their entire pickled pepper jar to spice things up a bit.  Didn't work, but made my rice too salty, yet lacking in flavor. Go figure. Also, there were stiff noodles, greasy rice, and what appeared to be day-old onions everywhere.   And their pathetic excuse for soymilk - they use the worst kind and charge you I think $1.50 for it.  in a tiny 8 oz cup WITH ICE. So like 6 oz total of soymilk. Methinks - NEVER AGAIN!
