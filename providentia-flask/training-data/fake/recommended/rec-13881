It rained for much of our time in New York, so we were hankering for some serious comfort food. And what sounds cozier than Bubby's Pie Company? My mum's Lonely Planet seemed to agree, and we were tempted by the offerings that were promised at this down-home resto. We almost turned back when we saw the bustling crowd inside the restaurant but with some stroke of luck we were seated immediately and could look at the muggy rain torturing the already-bleak industrial setup of TriBeCa from the inside. Â  Our waiter was not one of those friendly, gung-ho flairy types but he was always attentive to our needs, from the very beginning when he brought out Bubby's famous hot biscuits (not the best, as we were told). The four of us took advantage of brunchtime's range of offerings and ordered two pulled pork sandwiches, eggs benedict and huevos rancheros. The sandwich was disappointing-- mine especially had very gristly pieces that had congealed from slow cooking to cooling-- it was tender, but very crackly-dry and the sauce was run-of-the-mill. The eggs benedict was unspectacular, and the only thing that wowed me was the huevos rancheros, a decidely "Californian" execution with heaps of avocado and tons of zesty and refreshing pico de gallo. If I went back to Bubby's I would order this again, perhaps. I'd like to try Bubby's again, but perhaps for a late-night drinks-and-nibbles option. The vibe is hip (ironic?) and relaxed, and the bartenders provide great eye candy. The brunch was just reminiscent of a theme park, offering too much variety and not much consistency in execution.
