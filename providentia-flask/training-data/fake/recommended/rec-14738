I really hate to say this as the people that work here are really friendly, but I highly doubt I will ever go back here. A couple of friends asked if we would meet them for lunch here one Saturday. We started with guac. That was fresh and tasty. Then we ordered their nachos. They were okay, I wasn't a huge fan of the shredded chicken. I wasn't a huge fan of the chicken enchiladas either. In terms of drinks, I thought my frozen Margarita was terrible. My strawberry mojito was really good. The jalapeno infused tequila was out of this world. (Thankfully). That was definitely my favorite thing about lunch. I do like the ambiance here, it's a big place and the downstairs bar is cute, waiters are super nice. In general, I think it would be even better if they had outdoor seating. In general, I would maybe consider going back for a quick drink, but not eating here.
