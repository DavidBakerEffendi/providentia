Likes: +The cheesesteak I ordered was meaty and moist. +The wait time in line isn't too bad. You get your food within one minute of ordering. +++There isn't a sign at the ordering window that is meant to offend people that can't speak English or speak it well **cough** Geno's **cough**. Dislikes: -NONE If I ever visit Philly again, I will definitely come back here for a cheesesteak.
