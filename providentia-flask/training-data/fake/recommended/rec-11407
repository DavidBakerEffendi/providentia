The first time I came here was for a speed dating event where I just had a drink, their marvelous Sangria.  Afterwards I was so impressed I decided to head back for dinner.  Me and my boyfriend went for a date one night and it was perfect.  There are little candles on each table and just a really romantic setting.  The food was great as well!!  The chips and salsa they give you are so addicting.  The one appetizer we ordered wasn't exactly something we were fond of, nothing wrong with it just not in our taste so they actually took it off our bill which was awesome!  I had the steak tacos and they were soooo good.  I highly recommend them.  My boyfriend had the chimichanga which is HUGE and he greatly enjoyed that as well.
