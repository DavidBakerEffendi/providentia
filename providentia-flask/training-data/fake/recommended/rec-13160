nice decor, good atmosphere, Frisee salad with bacon bites, topped by an poached egg, which warmed up the salad a little bit, make the cheese flavor went out even better. Really liked it. Steak and fries, fries is so so, but the steak was done pretty well, not too rare but tender and juicy enough, the garlic sauce on the steak was a star. leave one star out mostly because it is a little overpriced, we spent 60$ on the two dishes.
