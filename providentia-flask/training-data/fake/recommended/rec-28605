cute, classy, wonderful service. a great place to go for a late afternoon cup Â of coffee or an iced cappuccino. though i personally did not try their panini's or salads, the diners sitting across from me were happily enjoying their meal and it looked absolutely delicious! i highly recommend trying this place!!
