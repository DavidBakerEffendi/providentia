Really amazing food, great service and a casual atmosphere.  We had heard great things about SHS, and couldn't wait to check it out for ourselves.   The specialty drinks were really tasty - but I'd highly recommend whatever drink specials they have available.  Last Thursday they featured caipirinhas and a lemony-gin concoction for $6 each - a bargain for a mixed drink in Center City!  We also had the Thinking Machine (bourbon, lemon-coriander shrub, and amaro montenegro) and the Liberal Arts Degree (rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, amaro meletti, absinthe + a lemon twist) for $13 each. For starters, we ordered the red beet deviled eggs and the seasonal mushrooms.  We were also served a complimentary warm pretzel with some seriously spicy mustard.  The mushrooms were the standout of our first bites and I highly recommend them if they're on the menu! For dinner, I had the duck breast because I can never resist ordering duck, and I was not disappointed.  It was perfectly cooked with a crispy skin that paired well with the carrot puree.  It also came with housemade sauerkraut, which I skipped because I'm not a fan in general.  Tom had the apple-braised pork belly, which was very flavorful and tender.  Both entrees were very carefully prepared and cooked. For dessert, we had the chocolate pie-in-a-jar.  It was definitely more fruit-present (raspberry) than chocolate, which was a little bit of a disappointment for the chocoholic birthday boy, but it was a nice, light ending to our delicious meal.  Our server was also nice enough to bring it out with a candle :) Also, I'm not sure if the AC wasn't working properly (or if there even is AC?) but it was hotter than hell in there on Thursday night.  The doors were open which let in a little breeze, but I was pretty uncomfortable during dinner.  Aside from that, a wonderful experience!
