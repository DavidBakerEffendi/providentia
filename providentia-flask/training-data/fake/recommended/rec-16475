Absolutely a must go! The food is unbelievable. The chef is delightful and genuine. This s fusion done right. So many places miss the mark or try to get too creative. The creativity is inspired and thoughtful but doesn't reach so far as to scare you from ordering or infuse you. Quite the opposite. We ordered 7 small plates (more than enough for two) and I wish I had room for more. The entire menu was interesting and ounces delicious. Don't worry about the BIG Places in the city...come here and be wowed!!!
