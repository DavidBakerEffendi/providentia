Great cheese platter, great mac & cheese, great grilled cheese and pork entree thing was pretty good but a little too spicy for my tastes. Fudge/cookie brownie and strawberry/peach desserts were delicious. Only complaint... They ran out of the bacon mac & cheese pie by at least 7pm on a Saturday! Really wanted to try that...
