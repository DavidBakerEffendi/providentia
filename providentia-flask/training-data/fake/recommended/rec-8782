My girlfriend and I went here during our trip to NYC, by referral of a co-worker that lives in the area.  Great recommendation, excellent food, and wonderful service!  Given the selection of restaurants in the area and new options to try, we would highly consider going back here for seafood.  Clean environment, great menu selection, and very nice ambiance!  I totally recommend the Blue Ribbon!
