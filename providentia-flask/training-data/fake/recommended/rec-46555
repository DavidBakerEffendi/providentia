Loved the wood and candlelight...didn't love our seating. Not much seating for two so we were placed against a wall where my boyfriend didn't have a view of anything but me (I sorta enjoyed that!!!!) Food was good. The watermelon soup was so unusual! Piquant and not really sweet with chunks of crab - really refreshing. The salad was clean but not really inspiring. Shared a delicious app consisting of a sheet of pasta with lobster bits and corn which was super tasty. Had the whole roast leg of pork for two - very tender and not too "porky" tasting accompanied by little crock pots of pea pods with tiny bits of bacon, grilled shitake mushrooms, and fingerling roast potatoes with what seemed like nutmeg or some sort of sweetish spice. Dessert was the American (?) - a mini root beer float, butterscotch pudding, and chocolate cake. Just enough to satiate a sweet tooth!! Wine choices were interesting - shared a bottle of Turley Zin. Set us back a bit but was a great choice with our entree. Must try The Miriam - tequila, lime juice, and agave nectar...smooth as silk (and named after my cousin who is just as smooth!!!) Wait staff, hostess, manager, and chef are all super cool!!! Good way to end our vacation in NYC!
