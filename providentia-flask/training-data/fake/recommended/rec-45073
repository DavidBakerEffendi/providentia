Yeah the burgers here are rock solid, but there's something foul going on here. I can't honestly give this place a good rating based on the army of miserable cunts that constantly swarm this place. seriously. i LOVE the bronte burger and they always do it right. but goddammit! I simply can't eat here. i feel like i'll inadvertently end up on a page of US weekly! take this WONDERFUL food to go or don't waste your time. the burg gets a 4, the place gets a 3.
