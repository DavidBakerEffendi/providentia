I have been going to this place over the last 4 years I've lived in Hell's Kitchen and ordered in Ratchaburi Noodles and Basil Dish at least weekly. I noticed as they grew in popularity, they got cockier and cockier. At some point they stopped taking reservations and you had to wait over an hour to get seated. Similar practices at Toto had negatively impacted the restaurant as locals are not willing to put up with lining up for dinner. Recently Pure had increased minimum delivery order from $10 to $20. Area of their delivery map is Hells Kitchen where an average household consist of 1 person. This hike would require that a person order two dishes instead of one which on a weekday night is a bit much. With so many Thai options in the neighborhood, I consider that a bad policy. I checked their website to see if the min only applied to seamless and it did indeed say minimum is $10 so I called them directly. The lady said they had changed the policy altogether. I told them I've been ordering the same dish over the years and they didn't seem to care. I did not feel loyalty is appreciated much at this restaurant so will have to resort to a different place of which there are plenty in the area. I am also removing it from my New York guide recommendations.
