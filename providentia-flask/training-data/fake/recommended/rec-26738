I took my Italian family here, they are very harsh critics. This place won over their hearts. The waiters were efficient, the bread crusty and hot. Everyone's dish was fantastic, especially the pasta in vodka sauce. The entrees were served extremely hot. Got a reservation for six on a friday night within a half hour of calling. Great price, awesome BYOB. Will be frequenting this restaurant.
