This is one of my favorite places in Philly.  I used to come here a lot just to get drinks, but after many nights of staring down the food menu, I finally came in for dinner.  And let me tell you, it was AWESOME. I had a cubano sandwich that was delicious, my sister's burger was perfectly cooked, and the country fried steak that was on special that night was also so yummy. Service was great as well, we ordered four beers and the waitress recommended a pitcher instead so we could save a few bucks, how nice! The venue upstairs is also very fun.  I saw Low Cut Connie with a bunch of friends and the whole crowd was very upbeat. The only downside is that the bar gets VERY noisy on Friday and Saturday nights, so don't plan on any long conversations with strangers unless you want to scream in their ear.
