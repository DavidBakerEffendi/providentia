I like it here.  Been a few times for happy hour and dinner.   Last time my boyfriend and I were there we got drinks at the bar (cocktails) which were delicious but hugely overpriced and the glass (short glass) was not even half full.  I understand good cocktails are a craft but you should still get some value for your money. As for the food, I have nothing but good things to say and I like the atmosphere a lot.  We have had consistently good service and enjoyed our experience every time.  Oyster Happy Hour is always a nice touch.  With the exception of some improvement of the cocktail list and cocktail prices, I'd keep coming back to Mayfield!
