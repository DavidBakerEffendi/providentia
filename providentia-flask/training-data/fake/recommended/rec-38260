I love Pacifico! The atmosphere is so cool almost as cool as the real fruit mojitos! they have several of them! the duck empanadas are soo good as well as the bread with tomato spread. Â The steak is really flavorful and the staff is always so nice and helpful. I highly recommend at the very least getting a mojito ts soo refreshing!
