My absolute favorite restaurant without question. I discovered this place about a year ago on my first trip to NYC. Marc doesn't screw around, he knows great food. I'm anticipating an increase in the $99 per/person tasting menu in the near future. Reason being, the food at this price is a total steal. I'm by no means a food snob, but I've paid 150-250 pp for food that's not even close to this caliber. Where do I even begin... The Hiramasu Tartare, Chili Lobster, Halibut w Proposal Sauce are my favs and have become stable's on the tasting menu I've always admired Chef Forgione on the food network and Iron Chef. I mentioned this to the waiter on my first visit, and guess who brings out the next course?!? What an experience to meet the legend himself. Couldn't have been nicer and more down to earth. What a treat They have their own housemade cocktails and they're out of this world. Service is also exceptional. This is the best value money can buy for the best food in NYC. Go here. Go here now. and go back some more.
