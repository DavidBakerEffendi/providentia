Love their omelettes!  Excellent coffee and bread, too.  Fruit cup is always freshly cut.  Yasmin and Kianna warmly welcome you when you arrive, and the entire staff is attentive and friendly.  Try their "Light Start" for breakfast--healthy and tasty!  The Americana is our favorite place for brunch!
