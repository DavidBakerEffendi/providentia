3.5 stars. We shared fish n chips and a cup of tea. The food was very good. I'm sensitive to overly greasy food and this food did not taste overly greasy. One was plenty to share. They use sarsons malt vinegar which is a nice touch. The service is horrible. They are not rude, but it seemed as if we were 100% invisible. No one checked on us at any point, even though they walked past continuously.
