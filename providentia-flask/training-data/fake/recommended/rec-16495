This is bar none one of my favourite restaurants in the city. It's great for vegetarians, there are tons are amazing options, and everything is DELICIOUS! I suggest this place to everyone, and they're always happy with it. It's a great mix of flavours. It's smaller dishes, made to share. The tables are super small, and this place isn't accessible at all aka do not bring your grandmother here or anyone who can't move around well. Try it! You wont regret it!
