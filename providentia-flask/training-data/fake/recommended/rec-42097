I've only given it four stars because I can't imagine a restaurant that would please me sufficiently to warrant the perfection of five. I'm not that easy to please, you see. One of the best lunches I've had for $50 a head, including two rather good glasses of wine. Perhaps the best burger I've had in New York.
