If you have a child attending Yale University in New Haven, CT make certain dinner at the Union League Cafe during graduation weekend is a part of the festivities you plan for your family. Formerly a part of the Union League Club network, today the Union League Cafe provides the private Club dining experience without the Club membership requirements. What GREAT food the Chef prepares! The service is second to none! Very traditional classically prepared french dishes, with the notable exception of the best NY Strip you will find outside of a Chicago or NYC Steakhouse anywhere in the USA. Another absolutely wonderful dish is the poached lobster. I thought I had died and gone to culinary heaven! Finally, the Creme Brulee--just do it! Trust me, its worth the extra 15 minutes in the hotel's health club the following morning. Superior wine list is another positive quality. Must do. Enjoy.
