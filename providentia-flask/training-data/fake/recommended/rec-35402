Someone at work told me about this place and I have to say the food was very good. I like spicy food but Thai food can be very spicy. One time I made the the mistake of ordering curry chicken with bamboo shoots and asked for medium and ended up drinking 20 glasses of ice water. My mouth was on fire. The atmosphere was nice and very crowded and you can tell the place was renovated recently. The problem I have with this place is the wait. I mean when the waitress says the wait is 20 minutes I expect it to be around this time we would get a table but after waiting 1 hour that's ridiculous. My suggestion is to come early if you plan to go on a Friday evening.
