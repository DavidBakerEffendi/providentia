Old man bar in a not so scary section of Newark. White people walking around with impunity. Very basic, no frills atmosphere. One guy working both the bar and the "kitchen" area on a not so busy Saturday night. He did everything right. Burger was fantastic; fresh definitely, not frozen. Onion rings were bangin'. Calamari was delicious. Marinara sauce was definitely just jar tomato sauce with a sprinkling of pepper flakes. However, whenever in the neighborhood will definitely visit again.
