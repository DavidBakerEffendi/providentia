When it comes to Chinese restaurants, it's no secret that they are often lacking in the name department.  They usually contain words like "Lucky" and "Happy" and "King," or they just describe the restaurant in the most obvious way possible, like "Chinese Restaurant" or this place, "Nan Zhou Hand Drawn Noodle." Anyway, this place is bonkers good. BONKERS! The noodles are always perfectly cooked, springy and slightly chewy, and the soup is delicioso. I always get the beef stew noodle soup and Grace always gets the ja jang mien (#14).   You can get the noodles shaved or hand drawn, in my opinion you gotta go with hand drawn every time.  Oh yeah and you can get the ja jang mien with a fried egg on top which looks amazing as well.  Definitely gonna try that next time.   Peace, noodles, happiness.
