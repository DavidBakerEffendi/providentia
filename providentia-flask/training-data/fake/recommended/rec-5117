In the book of Jeremy it reads: On the 8th day god ordered pizza and it was from lombardis.. Enough said... Crust, sauce, cheese, toppings... Perfection. This place gets BUSY... Be prepared and you won't be disappointed!!! Worth any wait!!! Go here, and go here often... Moving to NYC from Chicago I heard all the hype and thought it was well deserved.
