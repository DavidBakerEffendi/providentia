everything i've gotten here has been glorious! food truck and restaurant. minus the fahrenheit chicken sandwich....skip that. it was a big soggy mess and the chicken was sub par. they put almost all of their effort into their pork and it shows. but over all, great atmosphere and really friendly folks. good job! can't wait to see more.
