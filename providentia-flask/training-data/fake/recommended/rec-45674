Hibachi area had an hour wait so we sat in the dining room and ordered hibachi. Food quantity was good and quality was great. Very good overall!! Had filet mignon and shrimp. Both were perfectly cooked and seasoned well. The only thing I didn't like we're the sauces. Both tasted vinegary and were unlike sauces I've had before at other hibachi places...where they enhance the meal. These sauces detracted. However the food was so good, it didn't need it. We will come again.
