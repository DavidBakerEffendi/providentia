Went here for lunch. Thank god we had reserved a table as the place got crowded soon. The food here was pretty good. The complimentary bruschetta was good. I loved my carbonara, tiramisu and coffee. Others on my table loved their food too. However, the portions are small. The ravioli my colleague ordered was good for an appetizer not entree. All the desserts were good. I would go back here but wish they improved their portions.
