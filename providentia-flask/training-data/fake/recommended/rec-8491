I live in the area and really love to support our local businesses, but I just can't recommend this place. The food is only OK, and even when it's not busy everything is so slow and humorless. I stopped going because I got tired of standing unacknowledged at the counter for minutes on end, then waiting 10 minutes for a single bagel.
