I want to give this place 2.5 stars but will be generous and round it UP to 3.  I was excited to finally make it to Corner bistro but honestly it was just "ok".  NOthing really special.  My bf and I both had the bistro burger and an order of fries. The burgers were tasty especially due to the bacons but it wasn't anything out of this world or different.  The fries were disappointing.  McDonald's fries are better.  enough said.  Kinda underwhelming experience overall.
