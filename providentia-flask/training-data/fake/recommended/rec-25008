Beautiful transformation of the old R.H. Tuggs with an additional lovely indoor/outdoor eating area and a separate sitting area in the grass off the water. I had two of Blue's specials . . . Red Bean Soup with Crispy Bacon and Rice.  I love soup, and this was a large portion, very hearty and delicious.  I also had the Pork Medallions with Blue Cheese served with Mushroom Risotto.  A decadent meal, but well worth it!  My husband had the Grilled Octopus Salad for an appetizer and the Curry-Infused Moroccan Chicken in a stew.  We shared everything because it was so good, as well as one dessert . . . Panna Cotta with Aged Balsamic Vinegar and a couple of blueberries.  Even before Blue, Panna Cotta was my new favorite dessert, and this was the best I've had since getting on my Panna Cotta "kick".  I thought the Aged Balsamic Vinegar was an unusual topping . . . almost sweet, and what a great pairing!  Our meal at Blue was the best my husband and I ever had under $100 (which even included a couple of glasses of wine). You could tell that the waitress was very experienced.  She made recommendations when asked and checked in with us throughout the meal without hovering over us.
