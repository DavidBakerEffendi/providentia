Supposedly this place is one of the oldest restaurants in NYC.  You could easily walk or drive by this non-desrcript building, wedged in amongst car dealerships and warehouses on 11th Ave.   However, this place is worth it.  Upon entering, it seems like any Irishey tavern that serves food.  We came in a group of 5 on a Saturday night and the dining room was about half full.  We were greeted by a sweet, 40-something woman with a thick NYC accent, who had a great sense of humor and took good care of us. We got beer, wine, cocktails and dinner.  For dinner, we got the lamb shanks, sirloin steak, shepherds pie (shared), and I forget the other entree.  Everyone really enjoyed their food.   I could go on and on about each entree, but I think you get the idea.  The food is good, the drinks are good and the service is good, what more could you want?
