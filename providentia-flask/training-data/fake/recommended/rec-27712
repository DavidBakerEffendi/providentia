I just went there last night in a big group and LOVED everything about this place.  I ordered a plate of sides so I could sample more things.  For less than $15, I got mac & cheese, candied yams, collard greens, stuffing, and sweet tea.  This is clearly not health food, but it's so so yummy / worth it for a treat!  The highlight of my plate was the stuffing - the best stuffing I've ever had.  The cornbread (brought out in the beginning) was also moist & delicious.   I am already planning my next trip out there - you have to try this place!
