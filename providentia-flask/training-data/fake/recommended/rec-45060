Stopped by on a weekday night for an early dinner with a friend.  It was nice out and we were provided with an outdoor table.   They have an excellent selection of wine by the glass/carafe and I recommend their pastas (the gnocchi and carbonara are both excellent).  I had the chicken entree, which while very moist and flavorful, was a little too heavy on the salt and olive oil for my taste.  My friend had one of the pasta specials, which he enjoyed. Service was only ok.  Requested bread never arrived, and we were somewhat forgotten after main course was delivered.   Overall a good place to go with a friend for a casual meal outside.  I'd give this place 3.5 stars, but am rounding up due to outdoor seating and very reasonable pricing - this is definitely a neighborhood value.
