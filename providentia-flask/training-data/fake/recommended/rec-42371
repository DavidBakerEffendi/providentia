Even if you are not a thin crust guy, the place is great. Not a Sicilian slice but not burnt slice either. A juicy slice with a crunch followed by a chew. But that's just the texture. The taste has the perfect ratio of cheese to sauce. But if you insist upon not eating a pizza, the other stuff is great too. If you're looking for a snack wings, calamari, and mozzarella sticks are amazing. And so are their sandwiches. A meatball or chicken parm is a great showcase of their all around greatness.
