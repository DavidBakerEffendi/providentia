This is the first week they are open, but it took them 30 minutes to get my and my friends stir fries out.   Not enough sauce if there's even any on there.  Noodles in one big amalgamated mess.  Shrimp tastes fishy.  It cost $17 for a smoothie (that was good) and a stir fry that I can't even eat.   And in case you get exicted about the pickled cucumber and think it might be Asian pickles that will taste really good in stir fry- be forewarned that they appear to be DILL PICKLES.  Uck.   Oh, and I paid extra for carrots and spinach.  No carrots are in my stir fry and there may be 5 spinach leaves.  Pathetic. ***************EDIT************** I have since returned to honey grow and have had much better experiences.  They seem to have gotten their act together food wise.  Organization wise, it's still a mess in there.  No one should have to wait 10 minutes to pay for their food.
