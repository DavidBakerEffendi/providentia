As a northern New Jersey native, my boyfriend has been eating at Fiesta Hut pretty much since he could have solid food, and this is truly one of his all time favorites.  I have now been here twice with his family and I can see why they like it so much.  Fiesta Hut looks like a total dive, but the food is unfussy and delicious.  The guacamole is fresh and quite good, and the margaritas are nice - nothing to wriet home about, but pretty much exactly what you would expect.  The California tacos are huge soft shells stuffed with a tasty combination meat (beef is my favorite, but the chicken is solid as well), cheese, lettuce, and sour cream.  The true star here are the cheese enchiladas, which are oozing with melty, cheesy goodness and smothered in a delicious homemade sauce.  If you're in the area and looking for some solid Mexican food, definitely give Fiesta Hut a try.
