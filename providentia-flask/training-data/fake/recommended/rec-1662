It's quite a sight on Passyunk it's congested with cars and people trying to find parking. I checked the websites of the two famous cheesesteaks I thought Pat's was more interesting and had choices of cheeses but when I ordered the cheesesteak I was trying my best to avoid the cheesewhiz, not particularly appetizing I was surprised they didnt give you a choice. Yuck! If you cannot even understand the names of food additives it's best to avoid it altogether. The mushrooms and peppers added flavors but it was soaking through at every bite. The steak was tasty but had too much fat. Here's my breakdown: Likes: Soft and toasted bread Mushrooms and peppers Cherry peppers Dislikes: Cheesewhiz Steak Juice running down my hands and legs (metal tables with holes that go through) Service - not friendly Surrounding of the store was sparse and lacking in cleanliness
