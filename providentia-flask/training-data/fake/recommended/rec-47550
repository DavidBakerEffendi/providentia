Beana's restaurant boggles my mind.  I like the casual funky vibe of the decor and the people who work here are earnestly friendly, to the point that they keep a supply of toys on hand to give out to kids who eat here (knock off Barbie dolls in big boxes, for example, for the girls).  The place seems reasonably popular and I know a couple of people personally who are regular customers, but to me, honestly, my meal at Beana's was among the worst food I have ever eaten that was made by professionals.   Other reviewers have suggested that the ingredients are canned or prepackaged or may have been prepared in a microwave.  Whatever it is and however it's cooked, I'd put it like this -- the food here tastes like what I imagine one would get on Mexican night at an old folks home, completely bland, mushy and the opposite of what I'm looking for when I eat out (or in).  Both my date and I thought the salsa tasted like ketchup and it really does. It's hard to imagine how a restaurant that's been in business this long can put out such bad food.  Maybe it was once good and the original owner or chef left and the place was inherited or bought by someone with no interest in cooking?   I've never been motivated to write a bad review before and I don't feel good publishing this one, since the owners seem very nice and well intentioned but if I can stop one person with working taste buds from eating here, it will have been worth it... and besides, Beana's seems to have their fans any way.
