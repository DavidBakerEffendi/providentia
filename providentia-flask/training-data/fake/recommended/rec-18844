Never had food here. But the beer selection is awesome and the live music gets an A+! Their themed music events are top notch. I get a little excited when I see the emails for a"music of 97" party! Cover usually ranges from 5-7 bucks. Mixed crowd, no drama, Good vibes. As many beers they offer, I only drink Lionhead for some strange reason lol.
