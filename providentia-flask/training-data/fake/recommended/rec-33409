We usually eat here when in Brooklyn. The menu seemed to change?! The fare isn't the healthiest or the tastiest, but sticks to your ribs for a long day of walking! I tried the 'cowgirl' veggie burger. The BBQ sauce seemed off-putting as described but was really good w jalepenos Â & guacamole. The burger was pretty good, but seemed like a big piece of cornbread with some veggies in it? All in all, jimmys is fine but not great. The music was so loud I had to shout my order at 1130am. Btw, what happened to the cinnamon donut holes?
