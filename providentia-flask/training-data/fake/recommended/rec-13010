Reaaaallly like this place. Great ambiance, trendy, hip and the food is good. I'm a big fan of the gigantic chandelier within a glass column. I tried to snap pics of it with my phone, but the lighting was too dim. I felt like I walked into a club, and I always wondered if this place secretly transforms into a club late night.. or weekends. But alas, it is just a restaurant. The entrees here are all very decent, but the presentation is where Room Service excels. I'm a fan of the pineapple fried rice and pad thai. The rice is served in a cone shape - fun! The service is always excellent here and the prices are reasonable. Fellas, this is a great date place.
