This was either the best or the second best meal I've ever had in NY. I've only been here once and both my boyfriend and I have been dying to go back. We went on a busy night, service was good, food was perfectly executed and delicious. We ordered three things, one item did not stand up to the other two, which were just so good. The bone marrow special and the goat's neck.
