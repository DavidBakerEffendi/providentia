I used to work a couple of doors down from the Corner Bistro. Looking back, I realize belatedly that it was a glorious time in my life, if only for the mere fact that I was able to go to the Corner Bistro anytime I wanted. Their Bistro Burger is a thing of beauty, a classic pub-style burger. Large, oval-shaped, and ridiculously juicy. I would also get the grilled cheese with bacon when in need of something cheap and easy. :-) The best thing about the Corner Bistro is the non-pretentious vibe and the old-school bartender.
