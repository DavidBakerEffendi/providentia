I came here on Tuesday evening with two of my friends. I arrived there a bit early and was glad to see that there were no signs of that notorious "minimum 45 min" wait. Granted, I also arrived at 5pm on a weekday, so it wasn't a surprise that there wasn't a wait. When I went in, the maitre d greeted me and told me very kindly that she cannot seat me until everyone in my party arrives. That was fair. So I waited inside the restaurant sitting on the "waiting area" couch. After everyone in my party arrived, we got seated immediately in the 1st floor booth, next to the bathroom. Though it was next to the bathroom, there weren't any yucky bathroom smells peeving out, so that was good. So the food. I ordered the truffle burger, medium rare, and I loved every bite of it. Though it was a bit small, the meat was juicy and the bun was neither too soft nor too hard. The burger didn't take that long to come out, while the fries took longer (we ordered the thin fries with truffle on top and the sweet potato fries). The three different sauces for the fries came in an Asian soup spoon and I really liked the chipotle mayo since it was spicier than the others. The other two were some mayo one and something that tasted like sour creme onions. The fries were okay. They were too thin for my taste. The sweet potato fries came as a pleasant surprise, as they were soft and sprinkled with brown sugar cinnamon. yum. We came out with a moderately full belly, but my friend and I had to get a dessert to get really full. Will definitely return again, but I don't know when I will. The burgers weren't like NOOO I CAN'T live without it. I will be satisfied with Shake Shack a couple of blocks away from my apt.
