I came here on Saturday night to pick up some food - really great experience.  As soon as I walked in, someone who worked at the restaurant caught me looking confused and explained the ordering process (really easy - just walk to the back, wait in line, order delicious meat).  There was a 20-minute wait but a waitress was walking around taking drink orders while you stood in line.  The place is huge with lots of seating, and an awesome live band was playing.  When it came time to order, I got the pork belly, the brisket and the baby back ribs - all were amazing.  Perfectly tender with amazing spiced crusts.  The potato salad was fantastic and vinegar-y, and the coleslaw was also great (not slathered in mayo like at other places!).  The BBQ sauces were also tremendous - there is one that kind of tastes like sriracha :)  I took my food to go, but next time I want to come here and have a few drinks, listen to some live music, and maybe dance a little :p
