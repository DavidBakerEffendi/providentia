A good neighborhood spot for a light, healthy meal. I hope they sort out their credit card billing issues soon, since I certainly hadn't expected to be charged over $1100 on a light meal with iced tea, for only two people. I can only imagine what a nightmare they must be going through now as they sort this out for the rest of their customers from this past weekend. northernspyfoodco.com/20â€¦
