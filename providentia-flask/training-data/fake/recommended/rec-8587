This place has really gotten under my skin. First impression-- a $14 Tiger burger (they blacken it, add cheese, and mix the condiments together to make orange-- because of Princeton!) is merely pandering, and expensive pandering at that.   Visit #1-- sat on the weirdly gloomy "patio" and ate a veggie burger that's really more like a falafel pita sandwich.  No major complaints, but not a good vibe. Visit #2 (deal killer)-- terribly bad service.  Waitress rarely visited, was hard to flag down, and repeatedly darted away before we were finished doing business (ie ordering).  Also, just super awkward at waiting, but whatever.   And the kicker-- the bill.  It was expensive but... Each happy hour beer was quoted at $3 and rung up at $3.50.   An upgrade to fries was quoted at $1 and rung up at $1.50. Not cool.   So we asked her about it.  She said that she told the table beers were $3.50, and that they were 50% off for happy hour.  The drink menu clearly shows that all the beers ordered were regularly $6... which makes one at 50% $3.  Yes.  Either she doesn't know how much things cost or she can't do math or both.  She was unapologetic and didn't bother to check her facts.   I waited behind to take it up with the manager but, surprise, he was nowhere to be found.   Unless my friends drag me here, I will NOT be returning.
