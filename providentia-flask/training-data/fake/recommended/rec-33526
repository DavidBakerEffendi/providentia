I'm genuinely confused. K-town is just 4 blocks up and one over. If you want a good deal on take out, go to Woo Ri Jip. I got the jjampong (mistake, I know), and it had one shrimp and a couple pieces of calamari. Definitely not worth the $9. This place is bizarrely overrated seemingly due to out of towners and non-Koreans.
