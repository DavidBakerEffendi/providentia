Marshall (HIMYM) was overreacting about Corner Bistro not being the burger joint! It's gotta be! With the red neon sign and green door. I mean, I thought I went to burger heaven!! As a first timer, I am impressed by the burger! My brother did a good job by not overrating the burger for me. I mean I went in thinking that it's not as good as people say but maybe he has eaten better burgers elsewhere. The Bistro Burger and Fries came out $12.50 and it was worth every penny. Slapped Shake Shack right across the face. The two doesn't even compare! First off, medium rare just how I like ANY meat. They actually cooked the patty medium rare perfectly (that bright pink in the middle)! Wow! And second, to order take out and still enjoy the taste was impressive. Third, that had to be one of the best burgers I've ever had (Definitely made it on the top 5). Every ingredient just melted in my mouth. The patty had a large quantity of meat but in a way, you really paid what you get for ($8). That crispy bacon to go with the burger made life taste even better. Anything with bacon is good though. Gourmet burger at its finest!
