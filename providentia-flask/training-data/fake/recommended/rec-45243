We tried out kafe neo not knowing what to expect.   We were more than pleasantly surprised when we walked through the door.  The decor is artsy with soft lighting giving it a comfortable atmosphere.   The food was well presented and the taste to die for.  The shrimp salad with wasabi dressing was daring and tingled the taste buds.   The apple  pecan laced salad with warm cheese dressing was delicious. The dessert choices are unusual and tempting and we loved the baklava. In summary, kafe neo is a Great choice for lunch, dessert or just an evening out  with friends.  it's worth a visit.
