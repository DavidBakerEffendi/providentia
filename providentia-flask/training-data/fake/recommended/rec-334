I took my date here Saturday night and we had a blast. We didn't have reservations, which was my mistake, so there was a 45-minute wait. The host was very accommodating though, and he provided us with bar stools to sit on while we waited. The waitress was friendly and attentive, the food was delicious, and the entertainment was great--a very festive and appropriate atmosphere. Highly recommended.
