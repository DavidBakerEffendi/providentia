I've been to this place for dinner and for brunch, and I really, really like it. The staff is friendly, and they're very explicative when it comes to your order. I like the setting of the restaurant. It's very cozy, but it doesn't feel like you're in a tiny room. The restrooms are clean as well. It's definitely one of the best spots in St. Marks.
