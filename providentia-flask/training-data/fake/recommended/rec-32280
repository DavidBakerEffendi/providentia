Great beer selection and at a nice chilled temperature. It definitely gets packed at night so get there early. The way to order food is kinda goofy but its great. Pretzels are hot and soft with a nice crunch to the outside. Cheese sauce is kinda weird though. It was cold and tasted more like sour cream. Either way, its a great place to stop by, have some food and some beers
