The restaurant is really very nice looking, the drink selection is good, the menu is great, but... ... I ordered a medium rare steak, and was pretty ill the minute I got home. If you can't cook a steak safely, how can I trust your oysters and raw food? This place seemed really nice, and the service was great, but crushing stomach pain and spending the night asking for death nets your business one star.
