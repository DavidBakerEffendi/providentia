A great place in the old city. I had the Southwest Turkey Burger with guacamole.  Very tasty and filling.  It came with fries but I upgraded to the sweet potato fries for a very small fee. They have a nice selection of beers. The atmosphere is very neighborly. They were busy during my visit but it didn't hinder the service.
