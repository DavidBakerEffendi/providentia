It should always be Christmas so I can order the Christmas Feast at Sazon. It had a nicely roasted pork, excellent tamale, and chicken apple potato salad; these are all lovinigly prepared in this family restaurant. Save room for dessert - Cacique, which is 90% cacao, is the darkest, yummiest chocolate drink from the the menu.
