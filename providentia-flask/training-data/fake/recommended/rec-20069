On a Friday morning, after getting baked on my walk of shame, the munchies hit and I had the meanest hankering for breakfast food. My initial thought was to head to Kellogg's since I was on Metro but then I thought, if I'm going to spend money it might as well be something I'd be excited to eat and not just something that'll suffice. So I took to yelp and decided on Jimmy's. Jimmy's Diner has an extremely laid back, old diner feel. I sat at the bar and was promptly greeted by the bartender (who was Â running the entire operation on his own and did so extremely well!). He was very knowledgable about the menu and very helpful. I wound up ordering the Biscuits and Gravy with a side of roasted Brussels sprouts both were amazing although I would've preferred if the biscuits and gravy were hotter. To drink I had the hot chocolate, probably one of the best I've ever had. Lots of whipped cream!! I also ordered the key lime pie to go. Also delicious although rather custardy and not as tangy as I prefer my pie. All in all, an amazing dining experience. I'll definitely be back for more!
