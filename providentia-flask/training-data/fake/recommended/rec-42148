Both the food and service were excellent. The menu has lots that I want to try and I'm very picky. The seating is spacious so you're not crowded in. It has a high ceiling which along with the spacious seating keeps the noise level low. Our waitress asked whether we were going to a theater so she could manage the time - what a nice gesture. We're definitely going back before the next show. We asked and yes they can accommodate large groups.
