what the hell is going on here?!?  at least a couple times now ive gone in-  and no bagels.  you are a bagel place-  i know this bc your name says bagel giant cafe-  so how the f do you not have bagels????  they were out of practically all flavors-  so i said to one of the rude chicks behind the counter-  what happened?-  and she said it was a very busy morning bc of the holiday.  what?????  if you knew there was a holiday-  and hence a larger crowd coming-  why not be prepared and MAKE SOME MONEY??  this place isnt good.  not a disaster, but not good.  prices arent good, bagels arent all that great- and if ya cant get em  does it really matter anyway?  if a tree falls in a forest....does that syaing even apply?-  argh nevermind agreed-  place seems dirty, rude service, not a particularly good value.  only useable if you live close by.
