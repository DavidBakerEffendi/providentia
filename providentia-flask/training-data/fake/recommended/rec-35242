Atmosphere - 1 Service - 3 Food - 4 This little gem (two of them) were a great find for those that love Japanese curry. Clean little place a little run down and the decor is non existent the service is average but the curry shines. The sushi is average but fresh, vegetables in the salads are fresh but go for the curry and Katsu. Lots of Japanese tourists find this place so they also seem to like it.
