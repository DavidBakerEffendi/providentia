Was the hype even worth it?? I guess so.. It's pretty legit... Could be very touristy.. but as i said.. it was pretty legit from whatever cheesesteak we have here in CA. AND if you really want to know... my boyfriend and i went here and next door to compare and see which one is better... both of us.. ate two sandwiches. EACH. PAT'S KING OF STEAKS is better than it's neighbor. There. that saves you money and room in your stomach.
