I have been coming here for about 4 years and I have never had a bad experience.  I usually get the 2 roll sushi lunch ($7.99) which comes with salad, miso soup and a your choice of a good selection of two rolls of sushi.  As for the specialty rolls - the monkey roll is amazing.  The service is very good and it's a great place to go when you don't have a lot of time for lunch.  My only complaint is the fruit flies or gnats that always seem to be there.
