TL;DR: I hosted dinner party for 40 people - worked out perfectly. Favorite dish is Orzo Arrbiata. Service is incredible. _______________________________________________ My first time at Aksum was for a small dinner and due to its success, I decided to plan my birthday there. Though I definitely maxed out Aksum's restaurant capacity (I had around 40 guests), the perfect execution of my special night on such a large scale is what makes me wholeheartedly recommend Aksum - whether it be for an intimate dinner or a large party. A casual afternoon stroll into West Philadelphia led me to stumble upon this hidden gem. With large glass panels for windows, outdoor seating and dimly-yet-cozy-lit interior, what more could you ask for when such is both a BYOB and a place for shisha (Hookah)? The manager Hannah is incredible. She handled everything from party planning to event management with professionalism, grace and an unbeatable smile. Her team is also fantastic - they dealt with every inquiry speedily and appropriately. The impeccable service definitely sculpted the success of the night. With 40 hungry guests, I am positive that our group pretty much tried everything on the menu. I had an exceptional Angry Baby Eggplants for starters. It was just the right amount of sauce and neatly balanced out the freshness of the eggplant. For my entree, I had the Honey Glazed Salmon. It was a good dish but it definitely loses to my friend's Orzo Arrbiata. The orzo was cooked in a tomato-based sauce and it was delightful. Only criticism someone had was that their lamb shank was a bit dry. I would just like to thank Hannah again for making this night incredible. Every single one of my guests had a terrific time (pledging to return!) and I am extremely happy that Aksum was the one I chose to host my special night with.
