I am giving this place a one star, for the food only. Over priced food, $20 dishes that were small in portion. Sangria was big as they say but watered down, I've had much better . We arrived at this place at 10pm knowing that their hours end at 11. But generally In other places I've been to won't kick you out if u were seated a whole hour before closing time !!! 10:50 hits and they put up the lights, and turn off the music !!!! And start mopping and cleaning right around us!!!!! we still had a lot of sangria left my husband and I and we asked to finish it and they guy says "that's fine" !!! Unbelievable Anyway we never finished it and we left at 11:10 because they were loud, rowdy, the kitchen guys came out and just kept staring at us. How terrible!!!!! I do not rate places just based on taste, I can cook my own tasty food !!! this place did not have good service or reasonable prices for what they offered.
