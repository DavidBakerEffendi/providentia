The food are good and delicious here. The place can be a bit small but it is a nice, clean intimate setting. The service is good as well. We got a nice waitress helping us and explaining to us about the menu. However, the only down side is the price, it can get a bit pricey. For example, do you know the green tea is $4? No refill and it is in this tiny cup. When I said tiny, it is REALLY tiny. And if you want to add egg, yes, I know, it is 2 bucks! Where the hell is that egg comes from that it cost 2 bucks??! It better be some mother freaking good egg or something.
