All the food at Nico's looks good and is priced right. I've been a customer for years, being on the road a lot and passing through on South Orange Ave or Sanford Ave. Being on a budget, Nico's is great. A whole 13 inch pizza is always $5. - that's enough for 2-3 people. If I have 3 in the car, I'll pick up 2 for lunch. Bottled beverages in the trunk, everyone is satisfied for $10. I often pick up 4 and bring 'em home. Wife doesn't have to cook, and the kids and they're friends can have at it - $20. Â Can't beat it. Note: Nico's is closed Sundays, and every other day opens at 11:30 AM closing at 8:30 PM when the steel shutters come down and crime goes up. It's a busy business area in a low budget community by a main intersection. Consistently excellent!
