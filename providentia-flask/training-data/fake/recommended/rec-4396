I'm a big fan of most things about Underdogs: * the staff are great -- friendly, willing to discuss the product, service-oriented * the fries are excellent and the fry sauces are terrific (Utah Fry Sauce and Curry Mayo are my faves) * Â the buns are chewy, sturdy and delicious without getting in the way of the sausage * the sandwich menu offers creative new combos as well as old classics * toppings are fresh, tasty and applied in good measure * the non-frankfurter sandwiches (I've tried all but 3) are uniformly delicious But, I don't love the hot dogs themselves, sad to say. I had a great conversation with Robert (owner/braintrust) about why they use a hot water bath rather than grilling the dogs, and to a lesser extent why they use the Dietz & Watsons - it's about replicating traditional Philadelphian hot dog service. He said that they would happily split and grill a dog for me any time, and not only have they done that, but he remembers me and offers to do it when I order. But after lunch today, I just have to conclude that I don't love the D&W dogs. But I do like Nathan's & Heb Nats, so it's not hot dogs in general. Don't get me wrong - I WILL remain a frequent customer, and I will get my name on a fist on the wall for trying all 23 dogs. But once I've done that, I will be sticking to the many excellent non-frankfurter options the menu provides - the 9th Streeter's spicy Italian, the Warsaw Packed's kielbasa and the Marrakesh's merguez are my faves so far. The Adonis (lamb with gyro toppings) and Brats were also quite good.
