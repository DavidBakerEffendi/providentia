It was a rainy Jan. 12th and looking for a place to just grab a quick bite, I suggested Juniors.  I've been here once with my folks but wanted to share the experience with my girlfriend this time. We sit at the bar because we were only getting a quick bite.  The bar tender was extremely friendly, considerate and always ensured we were "ok". We we waited for our food, the tender asked if we wanted complimentary slaw and beets to snack on.  of course we said yes.   yum.  the slaw wasn't soggy or dripping with mayo as so many places do.  Crisp cabbage with vinegar. My girlfriend ordered fried clams and I had the chicken fingers.  Just thinking small.  Well, my plate of chicken tenders were anything but small.  5 large breast size tenders friend with a nice crispy crunch to the outside.  The honey mustard was real honey and mustard. delish! The floor manager talked us into the chocolate mousse cheesecake.  They sang happy birthday to my girlfriend and it was topped off with the amazing taste of junior's cheesecake. Thank you!
