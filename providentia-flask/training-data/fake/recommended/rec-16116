If you're craving just fries, this is the spot. I mean, this is as good as you can make a fry joint. Delicious, crispy, perfectly seasoned fries, with a choice of a kazillion different sauces which all make your imagination go wild. We tried the rosemary garlic, parmesan peppercorn, and just plain vinegar as our sauces. All of them were awesome. The rosemary really stood out in the mayo. I actually just really really enjoyed the plain vinegar with the fries. Price tag for the fries was cheap, but when we added the three sauces it came out to like $6. Atmosphere-wise, it was an awesome little hole in the wall which works perfectly for the food they're divvying out.
