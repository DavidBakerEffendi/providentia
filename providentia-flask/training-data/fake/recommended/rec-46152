We stumbled on this place on Ladies' Night, which was a pleasant surprise:  three courses - with a good selection - for $24.95!!  But I mainly wanted to comment on two things which most people might not.  First, I ordered the filet mignon (for that price, what deal!). It was fantastic - I didn't even need the steak knife, it was so tender, but what I mainly liked was the small size. I know that makes me a very atypical customer, but I find most restaurant meals too big and uncomfortably filling, so this was great.  Second, the mashed potatoes were out of this world!!  No garlic, no sage, no nothing, just simple delicious mashed potatoes.  I took home the extra and they were even better the next day!   On top of that, our waiter was great; it was a wonderful surprise on a cold windy night.
