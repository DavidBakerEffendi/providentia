Every time I go to Landmarc I expect to have a well prepared meal at a pleasant place. The truth is every time I go I end up being disappointed. Sometimes it is the food and sometimes the annoying service, but there is always something. Â This last time the service was perfunctory and on the edge of rude. The food was ok, not great. Fooled once, fooled several times.
