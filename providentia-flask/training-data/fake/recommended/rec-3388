Don't let their Department of Health "B" rating deter you, this is pretty decent ramen! The broth wasn't' the most complex I've ever tasted (the vegetarian, fyi), but it was quite tasty nonetheless. I also appreciated the thin and straight noodles that arrived piping hot, and al dente. (Ain't nobody got time for overcooked, mushy noodles.) The toppings were also generous, which for the price, turned out to be a great deal. The egg was probably my favorite part - perfectly cooked and creamy. As almost everyone else has mentioned, this place is cash only and they don't accept bills larger than $20, so bring lots of little denominations if you plan to order for a big crowd!
