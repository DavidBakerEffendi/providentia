A little off the path of the main strip of bars and eateries, lies Brooklyn Star. This place is definitely a Star in Brooklyn. The food was great as well as the drinks. The bar is partially sectioned off from the restaurant giving off the feeling of it being two different places. The decor is great as is the entire layout, its pretty spacious compared to many other restaurants in the area. Being a Monday evening me and my 3 companions were fortunate enough to get a booth which I'm sure we would've needed to reserve if it were a weekend. To Drink I had the Sweet Tea Sour and is was well balanced. To eat I had the Mac N Cheese (w/bacon) it was a force to be reckoned with. Afterward I had the Country Fried Steak with Mashed Potatoes. Though the Potatoes were the standout of the dish the Steak was great. Out of curiosity I ordered the Cornbread with Jalapeno and bacon that was ok but needed the honey that was provided to balance it out a bit because it wasn't as sweet as most cornbread I've had in the past elsewhere. Definitely a place I will revisit in the near future. Highly recommended.
