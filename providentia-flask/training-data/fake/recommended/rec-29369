Forewarning: I've never had a cheesesteak before until Dalessandro's... so this is my first impression on philly cheesesteaks I was out in Philadelphia last week for an interview, and decided to hit up a popularly yelped philly cheesesteak place. Took a bus there from my hotel and I was surprised that it was in such a residential looking area. The place was pretty full for a late weekday night, but sat at the counter after we ordered. I definitely did not order correctly. I went with steak/mushrooms/onions (no cheese, SUPER REGRET, because I was sick and didn't feel the dairy). My bf had steak/cheese/mushrooms/onions/hot & sweet peppers. His was 100x better than mine. I made him switch with me halfway because I was unhappy with mine. Definitely get cheese (I seriously don't know what I was thinking that night). Without the cheese my sandwich fell apart in one bite. All the steak and mushrooms/onions fell out of my bun and my bun fell apart :( Oh and during my interview the next day, I mentioned that I went to Dalessandros the night before and my interviewer said it was THE place for philly cheesesteaks. She said that Ginos/Pats were more touristy.
