The food reminds me of Grandma's Sunday Meal. Not in a good way. Grandma sometimes forgets some important ingredients. The red sauce was great. Very tasty! As for the meatballs? Very bland. Which surprises me. Don't get me wrong their tender. Just the way they should be made but the flavor of the meatballs should hold on their own. You have to do a "no sauce test" to understand what I mean. As for the price? It should be less.
