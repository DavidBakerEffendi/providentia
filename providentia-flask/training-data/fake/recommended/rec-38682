Came in for Sat AM brunch. Great Irish Pub atmosphere. Euro Soccer games on TVs. Bloody Mary tasted great. Service was friendly and prompt. Molly got the French toast "bites" which were big sections of baguette, which don't translate very well to French toast. They werent very hot, and didn't have very good French toast flavor. Presentation was nice though. I got the meat lovers omelette...loaded with meats, but not very hot, and would have been nicer with some more melted cheese inside to hold things together. Would definitely come back again later in day to sample Irish beers and try lunch/dinner options.
