This review is for delivery. Although this may not be our FAVORITE pizza, it's consistently good, and they deliver, which most places don't. Not only do they deliver pizza, they have a full menu of salads, sandwiches, burgers, italian, and greek food - and really decent wings. I haven't found anyone else that delivers all those options, and I love greek food. Their spinach pie is great! The only thing I ordered there and was disappointed was the Souvlaki on a pita, the souvlaki was great, but the pita got super soggy and not edible in the takeout box. I would suggest ordering the Souvlaki, but have them pack the pita separate in foil. I'm not sure why this place got such bad reviews, we order from them all the time.
