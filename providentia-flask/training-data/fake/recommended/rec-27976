Tastes just like Chicken !!   Chicken the way it's SUPPOSED to taste,  Up until now, Diener's at the RTM has been my go-to rotiss chix place downtown, and it is still killer. Don't get me wrong.  Rotisseur, though, is in a class by itself.  The skin, of course, is the best part, and it is VERY savory.  Diener's can be a little sweet, and I don't mind that, but this bird was brilliantly seasoned.  Also, the breast meat was bursting with juice. All too often, I stick to thighs to avoid tofu-like yardbird, but these folks have their ingredients and method down.  I had a half bird with two sides (both carbs.)  Mac and cheese was both creamy and stringy and obviously had a thought-out blend.  Real fresh bread crumbs on top was a nice touch.  Roasted potatoes could have benefited from sitting below the spinning chickens and bathing in the schmaltz, but alas, they were just nice, tender, well-seasoned spuds.  Probably healthier that way ..  Staff was VERY friendly and efficient.  I couldn't finish all my sides (not because they weren't tasty, but the portions were quite generous.  Will definitely go back when I'm in the Rittenhouse Square area.
