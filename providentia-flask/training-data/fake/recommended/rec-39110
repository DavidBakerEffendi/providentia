For the adventuresome palate.  Not one of my favorite places to eat dinner in the city, but worth one trip.  The food is okay, rather complicated, but the fried oysters were fascinating and the fish dishes were very good.  The chef tries a little too hard to combine flavors and is successful in some attempts but not in others.  Their wine selection is very particular, leaning toward dry and rather bitter.  The bar and cocktail areas are really nice and the decor is very cool, so I would definitely go back, just not for food.
