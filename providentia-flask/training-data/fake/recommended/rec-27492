Went here with my wife and neighbors last Friday night. Never been here before but was very impressed. The ambiance was nice and the decorations felt well-placed -- like the tin ceiling, the Mobil Pegasus sign and the ceiling fans run by pulleys and a single rotor. There was a wall decked out like an Italian grocery store, probably a homage to the location being previously home to Manganaro Grosseria Italiana. We had a bottle of Nero d'Avola. We also had grilled Portuguese sardines, burrata (wood fired peppers), wild boar & veal meatballs as well as two pizzas for the table -- though I can't recall the name exactly, but it had squash, eggplant and was good and crispy. I noticed from the menu that they feature sausages from Esposito's Finest Quality, just two shops down. I thought it was a nice touch to support neighborhood products. They also had pasta dishes and other entrees, all seemingly well priced. Of note, they have this double wood-burning oven, one for pizza and one for roasting meats and fish. The pizza cooks in like 90 seconds, so said one of the guys who works there. Thumbs up, way up.
