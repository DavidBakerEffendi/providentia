Came here on Sunday for brunch. TOTALLY a hidden gem! There was a wait when I got there but I only had to wait 20 minutes to get seated. Each plate comes with either coffee, oj, and a choice of either a bloody mary or a mimosa. Within 10 minutes of ordering, they brought out our food. The nutella and banana pancakes were great! I also ordered the salmon hash I believe it was called and it was great, I would've loved for it to have more flavor though! Overall this place is great for brunch. Service is amazing, and the food is great! Totally coming back next time I'm in the city.
