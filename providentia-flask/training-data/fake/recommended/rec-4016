In a city characterized by impersonal service and overrun with mediocre diners, Tom's is a beacon of warmth and uncommon attention to detail.  Every patron is greeted and waved off personally by the owner, Gus, and in between is served promptly by a friendly staff.  The crab cakes and eggs are unbelievable. Sorry to disappoint, but contrary to the implication of the signed lyric sheets pasted around the walls, Suzanne Vega did not write "Tom's Diner" about this place, but about the more famous Manhattan "RESTAURANT."  In her own words (from measureformeasure.blogs.…): "When I was at Barnard College in Manhattan, I used to go to Tom's Restaurant for coffee, and after I graduated I also ate there before going to work. It was then a cheap, greasy place on 112th and Broadway, and it still is, in spite of its celebrity. (Sorry, but I have never been to the one in Brooklyn, though I hear it's really cute. The real one isn't cute, and isn't atmospheric. It's just plain, which is why I liked it.)" I don't need Suzanne Vega to agree with me anyway.
