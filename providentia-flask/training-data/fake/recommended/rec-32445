Review based purely on the pho and not overall experience.  The place is tiny and can be extremely cramped but well established amongst Asians in the area as the best pho around.  Broth is top notch.  Beef is good quality relative to many other pho options.  They keep it simple, and tend to use higher quality ingredients than other places around.  Pratt and Whit people make up a good portion of the lunch crowd regularly.  Definitely worth sitting elbow to elbow.
