Sat outside last night with a friend and had a wonderful meal.  For the two of us we ordered the edamame, tempura shrimp, scallop with crepe and two rolls.  Everything was delicious.  I was surprised by the large serving of shrimp tempura, we couldn't even finish it. The shrimp were delicious with an amazing sauce over.  The rolls were fresh and delicious.  The service began slow, took about 8 minutes for someone to get us drinks and tell us about specials, but then we had three people checking on us thoroughly the night.  It was a very busy Friday night.  We forgot wine, but were offered complimentary sangria...we had to glasses each, it was delicious.  I will definitely go back.
