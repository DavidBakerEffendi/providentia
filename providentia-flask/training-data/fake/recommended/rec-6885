My husband and I tried The Pines for dinner last night and had a wonderful experience. The service was very attentive and the assortment of dishes we tried were delicious. It is on the pricier side, but I think the attention to detail and service warrants the cost.   The menu changes daily, but if you see the cabbage salad as  an option, try it out - surprising flavor profile of spicy and sweet.
