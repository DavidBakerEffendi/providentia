WOW, despite the unassuming look and feel of the restaurant, the food was just shy of a Fine Dining experience. I must say that I was so pleasantly surprised I have told a dozen people in 24 hours. I sat outside at a small table and had impeccable service from start to finish, I wanted for nothing and most of the time the server anticipated my requests. I didn't even have to flag down or search for the server once. It's funny though as I rarely saw them...but they were obviously keeping an eye on my. Kudos. I started with the Wild Mushroom soup. Served quick and hot, this hearty concotcion was delicious. I fought with myself between scarfing it down like someone that hadn't eaten in a week and savoring every last bite. Then came the Coq Au Vin. Its been a while since I've had this dish as the last time I did I was extremely disappointed (I only wish I knew about Bistro Les Amis back then). My hats off to the Chef/cook...this was hands down the BEST Coq Au Vin I have ever had. The meat literally fell off the bone. Every mushroom had just the perfect taste with the wine sauce. On the side with the chicken, sauteed string beans with garlic, a perfect match with the meal. I literally ate every bite and even wiped up the juice/sauce with the bread. Purely delightful gastronomical experience. My only complaint is aimed towards me in that I was so full i couldn't eat dessert. Given how incredible everything else was, I can only imagine what I missed. A MUST visit for anyone in the area. Amazing food...I would recommend it to anyone. My total meal came to $28 without alcohol. Normally this would be a tad bit expensive...but given the taste and service I feel like I got away without paying full price. You gotta try this place. To Bistro Les Amis, excellent job, delectable food and impeccable service. Whatever it is you are doing ...you got it right and keep up the good work. I will patronize your place every-time I am in Soho...a new personal favorite.
