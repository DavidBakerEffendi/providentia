Went for the highly acclaimed wings and all I can say is that it definitely lived up to their excellent reviews. I had the chunky garlic wings which many people recommeded and it was soooo freakin good!! Another plus: the bartender has a wonderfully heavy hand. My drink kicked a**!! Just as a heads up, the place is small and doesn't seat many people and it's always packed. Went for lunch on a weekday and every seat including bar seats were occupied. A true testament to how awesome this place is.
