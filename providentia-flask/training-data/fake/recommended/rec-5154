I live pretty darn close to this restaurant and my two roommates and I didn't want to go far for dinner. One roommate is from Texas, the other from Kansas City so they've got some experience eating some quality BBQ food. Given that this was its opening night, I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt. However, the quality was really not that impressive. I ordered ribs but they were out so I got brisket instead and I didn't get much flavor from the meat. The sauces were too watery for my taste and I'm not a fan of vinegar based sauces. The potato salad was just okay and I wish the bread it came with was more like toast. Service was great and that's mainly why I'm giving the place 2 stars. For how much I paid, I wasn't satisfied with how much food I got. I spent around the same amount last night at Pork Slope and couldn't even finish my meal. Plus, it was delish. I'll probably give this place another chance as I see people are giving it 5 stars. But, I'm not necessarily rushing to go back.
