After admiring Yakitori Boy from afar (like three years 'afar'), I finally had a chance to go Saturday night! My friend and I made a reservation for 9 PM, so we missed the busy dinner rush.  Before I continue, check YB's "contact" section on its website about where to park; fortunately my friend was able to park safely around the corner in a lot which didn't seem to charge.  Anyway, she and I were taken care of by the knowledgeable and sweet Alan.   For our appetizer, we could not resist the 10 piece Chef's Choice Yakitori Appetizer. She ordered the Chicken Teriyaki bowl and I had the Yaki Tako (squid) along with a Lobster sushi.  The only letdown is that YB does not serve brown rice which isn't a deal breaker personally.  I think they could satisfy more palettes by adding this option.  Collectively, our food choices looked and tasted phenomenal. We ended with the Crème brûlée and strawberry mochi, both delicious and incredibly satisfying *without* being heavy.  In total our bill was $45.88 (after tax); not bad for two people. Now, what is a visit to Yakitori Boy without the karaoke bar upstairs?  Our Cranberry Vodkas were $7 apiece, so I'd say it was (somewhat) reasonable.  My friend and I were very entertained by the karaoke and ended up being invited into a private karaoke room by a coworker for a birthday.  We came, we drank, we sang! The waiters were incredibly attentive to the room and seemed to get a kick out of our singing.  We ended up leaving before 2 AM, but we had such a blast even though some parts of the song selecting were confusing. I can't wait for my next trip to Yakitori Boy!
