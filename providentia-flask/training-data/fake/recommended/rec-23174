With a very small town feel, this is good place to come and grab a bite.  I'd been here a couple times, and most recently came for prime rib night.  The prime rib was a good cut, but it was cooked more well done than I (and others) had asked for.  The vegetables were fresh, cups refilled timely, and service is always friendly.  The ice cream and store-made chocolates after dinner are delightful.  Overall, friendly service, good food.  But I'm not sure I'd be back for prime rib night.
