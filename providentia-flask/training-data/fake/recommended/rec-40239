What can I say!!!!   Best Mussels anywhere!! The only decision is whether to get Red or White... Last several visits .. Been RED!!!!!  I cant even bring myself to order Mussels anywhere else!!!! Latest visit yesterday My sons birthday coming from a Flyers game.. and excited to watch the Seahawks I'm a fan from way back and wanted to experience the win on Chickies huge TV!!  Of all my numerous visits I never realized they have a secret section all the way in the far corner with really nice cozy booths!!! Our waitress Melanie was very accommodating and also had the TVs in our section fixed for us to watch  the Football game. .. Her service was excellent .. The food was awesome including Clams, Mussels, roast pork and a parm sandwich everyone was pleased .. No Crab Fries this  time !! Maybe since I had to wait 30 minutes at the Eagles game in line freezing for them last Saturday!!!!!  Only complaint for the appetizer was not enough chips for the overwhelming toppings on the cheese steak nachos... When I asked if could purchase extra chips I was told $9.99..NOT..Next time ill bring my own!  LOL........Chickies is an awesome good time and always exciting atmosphere!!!  Great place to watch a game, celebrate a Birthday or just stop for a quick bite!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
