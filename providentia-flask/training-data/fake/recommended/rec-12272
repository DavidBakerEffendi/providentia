I recently went to Penelope for a lunch with family. I wanted to first try Penelope out for their breakfast or brunch.   I've heard gr8 things about their brunch and breakfast, but by the time I made it to Penelope, it was close to 3pm on a weekday.   The place was full when I arrived.  A short wait was included.  One of the first things, I noticed when I arrived was the noise level.  It was noisy.  I was not turned off by the noise, I just noticed it.  I could imagine that it wold bother some people.   The place had a laid back feel.  The staff has a relaxed dress code, and they are not at all uptight.  In NYC, I've noticed that some popular brunch places, can sometimes have an snotty staff.  I thought everyone in Penelope was friendly.  Especially, our server.  She was great. I started with one of their salads.   For my main  order, I was stuck between two items on the menu.  Their veggie burger, and their "fakin bacon" BLT.  I really enjoy homemade veggie burgers.  I've had alot of veggie burgers.  I gotta say, it's not really easy to make a great one.  I've had good & bad veggie burgers, but it's not often I had great veggie burgers.   With that in mind, I choose the BLT.  The veggie bacon was smoky in flavour.  It definitely was a good choice.  The sandwich was paired with great bread and came with french fries as a side.    I also order a glass of their sangria.  The sangria was OK. I was really full.  I didn't get a chance to try their any of their cakes, but the cakes were nicely displayed.   Penelope is definitely a place to check out.  A friendly staff, with a diverse and tasty menu.   .
