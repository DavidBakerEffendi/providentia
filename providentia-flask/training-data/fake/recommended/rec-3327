Best Thai restaurant in the Hartford area.  Has traditional Thai fare. Quiet home style interior.  Quaint and quiet.  Service is alright, sometimes they're in the back and don't see you walk in. Best of all, its BYOB and no bottle/cork fee.  I bring a double size red wine and get plastered all the time here.  Can't beat that.
