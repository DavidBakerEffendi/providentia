Hit or miss but they strive to uphold their reputation. I had excellent pizza here twice, OK pizza twice and a completely hideous near raw pie experience - along with sketchy service circled by some bitter barracuda's and one trixie who must have marinated in her cologne while squeaking the word "like" every minute. The manager caught this, moved us to a near repeat performance. The very undercooked pie came, enough was too much - we left. Â When leaving the manager stopped us, comp the meal & bar tab and offered a free invite including bar tab if we gave them another chance. It took a couple months but it was just an ok meal. Over the past few years this place has changed and they're clearly striving to keep their Top 20 ratings, but when the consistency swings this wildly it's just a matter of time when the traffic will move on. The smaller round pies have Always been better then the thicker rectangle pies. The ingredients and crust are top notch but many times the cooking has ruined the pie. It has a cool vibe & personality but stay away on a Friday/Saturday evening or you'll end up in a scream fest - the place has super loud ricocheting acoustics. It's so loud it's ridic. It's on Stone street which feels like old Europe, especially cool in the summer with all of the outdoor seating from the other eateries.
