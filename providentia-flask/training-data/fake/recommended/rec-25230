The Good: - Spinach Gnocchi (very moist gooey gnocchi in a delicious gorgonzola sauce). - Great house wines very decently priced (carafe with 3 glass portion for $18). It's as good as a byob. - The complimentary bread they offer is perfectly soft and moist. - An appetizer with arugula and mozzarella pressed in a flat bread, I forget the name. It was great. - Decent desserts, liked the Panna Cotta and Tiramisu. - Decent portions. I sometimes skip the appetizer and am still full. - Had tried the special mushroom pasta once, that was great too. The Bad: - They do not take reservations over the phone for a party of two. So if I happen to reach there after 7:30pm there is always at least an hour's wait. And this is on weekdays. Weekend evening is a longer wait. But I find the occasional long wait acceptable. The soft gooey gnocchi, wine and bread with a good friend and great conversation makes up for it :)
