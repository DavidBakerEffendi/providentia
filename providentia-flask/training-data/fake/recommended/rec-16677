Yes it was awesome. Food was wonderful. Yes it was tight (5 of us squeezed on a table meant for 2) but after a 2 1/2 hour stream of amazing dishes none of us complained. Highlights were definitely the paneer, scallops and strawberry dessert. We called the day before for a reservation for 4 and wanted to add a 5th, after consulting with the chef they obliged, so thank you! The staff was exceedingly nice and explained everything and we all left completely satisfied.
