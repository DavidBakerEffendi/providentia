What can I say about this simply awesome neighborhood more-than-just-(DELICIOUS)panini-place? Having been to this place more times than the amount of digits on a normal set of hands and feet, I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed (I've only checked in 9 times, usually because I've been so eager to dig into my meal). Service is always spot on, food always hits the spot. Forgive me in advance, but I don't remember the numbers of the panini's, so I'll just stick with descriptions because all are unique enough that you can't be mistaken. I usually get the salmon panini (which is by far the most popular one from what I hear), but I've been branching out recently and the panini with bacon and ranch dressing is absolutely to die for. Though, if the name is any indication, panino Rustico prides itself on panini's, don't be scared to try a delicious wrap. I suggest the Caesar wrap. I usually end the meal with a double espresso and one of their sweet crepes, (they have savory crepes, but I have yet to try one) of which the lemon and sugar crepe is amazing. In a nutshell, food is always great, service is always great, Panino Rustico is ALWAYS great! Try it, you'll be hooked.
