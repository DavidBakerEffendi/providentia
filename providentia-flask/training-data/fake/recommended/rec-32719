The Pizza: 5 stars The dine-in service: 1 star Average of 3 stars... They need to step their game up w the wait staff. The first time we ever ate Luna Pizza was literally the worst dining experience ever and we go out to eat a lot... The two girls that were working were either a: the dumbest girls ever or b: lazy as fuck. Either way I'm not even going to get into the specifics bc it's just gonna piss me off more. But! The pizza is soooo good! We order from them all the time so we can avoid the dumb waitresses and still have the delicious pizza. It's the way to go. Also ps don't waste money on their "garlic bread with cheese" or whatever it was. It sucked.
