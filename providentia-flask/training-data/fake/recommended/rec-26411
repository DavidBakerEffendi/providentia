Location in Harlem is so much better.  This location needs help. Hurry! We tried to make reservations for 16 but was told they were booked.  So we decided to go early knowing we would have to probably wait 2 hours.  Which we were fine with and which is exactly what they said when we arrive. An hour and 45 minutes into waiting they said they had a table for most of us. But we would still have to wait for another table to be open.  So as some of sat down and some of stood next to our table. We noticed that they had no clue where the rest of our party would be sitting and then asked if the rest of our group can be seated in another far table.  Um, why didnt you say asked before.  Then the snotty male manager comes over and asked why we didn't make reservations. And made a point that we didnt wait 2 hours yet as we were told.  As I am writing this review I am reminded of what a jerk the manager was, and minus another star.  I felt bad for the Birthday Girl who dealt with the ...So finally a table behind our table was leaving and we had to ask if our other party can be seated there instead of the table they suggested. Food was only ok and that is where you have your 2 stars.  But cold. Why are your chicken wings cold?   So, we finally finish our food and was wanting our MIA waiter to bring out our cake.  30 minutes later they did.   This place is suppose to cater to large groups.  Family Style!  Please at least have a plan before seating half of the group.  Then making the party feel like it was their fault for choosing this restaurant.  We wouldn't have mind waiting til you had a good plan.   Dammit I like your convenient location.  Get it together.
