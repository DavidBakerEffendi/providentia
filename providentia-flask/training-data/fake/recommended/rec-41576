Last Friday night, i had dinner at Up Thai, my newest favorite restaurant, for the first time. All week long, I dreamed about the Thai crepe dumplings and came back for more tonight. What a wonderful and surprising mix of savory flavors! Wonderful service, full bar, dramatic lighting, eclectic music. I'll be coming back again this weekend with my good friends!
