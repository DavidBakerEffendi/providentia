If you're patient and love meatballs, then this cozy little LES spot is for you! The first time I went (only 3 days after they'd opened) we had to wait over an hour at 6PM on a Tuesday. And unfortunately, after visiting recently, the wait has only gotten worse. However, if you're willing to wait (or just go awkwardly early on a week day), then you will be glad you did. Keep in mind the staff isn't exactly the type to baby you and/or help you out with the menu but it's pretty easy: Pick some meatballs, pick some sides, and wait for the deliciousness to come to your table. Must Try: Spicy Pork Meatball
