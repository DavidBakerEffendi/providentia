I have been here numerous times since moving to the city. I love it! Sitting inside or outside it is always a wonderful experience. I was here not too long ago and just loved my server Laura, she was very helpful with helping us pick out what to eat and every recommendation was right on point! Great experience and I would recommend to anyone -if you have not been to zavino, you must go!
