My favorite bar in New York! I absolutely LOVE this place. The atmosphere, the drinks, the food, the bartenders, it's all on point. I'm obsessed with the Ginger Smash, the fresh pineapple totally makes the drink. Last time I visited EO I also had dinner, the waitress was really awesome and suggested some really great items, including the crispy skate paprik√°s, which was amazing! When an obnoxious drunk guy came over to interrupt my friend and I's meal the waitress could tell I was really annoyed and when I got up to go to the bathroom she chased me down and brought me a shot of tequila for her and I, saying she could tell I needed one as bad as she did. So obviously, this place gets me. Sit at the bar and enjoy conversation with people you came with, people you just met sitting next to you, or any of the really friendly bartenders. However, beware if you ask Steve the bartender to take a photo for you.. you might end up like me, with the bartenders hijacking your phone and taking no telling how many of themselves. It's all in good fun at EO though!
