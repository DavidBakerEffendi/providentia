I can only hope the food stays this good for as long as this place is open, which I hope is for a very long time. Got an order to go of a half rotisserie chicken season in herbs de provance -DELICIOUS! Very fresh, with hints of lemon and garlic. Sides tasted were the cauliflower and the mashed potatoes with kale. Worst thing I can say is that we didn't get enough, although that should have satisfied 2 people, it was so delicious I wanted more. Get the clementine soda as well, not too sweet and refreshing! Best place to come to Murray Hill in a while.
