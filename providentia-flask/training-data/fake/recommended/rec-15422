Ok I was excited for this restaurant but I seriously don't get all the hype. The food wasn't that great and came in small portions. It was bland yet expensive for the amount. The service is kinda slow but they're super nice. They make conversation with you, so that's a plus. Also, the interior is beautiful. One thing I hated is that they charged you $3 per person for asking them to bring out a pre bought cake. BUT I PAID FOR THE CAKE. Of course, not from them so they need to make a profit. BS. But not a lot of restaurants I went to do that. That was upsetting. Just come here for a drink, but don't stay for the food.
