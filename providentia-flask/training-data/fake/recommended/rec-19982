I think Bijan is hit or miss. I see the potential, but I didn't get the same experience as others. The server, who did admit that she was new, was unable to answer many questions. The Persian-spiced chicken wings (fried, sweet, sticky and spicy) were finger-licking good. The mashed potatoes (rustic) and haricots verts (delicious, but not enough) that came with the pistachio-crusted salmon (dry, didn't taste that fresh, under-seasoned and there was no "crust") were divine. The classic burger (1/2 short ribs and 1/2 ground chuck) came extremely overcooked for medium; it was dry and we just didn't like the taste. The home-cooked potato chips were good. On the plus side, nothing was overly salted. The space is thisbig, but extremely cute with a fireplace, chaise lounge and branches that serve as ceiling fixtures.
