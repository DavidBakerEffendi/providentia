My mom and I decided to stop by for brunch due to great reviews on Yelp. By all means did our experience live up to them. Our food was delicious and the service was great. I ordered their popular dish Farmer's Skillet and my mother had their griddle cakes. The owner/chef was kind enough to greet us and ask about our food/service. I will definitely come back to support a black business!
