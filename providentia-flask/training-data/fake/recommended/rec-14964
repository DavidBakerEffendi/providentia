My friend had ordered their lamb burger a few weeks ago and let me try a bite; it was so juicy and delicious, I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I came last night and decided to try it. While it was tasty, it certainly wasn't as juicy as the one my friend had prior. The tzatziki sauce was good, but a little sparce. I think they could have put a little dish of this on the side instead of directly on the burger for those (like me) who just wanna slather it on. It came with thick pickles on top (yum!) and jalapenos (not sure why?!? they don't list them on the menu and it seemed an odd combination with the lamb), plus a side of curry ketchup which I dabbed a little bit on and it added a nice kick. I think they should maybe throw a little Feta on this bad boy too - that would taste AMAZING! Oh, and per my earlier comments re: giant beers - I definitely intimidated a guy who declared that his beer looked wimpy next to mine. Awesome :)
