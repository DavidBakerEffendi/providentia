Yep, my first trip to Philly, I had to come and visit the landmark cheesesteak battleground. Since I was with family, we decided to split up and attack both places separately, meet up and share once we had some grub in our hands. Mom and I headed to Geno's. I really dig the decor, colors and vibe. It felt like Philly to me. It was lunch time, but not too crowded, just steady. I ordered two provvy "wit." At 9 bucks a steak, I was hoping for a hit. The best things about the steaks were definitely not the steak. The wrapping paper had more flavor than the meat. Yet, the bread was very fresh, crisp outside, soft inside, and the onions had a perfect saute. They weren't finely chopped, rather a nice big dice on 'em. I love onions that way. I think next time I'll order the whiz cheese b/c the provvy didn't do it for me. Great story to prove the cheesesteak feud is truly real. My mom forgot to have me order mushrooms for her steak. So, she took her Geno's steak in 'the other place's' wrapper since we were sitting at the competitions table and eating their fries (which RULE, btw) and walked up to their window to order some 'shrooms. I repeatedly said, "don't do it!" Alas, she didn't listen. One whiff or glance at the sandwich in her hand and they yelled "that ain't our steak, and we ain't puttin' our mushrooms on it!" Poor mom's ruse never stood a chance.
