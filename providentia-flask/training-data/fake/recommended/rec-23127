Amazing!!! By far the best restaurant in Princeton. Everything we tried was delicious. As starters: -Calamari was perfect, crispy, flavorful. I don't even like squid! -Crab and guacamole martini was unique and yummy, it made me wish that guac always came with crab!!! -New England clam chowder was great. Main course: -Lobster was great! Although it was my first time eating a whole lobster so I have nothing to compare to -Escolar and Alaskan Salmon mixed grill: so delicious I can't even express how good it was Service: Great. The hostess tried to seat us in the back next to the loud kitchen, but let us pick our own table when we asked. Waiter was helpful and friendly. Our food came in a timely manner and everything was very professional. Prices are definitely high but, for the quality of the food, I think Blue Point Grill is much more affordable and worth the money than other high-end restaurants in Princeton (*Agricola*).
