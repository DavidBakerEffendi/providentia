Another in a long list of restaurants that are good, but not amazing.  And when you're in Manhattan, why settle for anything less than extraordinary? Went here for dinner a few weeks back.  Got sat quickly, service was solid, food was ok.  Ate some fish, drank some beer.  The soup appetizer was probably the best part of the whole thing.   The details of my experience here will quickly be lost amongst the clutter of other so-so places I've dined.  My brain simply doesn't have room for run-of-the-mill.
