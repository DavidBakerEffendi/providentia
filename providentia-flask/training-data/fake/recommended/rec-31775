I've had two visits. One on Christmas Eve with a larger group of 10 and another this past weekend. Both times the food was very good. Although our lamb pita was pretty undercooked and a bit tough. We've had delicious sandwiches and pulled pork nachos and excellent sweet potato fries! Wish the beer selections had descriptions with the list to help narrow the choice. Excellent selection though. Definitely seemed like a place for the locals not a tourist trap. Very warm and inviting old building and decor. For our group visit the service was pretty good considering our size but the restaurant itself wasn't too busy. This weekend we had hot and cold waitresses. A previous reviewer stated lack of training, not so sure there, but definitely overworked. At one point I definitely felt as though we were "bothersome" to one of them and tried to say some things to make her smile. Slight improvement. I would go back again if in the area.
