4.5 stars, rounded up.  I've been a handful of times, and the last time I went, the food was so good that my fiancee and I asked to make another reservation (for Valentine's Day no less) on our way out.  The service was also lovely -- our waiter asked if we were there for a special occasion, which we weren't, but brought us a complimentary after-dinner drink anyway. Everything I've gotten here has been amazing, but the gnocchi, salmon, pork, and rack of lamb are stand outs.  The only negative is that this place is so far out of the way.
