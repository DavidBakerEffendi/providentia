My honey and I were on a long awaited vacation touring around Philly.  We "yelped" for places close to our hotel and decided to give this a try.  We started with some craft beers we don't normally have at home.  The list was pretty impressive.  We got the cheese plate appetizer, which was very fun, if you like cheese.   We also tried the hummus, which was ok (but I am a fan of garlicy hummus.)  We both got pasta dishes for dinner, which were good and had a slight "we are doing a different take on an old fave" quality.     We sat in the bar area, which we thought might be a problem, but on a Thursday night, turned out to be charming without being overwhelming and loud.  We really liked our server, she was very friendly and attentive to our needs.  The overall cost was pretty high, but as a special treat for us we went all out.  It was worth it for the ambiance and laid back atmosphere.   We relaxed and enjoyed every minute we were there.
