Salt and pepper isn't seasoning, this food is bland and tasteless at best, however, I can see why the masses enjoy this, it's halal food that caters for the american palate, it's basically grilled chicken/lamb and rice, my friends and I are torn against each other in the great halal debate of NYC. So some of us go here and some of us go elsewhere and we meet up again after our meal. Please don't flame me, this is just my open and honest opinion. Thanks.
