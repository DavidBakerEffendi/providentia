So, just a quick review of this place since I didn't end up eating there... Went to the bar to get dinner and some wine as I was eating alone... The menu looked good.  The food coming out looked good... but with the bartender's terrible attitude and tone, I just went next door and ate there.  If she didn't want to work... Go Home! So many places...  Not enough time to be treated like they don't have time to help you...
