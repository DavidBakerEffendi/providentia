HUGE FAN!  Amazing pizza.  Atmosphere is great, a bit dimly lit but I'm into that kind of vibe. Warning!  You will have to wait.  Quite a long time on weekends.  BUT! It is a.) worth it b.) if you go right as they open for dinner you'll likely get a seat right away or will wait for a minimal amount of time.  I recommend 5pm on a Sunday. What I love most about their menu is that they have an entire vegan section. I know what you're thinking, pizza...vegan.  But they're GREAT!  Usually a pizza joint will just douse the pizza in daiya, which sucks.  But Paulie Gee's actually took the time to have a well thought out excellent vegan menu, no daiya here!  Vegan menu is not a side thought, just great meat-free, dairy-free pizzas.  THEY MAKE THEIR OWN CASHEW RICOTTA AND VEGAN FENNEL SAUSAGE FOR GOODNESS SAKES! Non vegans I've taken there have loved their meaty-cheesy pizzas too.  Just great old school thin crust brick oven pizzas. Highly recommend: Greenpointer Red, White and Greenpeace In Ricotta Da Vegan Also, Paulie himself comes around to your table to make sure you're enjoying your pizza.
