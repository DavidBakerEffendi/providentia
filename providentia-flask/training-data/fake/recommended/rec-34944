I hate to give this place a bad rating because by comparison it is world's better than the crap Brother Bruno's throws at you, but Wayne Pizza would never survive anywhere else. If it does last, it will only be because the bar has been set so low. The pizza proclaims a "gourmet" origin, but it is terrible. It arrived cold after sitting in the oven for ten minutes and the conservative toppings have no flavor. Sorry. I'd say go down the road to something better, but there is nothing.
