Anyone who goes to William Paterson University has eaten here. This was my lunchtime spot during my college days. To start the pizza is excellent. Large slices that are not too thick and not too thin. I would definitely give this place a 4 star rating just on its pizza alone. The sandwich menu is excellent! A good size sandwiches for a reasonable price. Now that we have the basics out of the way let me tell you the real reason I go to this place. The sub steak sandwich! I love this sandwich and I can only find it at Brother Bruno. A sub steak sandwich is a cheese steak sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes mayo and onions. It is to die for! I am sure that any other place can make it ,if I explain it to them. But at Brother Bruno I don't have to explain it and they have been making it for years! Now the second reason I go to Brother Bruno is for the calzone. A small size calzone, just big enough for a quick lunch. Ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese and ham wrapped in deep fried dough with a side of sauce. The staff is friendly and the food is hot and delicious... what more could you ask for!
