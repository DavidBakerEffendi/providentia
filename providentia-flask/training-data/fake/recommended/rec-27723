I went back here after being contacted by the owner. My wife and I had the baby back ribs and fried chicken with crinkle cut fries. Â I must say, this time around was a night and day experience from the last time. The ribs fell off the bone, but were not overcooked. The chicken was meaty, and not spitting hot grease. The portion of fries was huge, and nice and crispy. While this still isn't my favorite batter for fried chicken, I'd recommend you try it because it is different than other places and all taste buds are different. Definitely try the ribs. The fries needed salt, but the way they are served you can add as much or as little as you want. I want to thank Scott for contacting me and being so professional about this. I could tell he really cares about his business and customers and that is respectable.
