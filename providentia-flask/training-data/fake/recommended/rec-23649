One of the best Falafels in town. Great service.. and quick for those who want take-out. Get the falafel with hummus and feta cheese sandwich! Comparable to Saad's, Hummus, and Maoz but all 4 are very different. Â This place is great to sit and eat with family as well. There are entirely too many places in the city trying to serve up falafels and only a few are worthy of a good review.. this would be one.
