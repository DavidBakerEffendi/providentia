I used to work for the Nevada Diner and I still go back when I'm in the mood for a Jersey diner. That HAS to say something about it! All I have to say is that the food is always fresh and made with quality ingredients. And the menu just goes on and on! You can pretty much get anything you want and they have some creative options that goes beyond your standard burger, fries or chicken fingers. They also provide a pleathera of healthy options as well. All their baking is done on the premisis as well. I recommend the chocolate dipped cheesecake! Staff are always friendly and they know how to keep your coffee cup hot!
