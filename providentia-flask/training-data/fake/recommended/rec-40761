I visited jones (during lunch) awhile back while visiting and found it spectacular. I got the tuna melt and my boyfriend the gumbo...delish. We both left happy, full, and not broke. Then we went again last valentines day. Don't get me wrong I'm not gonna blast em, they were super busy and that isn't anyone's fault, but our waitress forgot our bread pocket dealies. I like bread so i was a bit sad about that. She was so busy too we didn't see her the rest of the evening because other waiters and waitresses delivered our food and closed our check. I got the create your own salad, it was really good. But my boyfriend looked for the gumbo and it was no more. They replaced it with a jambalaya ...pardon me a rice pilaf covered in tabasco sauce and some small shrimps..I understand there is a recession and rice is more usable than okra...but wow this dish freaking sucked! Oh and don't get sat by the door ...we did... and little girls held the door open and we freezed our patooties off. Nothing like eating dinner in your fluffy jackets. Mmm romantic. I'm not saying don't go here. Just don't go here when it's busy, and don't order the jambalaya. Other than that Jones aint that bad.
