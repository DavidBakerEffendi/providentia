I went there for lunch with my wife and daughter. The menu wasn't very interesting a few sandwich choices and soups and salads. I had a potatoe soup, I've had better soup from a can and fo about 1/5th of the price. My daughter didn't finish her sandwich very unsatisfactory. High prices low quality. To be fair I didn't try the bake goods.
