Update: One of the girls working here is kind of short/rude. Asked for pizza topping- which I saw on a table a couple was already using- Oregano/crushed pepper... Whatever. Acted like she was offended I was asking if they had some behind the counter. News flash.. Your in the service industry, if you don't want to work, stay at home.
