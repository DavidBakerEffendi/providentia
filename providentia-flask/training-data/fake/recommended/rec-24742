I've been here a number of times and have never been disappointed.  The food is really good, as is the service.  It's a popular local spot and usually has a lot of patrons.  A friend of mine mentioned this place was quite good so I decided to try it out and have enjoyed it every time since. They have so many beers from around the world and drink choices to choose from.  Everything that my wife and I have ordered has been enjoyable. They seem to have a good number of vegetarian options for those who don't feel like having meat. I have to say some of their flavors are not what I expected when ordering Mexican cuisine but delicious none the less. I would recommend trying a few different things here but overall 4.5 Stars!!!
