Yum.  Super straightforward menu, good drinks (alcoholic and not), awesome food.  Meatballs are always delicious, the side of salad is so simple but tasty (is it the dressing? the apple slices?), and the numerous types of risottos I've tried here have never disappointed.  Despite the 30-45 minute wait, the food is always worth it.
