I planned my organization's holiday dinner and PUBLIC and could not have been more happy with the service from start to finish. The event planner, Kimberly, is warm, understanding, organized and incredibly helpful. The service at the dinner was equally incredible - just the right pace! Everyone (even uber food snobs!) had an absolute blast and adored the food. Thank you so much, PUBLIC! I highly recommend for planning events!
