After great bar service, I revisited for dinner. We had a reservation and the restaurant was not crowded. Â Still, it took 28 minutes to even order a drink! It took another 7 to get the drink. 35 minutes to place our order. Completely ridiculous "service". Food is okay. Service is terrible. We chose a booth which was very tight and uncomfortable for four adults. If I return for the food I will be eating it at the bar. It's a shame because the restaurant is beautiful and in a great location.
