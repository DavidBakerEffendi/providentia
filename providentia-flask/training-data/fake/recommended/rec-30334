This used to be our favorite brunch place in New York and the only one we'd travel out of our neighborhood for. We were there this weekend and unfortunately the food has gone way down hill. We both had the Cookshop scramble with smoked trout; it was tasteless and the eggs weren't fluffy like they used to be. It also used to be made with smoked salmon and the downgrade to trout for the same price is unfortunate. We also had an order of the home fries which had an odd taste which wasn't good. Unfortunately, the food was bad enough that we won't be going back despite the fact that our waiter was great.
