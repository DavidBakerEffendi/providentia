This is the perfect kind of fancy restaurant because, despite all the hoopla surrounding it, the food is really what you remember in the end. Every dish was standout and special. Even the risotto side, which we ordered as almost as a throw away kind of dish, was lick the bowl good. Harold was not there, so I did not get to kiss him. I considered deducting one star for this, but I decided to play fair.
