I am not Filipino but I love Filipino food! I'm an upper west sider so when I have a craving for Filipino I go to Grill 21. Their lumpiang shanghai sampler is the best. Last year I had my best friend's engagement party there and service was top notch. It was very quaint and they pretty much shut down the place in order to accommodate our big party. It was full of samplers, platters and plenty of San Miguel beer for just $25 per person. Everyone had a great time and we were able to decorate the restaurant with pictures of the bride to be. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone I know because it is quaint, affordable and close to all major modes of east side transportation. It is a place where you can bring your girl friends and talk for hours or bring your family. All in all best Filipino restaurant in the city hands down. No need to go to Queens to get good food. Stay local!
