This is my favorite restaurant. Period. And I am a vegetarian, so one would not imagine Austrian food at the top of the list. The food is fresh and delicious, the ambience is wonderful, the service quick and friendly, and the prices are not expensive. I take all my out of town guests here and 5 years after their brunch there, my parents still reminisce about the experience. My veg favorites are the simple, but delicious green bean salad, tomato soup, stuffed french toast, and possibly the greatest food item all time: their apple bread pudding. It is my crack. Â I love this place!
