My friend suggested we try this place and that it was "Number 2" in Manhattan - which initially made me cringe because such highly sought after places usually end up being pretentious and "a scene".  The Gander however, while popular and busy, was extremely classy and the staff incredibly polite.  I had mixed up the name under the table reservation, and they still were trying to accommodate me... and when our table was ready, I requested if we could sit at another table not to close to other tables, and the hostess was more than willing to re-seat us. Now to the food!  We ordered the Lobster Roll Charcuterie - wow that was something special!  We also had the brisket tots as a starter. For main, I had the Tasmanian Trout and it was absolutely fantastic!  The mixture of lentils with the chorizo on top of a perfectly cooked Trout was divine.  Last but not least, we had a side of the cauliflower, which if you like capers and vinegar-like dishes... you will be very happy with this one.  Dessert consisted of the Banana souffle dish which made our taste buds extremely happy all to be washed down with some of their great tea selections. The food is as good as it looks on the website pictures. I highly recommend The Gander for foodies, a date or a business meeting.  I can't wait to return!
