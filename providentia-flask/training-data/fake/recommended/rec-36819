Sometimes I like to treat myself to an afternoon snack of a dozen oysters & steak tartare, and I rotate between Balthazar and Blue Ribbon.  Not sure which I like better since both are fantastic.  Not sure I'd want to dine here during the dinner rush -- seems like it would be a bit too chaotic, but then again the waitstaff all seem quite professional.   I heard the breakfast is great, but I never wake up in time for it.
