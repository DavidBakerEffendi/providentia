My boyfriend almost dropped his pants at the concept... We got the 4bacon/4 caft beer flight- awesome! Get the homemade Lamb bacon! Wait to get the "sundae". I heard they are developing a HOMEMADE bacon Ice-cream and the machine I arriving in a few weeks!! Â  Right now it's vanilla ice cream w bacon peanut brittle if you wanna try that or the cookies in the meantime. Loved the rustic decor- they have a lotta TVs & superb service! Thanks Shani!
