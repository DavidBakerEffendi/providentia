Recently had the pleasure of dining here. When we arrived, the hostess seated us immediately (we had reservations but this doesn't happen often). I felt a little sorry for the couple ahead of us who was trying to do a walk-in. We were seated in one of the back "booths" against the left wall. The decor was minimal but warm and inviting. The waiter was very pleasant and helpful in answering our questions. For appetizers we tried the Spicy Duck Meatballs and Crispy Berkshire Pork Belly. The trumpet mushrooms with the pork belly was quite a food-gasm. I should point out that I have a severe weakness for mushrooms. And recently I've been gaining exposure to just how many varieties are out there! For our main courses we went with the Steak and Striped Bass. Delicious! The Striped Bass came with an edamame falafel. Yummy! Although we were full, you have to try the dessert. From past experience we knew we only needed to share one dessert and decided to go with the 'special' for the night - yuzu poundcake with basil infused cream and roasted strawberries. Score for the pastry chef. My only 'complaint' might be that the wine list was a bit limited but I still enjoyed my Riesling. I think the beer selection was more interesting. I think overall it's at a great location and I'm betting it's popularity is going to skyrocket soon.
