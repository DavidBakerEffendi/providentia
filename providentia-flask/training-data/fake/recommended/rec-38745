Valley thunder... I umm didn't like this sandwich at all. Tasted like old flavorless Mac and cheese and the meat was undistinguished from the melted cheese. I didn't even finish half of it :( My friend ordered the Brielle and that looked really good. I would definitely come again and try another sandwich it seems like they aim to make a quality product.
