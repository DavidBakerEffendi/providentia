If I go somewhere twice, it's generally because it didn't suck the first time. So, I'll give Perilla that much. The first time I went, the pork belly was astounding, the spicy duck meatballs didn't disappoint, and the hanger steak was extremely enjoyable. The cheese plate was skillfully assembled and the fresh donuts, served with custard and chocolate, were the perfect ending to a lovely meal. But more recently, the pork belly was gone, the much-vaunted meatballs were over-seasoned, and hanger steak is now on the menu of every "seasonal American" restaurant in the tri-state area. I had the special, Osso Buco, served with some wonderful glazed carrots, but the marrow (which I normally adore) coated my mouth in a nasty film. We didn't have time for dessert, and that marrow aftertaste stayed with me all night long (through a three-hour opera at the Met). One of my dining companions, who has Tabasco in her veins, choked on her much-too-spicy lamb. And the quail was dry. For shame, Perilla.
