COME HUNGRY!! I'm not kidding!  We stopped by for a birthday brunch on a Monday, and I wasn't prepared.  Not even close to prepared!  When the food came out, for three of us it was our first time at Sabrina's; our friend laughed at how wide our eyes got as we tried to figure out how we were going to eat all of the food.  My Special Stuffed French Toast was Flinstones big!  I'm so serious.  Pictures can't do it justice.  Even with four of us eating from it, we were only able to finish half.  The polenta fries?  Each fry was the size of one of the fat leggos you used to play with.  They were great, and they were fried, but they were blocks!  Yummy, tasty blocks, but blocks. Great, friendly service, totally reasonable prices given the serving size, and tasty food.
