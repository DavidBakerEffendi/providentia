I've now had Pho in Boston, NYC, and all around San Fran & San Jose, but Pho 501 has a certain je nes sais quoi.  I never got tired of the Saturday morning spicy beef noodle soup with ox tail. I think they've got a good recipe, it's family owned with the same cooks making consistently delicious broth, they've usually got a long line even on weekday lunch hours, grandmother can be seen in back doing prep work...  Good ethnic food is hard to find in CT, so don't hesitate to try this place.
