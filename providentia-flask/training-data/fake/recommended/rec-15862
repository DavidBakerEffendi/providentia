Hands down, this is probably the best value in town. The food is simply deliscious because it's all about the ingredients and preparing them right not more and not less.  The winelist is plentyful with something for everybodys taste and budget.  I've been going there since it opened several years ago.  My heart sunk when it was mentioned in the Michelin Guide because my secret place was no longer that.
