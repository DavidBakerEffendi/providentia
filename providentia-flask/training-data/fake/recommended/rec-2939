My Brooklyn friends rave about this place and we finally got to go without a huge wait.  Their lunch specials are good- ranging from $5-$8 or so.  We started out with guacamole that was top of the line.  It came with crispy tortillas instead of chips- different and I like it. Normally, I'm not a big quesadilla fan.  If I want that, I'll make a grilled cheese.  But, the flor de calabaza quesadilla came highly recommended from good sources so I gave it a shot.  SO good.  Best quesadilla I've ever had, hands down.  Stop trying everyone else!  If I were to go back, I'd order like 10 of these.  Also ordered a fish taco which was really subpar compared to guac and quesadilla. The restaurant is tiny (my Philadelphia coming out) but it's adorable on the inside. Price was right, great service, excellent food.  Def a 5 star experience.
