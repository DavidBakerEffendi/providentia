This is one of the few places in NoLibs that opens prior to noon on a weekday, so we decided to give it a try on a frigid day. There were a few people already at tables, and by the time we left even more tables were filled. Â This would be a cool place to come on Day of the Dead, I think. Went with blood orange margaritas which were fantastic and ended up with Snap and Ginger beer (I have wanted to try it since I knew it existed) which was delicious. I had the smoked chicken burritos and my galpal had the skirt steak burrito. We shared an order of guac to add to our burritos which was YUM! I would definitely go back here again, and am glad I tried it.
