I love falafels and if you do too, this is definitely somewhere you should try!  I wasn't sure what to expect because I've generally always eaten at very traditional falafel restaurants. But Taim is wonderful!! I got the falafel sandwich and substituted the pickled cabbage for tabouli salad. The service was great, they were very friendly and accommodating.  Our food came our in a timely fashion, hot and fresh!  There wasn't one part of the sandwich that I didn't enjoy. The tahini was amazing, the falafels (I got the green ones) were delectable, and the hummus tasted like it was homemade.  Topped off with the tasty tabouli that I couldn't get enough of.  I can't rave enough about this cute spot. Definitely the place to go if you want a great fresh and authentic tasting falafel.
