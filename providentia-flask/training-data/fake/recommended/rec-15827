I am not usually fond of small plate restaurants, I feel as if they leave much to be desired. Tink's might have opened my world to a whole new way of dining. Their menu has a variety of stick to your ribs food, and they find a way for you to always want more! Their ricotta gnocchi and braised sirloin ravioli are absolutely delicious. Wash it down with their rosemary lemonade and you will be in heaven. I have already been back twice, and am looking forward to stopping by for brunch.
