As a bookstore, I absolutely adore Atticus. When I visit I tend to spend hours browsing through their small yet great selection of books. Aside from an occasional "10% off hardcovers" or the like, don't expect any discounts. The cafe? Never eaten there, so I can't give a complete review. They have started treating the cafe area like a restaurant via a "Please wait to be seated" sign. Perhaps it was to make sure people are not lingering in the cafe area reading although... it's a bookstore! I understand it's small, however I prefer to browse through books before I buy them. My solution: sit on the floor next to the bookshelves haha. They do in fact have $1 coffee! I didn't get any because they charge $.50 for a splash of soymilk, which is ridiculous. Last I checked, it didn't cost me $50 to buy a carton of soymilk. Worth mentioning is their t-shirt I bought yesterday. Atticus logo on front left and on the back it reads "Unattended Children Will Be Given Coffee and Unlimited Access to the Internet."
