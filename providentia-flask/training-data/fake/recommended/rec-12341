this is by far the best pizza in NY, well Brooklyn! Well worth the wait, although we got lucky and waitied 20 min. the pizza was Hella Good. i would definatly recommend coming here. i would love to come back here and eat again on my next visit. Im a thick crust lover myself, but the thin was very Good. Two thumbs Up!!
