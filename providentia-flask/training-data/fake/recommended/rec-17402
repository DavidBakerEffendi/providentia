Great food and atmosphere. Pros are the food,amazing sangria mixes all you have to do is bring the wine. They also have mojito mixes which I have to try next. Only con is the wait took an hour to be seated we were a group of 4. But the wait is worth it I recommend the Ropa Â vieja as main dish it was really really good yummmmm:)
