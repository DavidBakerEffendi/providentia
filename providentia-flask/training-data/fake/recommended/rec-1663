Came here after touring nearby Liberty Bell and Independence Hall with my team of 9 peeps. On a bit of a time crunch, tired and starving - our grumpy group requested philly cheesesteaks, a must for all our initial visits to Philly. Sonny's came up on yelp and was in walking distance. About a 5-10min walk. Beautiful day. Passed by other interesting eateries, we were on a mission. It was either Sonny's or Campos but we all chose Sonny's. Campos was just down the block. IT WAS A GREAT DECISION because it was so damn delicious. My lactose intolerance as of late has been steadily worsening and so I had a plain steak combo (includes fries+drink for ~$10). I had low hopes for the cheesesteaks without cheese but man oh man was it still amazing. The bread rolls were light, fluffy and the perfect density to soak up the grease of your thin sliced, fresh meat and onions. You are able to order it without onions as well. Those that enjoyed theirs with cheese (both wiz and provolone) also all thoroughly enjoyed theirs. Fries were amazing. Go heavy on the spicy mustard and you'll leave very content. Since then, we had tried out Pat's one of the many but one of the more famous cheesesteak eateries - which ended up with across the board disappointments from everybody in our 9 person group. We all still talk, dream and fantasize about our return to Sonny's. Which we fully intend to fulfill before we leave the area in early June. Come check this place out if you can! Awesome T-shirts here too :D
