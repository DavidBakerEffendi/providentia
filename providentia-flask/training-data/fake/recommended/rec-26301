Hmm...I really don't know what all the hype is about this place. The pizza was good but I don't think it's worth traveling all the way down there and then waiting in such a ridiculously long line. The way I see it, you should try it once just so you can say you've been there, done that but not wroth going back unless you live around the corner.
