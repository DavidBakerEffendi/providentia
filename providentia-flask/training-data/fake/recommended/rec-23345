I am confused why people dislike this place so much. I noticed the little touches that made me appreciate this place that my sister pointed out. For example, listing local farms where they get their food from (very SF). I also like that it wasn't crowded. I can understand why some may dislike the food here mainly because the menu is 'earthy', but everyone I was with including myself enjoyed it... Try the Ploughman's plate.
