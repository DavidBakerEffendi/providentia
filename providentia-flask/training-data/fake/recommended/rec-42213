5 Stars for EXCELLENT service. My fiance and I dined at Blue Ribbon in Park Slope this past Christmas Eve, not surprisingly the place was packed but that didn't stop the general manager from coming over after he saw the wine we just ordered. He politely introduced himself and continued to give us some interesting notes on our wine. The food came in a timely fashion and it also was good. Our waiter visited our table frequently and was extremely knowledgable on the menu. Upon leaving, the manager greeted us near the door and thanked us for coming in. Well done guys, we'll be back.
