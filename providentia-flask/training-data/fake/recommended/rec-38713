I'm in town for business and this place came highly recommended. Now I know why! Their appetizers are awesome....  that garlic cheesy bread is amazing. Their dinners are yummy too. I was with a group of 12, and everyone enjoyed their meal.  I had the chicken parm and liked it so much that I went back to try the grilled chicken. Both were great, portions are huge though. The service is outstanding, very accommodating to say the least. We all needed separate checks and our waiter didn't sweat it. I'd go back if in town again!
