Two visits, one after 8p on a Thursday for dinner and drinks (3 stars) and second, for Sunday brunch (5 stars!) So I am giving 4 stars as my overall rating. I am visiting from Baltimore. I came Thursday night with a girlfriend of mine who lives here. I had already eaten and stuck to wine, while she opted for a kale salad and brownie dessert. The kale salad was a little two "lemony" for our taste, and the calamari was average. The brownie was amazing! The drink prices were to be expected. The brunch, on the other hand, was amazing! We came Sunday morning. Mimosas were delicious. I would say that the seating in this place is a little tight, specifically in the evenings, but the brunch is definitely worth it.
