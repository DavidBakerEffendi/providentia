Overly-priced for tasteless food! That sums this restaurant up in a nutshell! For the appetizer, the portobello mushroom would have tasted the best if it weren't burnt. The special Spanish-style octupus appetizer tasted bland and slimey; the garlic shrimp appetizer had small, cheap shrimp that was drenched in butter. The supposed aged steak looked huge, thick and fanciful but lacked flavor. The salmon was dry and bland, I could go on and on! We finally ordered dessert, thinking at least something should taste good here and needless to say, the coconut gelato looked appealing in a real coconut shell, but tasted very artificial and was probably the worst gelato I have ever had in my life. Everything in this restaurant appears to be beautiful and delicious, but it is quite the opposite.
