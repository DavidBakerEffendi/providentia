I should have reviewed Almaz months ago but I go so frequently I always assume I'll do it the next time. It's a cozy spot with great food and service. The vegetarian Ethiopian platter is especially tasty with more variety than is even listed on the menu description. The portions hit the spot--I finish about 3 bites over where I should have stopped. And the family platter has *two portions* of each dish--a lifesaver because I become very selfish and mildly angry if my dinner companion starts to hog the Tikal Gomen.
