Just ordered dinner from here and it was very good. Two chicken wraps and a fried calamari app. The only reason to not give a 4/5 is that the wrap was not on lavash as stated on seamless- it was on a tortilla wrap. That totally bummed me out because the other place we like has a lovely wrap on this lovely thin lavash, better dressing, more veggies and is almost half the price. If i never went to the other place, I wouldn't have any complaints for this one because, the chicken was very good as was the calamari. Just not what I technically paid for...
