We came here because you can bring your own alcohol, but were pleased with the food and wine selection (had we not brought our own).  The most outstanding thing about our experience, however, was the extremely slow service.  It took almost five minutes of standing at the front of the little place to even see someone who worked there.  There apparently was only one waiter that night, which seemed odd since it was a Friday night.  He was very helpful and friendly, but could only do so much being the only one there serving an almost full house.  I would think the restaurant should staff more people on busy nights.  The lack of staff and the 45 minutes until we got any food aside, it was great!  The butternut squash ravioli stands out as a highlight.  They also had a list of deserts and I wanted to try all of them they sounded so good!  Maybe we came to them on an anomalous night with a one-person waiting staff, so try them yourself and see if it's the same.  The food is decent and the wine list (this coming from my sommelier friend whom we were with) is as well.
