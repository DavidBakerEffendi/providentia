MMMMmMmmmMMMMmmmmm!  I'm eating the Chipotle Shrimp Salad on this week's lunch special menu.  DELISH!  The spicy, smokey chipotle sauce on the shrimp is wonderful with the subtle, sweet homemade lime vinaigrette dressing.  I highly recommend this salad!  But order it soon... it's only on the menu this week!
