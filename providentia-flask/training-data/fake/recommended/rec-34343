I was there twice for their tuesday and friday "chat" buffets. Food was ok for the $15 we paid for the friday buffet. The puris (for the pani puris) were soft and non crispy...i guess they were left out in the open for a while. The wadas and rasam was great. The guys never asked us for a dosa...btw the chat buffet says that the dosa will be made to order but for those who dont know and dont ask, you will never get it. The rava dosa I ordered was great. Towards the end of the buffet, I ordered a mango juice for my son and a mango ice cream for myself and the mrs. The mago juice was warm and came in a tall glass with no straw. The mango icecream had a tiny single scoop and you could see the frost on top of the ice cream suggesting that it was lying in the freezer for months. I paid some $4.95 for the ice cream!!! Another observation: The service was sub par. No water offered. When I asked for water, it did not show up. When I walked over to the buffet table I noticed the server busy talking on his cell phone. The food was decent but the service was terrible. I am not sure whether I will visit this place again.
