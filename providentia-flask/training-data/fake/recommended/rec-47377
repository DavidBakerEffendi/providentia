This is about as good as it gets. LV came highly recommended by friends and it did not disappoint. Chef Andrew Carmellini nails it. I actually had a fantastic birthday dinner here and the menu looked incredible from top to bottom, I was salivating throughout the day leading up to the meal. Many times the build up doesn't deliver, but everything on there was tremendous and rich with flavor. This is a great location that is not too central to anything, but gets you down a few cobblestone streets over into the residential feel of TriBeCa. There are a few nice spots to grab a glass of wine before dinner, but that may not be necessary as there is a lengthy bar that is very accommodating. Â The atmosphere is busy and energetic, but in a swanky, fun way. It is elegant and impressive, but not overly pretentious. And even though it's not terribly quiet, it's never disturbing to dinner conversation and feels very much like a date spot. I tried to get a variety of things; the blue crab, steak tartara, and the lamb meatball (highly recommend) for starters. And then the rigatoni and spice-glazed duck. Everything was tremendous constantly challenging the taste buds. I also split a little cheesecake to top off the evening and indulge further. Things were a little pricey, but we did order a bottle of wine (manageable pricing) and you absolutely get what you pay for, so I was never resentful when the check showed up. I must have raved about the food here for a few weeks after my meal, and anytime someone mentions this place I have to jump into the conversation and give my two cents. If it isn't already, put Locanda Verde on your "restaurants to try" list, and bump it to the top.
