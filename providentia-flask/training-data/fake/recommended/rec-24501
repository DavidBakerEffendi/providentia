Date night w/ the boyfriend on a Wednesday evening. Place of the restaurant is a hidden gem! The entrance felt like we were walking into a little secret garden. Upon entering, to your right there is a little seating area that guests can request to dine if they like. It is like your own private cozy little section outside of the restaurant but not really. To me that is like a personal invitation to a mosquito death trap lol But anyway. Upon entering the place you have to walk past the long bar area. There are open seating's on the first and second floor. Definitely did not know they had a second floor. The best part about the second floor was the private dining they had. We had to walk through the kitchen in order to get seated in which I thought was a different experience. Our server's name was Charlie I believe. Phenomenal service and very upbeat. The food was another experience. Portions are pretty small but it is a tapas restaurant. Great concept. You get to try a little bit of everything. We ordered: - Bacon Wrapped Dates & Olives Stuffed w/ Almonds - Trout Roe, Black Rice Crisp - Shrimp & Chorizo On Skewer - Â Octopus - Sea Scallops - Brussels Sprouts - Stuff Grape Leaves - Peking Duck Breast I must say, the Sea Scallops were salty. I think they need to ease off the salt. I felt like I was eating salt with a hint of scallops. I think it should be the other way around.. You know the freshness of the scallop w/ a hint of salt would have been perfect. Would I come back. Yes!
