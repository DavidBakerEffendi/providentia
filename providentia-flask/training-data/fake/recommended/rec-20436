I love this place.  The food is great, cheap, and served in large portions.  The decor is clean and modern (no faux pan-Asian decorations), they often have a DJ spinning, and they also tend to serve pretty stiff drinks... oh, and those are pretty reasonably priced as well! The only downside is that it's a tad noisy and in the summer it can get quite warm inside.  However, they also have a cool litlte outdoor seating area in the back.  All in all, this restaurant/bar is a winner.
