The pizza was NOT fresh! It was dry looking and needed to be burried under a fresh layer of cheese. Sooooooo Â disgusting! if you want great pizza that is always fresh and they aren't cheap with the sauce and cheese go to MORRISTOWN NJ for SUVIO's PIZZA or MORRIS PIZZERIA.If you like avellino's pizza then you don't know good pizza and I feel sorry for you.
