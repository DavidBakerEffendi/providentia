This is a great spot if you're looking to grab dinner close to the theater district and avoid the overabundance of tourist traps in this part of the city. The decor is an earthy Asian-chic (loved all the lanterns!) that feels sophisticated but not pretentious. I have to agree with other reviews that the pho bo and the spare ribs (really a scrumptious paper-thin slice of pork wrapped around a sugar cane and grilled in a kind of mock spare rib) were the clear highlights of the meal. This was maybe the most flavorful pho broth I've ever had, which made up for the fact that the basil leaves in the condiment bowl were turning brown and could have been fresher. We also had the kimchi fries--great bar food--and the fresh shrimp roll and vegetable dumplings, the latter two being maybe a little on the bland side. Other people in our party also loved kung pao chicken as well as the cashew chili chicken. I would go again.
