A quiet romantic little restaurant with plenty of charm and fragrant unique spices on the menu. The stews and curries are excellent as are the chicken and meet dishes. One warning though is that this food has a bit of a kick to it i went with my girlfriend who does not like spicy food and she found this place hard to enjoy however i thought the food service and charm were excellent. Note the prices on the yelp menu are out of date they are a bit more money now.
