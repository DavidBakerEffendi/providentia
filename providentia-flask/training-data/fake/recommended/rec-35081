So...I have to say I believe in second chances.  Home Sweet Harlem is a great local spot and the proprietor Donna is so sweet and kind. I love her ideas behind getting the community together and supporting local artists and chefs. Donna has been so generous to let a local group of mothers, myself included get together and have a weekly story time in her fabulous space. The first week I tried the Caesar salad with organic chicken and it was honestly delicious!  Each week now I have enjoyed a large portion of Caesar salad with their yummy homemade dressing and croutons. Home sweet harlem is a great place to book large parties and events I definitely recommend working with Donna and the Caesar salad!!
