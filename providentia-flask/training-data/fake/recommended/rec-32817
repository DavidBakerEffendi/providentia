I don't understand this Apizza thing all over New Haven we decided on Pepe's over Modern.  Hungry for some good food with some friends.. why not stop on Wooster Street for what is considered one of the best pizza places in the entire United States.  I mean why not... it was a Friday. We ordered a large pizza with 1/2 clam and 1/2 sausage and pepperonis.  Thin crust pizza, greasy and full of clammy sausage goodness.  Service was not the best and the size of their drink glasses are size of shot glasses which leads to infrequent refills and parched patrons.   Good pizza though... even when you take it out of the fridge the next day with cold congealed cheese all over.  I think I just had to change my underwear thinking about it.
