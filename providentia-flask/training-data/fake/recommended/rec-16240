Holy crap it was delicious. I sampled a few cocktails here and they were all note worthy and created with craftsmanship. DInner was delish and ingredients were fresh. noteworthy is the shortrib burger. get it! If it wasn't for the waitress giving us the eye to wrap up and get out, this place would have 5 stars.
