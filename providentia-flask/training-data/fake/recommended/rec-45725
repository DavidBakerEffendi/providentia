Just moved in the neighborhood and I am really happy this place is around the corner! For sure, this is going to be my favorite burger place! I can't wait to eat the rest of the menu! The burger and the fries were absolutely delicious, very tasty and not greasy at all!! The place is also really soothing and well decorated!
