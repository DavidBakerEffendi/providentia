Nice little hole-in-the-wall place in Bloomfield. The restaurant looks better on the inside than it does on the outside, though atmosphere is not what you're looking for while trying to find a good Indian place to eat in NJ. The food, however, is EXCELLENT. My father and I shared dishes of Chicken Korma, Panir Makhani, and Curry Chicken. I think the Curry Chicken ended up being the best, very flavorful. The owner came over near the end of our meal to make sure everything was all right, which doesn't happen often enough while eating out and shows good effort on her part. Will definitely be visiting again! It's good to have a tasty Indian place near home, especially when you're used to eating it all the time while living in the city.
