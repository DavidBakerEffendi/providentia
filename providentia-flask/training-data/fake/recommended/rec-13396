Yes, 5 stars! Why? Even though the place was crowded on a Friday night, our wait was only 30 minutes. Get a drink at the bar while waiting for your table. You must get the croquettas, patatas bravas, shrimp with oil and garlic, and chorizo. For the shrimp tapas, dip the bread into the sauce. Amazing stuff! They are strict about having the hostess seat customers, even at the bar. A movable tablet is placed on the bar right in front of vacant seats indicating "Please do not sit and see hostess to be seated".
