cannot say anything negative about this place. have ordered out twice, eaten in once. everything i've ever gotten was amazing. up thai rolls are great! green curry and panang are some of the best i've had. service is fast. prices for lunch special are $10 and you get tons of food. decor of the restaurant is modern and intimate, also good for a date. i haven't tried their thai iced coffee or tea, but that's next on my list!
