In a neighborhood that has no short supply of Thai restaurants, Room Service is a standout. Their drunken noodle is my personal favorite - the rice noodles they use are fresh & chewy and the spicy sauce is full of basil flavor. Starting at 6.90 for an appetizer & entree, the lunch special can't be beat.  I order from here regularly on Seamless and the food arrives in a jiffy and the entrees are still steaming hot. On occasion, the lunch appetizers may still be cold in the middle (e.g. the chicken and shrimp steamed dumpling).  But for the cheap price, c'mon you can't really complain too much...
