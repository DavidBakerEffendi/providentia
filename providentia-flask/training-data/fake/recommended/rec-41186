This place deserves the hype.  My indecisiveness is usually calmed by the lack of vegetarian choices at restaurants (which Is FINE with me). That's why I mesh well with trader joes-- it's almost communist with their TJ brand peanut butter. Two choices: crunchy or creamy?  Il bambino on the other hand had a ton of veggie choices. None of that "bland tomato, shitty mozzarella, semi fresh basil" bullshit. I had a vegetarian panini for for vegetarians who actually like food. Eggs, blue cheese, BBQ chips, and some kind of aioli.  YUM.  The best part is the crispy perfectly toasted bread that doesn't hurt your mouth and scrap your gums when you bite into it. My boyfriend was in bacon heaven. I was in egg and cheese heaven.  They have a great selection of wine and beer but the drinks are a little expensive.  The service is a little slow but they were also pretty busy and it gave us time to relax and enjoy the meal.  We were totally satisfied and happy with our meal. Can't wait to go back!
