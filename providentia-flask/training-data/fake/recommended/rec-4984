I used to go to the old Chavela's when I lived nearby and was between jobs, so a friend and I could eat cheap vegan tacos for lunch at the tables outside with our dogs. These days, they don't have an outdoor space, but the food has gone from being pretty good to being consistantly awesome. The sangria is really good. The new place has way more room, a great bar, and the food is better than ever. This is one of the few places that works equally well for a date, dinner with friends, or brunch with my mom.
