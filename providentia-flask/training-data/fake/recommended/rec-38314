Had a great dinner here with my husband.  Overall a very nice place is in an interesting building that used to be a bank.  It was winter, but they have nice outdoor seating where you can watch all the goings on of Church Street.  We shared the chicken nachos for a starter.  They were very good and very filling!  My husband had the Kobe burger and he said it was the best burger he has ever had and it will be hard to forget it.  I had the Misty Knoll Chicken pasta.  It was very good and was sad I couldn't take my leftovers because we were on a long weekend trip. Overall it was a great place for dinner.  We returned the next day for afternoon drinks at the bar.  I had a hot cider drink and my husband had a few of the local beers.
