Dinner with my fiancee was incredible.  Small restaurant tucked into the hotel, which occasionally gets loud from guests entering/leaving/gathering in the lobby which is adjacent to the entrance.  The complaints end there, and are the reason for 4/5 stars.   The food was inventive, delicious, nuanced and unique.  The atmosphere inside was intimate and relaxed.  The service was impeccable as would be expected with very knowledgeable, courteous and engaging staff.  The pricing is as expected, but here you get what you pay for and we had no complaints given the incredible meal.  Definitely a top 5 restaurant from an incredible chef.
