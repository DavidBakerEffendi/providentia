ok so the steamed oyster appetizer was good but they gave us a odd number which makes it a little difficult to share my gin martini was good i ordered some type of fish it was unseasoned and it came on a bed of grits ugh not so good but my bf got some type of stewed chicken its was delicious but the atmosphere is trendy i would go again but i would order a salad and drinks
