You know that show on Food Network.. Best thing I ever ate? I think everything I had at this restaurant would qualify. I'm a little late on this review but I went Valentine's Day weekend for a romantic dinner with my boyfriend! He wanted to do the tasting menu but unfortunately, the whole table has to do it. (will be back for that...) Here's the rundown on what we ordered: Kampachi Tartare Chili Lobster ... still drooling.. Tortellini Ravioli Venison steak Halibut and Banana Pecan pie bread pudding Everything down to the service is incredible. Our waiter Justin was awesome! Too bad Chef Forgione wasn't there because if he was, our waiter said he probably would have came out. We are food network obsessed! Although there are still a ton of restaurants on our list that we need to visit, I think we will be making another stop here in the near future. HIGHLY recommend this place...... impeccable!
