It's a shame it wasn't a great experience that I had somewhere that inspired me to finally put my Yelp account to good use and write a review. I just felt like I had to warn people about this place. Other people have mentioned the service issues in their reviews, but really that's what it all boiled down to for me here. Beyond the one star that I'm required to give, I'll throw another on for the great beer selection. My friends and I walked in the door and were completely ignored. I understand if you don't have a host; you're a bar, that's cool. But am I supposed to seat myself? Am I supposed to wait to be seated? Can I get a simple hello, because I'm here to spend my money at your establishment? We fended for ourselves to nab a table and waited for someone to bring us menus. And waited. And... nothing happened, so literally 10 minutes later we got up and got menus ourselves (!!), whereupon another 5 minutes go by and a server (who I think has been mentioned unfavorably on this site before, management take note) came over and asked, "So are you hungry?" No greeting or acknowledgment beyond that. We ordered and got our food in decent time, thankfully. My fish and chips, a special for the night, were distinctly lacking the malt vinegar that the blackboard promised. The fries were burnt on the outside and oddly mealy on the inside. The fish was cooked well but could have used that malty goodness that I had expected. We received enough attention until it became clear that we weren't going to order any more drinks, when our server went back to chatting with the bartenders, the locals, and generally ignoring out sorry asses. We had to get up and ask for the check, and after it was brought to us, had to get up again to hand it to our server with our money. I agree that this could be a good spot to sit at the bar and have a drink, but they shouldn't even bother pretending to serve food.
