Key points: CASH ONLY. GREAT FOOD. "EH" WHEN IT COMES TO WAIT STAFF. Full review: The food is to DIE for. Went here on my vacation per recommendation of a friend. Didn't anticipate a wait, but there were people sitting outside waiting. Apparently that's how it always is, constantly. We went around 12 on a Wednesday. They were able to text us when our table was ready (about forty minute wait). I had chocolate chunk pancakes and sugar cured bacon. UNBELIEVABLE. My friend had southern breakfast and chicken apple sausage. She loved them. The wait staff is kind of snooty. Probably because they never have to worry about business being slow. We didn't realize it was CASH ONLY until we were paying (also had to wait 15 minutes after they cleared our plates to get a check, and that's after we got up and had to ask someone for a check). The quarters are tight as are many places in NY. Only taking a star away for wait staff attitude. Food worth enduring.
