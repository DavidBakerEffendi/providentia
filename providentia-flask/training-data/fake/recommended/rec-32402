Three small plates, a house cocktail and a 7oz Belgian IPA, $49.  The mixed nuts/olive small plate should/could have been brought out while we waited for the other two.  One, the fried artichokes with a schmear of anchovy mayo was very well fried but the anchovy mayo was too salty for this salt lover.  The second, a muffaletta sandwich, came out pressed/panini style-tasty none the less, but not what I expected as a muffaletta is a cold sandwich.  I gave that a pass on that because it came with a well sized basket of excellent French fries which wasn't mentioned on the description. Our waiter was taciturn-when I asked what was on tap-he kinda grunted and pointed towards the blackboard above the bar (which I hadn't noticed yet).  The only description he gave for the small pour of IPA was that it was 'strong'.  Had to ask for menus, water, and he didn't look us in the eye or talk at all.  And on the way out we crossed paths with the hostess who brought us in and didn't get a smile, good evening, or parting word. So go for the food to try, the kitchen was up to the task, the service staff needs a polish.  Plenty of parking as well!
