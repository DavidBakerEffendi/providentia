We arrived to Ssam promplty right after it opened @ 5pm and got seated immediately. We got lucky and sat at the same table Anthony Bourdain filmed his, "food porn" episode of  "No Reservations", I thought that was pretty neat since he's my idol and all, ha! The ambiance of this place was very comfortable & casual. Although I can't say much for the staff - One in particular was very cool,  while the hostess/chicks were quite stuck up as Amy J. also encountered. Unfortunately, one of our servers got confused and presented the "Crispy Pig's Head Torchon" on our table while ranting about another dish.  It seemed very unprofessional and the server should be schooled again on the dishes before presenting. Here are the dishes we ordered: Cured Hamachi: absolutely delicious! I have a new found glory of yellowtail. Santa Barbara Uni: Uni was just melt in my mouth delicious and great texture with the beet tapioca. Steam Pork Buns: Pretty good...it seemed to need a bit more salt to me but overall, the pork fat did rule. Ssam special of the day: Lamb Pate with orange marmalade and pistachios, I wish it had a bit more spice but quite good. Bev Eggleston's Pork Shoulder Steak: Highly recommended!  The cumin yogurt sauce was a great complement to the dish. Crispy Pig's Head Torchon:I enjoyed the Azuki beans on the bottom more than that torchon - the beans had a similar taste to smokey baked beans with collard greens. Sichuan Beef Tendon:I would not recommend this dish -  its definitely a about the crunchy texture, more than flavor. I'm not a usual after dinner dessert person so I couldn't give you a recommendation on that Ssam new American cuisine was definitely an interesting awakening to my palette.  Too bad I was too full to try some some more but I would definitely come back again for round 2.
