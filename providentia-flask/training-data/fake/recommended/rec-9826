food: 3 decor: 4 service: 3 overall: 3 this place is pretty well decorated - dim lighting. clean inteior, and they have this huge chandelier in the middle of the room in a glass case. everything else about this place is just pretty average. the food is decent but not mindblowing.. i've had better thai food elsewhere, but would recommend the pad thai and curry puffs. the service is average. overall its not a bad place to hang out though, the ambiance is pretty nice. the only this is you'll feel really squished bc seating is tight, but i guess thats nothing new in nyc
