After sitting down to view the menu and planning the upcoming feast of a salad, appetizer, panini, cocktail, and bruschetta the waitress informs our party that the Guiltcity certificate is a misprint. Instead, two people are to share one salad and one panini. After going back and forth over the alleged misprint, I let the waitress know that the certificate was purchased an hour prior to our arrival. One would think at this point a manager would come over, apologize for the confusion, and offer a complimentary beverage as I settle the error over the phone with Giltcity. No. As I sit here waiting for my salad, still no manager. Absolutely unacceptable. And for that reason alone I will never return. By the way, the website still shows the misprint.... Seems like a scam to get you in the door.
