Best pizza in Wayne!! I have been coming to Brother Bruno's since 2004 when I began my undergrad work at Willy P. These guys are awesome...timely delivery, service at the location, and a cornerstone of Wayne.  They post daily specials via Facebook and make delicious food.  Their Buffalo Chicken and Bacon Ranch slices are by far the best ever. If you are ever in this area, I highly recommend dropping by for a slice of heaven at Brother Bruno's!
