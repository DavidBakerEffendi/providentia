Made reservations on a Monday night for two at 6pm. Was seated right away upon arrival at 5:50. The restaurant itself is dimly lit with music blasting. I found myself needing to raise my voice in order for my dining companion to hear me. We ordered the Tito santano guacamole ($15). It came with tortilla chips and salsa. It wasn't bad, but I've had better guacamole for cheaper. Some spicy and lemon would have improved it ten fold. Nonetheless it was decent. We also ordered the taco sampler ($23) and enchilada mixter ($18.50) which both arrived simultaneously. The tacos included sea bass, beef, pork, chicken, and mahi mahi. Overall they were all well flavored. Our favorites were the chicken and carnitas. We shared the tacos. Literally split each one taco in halfAfter attacking the tacos, I was too full for the enchiladas.
