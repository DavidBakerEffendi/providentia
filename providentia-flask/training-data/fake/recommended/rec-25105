I've never written a bad review before- but I have tried the Chubby Muffin three times and always walked away extremely disappointed. I'm surprised because my experiences with the Skinny Pancake have always been so fabulous. First of all, the customer service is woefully inadequate. The attitude behind the counter is distracted at best, and at worst downright rude. I ordered lunch and they behaved as if they were put out that they were being asked to make something. When we ordered ice cream and their creemee machine broke, they never made eye contact or let us know how long the wait would be. They complained loudly to each other, and when I asked if we should keep waiting, they scoffed and shrugged. We tried one final time to get coffee and were served lattes of scalded milk ten minutes later. I guess I just wanted to share my experiences and suggest to the Chubby Muffin that they put more of an emphasis on being friendly and communicative with customers. Afterall, you're in the Old North End. We love it here and would really appreciate a staff that takes the time to smile and say hi back.
