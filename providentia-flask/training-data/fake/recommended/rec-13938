Wow, where do I even begin? Okay. My husband and I make an effort to visit Clinton Street Baking Co. every time we're in New York City (we live outside of Boston). Despite the fact that getting to the Lower East Side, waiting in line, eating, and getting back takes up the better part of a morning, we still do it. Why? Two words: Southern Breakfast. Scrambled eggs, cheesy grits, fried green tomatoes and SUGAR CURED BACON. I.... I can't... It's just too amazing. I don't even know if anything else is good there because I can't not have the Southern breakfast. Gooey, perfect grits, warm, gritty fried tomatoes, and the bacon. My god, the bacon. Sweet and chewy and just a little bit crispy. I die. Every time. Is it expensive for breakfast? You betcha. Will you have to wait in a pretty long line (I'm talking a good two hours if you strike while the iron is hot)? For sure. IS IT WORTH IT? Hell yes. Some tips: get there before it opens. Especially if you're coming on a weekend morning. You'll still have to wait but it won't be as bad. One time we came at 11 am on a Sunday. BAD BAD BAD idea. We didn't eat until about 1:30. Also, get yourself some coffee and treats while you wait! They are also a coffee shop/bake shop so get some coffee (very good, very strong) and a muffin or scone. We had a berry scone while we waited yesterday and oh mah gah was it good. Crumbly and moist with that sugar crunch on top. Perfect. Get to Clinton Street!
