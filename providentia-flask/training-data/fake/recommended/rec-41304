Imagine paris circa 1850. Warm ambient, yellow street light gently filtering through rustic, foggy windows enveloping a bustling restaurant filled with intellectuals, bike enthusiests, and locals with live music in the background. That's the atmosphere at Moto. I've never experienced anything like it and I can't wait to go back next time I'm in the neighborhood. And the food's pretty good too :)
