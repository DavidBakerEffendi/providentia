Came here because the place we were going to nearby had an hour wait. So we decided to try another French spot in the city. The food was okay. For the prices, we could have easily went to our favorite French steakhouse, Les Halles, and ordered all of the same things and paid a bit less, but had a higher quality of food. The steak was okay, French onion soup was good, coq au vin recipe was interesting- not blown away at all. The worst though: the cheesecake. So bland, clearly store bought or frozen. Total disappointment. The wait staff were really friendly though.
