I have been to this restaurant numerous times and it seems that every time I go back the service, specifically from the hosts, is outrageous. Not only are the hosts pretentious and give major negative attitude I also overheard them mocking patrons last night. Once seated our waitress was very friendly and attentive but I always get the feeling they want to serve as quickly as possible to get us out ASAP. I know it's a very popular place but I hate feeling rushed when I'm eating and especially when I'm not paying for the cheapest food. I will definitely rethink going back there as the wait situation is quite stressful and the hosts attitude just makes it worse.
