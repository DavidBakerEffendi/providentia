Dinosaur BBQ is what a bbq chain strive to be, when compared to alternatives such as Dallas BBQ it definitely blows it competition out of the water but against other local restaurants there is definitely a lot more room for improvement. So for a starter the excessive wait can go either way, it can essentially turn you into a savage will to eat anything or discourage you and make you leave. I decided to wait it out and after maybe 50 minutes we were seated. Food came relatively fast after being seated. I will honestly say, the pork sliders were the highlight of the meal. The ribs and the four sides that we ordered were decent, but honestly I felt it could've been better in the sense where the meat was more moist. I really disliked the cole slaw and mac and cheese there was just something about the taste that threw me off. But the chili and the beans were decent. Overall, I wasn't amazed by the food nor was it worth the wait. I'll say this though, the food is definitely enjoyable but for a 45 minute wait? I think that there are alternatives, or take it to go because people were coming in and out on that line.
