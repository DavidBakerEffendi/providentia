Came here for our winter banquet for a student group. First of all, the service is amazing. They usually don't accomodate groups larger than 8, but because it was a monday, they nicely accepted our large group of 11. Remember to make reservations in advance though! We had the Mussels and Clams and Italian Meatballs for appetizers. The Mussels and Clams were fresh and the soup was delicious. The Italian meatballs were so rich in taste, tender and phenomenal. I would just go for their meatballs! I ordered the Parpadelle for the main. I personally loved the lemon ricotta. The portions were also large so I had to take it home. Still tasted amazing even after a day and put in the microwave! Oh, and the best part- desserts! My group shared the Tiramisu, the Molten Chocolate Cake and the Mascarpone Cheesecake. The Tiramisu was average, nothing extremely special. The Molten Chocolate Cake was warm and soft, not too sweet and delicious. My absolute favorite was the Mascarpone Cheesecake. It was so rich but with a tender taste... too good to be true! It is one of the best BYOs I have been too. Can't wait to go again!
