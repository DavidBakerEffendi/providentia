I was expecting a bit more from a Tom Colicchio restaurant. The decor and view were amazing as well as the service. The staff was very informative so thats a plus! For starters, we had the salmon tartare and the avocado and hamachi salad. The salmon tartare was really salty for my liking but the avocado and hamachi salad tasted fresh and light. For my main dish, the duck breast was chosen. The meat was tender but again salty. Portion sizes are quite filling but all I remember mainly was just chugging glasses of water..
