I go for dinner once a month now.  The food is glorious, hearty, creative, interesting, perfectly executed - I love the bread basket - I always order the special pasta (last time it was a red sauce with mussels and rock shrimp - I took bread and got all the sauce out of my dish and my friend's dish).  But, the service is slow as hell - for a 9:30 ressy we didn't end up eating until 11:45 - it's really nice and people sit at their tables for a while, but I just can't make late ressy's anymore - now I go at 6pm on the weekends for an easy good time AND they have the special roast sucking pig at that hour (they always run out later in the evening) - which was the moistest piece of roast meat I have ever eaten.
