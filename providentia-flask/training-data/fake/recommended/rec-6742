Standard tavern, local sports pub kind of place. The bar is pretty big, always packed, and there are plenty of TVs. The food is decent - nothing spectacular, but they have a lot of choices so everyone will be happy. Â I did ask if they had fried pickles, which they didn't, but they offered to make them for me. I thought that was pretty cool. My husband likes this place - he can get his bar time in and have a drink and watch the game and I sit at the bar and people watch. Sounds great to me.
