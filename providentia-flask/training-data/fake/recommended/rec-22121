Delicious Brussels sprouts, really good shrimp cocktail, and yes we had the steak for two and it was insane. Seriously two people should not eat 42 oz of steak, ever, and that was the smallest one they had. I had no choice, I was on a paleo diet so that was my only option. Super pricey but we did eat it for another two meals! Good creme brûlée too! All in all everything was great, I didn't give it five stars only because I'd expected nothing less at those prices in this neighborhood, and there was nothing terribly unexpected that could get my juices flowing for five stars. I'll certainly go again sometime I'm sure!
