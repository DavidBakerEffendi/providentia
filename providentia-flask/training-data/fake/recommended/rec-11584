Perhaps it was because this place was so hyped up, but I felt that it was good, but mediocre. The bar is small but was not crowded when I went with a friend early on a Sunday night. It's cash only, and the only menu is a small board at the end of the bar. I do love the down and dirty feel of it, the no-nonsense staff, the fact that the food is served on tiny plastic plates, and that it is very low fuss and no frills. The burger, however, did not amaze me. It was certainly fine, but for a really good burger that hits the spot, I'd recommend Burger & Barrel, JG Melon, or Minetta Tavern. The burgers here are definitely cheap, but you get what you pay for.
