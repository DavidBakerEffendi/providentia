Not much to add here, but I'll give it a shot... Il Bambino is probably my favorite place to eat in Astoria, and definitely one of my favorite spots in the city overall.  Whenever a friend comes to Astoria looking for a place to eat, Il Bambino is ALWAYS my first suggestion.  I must have tried 30 different paninis from this place (no joke) and none of them have ever disappointed.   You might think that a panini sounds unsatisfying (I know I did at first), but you could not be more wrong about the sanwiches at Il Bambino.  The Porchetta panini is hands down my favorite.  The Italian Meatloaf is also incredible, as is the Prosciutto with fig spread, Speck with apricot butter, Artichoke with goat cheese, every single one of the brunch paninis, etc.  You truly cannot go wrong with anything on the menu, and their specials are always top notch as well.   The staff is also very friendly and laid-back.  My only complaint (and man is this splitting hairs), is that for as much as I've been here, they still don't seem to know who I am.  Random and arbitrary, but it would be nice to get more than just a "Hello" on my 812348th visit to the place.  Definitely won't stop me from coming back time and time again, though...
