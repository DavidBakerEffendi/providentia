If I am near the Shop-Rite on Olden Avenue and I am not sure what I am in the mood for, 9 out of 10 times I choose Mamma Flora's. First of all, everytime I walk in there the owner/manager greets us with a big smile and warm welcomes. He seems to remember all of the regular customers and is extremely pleasant/attentive. Now on to the food... Everything is made to order so if you don't want onions/tomatoes/etc. they are very accomadating. I LOVE the "Insane fries". I pretty much order them with anything that I get. They are cheese fries but better...with corn, onions, jalapenos, olives, and I don't even remember what else. But they are good! I have also had their cheesesteak, pizza, and soup, which were all delicious. I have never tried their pasta dishes or sat down to eat here...I kind of forget that I have the option to do so. Their takeout tastes so good I am sure that it would be even better served immediately. Overall, great food, friendly atmosphere, and pretty good selection of bottled sodas and iced teas/juices (yes that matters to me). Definitely give it a try if you like casual, sit-down Italian restaurants.
