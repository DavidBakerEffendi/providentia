I came to this cart a year or two ago. In fact, I had to go twice because it was so fantastic. This trip, I went back and it was just mediocre. My friend got it twice (around 4 PM on Saturday and 1AM on Sunday with me). He said when he got it at 4PM, it was better. The pita was cut a different way too. When I got it, 1AM Sunday, it was meh. The garlic sauce didn't pack a garlic punch and the chicken was just okay. The hot sauce was hot. Totally over halal cart. But maybe I will give it another chance earlier in the day.
