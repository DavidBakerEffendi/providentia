This is the THIRD restaurant that we've come across in the tourist-trap of Hell's Kitchen that DO NOT have HIGHCHAIRS for babies!   What the heck?!??!?!?! Anyway, we made do by strapping our one-year old to her seat with our belts.   But we ordered the bangers & mash.... both kids loved it and so did I!!!!  The bangers were so tender and juicy.   The mashed potatoes were good but it was A LOT of mashed potatoes.... and the gravy was so rich and flavorful!  My hubby ordered the shepherd's pie.... LOVED IT!!!!  I thought it was a bit gamey because of the lamb mutton, but that's just me.   My son wanted the grilled cheese and tomato.... he ate everything!!!  And he's not a fan of tomatoes in the raw...but maybe it's because there was a lot of really good cheese and it was a dimly lit dining area.   The fries were also really good --- handcut and fried perfectly!!! I'm a fan of the restaurant... just wish they had highchairs.
