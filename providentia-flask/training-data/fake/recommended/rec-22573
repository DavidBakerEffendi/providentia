Beyond the great people, service and sustainable & local specialty dishes, Brooklyn Commune is heavily involved in the community, hosting events for children and families, supporting local artists and food producers, and serving as a CSA pickup for the neighborhood. I don't know the owners personally, although it's apparent that they're passionate about creating a great place for everyone to enjoy - not just another hipster hangout. The prices are a bit more than what you might expect for most Windsor Terrace establishments, but I personally feel that they're more than reasonable considering the great offerings that Brooklyn Commune brings to this neighborhood. A few other things to note: -No wifi -Outdoor seating is available on nice days -Spacious inside, including the bathroom -Music varies from day to day and plays at a moderate volume level -Bring-your-own beer/wine
