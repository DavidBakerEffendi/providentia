Went for Philly Beer Week 3 course for $35. Sticky tables; like arms stick to them kind of sticky. Waiter cleaned it using a sloppy rag pulled from a pitcher. I had mussels - some never opened, others were rubber bands; the shrimp tacos - two enormous overcooked shrimp in dry crumbly tortillas; and then the brownie dessert - which was like a wafer thin piece of brown Velcro covered in the smallest spoon (not scoop) of ice cream ever. Wife had empanadas - smallest ever, then the smoked chicken - i have seen bigger finches in my life, and the same brownie since the cheesecake was sold out. Oh,,,and three really small glasses of good beer. Got ripped off for bad food. The only thing they did well was serve someone else's beer. Won't return.
