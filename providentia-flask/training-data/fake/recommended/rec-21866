I went here a few nights ago for the Dine in Brooklyn prix fixe menu, and it was delightful.  Adventurous eaters will be pleased by the more inventive and/or unique menu items-- the anticuchos of pig heart were expertly prepared, and the avocado creme brulee is reason enough to return.  I also enjoyed the celery root soup, as did my dining companion, who (inexplicably) hates celery.  His ceviche was equally delicious, and I was particularly intrigued by the hot sauce in the marinade, which really set this ceviche apart from the norm.  His beef cheeks were tender and tasty (not a euphemism), and my tilefish and plaintain had a sweet/savory balance that I loved.  Aside from the fantastic avocado creme brulee, we also shared the sorrel pie that was smooth and tasty, too.   The quality of service was more than adequate (from a very tough critic), and our server was particularly friendly. My only teenie, tiny criticism is that sangria was a little too sweet and masked the wine more than I like (I sort of felt like it was a mix, but I don't want to accuse them of such an offense without knowledge). I am probably in the minority, however, in preferring a less-sweet sangria, and it was not bad by any means. Definitely will be back.  Love my hood!
