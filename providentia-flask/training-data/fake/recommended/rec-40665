Service is pretty good, waiter was very attentive. Food was pretty good, the grilled cheese and tomato soup was alright. Ambience of the place is very cool, like a blast from the 70's. Beer selection is pretty good, great to see local beers from Philly! I expected a bit more from this place, honestly.
