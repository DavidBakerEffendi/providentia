What happened to this place in just over a period of a couple of years!? The Hot Dogs were somewhat tasteless, and the relish was bland. The Onion Rings were a bit on the greasy side, and it just is not the same. The atmosphere remains the same (cool) and the seagulls are still present, ready to crap on your rental car. Hopefully, next time in NJ, things will be better.
