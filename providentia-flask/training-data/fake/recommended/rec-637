Came in for dinner. Ambiance: a bit run down, like a sports bar / dinner. Only about 10 tables, soccer on the tv. The place could use a facelift. Food: now that's what I'm talking about!!! Fatten your botty up these are the portions your Portuguese grandma tries to force feed you. HUGE!  The food was awesome. Beef ribs (see pic) were huge, and came with a mound of rice and another side.  I had half the plate to take home for lunch and I got the half order. Awesome rub on the meat, nice flavor and only $9.5. Steak sandwich, my bf loved. It was very basic Meat And bread a little lettuce and a mound of fries.$7.5. They seemed really busy for take out. Awesome spot, would definitely recommend it.
