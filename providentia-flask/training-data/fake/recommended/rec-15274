Service was OK but this place was so empty it felt like they were just standing there staring at me eating. Soup was OK. No bread or crackers. Lunch was a sad $12 version of eggplant parmesan with a former description. What I got was breaded eggplant that tasted like it had been frozen and recooked and was so mushy I could eat it with a spoon. The only reason I gave this place 2 stars was because the pasta and sauce were OK tasting. Also I told the server I was staying at a local hotel (as the sign out front instructed) and she failed to honor the 10% discount.
