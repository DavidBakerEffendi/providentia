One of my favorite, go-to places in Center City. I love the unique tex-mex menu. Great guacamole. AMAZING nachos. Nachos are pretty much my favorite food and these are legit. I came in ridiculously hungry for lunch one day, ordered nachos for myself, and ate maybe 2/3 of the plate. They are huuuuuge. I'm bringing someone to help me next time. I love the pepita salsa, too. I actually found this place right after I moved to Philly last March, on the craft beer bus. Said bus "tour" includes a lot of other craft beer bar gems, so this place is in good company. It seemed like a location that was in an area I was vaguely familiar with and not too far from the regional rail (suburban station), so I decided to start my day here. Excellent choice. They only have about 16 taps, but they're always filled with good stuff (plus there's a second bar upstairs). I love when they have Deschutes Chainbreaker. Good local and west coast beer selections! Great selection of US craft and European bottles, too. The decor and staff might look intimidating at times, especially for this location, but I've always had great service. Everyone is really nice. The only downside is that the bathroom is on the 3rd floor. Knowing that I now try to plant myself on the second floor so there aren't so many stairs to climb.
