Since sushi options in Philly are usually limited to center city, it was interesting to see Yelp spit out Izumi in the middle of South Philly. The location is sort of out of place, but we decided to give Izumi a try. They have outdoor seating near open archways, which makes me think of Europe or something. The food is expensive, if not too expensive. I mean, I know sushi/Japanese places tend to carry higher-than-average prices, but really some of the prices were just ridiculous. Five dollars for tea? No thank you. Nine for a roll that usually costs me five? It was off-putting for sure, but the food itself was very good. I think next time I'll skip sushi in S. Philly and just take the journey to center city, where my options are wider and considerably cheaper, without sacrificing quality, and gaining more atmosphere. If you live in S. Philly, go ahead and try it out, but nothing worth traveling down there for.
