Visited here while on a business trip. After looking at the online menu I thought this place would be pretentious and stuffy. Boy was I wrong! S+P was delightful from the start! The atmosphere is welcoming and chic. Service was excellent from the moment we walked in to the time we walked out. I didn't drink alcohol but my coworkers enjoyed craft cocktails, beer and wine.  All drinks looked  fabulous. For dinner I got the organic chicken, which was incredible (I mean really, how can chicken be that good??) but the real star of the meal was the brussel sprouts. Seriously, I think these things were laced with some sort of drug because WOW. I couldn't stop eating them. Who says that about BRUSSEL SPROUTS? This girl. I could have had just those for my meal and been quite satisfied. Warm molten chocolate cake and key lime pie  were served for dessert along with a jar of s'mores. You read that right: S'MORES. Scrumptious. If  you like s'mores you MUST try this. Seriously. Do it. And then write me a thank you note here on Yelp! Our servers were able to make very educated, helpful wine pairing suggestions and were  attentive throughout the dining experience. This really was an *experience* When in NYC check out S+P and prepare to be delighted.
