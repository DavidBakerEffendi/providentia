Booked this place as a last minute Saturday night dinner reservation with another couple. Despite being a "hotspot" they had a ton of availability. The decor is very chic and modern, and crowd is very young and trendy. I would recommend going with just appetizers and splitting several with the rest of your party. Â The entrees are pricey ,and pale in comparison to most of the apps.
