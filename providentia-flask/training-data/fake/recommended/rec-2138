Slipped into Brooklyn Star for brunch with zero expectations. I thought the layout was cool, and the bench seating was a good touch. Everyone was incredibly helpful and friendly. For my order I got the meatloaf sandwich which was made with ham and topped with the fried egg on thick cut bread. When it came out they made a smiley face in the sunny side up egg with dabs of hot sauce which was a pretty cool touch to a flavorfully delicious sandwich . It came with house made chips that were seasoned perfectly. After all of that food I still decided to order the cast-iron skillet cinnamon bun (thanks to the couple next to me that got it first). I was stuffed but still had to have one. Shout out to whoever thought about adding that to the menu. I couldn't finish it and ended up eating it 2 days later cold standing in front of my fridge (slightly buzzed) and it was still AMAZING. Way to play Brooklyn Star, good game *slaps ass*
