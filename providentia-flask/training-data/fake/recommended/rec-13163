I came here for Brunch on Sunday and it was a bit of an 'excursion' for me as it was not near where me or my friend lived, but we had heard so much about this place we decided to make the trek, bear the wait & see what it was all about. We got there at 10:50am and waited about 40 minutes before we were sat at our table of 2. I think there's such a long wait because the place really is not that big, but at the same time they turn the tables super fast so I am a bit surprised by the wait... we were done and out of there within 30 minutes!! We both had the Nutella French Toast which to be honest is the only thing that sounded good to me - everything else was a little too exotic for my tastes (i.e. waffle with coconut, which I do not like coconut). It was OK but I wish there was more nutella, you only got a taste of nutella in about 1/4 of each piece! So I don't think I'll be stopping by here again, there's just too many other brunch places that I absolutely adore and this one was just so-so in my book. ~Katie
