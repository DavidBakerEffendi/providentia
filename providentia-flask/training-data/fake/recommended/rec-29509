When I first moved to Lawrence I was happy to find a Chinese restaurant within walking distance that was until I tried it for the first time. I had ordered the generals chicken it was over cooked to the point I couldn't even chew it. The egg roll was burnt beyond edibility. The fried rice was the only good part of the meal that was acceptable. Fast forward to today, listen everyone has a bad day, maybe the chef feel asleep while cooking for me the last time. I was feeling under the weather a little wanton soup would make me feel better. I placed my complicated order of a large wonton soup and sat to wait. A couple of customers came in and picked up orders while I was waiting. 15 minutes passed they must have been working hard on the soup. A new worker asked if I placed an order I excitedly told him I did. After a brief discussion in Chinese (this soup is going to be epic) my original server asked if I ordered. I said yes I did, she asked what it was. My order was never placed! I just left, this place is pure crap with a total lack of attention to detail and customer service. I tried this place twice only had food once and that was garbage. Avoid this restaurant, unless you like to be disappointed. Â  W Ff
