Came here for happy hour, they advertised good deals ($5 sized small plates and 2 for 1 drinks). The food was really good and generously sized, and would've given them 5 stars based on that alone. The problem is that the "2 for 1" drinks is per person, so you can't share it across two people. My girlfriend and I each got a beer, clearly indicating that we intended to order the happy hour special, and were surprised when we were told we would have to pay full price for both drinks instead of just one. They didn't note no sharing on the menu, the waiter didn't tell us, and this blatant false advertising and ruined my experience (to the point that I'm writing this from the table while finishing up the two extra beers I didn't want to order but was forced to).
