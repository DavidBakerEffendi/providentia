Sick burritos!  I had a chicken and chorizo burrito today and I was in heaven.  The chorizo has a nice little char to it that really gave the burrito a nice kick to it. I have been here a few dozen times and the consistency of their food is why there is always a line there.   I love burritos and this place takes a crap on the "other guys."
