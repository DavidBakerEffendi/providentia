Came here for a cocktail and an appetizer while waiting for a table at another restaurant and was not disappointed. The darkish corners and warm candlelight made it obvious why this was clearly a great date night locale. I had a cocktail with vodka, passion fruit and fresh thyme. Sometimes savory additions can be a little TOO savory (know what I mean?) but the little hint of herbacious freshness perfectly balanced the bright beverage. I went with the chef's plate, which included two cheeses and two meats, plus accompaniments. I let the bartender select the cheese and meats and was not disappointed. In addition to two cured meats - lomo and one I can't remember - and the seasonal cheeses, the platter included an olive and caper berry, marcona almonds, baguette, two kinds off house-made crackers, stone ground mustard and house-pickled beets, red onions and carrots. It was more than I expected, and well worth the $15 or so.
