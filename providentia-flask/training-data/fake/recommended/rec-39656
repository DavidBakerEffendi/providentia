i live on staten island and ate at alot of places on the island..and im def. gonna say its one of the best places to eat on the island..and all you see on this island is italian food so its great to have someting a little different...food was amazing..there is this shrimp app. with some orange sauce on it which was amazing that we kept dipping the bread in it...there was 3 of us so we all tried each of our's entree and all 3 were awsome..my friend got some chicken entree with like porcini mushrooms in it and ive been deaming about it for a week now it was so good..service was very good(some hot little chezh blonde)very friendly staff...had like 3 parton margarita's and told her to make sure there nice and strong not just a bunch of triple sec..which they def. were nice and strong..and she didnt charge me double patron(which in alot of places they will,pisses me off when its $20 for one drink just because i want a nice stiff drink)...food is really good we got 2 apps, 3 beers, 3 margarits, 2 arnold parlmer's(which dont order those cause they charge you $7.00 for each,so they charge you for a ice tea and lemonade..but $7.00 bucks for a non alcholic drink is wild) , 3 entrees all come with pot and veg, and one coffee and a dessert..got the bananna cheese cake...good but not my favorite...bill was $160.00 which is very good in my book...place is very cool looking inside also...id def. go back very soon
