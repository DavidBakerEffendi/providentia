This is now our second time at the new Marzullo's since it sold in early December 2013. Our  first experience was not good but we attributed the poor service and food  to the new ownership getting started in this location. We returned last night to find only half of the dining area available with one waiter serving all available tables. It was so very cold in the restaurant to the point it was uncomfortable. We also heard other tables asking this one waiter to please turn up the heat. The menu is exactly the same as the previous owner's. So if you are in the mood for mediocre entree's this is the place to go. The new owner has also eliminated the half price pasta special's for Monday to Wednesday. That was the only attraction to our group going to Marzullo's these many years. In addition to doing away with the Monday to Wednesday special he also did away with the previous wait staff. The young waitresses that worked at Marzullo's were excellent. They were friendly, efficient and hard working and always maid our group feel welcome and comfortable. Keeping the wait staff and changing the menu and chef's would have made more sense. With so many other choices in the area it is highly unlikely we will be returning to this this restaurant.
