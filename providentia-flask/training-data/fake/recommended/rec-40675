We wanted to have tapas for dinner before going out clubbing and heard good things about Continental. It seems like this is the place where girls go for dinner before going out. All the tables were packed with party goers nibbling on tapas. We shared a few dishes.. cheesesteak eggrolls, crab mac and cheese, bbq chicken quesadilla, and roasted red pepper and feta cheese dip. We all agreed the bbq chicken quesadillas were the best and most flavorful and the least liked was t the dry/bland cheesesteak eggrolls. My girlfriends liked the crab mac and cheese because it was light and made with orzo, I personally prefer a thicker, heavier macaroni and cheese. For dessert we got the chocolate cupcake served with an orange flavored ice cream.. we weren't fans of this dish. We also got cotton candy .. which is exactly what it sounds like.. a circus style bag of cotton candy.. one of my girlfriends reminisced of her childhood while ripping off pieces of the blue cotton candy..but then slightly panicked when her mouth turned blue. We took a trip to the bathroom and were really surprised by the double sided mirrors. You can see right into the bathrooms as people wash their hands.. pick their teeth and touch up their make-up! It was so awkward.. I definitely didn't like that. Overall, I thought Continental was chic, the bill was reasonable but if we got cocktails it would have been quite expensive. We would have preferred everything to come out at once but I guess since it was tapas style it came out as it was ready. I wasn't blown away by the dishes but enjoyed the atmosphere.
