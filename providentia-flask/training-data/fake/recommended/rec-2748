My Thai noodle beef soup was good. The broth was delicious, but I was a bit turned off when I discovered that the beef came out of a bag...pre-packaged. I have been to other Asian restaurants where I can get fresh food for the same prices that Dee charges. Good food, convenient location...but mediocre quality.
