Delish!  Beautiful weather yesterday brought my girlfriend and me to Bonjour Montclair to sit outside and dine al fresco.  Both fortunately and unfortunately, that is the only time I will dine there because their inside seating is not fantastic.  Seriously, their only downfall.  With such delicious food and coffee and fresh juices, it's a shame this place doesn't have a larger store to showcase their goodness and allow their customers to relish in the food with non-styrofoam plates or plasticware.   That said, my only complaint.   I enjoyed the turkey and brie sandwich on a fresh baguette with a delicious salad and I'm assuming homemade dressing.  I asked for a large coffee with milk only and it came out latte style!  Yum!  My friend ordered a savory crepe with spinach and cheese and it looked great.  I dipped some of her leftover crepe in their jelly.  Was texturally perfect!  The employees were super nice and helpful as well as professional.  On another beautiful day, I will be back!
