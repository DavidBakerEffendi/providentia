I fondly remember this place as my family stopped by it during a trip to D.C. The food is top notch. I remember sampling the savory meatloaf my brother had, the sweet potato fries on my mom's plate. Sabrina's first introduced sweet potato fries to me, and I have to say that everyone should get it. (I'm serious, forgo the regular fries for these fritters!) Their portions were definitely worth the price. I'd sit on the inside though, outside space is tiny and exposed to all exhaust from moving vehicles.
