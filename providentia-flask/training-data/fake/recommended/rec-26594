Growing up in North Jersey, diners are my specialty.  Went here super late (close to midnight) and ordered my usual (eggs over medium with a side of toast and french fries).  I thought my food was just as it should be for a diner- delicious!  However, others at my tables who ordered less typical diner food (salmon, for example) were not very impressed.
