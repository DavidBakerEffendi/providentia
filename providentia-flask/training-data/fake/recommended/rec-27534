the wait - for a busy night - was very accomdating. we sat at bar all night because we were drinking our supper. quite classic of my friends and i. the prices were average and interior was small and lively.   the bartenders seemed a little un-friendly. and one was clearly there just to show off how sexy he was... he made drinks sloppily and barely got to half a 1-count when mixing the margaritas. he wouldn't look you directly in the eye, because he was busy grinning towards the ladies behind me.  ok... i get it .. but seriously ... if you are going to be an asshole, at least be able to make a miraculous margarita. it reminded me of a small college bar, but still had a nice intimate personality to it. the open windows are a hit. much needed on a caliente night of drinking and women.
