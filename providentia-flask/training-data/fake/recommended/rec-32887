This is our absolute favorite restaurant.   We always get the same thing and it is consistently good.  Steamed Dumplings for appetizer are light and tasty.. and for dinner Chicken or Shrimp Pad Thai and Pork Chops.   Thai iced tea is good if you like ginger.    Service is always excellent.  I go for dinner with my husband and also meet my girlfriends there.  BYOB
