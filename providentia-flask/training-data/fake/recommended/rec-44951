My boyfriend and walked over to the West Village to find a romantic restaurant .  The Little Owl caught our eye and two men sitting out front raved about the food.  The food was delicious!  We started with the tagliatelle bolognese which was perfect.  The pasta was al dente; the only way my Italian boyfriend will eat it.  The pork chops and chicken were also perfectly prepared.  Above all, the ambiance of this cozy corner restaurant was very romantic and the service was very friendly.  It was a perfect dinner!
