Trust the reviews and get the spicy thai basil noodles! Came here for an early dinner last night with 2 of my friends and had a great time. We got the last table outside, so already we were off to a good start. We shared the chicken and shrimp dumplings, avocado roll, chicken pad thai, and spicy basil noodles. Dumplings were light, noodles were lip-smacking good, and my drink (mango mojito) was a great compliment. A sweeter twist on the original mojito. Yummy food, solid drinks, quick and attentive service, and unbeatable prices. Would absolutely recommend this place if you're in the area, craving carbs, and on a budget. FYI: they only take reservations for parties of 6+.
