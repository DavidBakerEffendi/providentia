Best of the Asian sandwiches!  The bread is crusty and delicious.  My favorites are the shrimp and pork belly sandwiches.  How the sandwich manages to be fatty (in the best way), but not greasy is mystery.  The bread to fish ratio in the catfish sandwich isn't the best, but it's still really tasty.  I would drink the fresh watermelon juice all day, every day if it wasn't $3.50 per cup.
