So I now have two daughters at UVM  and they asked if we could go to Sweetwaters.  I agreed because maybe the last visit was an aberration.  I was wrong.  We called and asked to be put on the waiting list.  We told them we were a party of five.  They said there was no wait to come right in.  We walked in less than 5 minutes later and were told the wait would be over an hour.  From no wait to an hour in 5 minutes or less?  And an hour wait for food that is suspect at best? Stay away from the mismanaged 2nd rate hole.  Try Luenigs or the Church Street Tavern or even VPB. RUN AWAY from this place
