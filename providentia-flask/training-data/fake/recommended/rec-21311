We had a great meal on the Terrace at Riverpark on Sunday night. They have really hit their stride. The sweetbreads with fennel and heirloom strawberries was amazing, as was the perfectly prepared rabbit. Service was attentive and knowledgeable. Plus they have a good wine list with some interesting, fairly priced wines and they handled a nice Burgundy GC I brought perfectly for a fair $25 corkage fee. Far and away the best restaurant in the Stuyvesant-Kips Bay-Murray Hill corridor.
