Visited National Mechanics for the first time today. Sat at the bar and only had drinks no food. The bar service was good - the bartenders were attentive and offered suggestions. The bartender was also knowledgeable on the history behind the name which we were curious about. The atmosphere was cozy and comfortable. Would definitely consider coming back and hopefully will get to try some of the food items next time.
