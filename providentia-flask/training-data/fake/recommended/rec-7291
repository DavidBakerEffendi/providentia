Came in sight unseen for brunch with a friend and had a really lovely experience. The staff was welcoming and friendly (and efficient) and the food was delicious. It was a really nice meal and we left vowing to return. Only regret was that the lighting was a bit bright - I felt like we were in a showcase. Still, I'll bring my shades and return soon!
