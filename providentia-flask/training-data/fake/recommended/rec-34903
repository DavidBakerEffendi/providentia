Excellent food and attentive waitstaff. The Indian food is so good that I haven't had a chance to try the Thai side of the menu. It nice to use the yelp coupons. It is a real treat coming here. This place is low lit and has a very nice atmosphere. It seems like a more upscale than your average indian resturant and the prices are good. My daughter says it is her favorite Korma across 2 continents.
