Very quiet during the weekday lunch hours which is odd for a place that makes sandwiches. Food was absolutely delicious all around. I went with a group of ten and ordered a cheese and meat plate, salds, olives and lots of paninis. Everyone seemed to be satisfied by the experience, and a visit to the Museum of Moving Images after, topped off the afternoon. It was 4 million degrees outside, otherwise we would of sat on the spacious outside deck.
