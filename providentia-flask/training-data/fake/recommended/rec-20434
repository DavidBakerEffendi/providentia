I'm giving them five stars for the biscuits/eggs-benedict dish I had at their brunch.  The egg/grits was also amazing.  I'm not even a big brunch person, but I can't stop talking about how great that food was.  Dinner was probably closer to four stars [still not too shabby, though!].  Service is good and the outdoor area in back is really cute.  Definitely a real find.
