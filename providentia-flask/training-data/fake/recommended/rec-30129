I came in here on New Year's Eve on my way back from the bars in hopes of some delicious greasy food. I decided on the bacon banh mi sandwich with a side of tater tots. The banh mi sandwich was pretty gross. The cut bacon pieces were hard and chewy. You could barely stick a fork in them.The tater tots were...well just plan ol' tator tots. Nothing special added to them. There are a lot of other interesting choices on the menu that are probably a lot better than the banh mi sandwich. Maybe it was just an off night but I was very disappointed with the food.
