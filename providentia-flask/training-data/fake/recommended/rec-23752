I love Cantina and their margaritas and their killer décor. My boyfriend loves their mucho grande burritos and I am always getting the chicken quesadilla because of its sheer perfection! The employees are friendly as heck, I've been there a million times and never once received anything but good service. However, it does get busy and employees  can only go so fast so be considerate!
