Very good food, good service, elegant ambience, but nothing set it apart from other restaurants of its type, in my opinion. It could have been my fault for not ordering the tomato basil pasta that people rave about, but that was my impression. Also, maybe more wine would have helped... I will say that the bread was delicious and that you need to get a reservation well ahead of time and may need to go slightly earlier or later than when you would ideally eat dinner.
