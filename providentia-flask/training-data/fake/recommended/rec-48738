Came for dinner last night based on all the great reviews. I have no complaints.  In no particular order, these are my thoughts/observations: 1.  The chicken satay was perhaps the best I've ever had, and I try it at every Thai restaurant because it's a staple. 2.  The service was good..our waitress was nice ,sweet, friendly, human, etc. 3.  Our reservation was for 9:30 (Saturday night), and were seated right away.  They weren't packed, but still busy.  This is perhaps normal, and neither here nor there, but whatever. 4.  I enjoyed the pieces of garlic bread which were unexpectedly served with our appetizers.   5.  There are other interesting choices on the menu that we didn't have stomach capacity left to try, but I'll be back to check 'em out.  Like that pork belly and sausage thing.   6.  The prices are, in fact, quite reasonable for such a place. 7.  The ambiance / decor was nice...interesting, not cheap at all, but neither was it fancy.  A cool-casual vibe all the way. 8.  I'm too lazy to write more. 9.  The chicken pad karpraw was good, but not great or remarkable...portion size was a little small.
