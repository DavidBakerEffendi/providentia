Went for a Sunday brunch here on a visit and had a very satisfying meal of 2 eggs, toast, home potatoes, a nice thick bacon.  Slice of chocolate-peanut butter cream pie shared by 3 at the end was a nice topper.  Very impressed with the quality buttermilk biscuits on the table upon seating which was greatly needed as the long wait had made me starved.  Bit pricey and the wait detract a star, but I would definately recommend for a lazy sunday meal.
