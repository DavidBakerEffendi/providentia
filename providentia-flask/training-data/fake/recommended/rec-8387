This place is fantastic. To be fair I've only ordered delivery so I have no idea what the restaurant itself is like, but the food itself is some of the best I've ever had in New York. I've tried a few different dishes including their Pakoras, Rogan Josh and Dhan Sak and they are all great. This is a great restaurant, especially for this neighborhood!
