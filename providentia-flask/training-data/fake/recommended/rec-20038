We have been back for dinner on multiple occasions and Runner & Stone does not disappoint.  From appetizer to entree to dessert, the food is perfectly prepared and delicious!  Most recently we celebrated my birthday here with my family, not only were we treated like "regulars"(my parents were impressed!), the food was the best its been yet!  We had the salad special, soup special and duck pastrami to start, followed by lamb burger, the roast chicken, the fish special and a vegetarian special.  We had to rush out before dessert(but I've got my eye on the pear tatin for next time!). Thank you Runner & Stone for adding culinary delight to our neighborhood!
