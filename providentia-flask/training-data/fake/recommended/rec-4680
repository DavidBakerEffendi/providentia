I've had many great dinners at Rizzuto's. The flat bread pizzas are so unique and crafted with such fresh ingredients. The wine list is extensive and reasonably priced. I highly recommend their pasta dishes and you can mix & match types of pasta and sauces. Oh & the calamari is to die for. Recently, my new favorite time at Rizzuto's is during early afternoon on the weekends solo with my paper. (Outdoor seating is quaint & quiet during this time of day when available). They have this amazing lunch deal called The Sampler: 1/2 any sandwich, 1/2 salad & a cup of soup for $12. Very hearty portions. As a self proclaimed soup-ophile it's the highlight of the trio. I pair this with a bloody mary, clearly home made & the perfect level of face sweating from the horseradish. Sadly, the service is hit or miss. My last visit I was completely forgotten about by a waitress who had 2 other tables. She was always sincerely apologetic but it put a damper on the time I look forward to every few weeks. Nevertheless, though I appreciate service as much as what's being served I still very much enjoy this establishment for some me time or a great meal out with friends.
