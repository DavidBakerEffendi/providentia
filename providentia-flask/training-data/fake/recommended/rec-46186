The food here is fine, but definitely not the main draw. The drinks are amazing and the atmosphere is so comfortable - I went my husband to meet some friends, and what we thought would be a 2 hour (tops) meal turned into 4 hours. Our waitress was great and didn't seem too irritated that we wouldn't leave. ;) The bathroom was not as clean as I would like, and I felt like the floor was a little sticky - not a great feeling. But for the drinks and atmosphere I would def come back.
