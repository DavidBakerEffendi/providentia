Surprisingly there still was a long customer line for Halal Guys at mid night. The taste is not bad. However, there is one problem, the rice is too dry, it may drive you crazy if you don't add a lot of sauce on the rice(and I saw a lot of people added quarters of ranch sauce there) or not have a can of soda with this. Â In my opinion, it is ok, basic on the low price, but unfortunately,it isn't good enough to make me to buy that again at mid night.
