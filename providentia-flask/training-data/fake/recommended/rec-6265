When my friend said we were going to leave Manhattan to eat Thai food in Queens, I got nervous. "Leaving Manhattan" is not something I do because of food. SriPraPhai was proved me dead wrong. First of all, it's an easy commute from Manhattan. The 7 train to Woodside and a three block walk takes you there. Note well this is a CASH ONLY restaurant. The service is good, pleasant, and capable. Our papaya salad (there are several on the menu) was crunchy, fresh, with a little bite. My Taiwanese friend and I (I'm a white guy from middle America) have a different take on "bite". The fish cakes were among the best I've eaten. The Red Curry was amazing. The second entree, Larb: ground pork with mint and lime was served with a huge serving of perfectly done white rice. We shared on dessert that was a tasty combo of sticky rice in coconut milk. Two appetizers, two entrees, one side dish, two beverages, and a desert was $47. I'm definitely going back!
