I was pleasantly surprised..... I came here last minute because it was close to where I was staying.  I sat at the bar and ordered a caesar salad and linguine and white clam sauce. The salad was good, but the linguine and white clam sauce was one of the best I have ever had.  It was al dente and was loaded with flavor.  I can't wait to get back here to try some other dishes.
