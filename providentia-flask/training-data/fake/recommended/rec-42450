I decided to try this place for lunch after seeing a lot of positive reviews. I have to say I was happy myself. It's not too far from where I work and they have healthy food options which taste good too. I ordered the 'Ultimate Plate' and the 'Alkaline Shake' - both turned out to be good choices. But, I have to admit there were so many other options on the menu that I would want to try, so I'm definitely going back to this place. The man behind the cash counter was courteous and pointed me to a much larger menu than what was in front of me on the boards in the restaurant. I have to say though, I felt the lunch was kind of expensive given that it cost me $20 (including tax and tip) for those 2 things. The plate was kinda big though, good enough to last me 2 full meals and I guess if the food is healthy, you've got to pay! One other thing that wasn't a deal breaker but not the most comfortable either that they have a small space inside the restaurant hence not enough tables to sit there and eat if you wanted to. Happy Eating!
