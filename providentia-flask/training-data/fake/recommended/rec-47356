Damn-another restaurant in NYC that kitchen closes during the transition from lunch to dinner-wtf. I still to this very day-do not comprehend why restaurants close for 2 hours during the meal change. It's inconvenient and unwarranted. Not to mention- you lose potential recurring customers and immediate sales. Howbeit, I managed to place an order in for the Octopus-which is one of their top rated items on the menu. To say the less- I was not impressed-but not disappointed. It was filling and accompanied a delicious chickpea salad. Now you officially have "The SupremeTouch"
