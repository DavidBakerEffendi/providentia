meh.  I really like johnny brendas and I kneeewww there was a reason that I hadn't sat at a table there in a long table - simply because it ALWAYS sucks.   I couldn't avoid sitting at a booth there last week because I was with 5 of my good friends...sitting at the bar on a friday night when you all want to eat just doesn't work....to crowded and you really can't talk to each other.  Without getting into details (If you want some good ones read abigail "rabbit rabbit" l.'s review) service was very slow and generally not good(semi rude).  I'm not dissing all the waitresses there though, there are some good ones and the bartenders are pretty awesome...but somehow I always get stuck with the poor performing waitresses.   You lose a star this time JB's!  sorry.  I still like your beers and your atmosphere, but you really need to step it up a little.  I'm not a hard person to please, I worked in food service for years so I totally understand its a hard job but its not that hard to stay pleasant 90% of the time and do a semi decent job.
