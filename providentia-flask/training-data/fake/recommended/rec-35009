Very charming place my husband found one night to remedy our Greek food crave. We weren't expecting much, since Greek restaurants (at least good ones) seem to be something of a rarity in NJ, compared to our former days in NYC and frequent trips to Astoria. Upon arriving, we were warmly greeted by the wait staff and offered to choose whichever empty table that was available. Their menu was incredible, with many hard to find Greek specialties like grilled loukaniko and grilled octopus. The waiter (Mario), was extremely helpful and graciously assisted in helping us choose our appetizers (mezes) and entrees. We had a bunch of mezes: melitzanosalata (eggplant dip), keftedes (seasoned Greek meatballs), saganaki (fried kefalograviera cheese), tomato feta salad with wheat rusk, kolokithkeftedes (zucchini fritters). All were delicious, though the eggplant dip was not smoky & thick enough for me (but it was delicious nonetheless). The pita bread was especially toasty and complimented the meal nicely. My husband had his standard pork souvlaki which was nicely done with juicy chunks of grilled pork, fresh fried potato"chips" (yumm!). The tzatziki was fresh and creamy, way beyond the usual goopy mess we have sadly encountered elsewhere. I had Shrimp Santorini, which had a great pepper & tomato sauce and some feta sprinkled on it. The owner, who had walked over to us to make sure we were pleased with our food, sent over an extra dessert to our table for our son. This wonderful place more than exceeded our expectations and MUCH closer than driving to Astoria for great Greek cuisine in a warm atmosphere. Can't wait to return soon!
