IT JUST SIMPLY AMAZES ME WHEN I READ THESE REVIEWS WRITTEN BY THE SILVER SPOON RESIDENTS OF THE SUBURBS. LAUGH OUT LOUD. Ok, so you've read the reviews about the food, etc but this is quite simple folks. This is the #1 Sports Bar in the United States of America. Period. The ambience is 5 platinum stars. Anytime there is a goal, touchdown, etc the bells, whistles and horns will blow off like your in the 1st row of the stadium in person. The music is upbeat and sets a motivating tempo to party. Friday and Saturday nights in C&P is the epitome of brotherly love. The commoratore is SECOND TO NONE. Trust me folks, I've been to sports bars all over the country. This is numeral uno. Wether your there to watch sports or party and eat this place accommodates everything. Please for the love of God will people from the suburbs stop coming here and rating it. They only write sub par reviews because genetically they are nerds and wouldn't know a good time if it landed on their main line boring heads
