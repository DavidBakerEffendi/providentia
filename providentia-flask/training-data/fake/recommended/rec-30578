After a long day of apartment hunting, my future roommate and I decided to stop-in because they were the onyl restaurant we noticed was still open and seating on a weekday at that hour. The place has a huka bar lounge feel to it.  There are candles everywhere and you can opt to sit on pillows and low tables if you don't want a normal booth.  The servers start you off with some type of cracker garnished with greek yogurt and olives.  That alone told us that the meal was going to be good. We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share.  First, we started with the humus.  So incredibly fresh with a bite of lemon and a basket of pita pockets to enjoy it with.  You have to try the sweet corn and cheese!  It is a steel pan layered with some type of cheese and sprinkled with very sweet corn.  I have no idea why this tastes so amazing together, but it was the best of the three appetizers we ordered.  We wanted the duck with figs, but they were all outs so we tried the lamb pizza instead.  It was okay.  Not my favorite part of the meal, but the dipping sauce that came with it was great. The bill came out pretty cheap and the service was efficient.  I would come back here for drinks and an entree.  Perfect place for a date who is adventerous enough to try new foods or a group of friends that like to converse on the floor.
