I have no idea where people are getting their ideas from but this is one of the better diners in NJ. They have everything you'd want in a diner experience: tons of selections, expansive dinner options, high quality breakfast and desserts, and the vibe. Diners are everywhere in NJ, and most of them are sub-par to average. Lame food - crap choices (especially for vegetarians). When I come here there is always something new & creative to try, never boring, and reasonably priced. Just last night I had a veggie panini with a side salad (they offer this or fries, automatically - really awesome choice). They have different bread choices which is awesome because I love sandwiches with non-boring bread. On each page there is at least one interesting option for a vegetarian & of course a million more for omni people. The breakfast is also super ballin'. Their pancakes are huge and you can get so many different versions. My only big complaint is their french toast isn't very interesting, and often they add sour cream to their home fries (wtf?). Anyway they also have a dessert case that gives me a lady boner when I walk in because I want to eat everything inside. I took one star off because I agree the service here is hit or miss. I noticed they are *always* getting new servers - and they all have either some kind of attitude or can be super slow. But you know what ? Whatever, I bet working in a diner sucks. The food is super good. They've never given me an attitude at the front counter about splitting checks, and they have a loyalty card so that once you spend 500 points you get a free meal. Niice!
