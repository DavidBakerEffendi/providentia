Worth every star! We came into Williamsburg on our last day in the city before headed back to California. As a born and bred Alabamian, I can tell you they nailed the Southern flavors! We tried the chicken biscuit, honey biscuit and the sausage gravy- all three were AWESOME! And the buttermilk ranch with the crudit√©s was also a great touch. Highly recommend and a great find!
