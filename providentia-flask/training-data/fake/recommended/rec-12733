Let me just say it: OMG worth the hype. I am always hesitant about waiting in lines. Its not worth it. So when one of my friends suggested that we stop by the Clinton St. Baking Company for a Sunday breakfast, "Oh it might be a hour wait at least", I was totally skeptical. But we got there 30 minutes before it opened. And it was raining, so a lot of people weren't out that morning. Lucky for us: we were seated right as the place opened. The place is tiny, so I can see why the wait is so freaking long most of the time. I am so glad that we waited. I have never been so satisfied with each and every component of meal before. I ordered the Clinton Street omelette and enjoyed every bite. But it wasn't just the omelette. It was the toast (so fresh) and the jam (I almost licked the container: its an amazing combination of bitter/sweet). And the potatoes.... so tasty and buttery. I tried my friend's pancakes and, indeed, they were delicious. I am not a huge fan of pancakes, so I probably wouldn't order them, but if that's your thing, go for it....you won't be disappointed. Its a NYC experience for sure: just get there before it opens and be prepared for taste bud heaven!
