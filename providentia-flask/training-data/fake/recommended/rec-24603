Can't say anything besides "WOW" about this place...My husband invited me for a dinner yesterday  and we were wondering where to go as we both love new places..There is a risk and never knows what can you get..But  we both work in Chelsea area decided to go somewhere not too far from the jobs. Don't know why we chose Salinas..May be the place was on our way and we didn't want to waste time for looking around, may be I loved the name cause I'm crazy about  Spain..:))   We were simply shocked..The outside entrance wasn't promising..all black and boring, what is typical for this area and neighborhood. But inside..Mamma Mia... gorgeous place, full of fresh flowers, intimate lights, reach interior design and very good music. And a huge fireplace in the back garden room...Service was excellent. My mojito was very good. My husband tried a tequila mix drink from their list of coctails -it was very good..Can't name all ingredients as a menu was really unknown for me. Our chose of fried octopus on potatoes  and delicious  artichoke/pine nuts mix appetizers was  very good. And then we got- Paella with chicken and mixed seafood..WOW...the plate was enough to share between 3 ppl!!! Just delicious...I wish to come for their desserts as it was no room for any single piece yesterday :))) I remember profiteroles with cream from a dessert menu...At the end we were greeted by the place Owner who was kind enough to spend several min with us, show a back garden room with fireplace, sign a business card and wish all the best...Very pleasant experience..I will definately come over again , for desserts and more.
