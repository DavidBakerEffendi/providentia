I'm not even a sushi person and I love this place! My friend who goes to Pratt swears by Iron Chef House for her lunchtime sushi fix. I have to admit, the rolls are pretty amazing here. My favorite is the definitely the monkey roll. I'm the type that is hesitant to try anything other than a California roll at sushi restaurants yet I found myself adventurous and trying new dishes at this place. I trust that the fish is fresh and usually combined in a way that makes me forget I'm eating raw fish. I love how cozy the atmosphere is too. Definitely worth a stop by if you're in the area.
