I went here on a date and, though the date wasn't amazing, the bar was!  When you walk in you go through a heavy curtain into a dark bar.  We were able to snag a great table, and right after we did the bar became really crowded.  The special cocktails are to die for- and strong!  I would suggest ordering a few different drinks between your group so you can taste test them all without a huge bar tab and a hell of a hangover. Great beginning-to-date spot- feels intimate, loud enough to be lively but not loud enough that you can't hear the other person. Also a great place to come and people watch- an interesting group of  fashionable outfits and people.
