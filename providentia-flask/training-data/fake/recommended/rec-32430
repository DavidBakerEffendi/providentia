Interior design is amazing! Very romantic, chic, especially with the dim lights. Wish the tables weren't so close together though. Started off with calamari. I'm a huge fan of calamari, but I didn't like how the squid was huge and you could taste more of the flour instead of the squid itself. Had the lychee sangria and I definitely recommend this one! Soooo yummy and refreshing! Loved the fresh lychee in it too! Ate the basil noodles for dinner and it was large portion and tasty! Wish it was a tad less saltier though. Overall a good experience!
