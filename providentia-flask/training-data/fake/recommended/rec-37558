We checked in on Yelp and received free dumplings in spicy oil, but they were only partially cooked, so we each got a mouth full of meat paste. The replacement dumplings were good though. The Chongqing Spicy Chicken was delicious as was the spicy vegetable salad. The fried eggplant with minced pork in garlic sauce was mediocre. The eggplant was battered and fried but otherwise unflavored. The sauce with pork made it decent.
