Based on some of the earlier reviews I was a bit nervous -- it definitely sounds as if the service can be uneven.  But I went with three others for dinner on a Friday night, and all of us were floored.  The service was spot-on, the two fish dishes were cooked and sauced perfectly, the vegetarian (raviolo) was the very best vegetarian dish I've ever had, and the duck (my order) was damn near tear-inducing. (And, although it doesn't need to be said again, yes, the spicy duck meatballs are that good.) All four of us also gave rave reviews for atmosphere -- not too loud or cramped, but busy enough that it didn't feel stuffy, and intimate enough that you know you're in the West Village.
