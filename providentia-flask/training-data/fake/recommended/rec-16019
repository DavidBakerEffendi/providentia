HOLLLLLLLLLLLY BALLS.  If you die tomorrow and have not yet eaten the ricotta gnocchi with creamy black truffle sauce then I feel bad for you.   Melts in your mouth. Also got the tuna carpaccio which was delish but the gnocchi was the best I've ever had. Service was a tad slow...once again, gnocchi...off the hook...worth. the. wait.
