The 5 stars say it all. Hubby and I went for NYE dinner. Hubby had the chicken dish, and I had the trout. For sure, it was one of the best fish dishes I have ever had (and fish is my preferred meat of choice). The enter was cooked to perfection, and the fish was well complimented with sides of asparagus and carrot puree - yes, not potato, but carrot puree - with lemon sauce on top. The entire effect was nothing short of mindblowing! Hubby's chicken was also pretty good, and the portions were of a good size. We both have sizable appetites, and the dishes did justice. However, the review will not be complete till I eulogize the flourless chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream we ate for dessert. It was so good that hubby and I fought for the last bite! Unfortunately I don't recall the name of the server, but he was super nice and efficient. No complaints here too. Overall, an extremely satisfying experience, and we are waiting to go back to Cafe Orlin the next time we visit NY.
