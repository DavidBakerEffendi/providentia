**BEWARE**  While waiting on line today I noticed the familiar faces who usually serves up the street meat is no longer there.  The cart and brand looks the same.  Seems like the original owners sold the stand, but not the recipe.  The rice was different, gyro and chicken was chopped into very small pieces.  Meats didn't have much flavor.  The flavor I once enjoyed is no longer at this location.  No wonder the lines across the street is even longer now.
