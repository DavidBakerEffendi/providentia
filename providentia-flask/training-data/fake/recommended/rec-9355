Empanadas everywhere! So many different choices I actually felt overwhelmed. I'm very indecisive but we finally went with the viagra, brazil, and chorizo empanadas, as well as the chicharron. All of the empanadas were packed with flavor and were surprisingly filling. The viagra empanada was the most unique, consisting of a different seafoods mixed together in a white sauce. The chicharron is way too salty though-- you'd have to eat one of those babies with a whole bowl of rice. It was also a bit tough and hard to chew. All in all, it was a pleasant experience. Oh yes, and the green sauce is AMAZING! I dipped everything in it and couldn't get enough of it. I would've taken a whole jar of it home if I could.
