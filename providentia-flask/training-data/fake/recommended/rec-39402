Delicious Italian restaurant off the beaten path. Owners are young and passionate. As the only lunch customers on a late weekday, we were treated with samplings of wine when unsure of what to order, information on dishes from the waiter (who is also the cook), and recommendations. We all got a personal pizza, I ordered anchovy and olives, so delicious and fresh. Even got a few desserts which were equally as fresh. If you are in little Italy and don't want basic spaghetti and meatballs, try here for authentic and fresh real Italian food
