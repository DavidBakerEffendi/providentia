I've never had a pleasurable experience at La Va, despite the fact that their coffee is pretty good and (I hear) their food stuff is pretty OK. Maybe I should take a walk around the block or ten great big breaths. I'm mad. I stopped into La Va today after dropping my bike off at Bicycle Therapy to get a new tube. I brought my laptop and a book that promised to help me reword my resume and get me a job. I found a table near an outlet. I had no cash so I used the ATM hidden in the back by the bathrooms. It gave me a twenty after charging me $2.50. I bought an "XL" iced coffee which looked like a medium with a bigger price tag. I asked the barista for the internet password, which is "Facebook." I was ready to sit for a few hours and fix up my paper self, but I couldn't because the internet wasn't working. While fiddling with it, I was approached by a manager who asked me and the girl sitting behind me (who also had mad books and a computer occupying space) if we could sit together at a table for one so that other guests could sit as well. "That's fine", I said, "but could you tell me why the internet is not working?" "We shut it off during peak hours," he told me. It was a Saturday afternoon. I told him that was dumb. He asked me why it was dumb. I said because the main reason people go to coffee shops is to sit with a cup and their computer. I said I understand you want people in and out of here so I'm out of here. He shrugged me off and went on to hassle a few more customers about their seating arrangements. I got my bike (and by God, are those gentlemen at Bicycle Therapy friendly!) and I awkwardly walked it down South with my extra large iced coffee.
