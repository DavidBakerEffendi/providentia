Jones used to be the perfect place: cheerful kitschy 60s interior with comfort food appealing to both guy and girl headed down to see a movie at the Ritz. But then, like Don Draper's household and the offices of Sterling Cooper, things started to change. The atmosphere and service are still delightful (hence the three stars). The server was welcoming, came back several times to fill our iced tea glasses, and asked us, along with someone else, how our food was. Unfortunately, I had to offer some constructive feedback (OK, complain). I used to LOVE their turkey burger. Ordered it every time for the buttery bun and freshly ground turkey topped with a dollop of melting boursin cheese (similar to one of the burger preparations at Monks). Sadly, the burger this time was a thick patty more similar to the one they serve at Marathon. And the beef in my father's beef brisket sandwich was poorly seasoned. Perhaps I'll be back for some grilled cheese and tomato soup or another basic they probably do well. But unfortunately I think my burger broke the Jones' spell.
