Don't be fooled by my 3 stars...I like Eataly!! but because it was my first time going there I didn't get the full experience. Future visits my rating may grow or decrease . Everything looked really fresh from the seafood, bread, and pasta..We bought a 10 dollar jar of sauce which taste really good even on boxed pasta. A lot of the things are just so extremely expensive (even though I did expect it) the girls in Eataly were nice and pleasant unlike the staff in Birreria. For you to really appreciate Eataly you have to really know and appreciate good quality italian food and be willing to spend the big bucks on making it. They have everything in there in addition ice cream, desserts, pizza, wine tasting...it's a really good experience..If you're going there to eat at one of their restaurants, make sure you DO YOUR RESEARCH, you might need reservations in order to have a pleasant experience. I must go back to try some more things like their desserts!!
