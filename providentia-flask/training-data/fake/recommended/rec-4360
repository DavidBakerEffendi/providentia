Downstairs - decent food and drinks, good, laid back vibe. In the bar area, the pool table takes up quite a lot of space, but you can deal. Upstairs - This is where JB's shines. They get some really good acts here, and even though the space is small, the sound is fantastic. Sound guys and gals from other venues should talk to the folks here to find out how they manage to make it sound so good - proof that a small venue doesn't mean poor sound quality. Even though it is pretty small, I love the split with the balcony above - where you'll usually find me when I'm there for a show. Bartenders have always been really nice. And did I mention the acts? Because they really do get some great acts here, and when it comes to the local bands that open up for the touring acts, they do a great job of pairing them up well, showcasing fantastic Philly talent. Bathrooms are clean and there are plenty of stalls. Beer is average price. The setup is such that the merch table is sectioned off but not too far away. All in all, this is the best small venue in the city. Now can you please open one of these up in south Philly? Pretty please?
