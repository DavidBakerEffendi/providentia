I'm surprised at the negative comments. I too have been to Stone Hearth 3 times. I've found the waitstaff extremely friendly and especially warm to children. The Thai slaw salad is great, as us the trout and pizzas. Butterscotch pudding is amazing. My kids now ask to go. Nice wine list. Service is a bit slow but I chalk that up to working through the opening weeks.
