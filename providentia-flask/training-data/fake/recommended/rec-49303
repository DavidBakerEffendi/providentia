The portion sizes may look small but a meal at Burger Baby will fill you up plenty. I had both duck fat and non duck fat fries and I prefer the former. The duck fat fries were salty and crunchy but not dry--- creating the perfect trifecta of yum . The coleslaw, which is often overlooked at restaurants, was fresh, crunchy and slightly sweet. The burger was out of this world. I ordered the Kobe burger medium rare with the black truffle aioli and fois gras. A very messy burger but delicious nonetheless. The meat was juicy, tender, and flavorful. Ketchup would have done a disservice to this burger. The decor is fitting--a modern take on the classic 1950's diner. Tip: remember to use plenty of napkins...I did but I'll still had to wipe down my iPhone screen when I got home. Burger Baby is a must do for gourmet hamburgers in the Hartford area.
