Great for a late night burger.  I've never eaten here prior to 1am (restaurant options are limited in the West Village this late at night), but on a weeknight it is quiet, cozy and local.  The burgers are pretty decent, the fries are probably from McDonald's, the service is barebones (fine by me).  It's can be pretty packed when the Meatpacking crowd takes over on Fridays/Saturdays, but I digress...
