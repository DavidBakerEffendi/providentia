The Lamb Doner Shawarma Sandwich was very good, lamb was tender, juicy, and flavorful, their hot sauce and white sauce were very tasty.  The Falafel Sandwich was also really good although I would've liked if it came with some tahini but that's just my preference. My favorite was their Hummus which was rich and creamy, served with a nicely scorched pita.  I could make a meal out of just this and be very happy!
