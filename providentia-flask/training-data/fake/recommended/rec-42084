dsdflkh?  WHAT? adkfnsadoi! WHAT?  skdals8?!!  WHAT?  I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE MUSIC!  OH, WAIT, APPETIZER?  YES!   Lots of style, not much substance.  Kinda like a dinner-club.  If you're in the mood for that, by all means.  Good for grabbing a drink or desert before going out.  But for a dining experience?  Not so much.  Food was okay and over-priced, you are paying for the swank factor, no less. Best part is the bathrooms and photo booth.
