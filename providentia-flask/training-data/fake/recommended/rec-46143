This is a regular restuarant I go to when I am in town on business. My whole team enjoys the atmosphere and food. The buidling is as described in the other reviews. The menu has variety, but there is some definite germanic influence. The steak and seafood options I have eaten have been delicious and the wine selection is good as well.
