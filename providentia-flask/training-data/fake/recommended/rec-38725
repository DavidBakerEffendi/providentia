If you're looking for a great (and FILLING) breakfast and don't have a lot of cash, you've got to head to Moe's.  Located on a nondescript side street west of downtown, this place has incredible pancakes, hash browns, omelettes, and decent coffee too.  Most times two of us get out of there for less than $20.  If you're not willing to show up early, though, you'd better have some serious willpower, because you can wait for a looong time, the whole time being teased by the smell of the food.  The apple walnut pancakes are the best, Jerry, the best!
