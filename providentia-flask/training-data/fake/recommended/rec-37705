One of my favorite ramen spots in the city.  Although I am a fan of Ippudo, something about Minca and it's sister restaurant Kambi really draw me.  This is the place I go when I just want a good meal and don't need a lot of hoopla surrounding it.  I love sitting at the bar watching the guys assemble the ramen bowls, especially when they give a hard shake to the ramen noodles that have just been pulled from the boiling water.  The radish salad, gyoza and miso ramen are the perfect things to share.  I dream about that radish salad.  Don't know anywhere else in the city that does it but it's the perfect amount of crunchy freshness to compliment such a rich and savory bowl of soup.
