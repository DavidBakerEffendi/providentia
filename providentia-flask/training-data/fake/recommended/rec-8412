This is the best Indian food I've had in NYC, including all those east side joints in Manhattan. I usually get the "2 course meal deal" with Dan Saak and keema. The husband-wife duo do a fine job of adding the personal touch- so friendly, always serving us tea while we wait to pick up our take-out food. I feel so privileged to have them in our neighborhood!!
