Come before noon on the weekends because the line outside gets crazy. Tried the pumpkin pancakes that everyone raves about and the egg Florentine. Thought the pumpkin pancake was okay, a bit overly sweet and couldn't finish it. The egg Florentine was really good and came with a small cup of OJ and cappuccino. It's not the cheapest breakfast meal but you get to sit with your friend in a nice atmosphere and have a little variety on your plate.
