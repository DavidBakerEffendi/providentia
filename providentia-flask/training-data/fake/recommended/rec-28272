The place is BYOB, has a really great atmosphere, the mac and cheese with truffle oil and mushrooms is the best I've ever had. I was meeting my friend here and when she showed up they asked her to wait outside because they didn't open until 6. This was at 5:55. Okay. Besides that everything else was wonderful
