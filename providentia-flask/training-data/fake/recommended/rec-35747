My wife and I visited Philly for the first time and just walked in on a Saturday night at 530.  They were very welcoming even though we were a walk-in with our 5 month old daughter.  Having said that.....  The food was incredible. We ordered many dishes because they all sounded amazing........ And they were.  The octopus (pulpo) was the most perfectly cooked octopus I ever had (and I work in a professional kitchen.)    It was delicious and tender yet crispy and just amazingly awesome.  The simple arugula salad was seasoned and dressed perfectly and garnished with beautiful figs.  The short ribs were great, as well as the duck rillettes.  The anchovy dish made me want to do a back flip.  They were amazing and deliciously paired with a melon gelee (i think) The dessert was goo also but portions were a little to small. I dont think I will ever try a different restaurant when in Philly because this one was THAT good.
