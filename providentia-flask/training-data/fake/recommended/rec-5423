I was totally mesmerized by the attention to detail from the service to the food, to accommodating us as we arrived earlier than planned.....the pasta was light, flavorful and came in abundance!  The chicken parm my husband got was practically hanging over the plate...I tasted it..it was Divine!!!  We will come back....with company!!!
