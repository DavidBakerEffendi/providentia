After a full day of sightseeing with my Mom, who was tired and wanted Italian, we were happy to be welcomed in to Sotto 13. We were seated in the front room (a little quieter than the back room, which agreed with us). The ambiance was lovely, lighting perfect, cocktails respectable and the pizza delish. Thanks for the respite this Sunday eve!
