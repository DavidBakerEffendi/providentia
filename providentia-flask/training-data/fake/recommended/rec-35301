I used to come here 5:30 sharp to beat the crowd when it opens. It is the closest izakaya from where I live, and I come here for the convenience. However, the food quality has dropped constantly over the years. Maybe it is because there is not much competition in Midtown West. I don't think Hagi would be as popular if it was sitting in Midtown East or East Village.
