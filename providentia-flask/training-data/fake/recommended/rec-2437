I decided to try some cheesesteaks in Philly recently, and so I journeyed to Geno's and Pat's, and had a "wit wiz", one after the other.  Geno's is hands down the better sandwich.  The bread is soft and tastes fresh.  The onions are tastier, the meat is more tender and less chewy than Pat's.  Even Geno's cheese was better tasting and wasn't dripping or watered down like Pat's.  Also, try the fries at Geno's...nicely salted, slightly crunchy on the outside but soft in the inside.  I may have had Geno's first, at the peak of my hunger, but my palette never fails in discerning a good meal.  I'll be coming back to Geno's the next time I visit Philly.
