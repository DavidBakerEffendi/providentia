What a delightful evening. Went on Christmas Eve and were rewarded with everything firing on all cylinders. Service was excellent from moment we entered to the warm holiday greetings from the owner or manager's family when we left. Our server was Justin and he helped our party of four make sure we had an excellent tasting of their signature dishes. We started off sharing for four the salad, a delicious potato layered salad, and an assortment of potatoes and yucca. For dinner we also shared the excellent special braised short ribs, skirt steak (seasoned perfectly), and a delightful bouibaisse (well made entirely with fresh seafood). For dessert we shared an excellent authentic and beautifully crafted parfait with Peruvian rice and purple corn pudding as well as a pastry, caramel and rich vanilla ice cream topper. Even the coffee was perfect. A french press and a couple lattes. Our expectations were exceeded by this well run, nicely decorated and warm restaurant. I noticed that many of the guests were also from South America so that speaks to the authenticity of the restaurant. Price was reasonable, very convenient to shopping and parking. What else could you ask for. Merry Christmas to All. Only one suggestion. Carry an LED flashlight if you are over 65. It is very dark in creating a relaxed atmosphere.
