The little owl that delivers a big hoot at this hip West Village eatery. Apparently the fact that the restaurant is located in the "Friends" building must explain the outgoing and attentive wait staff. Space is limited and even with reservations you may have to wait. Don't let this worry you as you can pass time sitting outside with a glass of wine and get your picture taken by the tourists who come to see where Ross, Monica, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and Rachel called home. The specialty of the house are pork chops and they really are the best I have ever had
