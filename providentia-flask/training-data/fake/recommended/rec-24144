My rating is based on a Monday night where I didn't get off work until 8PM and dined alone. The $1 oyster was great if you know what you're getting (I didn't) I let the bartender pick for me. I had 6 to start and 4 out of 6 was great. Calamari was great. Perfect to my liking not to soft. Drinks (Samson st lemonade) Â was ok (I'm not a light weight) so go for the Monday fresh oysters and house wine. And oh yea... Where the f was the AC. The bartender was sweating bullets and after a drink you will too AND the ladies bathroom located in the basement (not handicap friendly) is a MESS
