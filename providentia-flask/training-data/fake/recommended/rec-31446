$7 bacon, egg and cheese sandwich, she offered "on a roll?" I said "great." 10 min later it came out on focaccia. Okay, fine no big deal.  I was expecting a fried egg or 2, but got scrambled w/ some partially melted cheddar. No prob, I can handle that.  But the 5 strips of nearly raw bacon was a step too far.  I politely called the server over and asked if they could please make the bacon crispy, apologizing for being a pain in the ass. Waited another 5 min thinking "wow," them strips are gonna be nice and crispy and when she returned with the sandwich she said "we didn't want to burn it."  But when I opened the sandwich all 5 strips had not even been touched.  Still floppy, pink and nearly raw.  I pulled the raw bacon off, ate 1/2 of the now cold sandwich and left the rest. I put my plate on the counter on the way out and I told her that there was no place on the planet that this would be considered crispy.   If a place can't get bacon crispy, what can they do?
