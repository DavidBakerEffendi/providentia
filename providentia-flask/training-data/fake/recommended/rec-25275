What a low-key gem of a place! It was a friend's birthday, and his friend had been here for another friend's birthday...anyway, it was so nice that everyone wanted to come back. We went for a dinner, and the place was barely visible from Avenue B. The menu of traditional "comfort food" like burgers, mac & cheese, pork chops, etc. wouldn't excite someone who wants something exotic, but the execution is wonderful, and the service just so pleasant and nice that you actually want to give them a nice tip. Â  The menu changes seasonally. Going in late fall, we had a kale salad and one with arugula and roasted pears. I think we changed one friend's mind about kale; he said he didn't like it before, but he gobbled down that salad. The pork chop was huge, the burgers nice with bacon and cheddar, and we also liked the fancy drinks on the drink menu. By this time, it was only about 7 PM and we were the ONLY customers. We had to try the brownie with candied bacon (sweet + salty = delicous), and on the plate they wrote "Happy Birthday" in delicious semisweet chocolate. The coffee was good too, and everyone left happy. This place is wonderful. Please go, and support them (and no, I don't know the owner).
