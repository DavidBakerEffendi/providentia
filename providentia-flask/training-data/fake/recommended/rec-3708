This place is cute, quaint, and has pretty good service. The front looks like a garden and the interior reminds me of a gallery in Chelsea. The food: my date ordered the peach pancakes which were phenomenal!! I ordered the "smoked" yellowfin tuna with poached eggs which was like crazy on a plate. None of the flavors were cohesive from the tartar sauce to the Fried tuna, to the "corn bread" and corn salad it was just a lot. It was a great attempt and was good enough to eat but just not what I was expecting, not was it something I'd order again. All in all if you want a place with slammin pancakes and no alcoholic drink specials this is your restaurant.
