The decor of this place is awesome - Louis XIV meets Buddha. Makes a great place to have dinner with a group of friends. The food is only ok. Price wise and portion wise you're good. The flavor of the dishes not to much. If you want spicy should probably go elsewhere. Everything I tasted seemed to have more sweetness than I would normally expect. There was hardly any other elements to balance it. For instance, the duck in green curry, which I would expect to be not sweet at all, was so cloying sweet I couldn't even finish eating it.
