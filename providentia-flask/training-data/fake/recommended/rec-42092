One of my favorite spots in the area. It's a nice spacious location with a laid back vibe. The staff is pretty friendly and efficient. It's nice that they're open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The bar is great for unwinding in the evening and meeting locals. Peter's an awesome bartender on Tues, Fri & Sat, It's a spot that combines the  diversity of the neighborhood, bringing together long time neighborhood residents with relative newcomers. I always meet very interesting people when I hang out here. Personally,  I recommend any of the sandwiches for lunch and the kale salad is great!
