I was hung over and needed to remedy the disgusting feeling in my stomach and head with a greasy meal. Ants Pants delivered with a egg/bacon/cheese croissant and at least one of not two potatoes' worth of shoestring fries. For $12 (including coffee and tip) I felt like a new woman. My friend ordered their house-made apple juice and that, my friends, was fantastico. I'd drink that on the daily if I had it available to me. Cash only and very, very small seating area. I'm sure that it'd be a hopeless wait on the weekend. But when you weekday drink on vacation like me, no problem!
