State Garden II is a perfectly acceptable option for cheap, low-end Chinese takeout. They offer all of the typical dishes, and are reasonably priced. The restaurant is very small like most Chinese takeouts, but it appears to be very clean. The food tastes exactly as it should, and it satisfies my cravings for this type of fare.
