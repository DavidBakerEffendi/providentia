I don't know what everyone is raving about. This place is dirty, the service is abysmal, and the food is so-so. I ordered the chicken cheese steak with soy cheese because I keeping hearing about how good it is. Maybe those other people have never had good food before, or they have lower standards. The bread was gummy, and they put mayo on my sandwich even though I told them not to. It took 35 minutes for them to make our order. We ordered 2 sandwiched and a small fry. The fries came out 10 minutes after the sandwiches. The staff was unapologetic about the wait, and not friendly. The cleanliness of the restaurant left a lot to be desired. Uncleared tables, dingy walls and ceilings, and broken windows to name a few things. If I could nominate an establishment for a Restaurant Impossible makeover, this would be it. The staff, service, food, and decor all need rescuing now. I certainly will not be going back here.
