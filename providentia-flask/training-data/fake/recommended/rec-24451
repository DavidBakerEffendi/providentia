Great food, atmosphere and service!  Tapas and wine selection was very good.  Serving staff did a nice job advising on menu and pacing plates.  We wanted to linger and chat and the staff was great with pacing and did not try and rush us which can happen in some of the nicer NY resturants focused on turining over your table.  The resturant is quite busy so be sure to make a reservation.  Also, they wait until your full party arrives to seat you and the bar area is tiny - keep this in mind when planning.
