What can I say, I love the squres here. Half a tray, whole tray just love it. The ices and spumoni are great as well. I have not had any entrees in a long time but when I did they were very good. Last time I had fried calamari it was perfect. It was tender and delicious. The sandwiches I had were great as well, but again I havent had anything but pizza and ices in a while. So to be fair I will return for entrees and update this review.
