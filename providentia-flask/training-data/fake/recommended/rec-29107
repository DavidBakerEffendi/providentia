I don't know if it's because I'm spoiled with pretty great food in the D.C. area, because I had the roast beef and not the pork, or what it is that I missed, but i'm sorry to say that I didn't have the glorious experience that I read about Tommy D's so many times on yelp before I got there. To me the meat had very little flavor and the roll was just average at best.  I feel awful typing it out, but it is what it is.  Standing in line for 30 minutes for average just made it feel that much worse. Don't get me wrong, it still beats your chain sub joints, but not enough to stand in that lunch line.
