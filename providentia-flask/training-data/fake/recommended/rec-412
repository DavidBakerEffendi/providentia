We tried to go for dinner and the show, but the early seating (8:00PM) was full.  Instead we went for the 10:00 PM Flamenco show on Saturday.  Having just come from a very big dinner, we did not order a meal.  However, we soon regretted being so full as the entrees around us (and the reaction of the other patrons to the food) looked great.   The show was fantastic and the music and dancing were both terrific.  I wish the sound system was a bit better.  We were literally in front of the musicians and sometimes it was hard to hear the vocals and acoustic guitars.  That said, it was a great show; very passionate dancing and music. The service was polite and efficient.  We literally ordered a club soda and coffee, but the waiter was all smiles and attentive.  The check was about $6.00, with no cover, so we tipped $20.00 on top of it because we had taken a table for the whole show. We will definitely be back to eat dinner
