I moved to Howe St this year (sorry to leave you, East Rock). Rudy's is on the corner, which is fine. There's no point talking about the old Rudy's because this is not that in the least. Brunch is very good here. Maybe too big, but very good. The beer selection is good and the staff can surprise one by being competent quite often. The bar tenders, however, are socially inept, truly useless staff members. I even called once, just to find out when trivia started, and the bartender said "check the facebook page, I just pour the drinks." and hung up. Thanks for asking someone for me, jackass. It was 3pm, he wasn't exactly swamped. The good thing is, it's a relief from Sullivan's without being as expensive as the Study, which are the other two options within two blocks. The food is pretty good, but I don't know if it's my bad luck or what, but they're always out of the best-sounding dipping sauces. Go for brunch, go for late night drinks. But don't go for atmosphere, Rudy's left it all on Elm St during the move ... whoops!
