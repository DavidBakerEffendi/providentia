White bean & beer soup = epic.  Mac-n-cheese was slightly disappointing for best in NYC.  Egg and cheese sandwich was pretty tasty, but about a 1/4 of an egg sandwich at double the price.  Cold brewed coffee was also on the pricey side, but pretty damn tasty.  On a separate visit had the white bean & beer soup which was probably the best soup i've had in a year. In the end, the food isn't quite big enough for the meal without becoming too expensive.  The music selection is great, and leans a little more towards punk than anything. Worth a visit.
