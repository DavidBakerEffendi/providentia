We ordered the branzino, mixed grill, lamb shank, calamari, and baklava for dessert. I would order the same items next time, except for the branzino. However, my kids loved the branzino, but I felt that it was just another fish even if well-seasoned. I've had one too many baklavas having hundreds of middle eastern clients, but their baklava was just a pleasant delight. You'd want to have a private party at this place and not worry about the quality of food and ambience.
