A colleague and I just ordered take-out for lunch.  I had the house salad, no onions, with chicken and the citrus vinaigrette dressing.  It was pretty good.  All ingredients were clean & fresh, the chicken was seasoned nicely & was freshly grilled, and the dressing was VERY good.  The only thing that was a bit funny tasting were the croutons. I would order from them again, though.
