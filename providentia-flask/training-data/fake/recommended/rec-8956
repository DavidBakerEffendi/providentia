The "entree" food here isn't too good, considering how expensive it is, and the fact that this place is a tea house. The desserts, however, are much better. The chocolate souffle with raspberry sauce was amazing. The souffle was incredibly rich and chocolatey. It might just be me, but chocolate flavored things usually don't taste chocolatey, or it takes a minute for the chocolate flavor to arrive. But not this souffle--it was SO instantaneously and incredibly chocolatey, like, L.A. Burdick's Hot Chocolate chocolatey. (For those who don't know, that's pretty fucking chocolatey.) And with the raspberry sauce to play off the chocolate, it was the perfect compliment of light and tangy to rich and indulgent. The jasmine ice cream is probably the best thing here, though. I've come back just for this ice cream. It tastes exactly how you think it should and would taste. The jasmine flavor is strong, sweet, and aromatic. I was so good. I ordered it twice in one sitting. (Note: 1 order of ice cream comes with 2 scoops. You can get 2 different flavors this way, but honestly, just get 2 scoops of jasmine. Also, don't judge me.) It sucks that this place is cash only, considering how pricey it is for such small portions.
