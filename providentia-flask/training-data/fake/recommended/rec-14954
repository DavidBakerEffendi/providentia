Walking through Penn's Landing/Olde Town you can tell by its look that Khyber Pass is the quintessential gastropub Philly experience you're looking for. Vast selection of delicious craft beers aside, the service is phenomenal and the staff is very friendly. They are actually pretty lively too, if you're up for having a hungover Sunday brunch convo. If I lived in Philly, I'd likely frequent this spot, although it is kind of pricey. I ordered the roast beef po boy with a big ass biscuit on the side. Both were stellar. By the time I was finished, I was belly full and hangover cured. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants more out of their sports bar outing and is willing to pay a couple bucks extra to get it.
