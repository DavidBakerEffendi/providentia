Wow... looks like they're in a bad neighborhood... I had the Minca Ramen (shoyu broth) and gyoza. The gyoza was OK. Had much better. I had the Minca ramen with the chijiri-men (wavy noodles). The noodles were good, but I did not like the broth. Didn't taste much of shoyu, but rather had a really burnt taste to it. The chashu was very tender but also very bland. Will skip this place next time.
