This restaurant has a great beer selection and the food is better than the standard pub fare.  Place is VERY clean and the servers are friendly.  They do a brisk business especially lunch and happy hour, if you walk in and the place is crowded, expect your food to take a while. All in all, I would recommend going here if you like Irish themed food, and good beers!
