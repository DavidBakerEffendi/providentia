Solid brunch on a Sunday with my girlfriends. Waiter had great recommendations, was very attentive and service was great even on a busy Sunday morning. Everything was delish- Duck Confit and Ricotta and Lemon Curd pancakes were amazing. Not to mention the mini- biscuits they provide complimentary while you peruse the menu. Definitely one of the best brunches I've had in a while - will be back.
