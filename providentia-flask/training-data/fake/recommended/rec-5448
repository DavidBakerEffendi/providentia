I had a business lunch here and it was wonderful. The blueberry muffins as a complimentary starter were so delicious and sweet! The crab bisque was very crabby, but I would have liked chunks instead of stringy crab. I got the crab cakes as my entree and they were great. The green beans were also tasty, but the whipped potatoes lacked flavor. Overall a nice and cute spot!
