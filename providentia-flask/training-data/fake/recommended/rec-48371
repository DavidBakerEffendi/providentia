I'm updating my rating because I've been there a few times now since being ignored and the service is back to normal- if maybe a little slow. Most of the times I've been here the service has been good and I've enjoyed the food. The bread dumpling and mushroom fricassee is really tasty and the spaetzle too, though a bit oniony. The desserts are also very good. No complaints from me on the food. I had one friend order the Salmon and comment that it wasn't so great, but that's the only food complaint I've ever heard from a friend I've brought here. I'll be back- though I should probably lay off the bread dumplings unless I wasn't to get really fat.
