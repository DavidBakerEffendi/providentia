Outstanding dinner at Dover! We really loved everything, from the cocktails, to the bread, to the main course. Just like at Battersby we were completely blown away by the vegetables!!! They are just amazing. And a huge treat is the dessert cocktail - we have been twice and got a different dessert cocktail each time and it would a highlight! Who needs the sweets when you can have a dessert cocktail?! Really love the lamb tartar! We can't wait to go back!
