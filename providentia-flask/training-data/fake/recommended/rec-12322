There was no line when we went. we had to check to make sure these were The Halal guys and not some fakes. The guys kept telling us to come over and reassuring us they were the real ones. lol... Ordered the combo to go. They packed it full while making coversation. The white sauce taste so good. The meat delicious and the pita chewy. For $6 you cant complain but honestly nothing special from any other halal cart!
