Quality food, adequate service (could be more attentive, but it wasn't awful by any means), adequate prices. Family of 5 including a 4-year old on a non-reservation on Friday evening. Seated immediately, got a bread plate, and a plastic water cup with a lid on it for the child without even asking (smart move, Miriam's). There were three other small kids at the place, so clearly it's a family friendly place, despite having a bar. We split a bunch of small (really small) sample plates of za'atar, beets, cauliflower and eggplant, calamari, shrimp and zucchini. All of them were good - I would say the shrimp was the best. Entrees ordered were couscous w/grilled bronzino, Levantine bronzino and chicken shawarma. Again, all were very good.
