Not worth it. Sliced bread with cold butter to start, with overcooked pasta, way too much sauce. I could see why some people say it's how their Nana cooked, because it tastes like someone who is not a chef prepared it. Plus they seem to think having massive portions makes up for little taste, yup, just like Nana. My french fries were clearly frozen fries and greasy. The coleslaw I had tasted like it came from a supermarket. My boyfriend was similarly unimpressed with his lasagna, the item they are supposedly known for. Yes it's cheap, but you get what you pay for.
