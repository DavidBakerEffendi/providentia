I came in from out of town for work. I think travel all over the world and have eaten at the most luxurious restaurants as well as a the best local dives. I'm a big believer that cost doesn't equate good or even quality food. Chef has put together a very eclectic menu from all kinds of culinary walks. I was recommended by Jessica, an excellent waitress there, the Brisket Tots as an app, phenomenal way to eat one of my favorites BBQ foods. I also had a half oyster spaghetti, three kinds of oysters here and it was awesome. I also had the suckling pig, excellent. I finished off with the banana parfait and a decaf espresso. The only complaint I have is that I couldn't have tried more items on the menu due to how stuffed I was. I'd recommend this to anyone and will be coming back again when work brings me to NYC again. Thanks for a great meal, Chef.
