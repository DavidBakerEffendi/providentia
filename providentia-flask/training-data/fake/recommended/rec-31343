I wasn't impressed with their menu, found this place because of Yelp but seemed the ratings this place received was a little off. I tried the lamb burger which was okay, nothing to rave about, a little odd, seats were not that comfortable, and too close to each other. A little hip place probably good for a drink or two, but not for dinner choice.
