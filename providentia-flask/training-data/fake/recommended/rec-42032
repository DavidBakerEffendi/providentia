I have more than one year been a regular a Puerto Viejo. I would say it is the BEST DOMINICAN FOOD in the whole New York Area. Everything is good, from empanadas, tostones, pernil, mofongo, etc ... and the Cuban Sandwich should win "The Best in NY" award. Monique, Cinthia and all the guys, will make you feel like you are home. The Brunch? Go and get the "Tres Golpes"... if you are Dominican, you know what I'm talking about. Puerto Viejo takes me home when I'm craving my grandmother's food.
