My experience at McCrossen's was rather disappointing.  I dined with a friend before attending a preview at the Phila. Museum of Art.  Lunch was Bouilliabaise   $22.00 for a bowl of mostly emply shells and a broth that was seasoned with liquid smoke.  Come on guys,  $22 bucks for this.  The sweet potato fries were smothered with salt; couldn't taste the potato.   Our server who was a young Asian/American woman shouted at us as though we were both hearing impaired.   The place has a very warm ambience but the service and food were substandard.   We will not return.
