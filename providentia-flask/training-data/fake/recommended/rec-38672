Hadn't been here in years! Went after work with great friends for appetizers and drinks. Absolutely perfect. Amazing and attentive waitperson. Sat on the patio and watched a great band and was very comfortable... Great night. The calamari was excellent. All the drinks of the menu were delicious and not over priced. We weren't rushed or crowded. The interior is beautiful and airy. I can not wait to go back!!
