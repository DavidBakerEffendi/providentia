Nook...its okay. the mushroom cigars are pretty tasty. The rosemary fries are rather normal french fries with a bit of rosemary oil- so thye arent exactly gourment, though they are good. Our burgers were very hot and juicy. My fiance didn't like how soggy everything got due to excessive burger juice, but i like it that way. It is BYO - which is nifty. However, the price listed on their online menu do not correspond with the menu they hand you in the restaurant, and then they charged us 14 per burger instead of the 13 per that the menu we had just looked at stated. After all that wine, I didnt care. But I am more laid back about that kind of thing than most people, and I do believe it was done intentionally. Over all, not a bad place for a BYO spot. But in ultra-competitive NYC I will find something better next time.
