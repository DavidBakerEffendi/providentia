I recently dined in the Tavern section of the establishment and was thoroughly satisfied with every aspect of the the meal. The service was excellent; attentive and accommodating. The ambiance was lovely; vibrant and elegant yet casual. The food was dynamic; creative and delicious and well-executed. For a more casual meal yet still featuring outstanding cuisine, service and atmosphere, Gramercy Tavern ranks as one of the best in the NYC Metro area.
