While only a small review I did want to give this place and the owner some praise. I live and work in the area and have been walking by this place trying to open for a few weeks. I went in one day and the owner was extremely nice. They were making some test food in the kitchen and he let me try a nice large piece of a Chicken salad sandwich. It has an excellent "pesto" style sauce on it which was a great alternative to a heavy mayo base, lots of fresh herbs and the chicken was juicy and delicious. but the baguette they us; this bread on was FANtastic. Soft, moist, held the food well. Cant wait to go and try the whole menu, really looking forward to trying it all. UPDATE: now have orders 3-4 times and gone for lunch. This is a must try for anyone in the area. The chicken sandwich with the potatoes is fantastic. The whole chicken is great and the sides are very good (Cauliflower and Spinach). The only thing I didn't love was the rice, a little bland and needed seasoning.
