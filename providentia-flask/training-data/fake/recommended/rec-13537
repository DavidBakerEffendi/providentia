4.5!! Much of St. Marks opens after 12 or 12:30pm. I think that as a student at NYU, a great place for brunch before class, avoiding crowds and having a place to sit and catch up with someone, this place is the spot. Not too far that you'll be running late, but far away enough to take a little adventure. I really enjoy their cappuchino that comes with their breakfast deal. Â also comes with 2 eggs, homefries, rye toast, orange juice. A meal under $10 is too delicious not to take up.
