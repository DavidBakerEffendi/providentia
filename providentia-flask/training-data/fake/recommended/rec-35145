I'm not sure what happened to those that weren't happy but this place is simply OUTSTANDING. Very warm, well designed place and friendly staff (seems to be common with other reviews), and any previous negative comments about the food is perplexing as the food was DELICIOUS!  The staff even welcomed our requests to make our sandwiches with special changes.  Service was timely as well, so again, not sure of previous experiences but ours was simply exceptional. I guess staff can vary but it's hard to believe with the obvious pride that the owner places in this wonderful restaurant and the over-the-top warmth we found from the staff we met during our visit. Great to find healthy organic food along our travel route!  Give it a shot - good bet you'll be very happy you did!
