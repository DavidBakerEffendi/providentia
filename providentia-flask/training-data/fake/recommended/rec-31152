One of the best Chinese food places in the area.  Reasonably priced and huge portions.  Driven past the shop a few times on my way home and it looks like a small quaint shop - maybe room for 5-7 people to sit and eat.  I would suggest take out or delivery from them. One of their positive assets is the ability to order from them online.  It makes ordering THAT much easier for us whenever the mood strikes.  We usually get our food within 15-20 minutes of ordering online, so despite thinking that it may delay the delivery process, it's the same as calling.  But there's no way for them to screw up your order (cause everything is faxed to them in writing). A household favorite is the Pineapple Chicken.  If you don't like sweet, it's not for you.  I love the cooked pineapple chunks and the tender chicken, but find that the sauce tends to be a little on the sweeter side that I get a toothache - LITERALLY!  But you shouldn't miss out on the chicken just because of that!  You can always eat it over white rice and it tones down the sweet.   Two thumbs up for always delivering prompt service with a smile!
