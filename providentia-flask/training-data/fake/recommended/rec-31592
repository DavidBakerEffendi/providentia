A local classic and absolute staple in the Clifton/Montclair area!  Best "square" slice around - prepared with the sauce on top and cheese underneath.  The first thing you taste is the tangy sauce - crust is great as well.  Why not 5 stars? Depending on who is making the pizza quality can sometimes be inconsistent.
