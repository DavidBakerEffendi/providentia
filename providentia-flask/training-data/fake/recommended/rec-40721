It was my wife, 7 month old daughter and myself.  The hostess was great, she sat us in a corner so we had room for our stroller.  She was extremely nice.  Our server was great, she was explaining about all the foods and was even giving us some advice on where to go around the city. We ordered the deviled eggs and they were outstanding, probably the best I've had (sorry Aunt Kathy).   My wife got the salad which was huge, she barely put a dent in it by the time I was done eating my lunch.  I of course had to try the grilled cheese and tomato soup after hearing all about it here on yelp.  Must say that I was very impressed.  I consider myself an expert on grilled cheese and have to say it was outstanding, not sure what kind of bread they used but that was what helped the awesomeness of the grilled cheese.  The tomato soup was great as well, not outstanding but great.  Maybe I was wowed by the grilled cheese and couldn't think straight.  But the tomato soup is worth it.   Jones did get extremely crowded and very very noisy.  Don't care about how crowded it was but the noise was just something I've never heard in a diner/restaurant, that's why I gave only 4 stars and not 5.   Overall I will come back.  The people and food was outstanding and will recommend to everyone.
