Pretty good man! I usually don't like Crepes. (They're too small and lack what I look for in a meal) But I'll take these tasty delights any day! Small and cozy, looks like one lady owns and operates it. But you can tell she really cares about all her stuff. Had the nutella joints and the ham and cheese. Both extremely delicious and plentiful despite it being a Crepe.
