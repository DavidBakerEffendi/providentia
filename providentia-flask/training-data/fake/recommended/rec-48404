I went to Las Ramblas the other night with a friend of mine for dinner. Its super tiny - mostly 2 tops, think I saw 1 4 top. Don't come here with a group. We went on Monday night around 7PM and got sat immediately, so no complaints here. If you don't like being touched though, don't come - the waiters were leaning on our table and up against our backs the whole time b/c they have such little space to work in. The sangria here is amazing. So good that I tried to replicate it at home without success. I recommend the sparkling strawberry. Their tapas menu is great too. We got the calamari, which was a little bland. We also got the manchego stuffed peppers which were ok, and the shrimp in garlic and wine sauce which was INCREDIBLE. I think we might have just ordered wrong. A lot of people were going with the specials and they looked delicious. I was full from just 3 plates that we shared, you definitely don't need to overdo it here.
