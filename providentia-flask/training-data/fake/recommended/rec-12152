From the outside, this place looks like a dilapidated house which made me instantly judge is as low-quality. Then I go inside and while they don't have Guinness on tap (odd, for an Irish pub with Guinness posters all over the place and Guinness glasses for beers that aren't Guinness) - they do have Bass on tap. Instant point there! If you have three beers on tap and one of them is Bass, you win. Their menu set some pretty lofty expectations - claiming Montville's best burger. While it is the only burger I've had in Montville (and I dare say, the only burger I'll ever have in Montville) - this burger compared to some of the better burgers that I've paid twice the price for. They did a heck of a job with it and present you with a choice of five different types of french fries with your burger. I got mine with fried onions too - the only way to go! For less than $15 for a Bass Ale, sweet potato fries, and an awesome burger - this place was definitely worth going to!
