Well for a Starr restaurant, I've seen better.  I would give it an A+ for decor though.  The decor was almost identical to a restaurant that I went to IN France!  Even though he really emulated the french decor, I was not at all impressed with the food.  It was completely uninteresting.  Good, but not anything I couldn't have got somewhere else.
