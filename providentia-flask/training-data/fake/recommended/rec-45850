Ohhh how I miss you Red Onion cafe. I live in southern california now and I have to recreate the that beautiful sandwich that you are known for. If you are in B-town and are looking for a great sandwich on church st head on over. Yes, it is a little pricey but the ingredients are fresh and that dam sandwich is one of a kind. Whenever I am in town I make a mission to stop by this place.
