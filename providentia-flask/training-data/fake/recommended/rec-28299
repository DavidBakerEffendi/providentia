I live fairly close to this place but it took me a while to go in. I was a little nervous since it's seems like one of those adorable but run-of-the-mill or pricey places. IT IS NOT one of those places. Il Bambino has delicious paninis and crostinis. I suggest the feta, olive spread and sweet onion crostini and the goat cheese and fig spread crostini above all. Any panini there is awesome but I particularly like any of the prosciutto paninis of the fontina panini. Please go to Il Bambino...but not so many people that this small but comfortable restaurant is crowded. And get a latte, they're great!
