Being Polish and familar with Polish food, I found the food at Lomzynianka as authentic as possible, and by that I mean delicious. I'm from Philly (love the byo, corner deli for beer at the subway stop) but was in Brooklyn and wanted to try it.  Not only did my fiancé and I come out only spending $24 but we also had leftovers. We had the borscht soup with dumplings, order of Ruskie pierogies and both had the gwumpkie (English phonetics). If you love polish food, good food, cheap food or byos, I highly recommend this place. I know I'll be returning.
