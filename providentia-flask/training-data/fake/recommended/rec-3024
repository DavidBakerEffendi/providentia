John's Place has some of the best pizza in the neighborhood. Its not super greasy and they seem to use fresh ingredients. Their salads are also very good and huge. The main reason I choose to go to John's Place instead of the other neighborhood places is because the mother and daughters who run the front of the place are so very nice. I always leave thinking about how great they are and how they are always in a good mood. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the other food I've had there has been just okay, but if you are going for pizza, consider this a five star recommendation.
