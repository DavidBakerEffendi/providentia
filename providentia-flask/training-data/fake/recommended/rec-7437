I went here with my brother and a friend on a whim because we were at Top Hops around the corner and wanted a place to bring out newly filled growlers of beer. Not only is this place BYO (a rarity in this city), but their happy hour is amazing. We arrived around 6 on a Friday and place was pretty quiet. We ordered a bunch of rolls from their happy hour specials and a plate of sashimi with rice (only $19 for 18 pieces!!) and the bill was only $56. It was more than enough for me and two guys. The food was fresh and the service was great. We will be back!
