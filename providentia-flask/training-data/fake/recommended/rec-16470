One of the few 5 star reviews I have given... and this place deserves it!  Soup Spot is so simple, it delivers exactly what it should, no more no less. You walk in, order the soup you want, and that's it.  The line moves quickly, the soups are amazing, and the sandwiches are surprisingly great!  The minimal (two maybe three guys) staff is always super friendly and very quick. Their selection is great.  Having only been a few times, I feel I have never seen them offering less than 10 different soups and several (pre-made) sandwiches. I always get the soup and half sandwich combo which also comes with fruit - a nice touch. Of course there are a few small downfalls, just too minor to detract from the 5 stars.  The line can get a little long, but it will go quick, and sometimes you may get someone in front of you who has no idea what they want and they throw off the flow. If you want a quick, simple, inexpensive yet very delicious lunch, The Soup Spot is the ideal place to head to.
