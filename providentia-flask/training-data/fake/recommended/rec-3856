Perfect place to go for a little knitting session and cup of hot chocolate. The Italian owner is such a smiley, friendly character who designs and writes the wine menus on the back of an air mail envelope. It's the small touches like this that make me fall in love with cafes and restaurants and this place is no exception. It has a huge space with book shelves covering one wall and a grand piano in the corner of the room. We ordered hot chocolates and toast with cheese and anchovies. It's such a cute place, I could have stayed all day.
