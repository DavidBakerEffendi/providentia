Came here yesterday afternoon for brunch and was throughly impressed by everything (the food AND the prices AND the service).  The hostess was incredibly personable.  The food was delicious and interesting.  The prices were completely reasonable.  And, I actually experienced a bunch of firsts.. all of which I would like to share with you all right now. - First time I've ever eaten rabbit.  And WOW.. where has this been all my life?!  I now dream of that tender juicy.. - First time I've ever eaten food that was grown on the roof of the building where I am eating (err.. round about way of saying: they grow their own produce!!! how awesome!!) - First time I've ever eaten home made orange cake with chocolate baked into it.  I'm usually not a fan of orange chocolate, but this was scrumptious.  AND it was complimentary.   - First time I realized that Tibet has tropical areas.  Apparently, they're on the same latitude as central/south america; it's only cold because of the altitude in some places.   - First time learning about bone graft... Excellent firsts all around, will definitely be back to experience seconds!
