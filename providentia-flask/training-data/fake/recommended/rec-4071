I had a really nice meal and a really nice time here for their lunch pre-fixe a few years back. Remember the food being excellent (but can't for the life of me remember what I ate). I do remember, that I adored the foyer full of citris. Mmm... Will have to go back to see if I remember correctly, and if this should really be a 5. Wasn't this useful?
