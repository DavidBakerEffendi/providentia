I absolutely LOVE this place. My husband and I went on a rainy Sunday so it was pretty empty, we sat at the bar and the bartender was  friendly and attentive without hovering constantly, given that we were her only customers.  I got the pea soup which was presented to me by pouring the liquid portion over the dry making for a  beautiful display.  It was also insanely delicious.  My  husband got the meatballs which were so moist and perfectly seasoned.  We then shared the spicy ham pizza which was served on a empty number 10 can fitting the quaint, shabby chic decor.  The crust was amazing, coal fired for crispy outside while still being chewy, just the way we like it.  The cheese and ham made for perfect toppings, the jalapeños were a bit much for me but my husband loved them.  I can't believe we waited so long to try this place, it will definitely be a regular of our now.
