I'm ashamed to admit it has taken me three years to try Sally's, the opportunity just never came up! So when a friend suggested we meet there for dinner on a Saturday night I jumped on the offer. We got there around 4:55 and there was a line, the place opened up and some folks got in, not us though. We stood in line and chatted with each other and some new friends we met while waiting, when someone called out there was an open table for two. We were the first party of two in line so in we went (this was about 5:20). We were seated at a small booth right in front of the cash register. Our waiter, Lorenzo, came by almost right away and took our drink orders (2 white birch's). As soon as he dropped off the drinks we ordered; a medium fresh tomato, garlic, and mozz (white); a large sausage, hot peppers, and mozz (red); and a small of the special eggplant (to-go). They arrived about 45 minutes after ordering (around 6:10). To say they were amazing is an understatement. I hate soggy pizza and these were perfectly crisp, even in the center. Lorenzo even came by and chatted with us for a few minutes about the best way to hide our leftovers from our spouse and roommates. When we were ready to leave Rick, one of the owners, boxed and tied our leftovers even going so far as to write our names on the boxes for us. The prices were in line with what I usually pay for takeout at my neighborhood place. Just remember it is Cash Only! Overall, I had a great experience, food and service. I'm going to be there so often they'll know my name before long.
