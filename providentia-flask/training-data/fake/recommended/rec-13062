This place is supposed to be really famous in NY for pizza, so naturally we had to stop by. For a party of 4 we ordered two pies with split halves - for the first pie, we had sausage and mushroom for the first half and pepperoni and pineapple for the second half. For the second pie, we had margherita for the first half and then margherita topped with prosciutto. The pizza themselves were pretty good. The toppings were fresh, and the way the cheese melted into my mouth with every bite with the toppings worked really well in terms of the taste. The crust didn't really work for me, however. I really like a flaky and delicious crust, and this one seemed lackluster in my opinion. It's definitely worth a try, but I wouldn't break my back to come back here again. But that's just me. The final verdict? If you consider yourself a pizza connoisseur, come and give it a shot. Has a great homey feel and environment, and is a great pizza experience.
