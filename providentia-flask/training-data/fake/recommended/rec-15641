First time at Nauna's - and probably my last - not because it was awful - it was just fine with me - but I don't live in Montclair - and there are several better and more convenient options closer to my house - so why travel to Nauna's. I agree with many of the reviewers - it's really about expectations going in.  In my case we were a large group of family from outside of NJ gathering close to Grandma and Grandpa for a family meal.  My expectations - good, solid Italian food.   One of the axioms of simple Italian restaurants - judge the meatballs and the red sauce - and you'll have a good sense of the strength of the kitchen.  I ordered angel hair pasta with puttanesca sauce - with a side of meatballs.  The puttanesca was good - flavorful - and the pasta wasn't al dente - but wasn't mushy either - and it was hot (a pet peeve of mine).  So - - - - the meatballs (2 constitute a side order) were delivered in a small bowl swimming in red sauce.  Both the meatballs and sauce were - meh - not particularly flavorful - no garlic, no parsley no oregano in the meatballs that I could detect.  The red sauce - seemed to be entirely tomatoes - no other veg., nor herbs.  It had me wondering if it came straight out of a can.   Anyway - if it's close to where you live - and you want a quick, hot bowl of pasta - maybe you should stop in.  If you are looking for more - make a different choice.
