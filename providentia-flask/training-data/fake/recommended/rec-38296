My girlfriend and I probably eat here 3 times a month maybe even up to 5 or 6 times. It's our favorite lunch place we share a bowl of pho (#7). The large portion is perfect for sharing between two people, and for around 8.75$ it is a great price. I've eaten bowls of pho is Chinatown in New York, Boston and international district in Atlanta. This by far has been one of the best. The only complaint If could have is if you're coming from downtown Burlington it's sort of a pain if you aren't a local. But other than that it's the Perfect lunch spot in the winter for a warm bowl of soup, and in the summer to eat out side. 100% would recommend.
