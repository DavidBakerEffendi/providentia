Gotta respect it for what it is--a local corporate Â jaunt that has great beer and ping pong. The sausages are to die for--especially during happy hour, when they're three dollars, and the mustard (with horseradish, I presume) rules. But they need to learn how to make sauerkraut. The answer is not carrots. Also, during the weekends, this place is hell on earth with bros. My favorite Stephen Starr spot I've been to yet, even when he takes a crap on sauerkraut.
