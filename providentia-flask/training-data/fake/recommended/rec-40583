My family and I came here for an early dinner around 4pm on a weekday. Terrible customer service and food that isn't even as good as the local Olive Garden. The severs were extremely rude and so aggressive with up-selling to the point that it made our dining experience uncomfortable and unenjoyable. Â  When our party of five didn't order any alcoholic beverages the dirty looks and treatment we received from the severs made us want to run out of the restaurant. As we were waiting for our meals we were offered by one of the servers to try the restaurants homemade meatballs- skeptical that this was just another attempt to up-sell us we verified with the server that we would not be charged. When the bill came at the end of our lackluster meal to our disappointment we saw that we were in fact charged for the two meatballs. The server had lied to our faces in attempt to charge us an extra 12 dollars- it came straight out of the tip. On top of that we were also charged for a undisclosed 3% fee for not paying in cash. Don't worry- that also came straight out of the tip. Needless to say we will not be returning!
