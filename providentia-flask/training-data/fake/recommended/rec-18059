Terrific food, terrific service, great atmosphere. The waitress knew her beers and made good recommendations to everyone at our table. small bar, but smoothly seated our party of 14. I even asked a server how she held multiple glasses in one hand, and she took the time to show me how to do it in the middle of a busy Saturday night. The menu is diverse and eclectic. Boiled peanuts left a little to be desired, but everything else was good. Burger, Cuban sandwich, fries, hush puppies were all great. Someone at my table spoke highly of the beef on weck also. Highly recommend this place.
