saw this joint on The Food Channel and had to give it a try.  Being from Los Angeles, the only hot dog joint we have is Pinks which i feel is over rated and definately not worth the +45 minute wait.  The fried dogs are are very tasty.  add griled onions and cheese on top and you got a meal to die for.
