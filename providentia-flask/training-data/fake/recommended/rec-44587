I just had an incredible dinner here. It was my first time and I'm already planning my next...I ordered the duck and it was cooked perfectly. My friend and I stayed close to an hour after our meal, chatting away, and didn't feel rushed at all. The only neg is that we both had to ask for more water not once, but two times :( But other than that it was a great experience!
