Hands down best pizza and Italian food on the island! This place used to be down the street. The parking is not that great at the new address, but worth it for the food. The regular pizza is thin and crispy and sauce is amazing. I always get an extra cup on the side to dip my crust. If ordering food, definitely try the baked ziti.
