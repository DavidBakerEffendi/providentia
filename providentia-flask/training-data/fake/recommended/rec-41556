I am truly stumped how they could get good reviews anymore.  Their quality has really fallen off.  I went there several times in the past and their food was good.   I went there Saturday night around midnight and everything was horrible and almost un-edible.  Half cooked yakitori followed by a sakoro steak that was more than half fat!  My napkin was huge from all the crap that I spit out in it.  Wouldnt feed it to my dog!  I dont know if they were just trying to get the food out quick because they were busy or what.   We were gonna say something to the waitress but figured the damage was already done.  I'm just never going back anymore.  YUCK!!!
