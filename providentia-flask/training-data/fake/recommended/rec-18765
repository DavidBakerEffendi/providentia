Unfortunately this place has become too big for its boots.  Aside from jacking up their prices a lot, they instituted a nonsensical seating policy.  At 5.45 pm, when the place was deserted, they had pushed 2 narrow tables together at the back of the dining room and declared they were for 3-  or 4-somes only.  On our previous 6 or 7 visits to this place we had sat here as a couple with no problem, but now they were expecting a rush of people I suppose.  So we left and went to Sambuca, just up the street where they were nice and friendly and cheaper too.  On our way back past Riposo  about 90 minutes later they still had not filled their tables, so I really don't know what their problem was about.   Go here if you don't mind unfriendliness, otherwise avoid.
