Went to the Orange Squirrel for dinner this Friday. Had a bit of a mixed experience. While the food was delicious, the service was a little lacking. It was a struggle to get the waiters attention at first. My girlfriend and I started off ordering a cocktail. I received my drink quickly, however, my girlfriend had to wait an additional 5 minutes for hers. There was no reason given and no apology for the unusual wait. In addition to this, the martini she ordered came out in a wine glass which was odd.   After having a cocktail, we attempted to order a half bottle of wine to share over dinner, however, we were told that they were out of both half bottles and full bottles of wine. The food itself was delicious, I had the duck breast entree which I would recommend.  There were a lot of unique items on the menu. Our experience could have been better though. With several good dining options in the area, I am not sure if i would try it again.
