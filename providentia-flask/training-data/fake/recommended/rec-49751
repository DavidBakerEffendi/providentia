Oh my god the soup dumplings. So I'm a big soup dumpling person. Big fan. I finally made my way down the sketchy alley to Joe's. After throwing my name on the wait list, crossing my fingers it really was 15 minutes, my buddy and I were shuffled in to sit with some other slightly baffled diners. Sat down, before drink orders were taken 'Dumplings?!' Ah! Lucky for me, I'm a quick reactor-pork please! A few beers and some spicy chicken were added. Place was noisy, busy and a little crazy. Then the dumplings. I am in love. I would walk from Brooklyn for these dumplings. The restaurant is amazing, because of these dumplings. I came back three days later, with another friend who wanted Sunday Chinese, for these dumplings. Go. Now. It's getting cold in NYC. For $5, 8 soup dumplings?! Win.
