we aren't from Philly, so we naturally went to yelp to find a good place for breakfast. they got us right in and the host was extremely courteous and friendly. after that, the service was very, very, slow. They were very busy, but a "hey, I'll be right with you," goes a long way. one person brought us coffee, another took our order, and another brought our food. We waited over 15 minutes to even get menus, and waited even longer to get our check. We had red velvet pancakes and eggs Benedict. Both were delicious, but honestly, made me feel sick the rest of the day. Not sure if it was just me, or if it was the food. Needless to say, with the sick feeling all day and the slow service, we probably won't be coming back when we visit again.
