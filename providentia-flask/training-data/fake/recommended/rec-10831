Came here on a super-hot night, after being curious since they opened last year (and weary of the bad reviews). They may have had some hiccups then (which is probably why they had so many bad reviews when opening), but they seem to have worked the kinks out since then. We were told the wait would be an hour, but had a drink at the bar and were seated in half that time. If you don't want to wait at the bar, they will text you when your table is ready... for people who aren't familiar with the area, there are a number of piers that can be explored in the area and great views of the harbor and Lady Liberty herself. Out waitress, Cat was very attentive and helpful, the food was delivered in a timely manner and with a smile. We ordered 2 dozen oysters ( the first dozen was so good that we ordered another), and then the Royale for 2, which we couldn't DREAM Of finishing! The crab was succulent and tasty, but there was just so much! we will definitely be returning but I think next time we will just order what we cant a-la carte... this time we just wanted to try a little bit of everything. I gave it 4 instead of 5 because it is a bit pricey, but I guess you are also paying for the real estate (this place is HuGE!!! the lot goes all the way through the block so they either bought two lots or one gigantic one). There are three levels (bar/pool table/mini golf and seating on first floor, patio, indoor seating, and service bar on the second floor, and the top floor is another dining area with a service bar. They probably have two kitchens too in order to keep this place running efficiently. We will be back, that's for sure. Hopefully next time we can get in a round of put-put.
