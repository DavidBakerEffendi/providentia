We had a birthday dinner here for 8 people. The atmosphere and service were very good.  The food was delicious.  Drinks were disappointing. We had a variety of mixed drinks and 2 kinds of Sangria.  None of the drinks were that fabulous. The food on the other hand was fabulous.  We had the mixed appetizer and our favorite was the bacon wrapped figs.  My steak entree was perfect and everyone was quite impressed by their entrees as well. I would definitely return and hope they had a different bartender that time. Overall a good experience.
