I was psyched to check out this restaurant because I heard it was good. But I was disappointed. The wait on a Friday night, nearly 25 minutes was reasonable. The tables are tight and the wait staff kept bumping into our chairs. The appetizer that we ordered: eggplant parm was tasty but lukewarm. We ordered the pizza with veal meatballs. The meatballs were good but the crust was floppy. The Pinot Grigio I ordered was fine for the price. The dessert, chocolate cake was very rich but dry. Unfortunately, there were no hot drinks like coffee or tea to go down with the dessert. I guess you are paying for the vibe there.
