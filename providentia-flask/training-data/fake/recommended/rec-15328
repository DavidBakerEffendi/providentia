PYT: Â Where great ideas go to die. If you're looking for creative food ideas that fall flat at the time of execution, look no further then this hipster haven. I'm not sure if its the meat they're using or just an inability of the chef to pull flavor from their burgers but, what you're getting from them is a glorified vessel for a bunch of toppings. If you end up at PYT, just get an order of the party fries (not the tots, a waste of money for what they give you) and a shake. Don't waste your time on the burgers--go up the street to Sketch where they appear top understand that a burger still has to taste great even with a million differnt things on it. Better yet, just don't end up there.
