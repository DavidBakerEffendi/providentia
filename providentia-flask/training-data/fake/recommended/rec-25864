As a carb-o-holic and pasta fanatic I give this place two thumbs up. I always make a reservation here when I'm visiting NYC. It's always crowded and I always have to wait past my scheduled reservation but the food is fantastic. Eggplant parm is delicious, and the portions are big. I even had some scallops here once that were a special, and I do NOT eat seafood, they were great.
