If you're looking for a cool little spot in Northern Liberties, North Third is a solid choice. The menu items are familiar dishes with creative twists. The chef is experimental while staying within his comfort zone. It's a good place for a interesting bite to eat or to get drunk with some friends while enjoying some gourmet bar food. The place is also an interior decorators dream come true, I think.
