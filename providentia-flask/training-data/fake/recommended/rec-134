I was pleasantly surprised to find a conveyor belt sushi in the heart of Connecticut.  Conveyor belt sushi is a staple in Taiwan, although I heard can be quite pricey in Japan. I went to Umi for the first time with a couple of old co-workers just to check out what it was like. The ambiance overall is quite contemporary.  Space is very limited however.  They do have booth seating but not that many and then you have the individual seating facing the conveyor belt.  It does have a look and feel of a conveyor belt sushi place that I know with a touch of contemporary flair. I do agree with some reviews about the availability of the sushi on the belt.  It is quite limited but it is very typical of American-style sushi places.  At the end of the meal we ended up eating about $25 per person just mainly sushi from the belt, a ramen noodle and a couple of drinks.   The sushi themselves are just regular sushi you find in any typical American-style sushi places, nothing spectacular.  You might be better off ordering from their menu. The ramen noodle my husband ordered was actually pretty good but it was very small in size for the price you pay for. At the end of it I think you pay more for the ambiance and less for the food.  It's a good place to hangout and it is on par with the rest of Blue Back Square.  However, I probably wouldn't go back there again due to the distance, the price and just the overall experience.  Not that spectacular.
