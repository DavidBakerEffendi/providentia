I'm not a breakfast person but I LOVE Cafe Cluny! They have the BEST french toast. I'm not big on french toast because a lot of restaurants make it too soggy and suken in. However, Cafe Cluny makes it with sweet brioche bread that is crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside. It is also served with strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. Their berkshire ham is also divine! Fun fact: The movie, The Switch with Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman had a scene here! Read my food blog review here: stephfoodie.com/2011/07/â€¦
