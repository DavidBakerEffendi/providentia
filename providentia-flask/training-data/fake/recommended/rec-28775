Came here with some friends, had reservations and still had to wait 15 minutes. Which didn't bother us, I understand when you're busy and need to make do. But the hostesses were probably the worst part of the experience. No smiles and it seemed like everyone going up to them were bothering them. A host is the first person you see walking in, should definitely switch up their employees so it feels more welcoming. We only ordered deserts, no actual meals. We got a crepe, smores fondue and a milkshake. We ordered some baileys for the milkshake but it took all the flavor away, definitely do not recommend that. They serve the liquor on the side to add yourself. Everything else was great. We had wine, a little pricey for a glass I thought. Our server was great, had a smile and was very outgoing. very informative with questions we had. So a little pricey for certain things, and the miserable hosts knocked a star off but I will be back!
