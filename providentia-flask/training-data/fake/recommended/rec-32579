I ate here twice in one week, it was so good. The decor is fun and has some interesting art (as the name suggests). The abundance of management keeps the restaurant ticking and they are friendly as are all the staff. The antipasto bar was phenomenal. You can choose a mixed plate of antipasto, the only problem is it's all so good that it's hard to choose. Whatever you do, don't miss the egg plant or the red peppers. Oh and the shrimp and scallops ... wow. The first night I had lobster risotto which was just fabulous. The flavors in the sauce were quite amazing. The second visit we had rabbit osso buco which so impressed my Japanese guests (and me). The wine list is fabulous and they have some very reasonably priced "Super Tuscans". I've been coming here for years but something has transformed this restaurant from very good to just excellent. I sat near the host stand and you could see that many of the clientele were regulars and no wonder. It's reasonably priced, especially for it's location, but who cares it's wonderful.
