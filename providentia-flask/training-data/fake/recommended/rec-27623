The pizza here is very good, but when you start throwing around phrases like "Best Pizza in NYC," Lombardi's is not quite up to par. One of the first things you'll notice is that it doesn't have much in the way of atmosphere.  There are a ton of tourists here and it kinda feels like you are in a T.G.I. Friday's -- very commercialized.    You also get the feeling that about as many Italians work here as a place specializing in takeout Chinese.   The pizza itself is really good, but not markedly better than similar pies at lesser known places.  The thing that really makes the pizza good at Lombardi's is the fresh mozzarella, and you can find cheese just as good (or better) at another pizzeria without having to wait for awhile. Bottom line:  Lombardi's is well known not so much because they have the best pizza, but because they are the first pizzeria in the United States.  So if you're a tourist, go to Lombardi's b/c that's a neat piece of history to take home with you.  If you're a New Yorker, you can do better.
