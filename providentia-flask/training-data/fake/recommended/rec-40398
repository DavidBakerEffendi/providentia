Come hungry and expect to leave greasy and smelling like what you ate. The food here - primarily served from a buffet but with dishes cooked to order - is oily cuban fare served in large portions. I like the ox tail and the pepper steak dish (forget the specific name, but it's made to order). Seating is very cramped but the food is too good not to come back. If you work in midtown and want an alternative to chipotle, meet a friend and give this place a shot.
