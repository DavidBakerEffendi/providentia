I've been eating at/ordering from Ruby's since moving to Soho in April. Over the the past 6 months I've noticed a serious decline in the quality of the food. The roast pumpkin salad - which was my favorite item - should now be called a pumpkin salad since there is no roasting ever. Cold, hard pumpkin really isn't appetizing. Their pastas also have become more gummy, the texture of the Alfredo sauce reminds me of paste. Ruby's used to be my go to for a quick, easy, tasty meal, but I won't go back anytime soon.
