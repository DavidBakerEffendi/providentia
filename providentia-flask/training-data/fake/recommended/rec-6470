what is everyone raving about.  the food is fine, not great.  the place is so tiny you can't even call it cozy or charming you are sitting on top of the table next to you, you should just share your food.  it is on a nasty stretch of urine smelling church street, who could possibly eat outside.  i can't figure out why it is crowded, are ARE these people eating here.  there are some great italian spots in tribeca, this is not one of them
