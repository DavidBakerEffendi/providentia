I had such high expectations of this place. And I was sadly disappointed. Husband got the pork with provolone and broccoli rabe. I got the roast beef with provolone and sweet peppers. It was lackluster and flavorless. No fireworks here. The rolls were not the highest quality (again, IMHO) and seeing they are just on the outskirts of South Philly where they have some of the best bakeries, that seems ashame. It was a disappointment. And we waited longer to get a seat then we did to stand in line. And we were there at lunchtime on a Saturday. So it was an easy hour from the time we got in line till the time we actually sat down to eat. Disappointed.
