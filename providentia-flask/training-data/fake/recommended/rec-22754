Quaint friendly family owned bistro  located in Newark's infamous North Ward.  Not your ordinary chicken and rib take out place. Portuguese food taken to a new level with a handful of signature dishes, fresh made soup and desserts, and a nice hot expresso to "top off" the dining experience.  Everything on menu is competitively priced.
