Came here on a Friday night in which it was busy but the wait wasn't too bad, prob 5-10 minutes. Wanted to try out their 'special' burger so a friend and I shared a truffle burger, duck burger, sweet potato fries and truffle fries. Honestly the texture of the duck burger seems similar to beef, so I wouldn't have known it was duck unless they told me. It had an interesting sweet taste so it wasn't too bad. The truffle burger was good but I didn't find it spectacular. Truffle fries were alright and the highlight of the day goes to the sweet potato fries due to it's distinct taste. I found the portion of the fries to be larger than expected which was good. Overall, would stop by again if in the area.
