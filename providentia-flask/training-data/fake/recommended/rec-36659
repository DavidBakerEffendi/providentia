I came here on a Sunday evening, and as soon as I entered the restaurant I was starting to regret my choice, since apparently half of Manhattan has had the same idea. But I was not gonna get scared off so easily! Despite being rather hungry I decided to give this a try, having read so much good about it. A short 20 minutes later my name was called and I was escorted to a communal table. I ordered the Akamaru Modern, which turned out to be an great choice! A lot of Ramen in a hearty broth, with some cabbage and scallions, and two pieces of chashu pork . I also ordered the Nitamago topping (seasoned salt boiled egg), since my waitress recommended it, which accompanied the dish nicely! Next time I might add an additional topping, though, a little more vegetables couldn't hurt in there! Stir everything up and enjoy... The communal tables are really nice to sit at, but I might be partial since for some reason I have a thing for them... overall I liked the whole layout of the restaurant, and service was really good and pretty fast. Awesome on a cold winter night!
