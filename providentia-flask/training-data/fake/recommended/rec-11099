If your idea of great Asian food is "The General" with a side of white rice you need serious help so please go here.  Everyone else please go here.  Bring cash but not much.  It's almost impossible to spend $10 per person. As others have mentioned the broths as delivered are a bit under seasoned.  I believe it's intentional.  Us Westerners are a finicky bunch and often hard to satisfy.  Take advantage of the condiments on your table and do your own thing. The noodles are simply amazing.  It's the texture that makes them.  They are the perfect firmness.  I could eat them every day. 228 reviews should tell you something.  At these prices you just need to try it.  Don't think about it just go.
