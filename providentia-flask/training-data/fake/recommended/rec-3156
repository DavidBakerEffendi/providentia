I've been to CB many times--mid-afternoon, dinner, late night--and other than one complete miss, when the burgers were watery, it's been pretty amazing. Although I don't think they give you a full pint of beer, it's still pretty cheap. Â This place has always been super crowded b/c it's a bit of a tourist spot, but it's one of the few places that lives up to the hype.
