Painfully slow service in an empty restaurant. Two hours start to finish. Server was friendly, but didn't write down the order and 1/2 the orders came out slightly wrong. Burgers were great, penne not so much. Hummus appetizer was scant on the veggies, but tasty flatbread and hummus itself was very good. Brownie dessert tasted overcooked with tough crusty edges. Competing sounds from tv and music playing and while I love popcorn for the movies, am not so keen on the smell through dinner. Will definitely keep going to the movies there. Dinner? No way.
