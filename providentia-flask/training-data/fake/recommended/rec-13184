The sugar cured bacon saved my day. This place doesn't get the full five stars due to the wait time. My boyfriend and I came in and was told it was going to be an hour and a half wait..no bueno. On another notes the food speaks for itself with the eggcelent juevos rancheros and delicious spiked dranks I have never tried before from spiked Arnold palmers and hot Mexican chocolate. Food is excellent here
