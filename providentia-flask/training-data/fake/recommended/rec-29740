We love this place so much we are regulars 2-3 times a month which is scary considering I take nyc grading so seriously (it's that scary) however the food is delicious and always quick.   The habernearo margarita made by the best bartender (my opinion) Andy are the best thing since sliced bread.  I'm Unsure If There are any Other places in the Bushwick area that make habernearo margaritas, But I'm not looking.  Sometimes I just wish they were open all the time until 4am which depending on the bar or lack of crowd can close anyway we love this place and ALWAYS look forward to coming.  Thank you! !!
