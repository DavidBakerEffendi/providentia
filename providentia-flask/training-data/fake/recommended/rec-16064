love, love, love johnny brenda's. a good time can often be had here, whether you are looking for it or not. a divey, yet not in a grimy way divey place to just meet up and have some drinks, shoot some pool, or see a show. i hear they have great brunches but have not ventured out during daylight here for some reason. also a great place to go if you just don't feel like dealing with the silliness of lines at frankford hall across the street!
