Wow, fantastic pizza, which is saying something in the New Haven area.  Pizza is Brooklyn-style.  Thin and charred crust, fresh mozzarella and a great number of delicious choices. the personal pizzas are a generous amount for e, and by ordering one each, we had a chance for a variety of tastes. We have been there twice in the past week, first time had pesto pizza with veggie toppings and a sausage and Paula's peppers.  Pesto is just not a topping you find up here, and as a transplanted New Yorker it was a real treat.  Paula's was great and spicy hot.  the house Salad was fresh, generous and tasty.  Back again tonight to try different stuff.  Ate at the Bar and Stacy made me one of her amazing specialty drinks.  So good had to have a 2nd!  I tried the clam pizza -- simple with just calms, garlic, oil and spices.  the clams were huge, fresh and sweet, the crisp crust was the prefect vehicle.  my DH had Kalamata olives and Sausage.  He thoroughly enjoyed it.   Service was excellent, friendly and efficient.  This is going to be out "go to" place for pizza.
