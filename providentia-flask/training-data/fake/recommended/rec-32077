There are plenty of landmarks in the city of Philadelphia, but this place should be on the National Registry of Historical Places too. There are few bars that define a culture as well as Chickie's. It's just massive, they have a signature item (the ungodly amazing crab fries), and no place wraps up the passion of the Philadelphia sports fan better. Plus the prices, while not exactly cheap, don't break the bank either. If you can't actually attend, this is without a doubt the best place to watch a Phils, Flyers, Sixers, or Eagles game on the planet. Tons of TV's with great sound, plenty of waitresses, and an atmosphere that won't shun you when you scream at the Birds offensive line for GETTING VICK KILLED BECAUSE THEY PASS PROTECT LIKE A DAMN POP WARNER TEAM!! (emphasis mine). I had a four hour layover at the airport last weekend with a friend who's a born and raised Florida girl. We went to Chickie's (not the lame one in the airport either) and met my cousin for a few drinks. My friend thought it was ok, but nothing special. She's not from Philly, so she didn't get it. She doesn't live and die with her teams the way you're supposed to. She doesn't understand the passion of people that were born here have for sports. And that's fine. Just give your seat at Chickie's to the girl in the Victorino shirt. She'll appreciate it.
