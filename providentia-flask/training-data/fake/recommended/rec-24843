This place was excellent!!! I was just looking for a quick lunch on my last day visiting Philly, and it was the juicy, dripping turkeys being freshly carved that caught my attention. I've always loved a good turkey/stuffing/cranberry sauce sandwich, and this place did not disappoint. About $11 for a HUGE sub I actually got two meals out of, a soda, and a bag of chips. Not bad! The staff was very, very friendly, and they had a large variety of sandwiches and turkey plates with gravy, mac and cheese, etc. If you're sick of cheesesteaks, come here! Yum!!
