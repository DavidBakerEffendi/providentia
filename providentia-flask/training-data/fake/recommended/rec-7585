This used to be called the old Willy's Diner! If you're on a diet this isn't the place to go. All and I mean all their damn food come in gigantic portions and greasy!! Lol even their salad don't even try it. What i love at this place is their excellent service. Chris is the man. I always and only order from their breakfast menu. Starvin' Marvin FTW! You won't regret it specially if you have the munchies! I like to sit by the "bar" area bc it seems like I get my order faster. Also recommend getting mint chip milk shake for desert! My only negative for this place is PARKING. Although they have another parking lot next to the library they don't tell their customers and everybody ends up looking for metered parking which is something you should beware of. Those ticket giving bastards are heartless and will wait 3 minutes until your time is over.
