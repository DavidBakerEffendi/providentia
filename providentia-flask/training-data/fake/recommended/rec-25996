You must wait for a table, but not for the food. This deep, narrow restaurant has this gigantic chandelier encased what would probably be a column standing in the middle of the restaurant.  Dark walls, decent lighting, candles on the small square tables, and average noise level is how I would describe this place.   We order these green dumplings for appetizer and they were just weird looking but tasted alright.  I order a Thai signature, the pad thai, but there were 2 to choose from?  So I get the one the waiter insist is better.   The staff comes around often enough to refill water but they also rush to clear our plates... My pad thai comes and it looks this big puffy white omelet. I start to dig in and find it's filled with thin angel hair noodles and seafood.  I was actually amazed how good it was.  I tried my friends duck dish and it was sweet and tender. Good food.
