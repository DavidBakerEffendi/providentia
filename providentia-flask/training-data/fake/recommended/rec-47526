Okay so telling from my pic you can tell I'm not German. Let's say when my family and I walked in ...it felt like everything stopped and went silent. As if we didn't belong so we decide to eat in the beer garden. The staff was very nice!! The patrons is what made us feel very uncomfortable. The staff was very welcoming. The food is good nothing crazy it's really a meat and literally just potatoes type of restaurant. But I will definitely go again.
