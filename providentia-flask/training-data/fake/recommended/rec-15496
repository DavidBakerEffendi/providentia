Had our table ready. Made reservation via email through their website. No response so I called. Lovely interior and very nice outdoor area to eat. Service is good. Food is good. Wouldn't come back so fast. A/c broken but it's ok. Unfortunately air doesn't flow inside. They were accommodating as far as nut allergies go removing pistachios and sunflower seeds. Fusilli needed flavor. Broccolo and margherita pizzas were flavorful. Chicken was good too. But....almost $200 for Dinner for 4 with 1 bottle of wine and no dessert is a little pricey.
