This is one of my fav NY restaurants - I really love coming here and eating at the bar, great watching the bar staff at work and all the hustle of the restaurant going on behind you. Â That works if there are only two of you, so when we returned with friends we sat at a table, usual great food, nice glass of wine, fun evening, but I did pass a jealous glance or two at those folk sitting at the bar......
