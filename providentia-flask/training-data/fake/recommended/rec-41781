So much to love about this place, but here are some highlights: The nebbiolo on tap would impress even the snobbiest wine snob. Even better, it can be purchased for $7 a glass or $14 for a full carafe. Perfect for an afterwork drink or paired with just about any of the dishes. The house cocktails are amazing, as well. All too often in NYC you pay $10 for a specialty cocktail that just isn't that special...not the case here. Whoever designed the liquor menu here knew exactly what he or she was doing. The range of entrees is also impressive. The menu isn't large, but it's perfectly curated, with dishes for everyone's taste: fish, lamb, pork, chicken, and some great veggie options. There's also a bahn mis sandwich (think of a re-Frenchified bahn mi) that is crazy good, as well as a fried fish sandwich and a chicken sandwich that the people I dined with raved about. Even the side salads that came with our dishes were great, which as we all know isn't always the case. There are also smaller plates that work well as a happy hour snack or alongside your dinner. I HIGHLY recommend the mussels and gravy or the venison fritters. To top it all off, the owners are extremely friendly and clearly want to make this a neighborhood spot for all. The interior is also beautifully done, especially if you're one of the folks who can remember what this place looked like before. Just a good vibe in this restaurant all around. Can't wait to go back.
