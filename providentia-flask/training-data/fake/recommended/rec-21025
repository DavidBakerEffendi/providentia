Amazing new restaurant! We held a company party there in december - was just awesome. Really tasty food, great wine and drinks - and we love the feeling in the space. Beautiful decorations - many of which the owners made themselves. We loved the zinc bar and the hand made doors to the wine cave upstairs. Highly recommend.
