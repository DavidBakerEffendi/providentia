I have been to Costa del Sol twice now and would go more often if i didn't live 40 mins away...but when i want Spanish food this is by far my favorite...from the habas con chorizo app to the house paella and the best red sangria to the great service from Spanish waiters and waitresses who are originally from Spain a few towns over from my parents town in Portugal, you will have a great experience too I'm sure!
