I dont understand all the hype and good reviews for this place. I've been here several times and have been disappointed almost all of them, but my last visit this weekend has forced me to never return and to finally write a review. The Host was a bald rude prick who has no idea what he is doing. The server was pretty rude as well. How come every time i get beer here it is warm and flat? most disgusting beer ive ever had. do yourself a favor and go the the zero gravity brewery across the street at american flatbread. the only good thing about this place is the food is cheap, i didnt say it was the greatest, cause its not, just decently priced for what you get.
