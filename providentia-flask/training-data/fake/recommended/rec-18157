I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Mood Cafe!  I have never been a big fan of lassis, but I had heard that they were particularly good here, so I thought I'd give it a try. I walked in, saw the fresh pineapples on display and decided to get a pineapple lassi. Hassan suggested I try a mint and honey one instead. I said sure.  Not only did he make the mint and honey lassi, but then he made the pineapple lassi as well so I "wouldn't worry that I had missed out."  Needless to say they were both so insanely delicious that I ended up drinking two lassis for dinner that night, a decision I do not regret (although I do feel slightly ashamed- I could not stop drinking them they were so delicious!).  So yes, two lassis for three dollars that night! I left VERY satisfied!
