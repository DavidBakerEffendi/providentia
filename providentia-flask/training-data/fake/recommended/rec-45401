I just read all of the other reviews, did I eat at the same restaurant last night? A. We didn't get offered any chips (stale or not) B. We got sat at the WORST table in the house - where all of the kitchen traffic is, do NOT sit there C. We had two waiters that both asked us 'if we were ready to order, would like something to drink', without realizing that they were both "trying to help" D. A huge plate of something very saucy could have (but luckily didn't) landed on my lap - it went all over the floor instead. E. My chicken was so very bland, I sent it back.  My friend who generally has great things to say about her meal said "eh" to the duck enchiladas. They comp'd my chicken, which was the right thing to do.  The WRONG thing to do was this:  on the way out, it was at THAT point that the owner says, 'I'm sorry about the chicken", my reply, "Thank you, it's ok, but you may want to look at the flavor of the dish'.  He replies, 'It's cumin!!! It was on our menu for 7 years at the other restaurant, it's an organic chicken breast, how could you say that?'.   Well, sir - that restaurant closed.  And for a reason.
