Came here on Tuesday at 6:30; got the scallops, which were great (though the food was really slow to arrive). Everyone raved about their food, and the service was pleasant; not so hyped on the atmosphere. Our heads were bumping into the counter, which was filled with croissants and other breakfast items, and in the bathroom, a list of the exterminator's visits was tacked to the door. Apparently he found roaches on his October rounds :/
