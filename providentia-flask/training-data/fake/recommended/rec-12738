Came here on a Monday morning and my friend and I waited for an hour and half. The blueberry pancake with warm butter maple syrup was good- fluffy and correct consistency. Served warm and in large proportion. On the other hand, the smoked salmon scramble was good but nothing to rave about. The place itself was tiny, tables are awfully close to each other, be careful especially when you are getting up to the restroom. Tips: order take out and picnic in the park which is only three blocks away. If I happen to be on the other side of Manhattan, I would come early enough on a weekday.
