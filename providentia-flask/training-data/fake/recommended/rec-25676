I found this place when I was looking for a nearby place to eat after the beer garden at the spruce street harbor point. Very very happy with finding this place, although I could see that this place would not be for everyone. This place has a unique vibe which includes a decked out mounted dear head. They serve a mixture of different drinks including old school and new school drinks. Hell their menu has a dark and stormy on it. Â Food was really good, I had an ostrich burger, a rare find, that was really good. I also had a taste of their long hots (Italian hot peppers) which were surprisingly really good. I would definitely recommend this place and will definitely be back.
