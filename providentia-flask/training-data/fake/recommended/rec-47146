This place would have gotten 4 stars, but the wait was ridiculous. And I'm not saying that because I'm impatient or anything... I'm saying that because they don't really know how to judge the wait time. They told us it was going to be 25 minutes, but it was double that amount of time! Insane! Granted, I understand that it was a Sunday, the most popular day for brunch, but they could have given a better estimate for wait time. The service was actually pretty good once we actually got to sit down. We didn't have to wait too long for the food, and it was actually extremely good food. Ordered the Breakfast Sandwich and the French Toast. The only bad thing about the breakfast specials (like the sandwich) was that you couldn't substitute anything, which, let's face it, sucks anywhere, but it ESPECIALLY sucks when one of the sides is a salad... for breakfast? Weird! LOL. All in all, the food was great, but I don't know if I'd necessarily wait that long just to eat there.
