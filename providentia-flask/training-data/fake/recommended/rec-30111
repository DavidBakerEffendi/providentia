I probably went to Bubbys at the worst possible time, 11:00 AM on a Sunday. Needless to say, the restaurant was packed which meant a 30 - 45 minute wait for a party of three, even for a good-sized restaurant. However, there were several chairs at the bar, so we were able to wait there until a table opened up. They have a great brunch menu, which appears to favor more breakfast items than lunch. My table ordered the pancakes and french toast, both of which were outstanding. Also, the portions are great as well. I always like restaurants that offer larger portions, which Bubbys certainly does not shy away from. Although I did not have any, my table informed me their brunch drinks (Bloody Marys and Mimosas) were outstanding as well. The atmosphere of the restaurant was great. My only critique of Bubby's was the prices. For pancakes, french toast and a couple of drinks, the menu was on the high end.
