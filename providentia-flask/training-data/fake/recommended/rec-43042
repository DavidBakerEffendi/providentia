Employees Only is a great place to start off your evening or finish it up.  Hell, It's pretty much good for anytime of the night as long as they're not too crowded.  The drinks are expensive, but are well done and strong, so they're worth it.  This only stands out in my mind because my date kept reminding me how much I was costing him...(this I don't recommend).  The appetizers are good and the service is fine.  I wish they would bring back the buffalo wings!!!  Nothing better than to close out your binge drinking fiasco with some sticky sweet magic.
