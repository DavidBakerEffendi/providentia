A new neighborhood treasure. While it is a little hard to find, it's worth it. We were escorted to a table up against the window that looked out towards LIC and the East River. Beautiful! We started with cocktails, and I strongly recommend "The Last Word" if you're a gin person. I began with a mackerel escabeche with a crispy paella cake and a slice of jamon iberico. Need I say more? The paella was crisp and chewy, the acidity of the fish was perfectly balanced with a creamy aioli, and jamon iberico is just amazing. A perfect ode to Spain on a plate. Pork tortelloni with pears and walnuts. Again, just ridiculously good. Rich but restrained---not over the top. Lemon meringue pie was good, not amazing. The ice cream that came with it, crema mostarda, was really really spicy, and even though we were warned, I couldn't finish it. It was too much and felt like I was eating peppers. Overall I'm excited to have such a nice dining option in the neighborhood.
