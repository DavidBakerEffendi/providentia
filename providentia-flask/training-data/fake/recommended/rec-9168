I've been back to this place four times, and each time it was for the grilled calamari and not much else. The food at both locations are equally alright. It's not BAD, but it's not as incredibly delicious as I was hoping it to be. The exception is, obviously, their grilled calamari. Fabulous. Not rubbery, and not too oily, grilled perfectly with an amazing garlic rub. Perfection each time, and a hefty portion as well. The other appetizers and entrees are good, not great. The reason I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 3.5 or 4, is because of the service at the SoHo location. Please note that their Brooklyn location deserves at least another 1/2 star for the friendly and accommodating staff. However, the staff at the SoHo location are the stereotypical "I'm a talented writer/actor/artist and I do this because I haven't made it big yet" asshole. They are pretentious, and lack any kind of personality. I'm quite sure none of the staff has ever looked at me directly in the eyes, as if I'm the Mexican Staring Frog (circa South Park 1998) and looking directly at me will cause them to die a painful death. Despite this, the calamari and random assortment of comfort foods, seafood, and steaks is enough to keep me coming back to their Brooklyn location.
