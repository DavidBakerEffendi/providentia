The great Pat's vs. Geno's debate. That's what a co-worker and I hoped to resolve when we made the quickest pit stop ever en route to catching our train out of the city.  Pat's.  Geno's.  Quite simply, a LOT of beef, cheese whiz, and bread to put down--all in 20 minutes.  (Luckily, there were no lines this Thursday evening.) First was Pat's.  $8.25 for a cheesesteak with whiz, no onions/pepeprs/etc.  Soft, yet crisp, fresh bread--nice.  Pleasantly surprised at how well the whiz worked.  But the meat, served in rough chunks, was a little tough and not that flavorful.  Good, but onto Geno's... Geno's.  I was wary of this place's reputation for in-your-face politics.  The "Take Back Our Country" signs were a little eyebrow-raising, but beyond that, nothing crazy.  Plus, this steak was damn good.  The meat here was neatly sliced, properly cooked, and well seasoned.  My co-worker raved about the hot sauce he loaded onto his. I understand that Pat's & Geno's are considered tourist traps by Philly natives, but nonetheless, are definitely worth checking out for the history.  Pat's vs. Geno's?  One man's opinion: advantage, Geno's.
