I want to love this place, as it is one of about 3 places that I can walk to for brunch, but after my third visit I have to say that I am seriously disappointed.  They have a lot going for them- nice decor, a great little waiting area, and a great-sounding menu.  Every time I've been here the service has been very spotty.  On my last visit I ordered eggs benedict, which should be served with poached eggs.  The eggs on my dish were cooked hard so that the yolk was not runny at all.  I am not the type of person who regularly sends food back but this was unacceptable to me.  This is a classic dish and you would think that with a name like green eggs, they would be proficient in cooking eggs.  When I nicely told the waitress about the eggs she whisked them away but didn't apologize.  Moments later one of my dining companions discovered that her 'make-your-own-omelet' did not have 2 of the ingredients that she ordered.  Again the waitress took the omelet away but did not offer an apology.  Our meals did come back fairly quickly with properly poached eggs and the missing omelet ingredients this time but without the potatoes that came with the meals.  My friend was also charged an extra dollar for the cheese in her omelet which should have been included.  I can't believe that this place has up to 2 hour waits with this shoddy service and food that is just "meh."  I'd rather stay at home.
