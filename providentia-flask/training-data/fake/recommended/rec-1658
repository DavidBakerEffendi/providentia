DAMN YOU GENO!!! Your steaks are friggin AMAZING! ALMOST amazing enough to ignore the tons of racist signs telling me I better speak English or don't bother standing in line (which I do, but if I spoke any other language it shouldn't matter)... How is someone NOT from this country gonna tell OTHERS how to behave when they come here? Ironically, the people that work behind the counter don't speak English (rather, some sort of half-mouthed blabber)... Kinda sound like a patient of a severe stroke... and some lady who can't HEAR English...Evidently, you must YELL everything to her. Social skills are lacking at this establishment to say the least.. Funny, he says Marines fought for the right to speak English... I beg to differ buddy. I fought so you can speak whatever you want! OK..enough of the rant.... The racist signs and the long lines, retarded staff isn't enough to stop me from driving 2 Hours just to get a few of these tasty treats... But it IS enough to keep me from rating higher than a 3!
