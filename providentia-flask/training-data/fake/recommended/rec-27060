We decided to check out Dough due to the concept of supporting and using locally grown ingredients. Other than that here goes another place specializing in pizza. The food was tasty and we loved the idea of supporting local farmers but there was something left to be desired. The ambiance is nice and they do have outdoor seating. Our server was very friendly and attentive and made our experience enjoyable. Due to the prices and portions we decided to get several items and split them. The salad was enjoyable but the portion was barely enough for 3 people. We ordered two pizza's that once they came out were on the smaller side and left everyone desiring more. We also ordered a side of the mac n cheese that was tasty and helped to fill us up. Overall we loved the concept but the pizza and portions for the money could be better. You will enjoy this place if you are looking for the experience but be prepared to spend some money is you are hungry and looking to order several different options.
