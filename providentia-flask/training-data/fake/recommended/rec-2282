This place was highly recommended by a friend who used to live in Philly. WOW! What an awesome place. We went for Sunday brunch and had to wait about 15-20 minutes, which wasn't bad @ all considering this is a hot brunch spot in the area. The place is very cozy and cute. The staff is very diverse, kinda punk rocky types and such, they were all very welcoming and very attentive. The food was out of hand! We ordered omelettes, which were HUMONGOUS, but were cooked perfectly. The best thing we had, which I still think about constantly, was their Stuffed French Toast. WOW. I have no words. Perfection? Euphoria? This monster piece of heaven on a plate was more than I could ever imagine. It was stuffed w/ some sort of caramelized banana w/ cream and covered w/ vanilla maple syrup. Wow. It was amazing. I would go back to Philly just for this alone. I recommend you call ahead. I tried to call ahead and the girl said no wait, but when we got there there was one and there were people arriving after me who did call ahead (ggrrr!). But if you do have to wait, just do it! It's worth it.
