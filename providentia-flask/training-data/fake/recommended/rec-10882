Bad service.  Bad food quality.  Long wait. We arrived Sunday night to a fairly empty restaurant.  We were told the wait would be an hour... which made no sense to me.  We gave them our number and went downstairs to the bar.  While sitting at the tables, twice someone tried to bring us food that the neighboring table had ordered.  Over an hour passed and we go upstairs to check in.  They've crossed off a party of 2 from their list who was written below our names.  We've been skipped! The service during the meal was slightly better, but not by much.  The servers had no familiarity with the menu-- for example when we ordered the lobster and a side order of corn, nobody bothered to inform us that the lobster came with a side of corn anyway. The food itself was marginal and highly overpriced.  The lobster was covered in so much butter, you couldn't even taste the damn thing. This spot has very cool ambiance, and a mini-golf course, and a nice view.  Unfortunately, that's all it has going for it.  The restaurant itself is to be avoided.
