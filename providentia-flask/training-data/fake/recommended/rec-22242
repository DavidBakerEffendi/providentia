I appreciate the point of view of the menu, but after the interesting and tasty appetizers, the main course fell very short. Their menu was recently cut down from the large book it used to be. The very nice server even showed us the old one that was often referred to on Yelp. It was huge and still is quite large. We decided to get the sampler so we wouldn't have to make decisions. Out of all the very different rolls there were only 2 I found somewhat enjoyable. Most were dry and were really hard to chew and swallow. Â We left disappointed and will likely not return.
