Underwhelming. Went for lunch and left pretty disappointed. We got the mac and cheese and the burger. Both were fine - the bacon was great. I had a hot chocolate that was delicious. The service was really mediocre. Girl seemed to be really overwhelmed by her 4 tables - I think she was new to serving. Forgot our drinks, and everything else was just slow. Normally doesn't bother me, but she wasn't particularly friendly to make up for it - not rude, just not nice. As for the decor, people seem to like it, but I thought it was as cheesy and pretentious. I suppose that comes with the territory when you name your place 'milk and roses.' I could see how it may be nicer at night so I may go back to check out the bar. But I wouldn't hold my breath.
