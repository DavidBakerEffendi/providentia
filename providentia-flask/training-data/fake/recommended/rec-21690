Yummmmm.  This place is a small joint that plays reggae and serves bar food and drinks.  The place is very small so if you plan on bringing a group with you, I'd probably choose another restaurant.   We had hamburger, fatty wagu beef, and karage chicken.  Hands down, the fatty wagu beef was the best.   When I went there, there were a couple of groups of Japanese people dining.  Usually that's a tell tale sign it's authentic.
