My friend and I came here on a whim for a classy night for her birthday. it definitely was classy and sophisticated in appearance/ atmosphere and i absolutely love the dishes and wine selection. Overall, the place is tiny, in sophisticated terms, it's: "intimate" In terms of layout, the grills are in the open with a wrap around table that seats roughly 25 people (guesstimate) so everyone faces the grill. honestly, there really isn't an amazing show to see but at least you know theyre not sneaking any creepy crawlies into your food. the environment is definitely warm and great for one on one discussions with me and my friend. service was great. our hostess suggested some great wines to start off with and then end with and definitely answered all our questions since it had been our first time. our plates and silverware were constantly changed each course and the woman behind the counter explained our dishes. However, cons, the woman behind the counter kept announcing who was finishing up their food and needed their next course. she was not yelling but Im trying to talk to my friend and do not need someone saying "25 and 26 are on their last bites" and hearing it every few minutes. food was tasty. loved every dish. remember all this is a tapas restaurant. so do not come here starving. of course this is also classy tapas. so its dolled up and presented properly. (do not come here looking for traditional spanish tapas that is so much more amazing and cheaper but only found in spain) you can see their wine menu on their website and definitely liked starting off with the white wine, specifically the verdejo and ending with a cabernet sauvignon with the main course. overall it was a great experience and great food. if i was rich and had a lot of money to eat tapas and drink wine id definitely come here. Â but if you have the money, and have a good friend to talk to and get a great wine buzz from definitely come here.
