corner bistro is great.  The burger is messy, so you always eat it faster than you'd planned.  More than anything, though, it is delicious.  Great size, good patty.  It is not my favorite burger in the city like many others have said.  But there are no problems with it.  It's a perfectly done, no-frills burger.  I think the best element is the perfectly done bacon.  You've got to love the environment in this place.  It's loud and crowded, yet very personal.  The service is ornery in a good way.  The waiter doesnt look at you or acknowledge you, but he is listening, and he'll bring you what you want.  The line is never as bad as it looks.
