I went to Bayou for the first time last night and was so surprised to find that it was really busy for a weekday night. While we waited for our table, we had sangria at the bar. The peach sangria was so delicious. The bartender was even nice enough to let us sample the mojito sangria and while that was good, the peach was definitely better. The food was really reminiscent of New Orleans cuisine. As an appetizer we had baked clams and scallop lollipops. For our main course we had crab cakes and jambalaya. Everything was tasty and we were really happy with the food. The decor and atmosphere is also a real treat. I'm looking forward to returning for one of their special events nights where they have jazz bands and tarot card readings. Definitely a highly recommended wonderful place to have dinner.
