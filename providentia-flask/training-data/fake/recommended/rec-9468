I went to the 53rd and 7th location Saturday around 5:30pm, and surprisingly there was no line. After triple checking that I wasn't at some imposter cart, I ordered the combo plate - rice, iceberg lettuce, diced tomatoes, sliced pita, and a generous portion each of shredded chicken and lamb. You can choose to have them drizzle the sauce on for you, but I opted for the little to-go cartons. Out of the plate, the only thing I liked was the lamb, which was really juicy and packed with flavor. The chicken was bland and extremely dry - I ended up just pushing it to the side so it wouldn't ruin the rest of the experience. The storebought pita had been steamed to mush by the time I got back, so I pushed that aside too. I ended up having a lamb salad haha, which was decent only because of how good the lamb was. Maybe it would have been better with their white sauce, but it strangely tasted like ranch, which I really dislike. If I ever go back, I'd probably just get the lamb with the lettuce and tomatoes and add some veggies at home - that would definitely feed 2-3 people.
