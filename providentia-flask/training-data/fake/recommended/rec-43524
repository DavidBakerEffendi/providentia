It catches you off guard when you first walk in and all there is a small area and a hostess stand and it doesn't get all that much bigger after walking through the curtain. The whiskey selection is outstanding. The bartenders and knowledgeable and attentive. They also know their sushi (great recommendation from the bartender). The Irish Car Bomb Shake is a must try. Very sweet, but definitely outstanding. Limited selection of beers on tap, but it is a whiskey bar. Limited seating even with the bar. I suggest going for an early dinner or pre-dinner drink. Great place, will visit every time I am in Philly.
