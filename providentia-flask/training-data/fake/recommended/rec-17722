LOVE LOVE LOVE Mariachi Grill! The food is fresh and delicious, the staff delightful and accomodating. Free chips and the best spicy salsa EVER while you wait for your food. My personal favorite-the chicken quesadilla is a huge portion-enough for two easily! My co-workers and I pile into Mariachi Grill for lunch at least once a week-maybe more.
