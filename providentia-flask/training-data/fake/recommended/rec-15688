Long Island City is booming right now. If you live in that area, it's a great alternative to living in the city for those that can afford it. Going back to the main topic here, I've been to this place twice and really enjoyed it both times I was here. Food = Excellent, Service = Excellent. I'll admit that paying $7 or $8 for two taquerias was a little much, but I'm willing to pay a little more knowing that the quality of my food is gonna be great. And as you can tell, it was awesome! Although, there isn't much decor around the place, everything else makes up for it. The last time I was here, I may have had one of the most interesting dishes that I've ever had. They call it the mole de piaxtla. It's an authentic mexican chicken dish where the gravy is mexican chocolate. How many places can you say that chocolate is used for a savory dish? Probably one in a million, right? The chocolate sauce had a very small amount of sweetness and it also had a combination of peppers and spices. On top of that, the chicken was so tender, it falls right off the bone. Usually I would expect something like that from a lamb shank dish at a Moroccan restaurant, but this is definitely something tasty and different. For everyone reading this post, you gotta try this place, even if you have been there once before
