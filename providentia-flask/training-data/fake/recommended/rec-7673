Great ambiance and service. The waitresses were obviously itching for us to leave at 1:30AM, but still kept their smiles on and waited patiently for us to finish the sangria, which at $35 per pitcher isn't cheap, but was delicious nonetheless. The food is wonderful and hearty, good portions for tapas and I recommend getting the skirt steak and scallops! These are not teeny tiny starve yourself tapas. I would definitely return for a date or fun night with girlfriends.
