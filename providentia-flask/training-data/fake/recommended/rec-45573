My boyfriend had spent the weekend in Atlantic City and decided to go to Philly since it's quite close to Atlantic City and it's not too out of the way from home. We decided to come to the Morning Glory diner because I had saw it on a TV special and the food looked mighty tasty. Well I was right...this place is seriously a gem. I got the Monkey french toast which is what this place is famous for and I can certainly see why. The french toast melts in your mouth and the caramelized bananas and mangoes really give it a good flavor. My boyfriend got a provolone topped frittata(the other thing this place is famous for) and it was out of this world delicious. The portions are huge to be sure to bring your appetite. I loved the french toast so much I got another order to bring home with me..it didn't even make it home. I was dreaming about it the rest of out trip so I devoured it in the car on the way home. My only complaint is that Morning Glory is in PA..not NY :(
