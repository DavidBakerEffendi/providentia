I clicked on 3 stars because I didn't want to give it only 2 stars, but A-OK is not how I feel about it. I agree with everyone who said that it has potential, but it needs work. The coffee is great, the space is nice, the cookies and bread are high quality (I've never had a sandwich), and the people who work there are nice, but here's what really annoys me: they open way, way too late. I went there recently on a Saturday morning at almost 9:30 and they weren't open yet. WTF? They're not open on weekday mornings as I'm on my way to work, about 8:10 or so. And they're practically on top of a subway entrance. How not smart is that? And how annoying? They don't post a sign outside saying what their hours are so that I know whether to venture down there for a cup of coffee or not before 11 a.m. That's my suggestion for a big improvement: wake up and open up your coffee place so that people who wake up earlier than 10 a.m. (read people with kids and people who work day jobs) can grab a cup of coffee on the way to the playground or the commute.
