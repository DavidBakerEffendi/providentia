I sat across the street, on a recent humid evening, melting into the stairs of the of the NY Public Library. I had finally made it, I had been waiting for some time, and there I was. When my friend finally arrived, it was time to step inside into the cool comfort of the AC. We started with a couple of cold ones, UB definitely has a choice beer selection, I got the fire island sea salt ale. I got the ale part, but was unsure about how the salt factored in. Still it was refreshing. Of course we came for the burgers, but ordered a kale caesar. I always find myself sitting at some restaurant or another disappointed, their really isn't much to them, and this one was no different. (note to self, stop order caesar salads as an appetizer). As far as the burgers go, we split two, I would go with what other reviewers have said and get the truffle jump off. That was the best thing I had here. We also ordered the manly burger, it wasn't for me, a bit rich. Not my favorite burger spot in the city, but pretty good .
