I'm mystified as to the loyalty that this business appears to inspire among its following. I was new to the Connecticut pizza holy war culture, so when we set out to New Haven to go to Sally's and found it was closed, the party moved to Pepe's.  We stood in line for about a half an hour listening to how amazing and life-changing it was and I have to say, my expectations were on the high end. We got inside five minutes before it started pouring rain and the line didn't dissipate a bit.  That could mean one of two things: that the crowd are unreasoning fanatics or that the pizza is just that good. Spoiler: they're unreasoning fanatics. Ordered a pizza margherita and a broccoli clam pizza (colleague's trip down memory lane in honor of his dad).  Half an hour later the clam pizza arrived, sans broccoli.  Server seemed offended that we were sending it back.  Half an hour after that the margherita arrived.  It was good if a bit overly burnt in spots.  The corrected first pie arrived after another twenty minutes and we packed up what was left and took off. The pies weren't terrible; the sauce was respectable and the crust was firm and crispy.  The mozzarella was tasty and the taste of the basil permeated the entire pie, so that wasn't bad.  The clam wasn't anything special, but my colleague raved over it. I can't hold it against the establishment that there was a line; it's not their fault people love their product.  But for a kitchen serving such a tiny dining room I expect faster service than half an hour per pie, and I expect it to arrive correct the first time. Honestly it was fun to check out what everyone was raving about but I highly doubt I'd bother going back.
