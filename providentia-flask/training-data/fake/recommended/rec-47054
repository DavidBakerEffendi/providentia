Awesome food.  Over-priced (especially the alcohol).  Ridiculous wait times on the weekends. Four of us (foolishly) attempted to get into Village Whiskey on a Friday night and the wait was two hours.  I'm sorry, but I won't wait two hours for a table in any restaurant in a city with so much great food.  I would suggest trying a weeknight or lunch as they seemed to be much more reasonable. Two of us tried again on a Wednesday night and had to wait about 40mins.  We ducked around the corner to Rum Bar for a drink while we waited, so not a huge inconvenience. Before I say anything else - the food was super delicious, there is no question about that.  My burger was cooked perfectly; juicy, flavorful, meat heaven.  We got the duck fat fries with cheese sauce and so should you.  Cheese puffs were good, but not as good as our other choices. My biggest beef (ha) with this place is the prices.  $11 for a burger isn't expensive, but it only comes with lettuce and thousand island dressing.  All of the extra toppings, including cheese, are $1.50-$5.50.  Whoa.  On the other side of that, the whiskey menu is even worse.  $10 for two ounces of regular Jameson?  I can go buy a whole bottle for $30.  We each had a cocktail and a beer, but I couldn't justify getting any WHISKEY at Village WHISKEY.  This made me sad.  As an Irish girl, I love whiskey, and looking at that untouchable, glorious menu of brown ambrosia hurt my heart. Note: I will admit that I am spoiled by living in South Philly.  There are so many great restaurants and bars to choose from and everything is much cheaper.  I know that Center City prices need to be higher because of high overhead costs, but in this case, I think Garces is pushing it. ALTERNATIVE: For an equally AWESOME (and cheaper) burger, head to one of my faves, Royal Tavern on Passyunk Ave. Bottom line:  It's worth going, just keep the above in mind.  I would go again, but only on a night when my wallet needed to purge.
