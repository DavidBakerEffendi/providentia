I personally like Geno's better even though Pat's was there first. This was only my second time having it. The first time I was going to college in Philly and a friend said I had to try a real cheesesteak and I was amazed. Nothing you can really describe here. Its a perfect combination of everything especially if you order it with cheese wiz. The bread is great, the meat is cooked perfectly, and the cheese is nicely melted all over. The only reason is took away a star is because I prefer Geno's. The only time I was there the guy seemed like he had an attitude, but what can you expect when you constantly serving the same thing without a break. The guys at Geno's never do they always seem up beat and friendly.
