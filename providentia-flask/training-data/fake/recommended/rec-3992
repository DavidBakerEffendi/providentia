Um, I love this place.  It's oyster season at home in the Carolinas (maybe here too, I don't know) so lately I've been craving oysters pretty hard.  I tried this place with the boyfriend a few weeks ago and now  I want to go back everyday for the bluepoint special.  You get SIX bluepoint oysters plus a drink (beer or  wine) for 8 DOLLARS!!!  There is no point in getting a drink WITHOUT 6 oysters.   And they are so delicious and buttery.   We also tried the fried oyster roll (delicious) the fried oyster appetizer (the same but delicious).  The second time we went there we tried the lobster mac and cheese (it was pretty good, not that cheesy) and the crab cakes (not great, wouldn't recommend) but just go for the oyster special.   I can't deduct points for the other menu items b/c the oysters make up for it.  And the staff is so friendly and laid back.  I just love it, okay!
