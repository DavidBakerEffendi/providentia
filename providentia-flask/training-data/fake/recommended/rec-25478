This is my favorite sushi restaurant in the area.  Sits right on the delightful Park Ave of Rutherford.  The prices are very fair and the quality of the food is very good.  This place often gives me free appetizers in addition to what I ordered, I don't know if this is normal or because I am regular. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is as big a sushi fan as I am!
