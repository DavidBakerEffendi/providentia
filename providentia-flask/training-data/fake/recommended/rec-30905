WONDERFUL! The staff is incredibly friendly, the food is to die for, the prices are right on. Took my dad here and he couldn't stop raving about it- even had me take a picture on his phone so he could remember it and show his friends back in Connecticut. Like he always said-- the best food anywhere always comes from a whole in the wall... and Scratch Bread is exactly that.
