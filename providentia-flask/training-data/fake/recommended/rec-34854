I've read many reviews of Calle Ocho's brunch, but not many for their dinner.  So for all the evening-eaters, here you are.   The fifth star was removed because of the following: After making a 8:45pm reservation on a Wednesday night, at 8pm my group of five sat in the bar area to start with some cocktails.  Around 8:50pm, I checked with the hostess who stated it would only be 5 minutes more.  Fifteen minutes after this, we checked again and were told 5 minutes. So around 9:15p, we were finally seated in the dining room.  At this point, the group was a little drunk and very hungry.   The bread arrived and the table quickly emptied the basket.  It was delicious, especially the bean dip! We shared an appetizer of Chicharon (calamari) which was very tasty, although it had pretty standard breading and marinara sauce. My first choice for an entree was the nightly special, but it must have been good because they were out. (Perhaps if we were seated 30 minutes earlier, I could've gotten lucky.) So, I chose the Spice Rubbed Salmon, Lobster Mash, Cucumber Relish, Mango Chutney. This was hands and feet down, the best salmon dish I've had in NYC since moving here over a year and a half ago.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned, each bite had overwhelming amounts of flavor and when combined with the mash, relish, and mango chutney, the overall flavors were as harmonious as a Boyz II Men song (yea that's right, I just made that reference).  I found the portion to be the perfect size, although I'm a 5'2" woman.  But I was dining with four men who all looked equally stuffed/satisfied at the end of the meal.   In all, I would certainly return to Calle Ocho to dine and drink. Even the long wait time can be overlooked for a delicious meal.
