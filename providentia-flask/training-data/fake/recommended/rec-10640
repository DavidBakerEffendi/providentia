Very nice main entrees -- I had the tilapia dish and my friend had the chicken pappardelle.  Hearts of Palm salad was ok -- could have been way more considered in terms of flavors and less clunky in presentation.  The peach tart tartin dessert felt like it came out on a pre-made frozen pastry puff. The atmosphere is very nice and the service is great. Will definitely go back.
