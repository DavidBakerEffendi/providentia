Had a great dinner experience here with friends - we were celebrating a 21st birthday, and our server was very friendly and attentive. Sit outdoors if you get the chance! The food is delicious - we ordered mostly "small" plates, except for two friends who shared a burger, and the "small" plates are definitely not small. The burrata crostini is absolutely delicious. We also had a few beers and the really excellent pear cider. The atmosphere is very relaxed and overall it's an amazing establishment in the heart of Princeton.
