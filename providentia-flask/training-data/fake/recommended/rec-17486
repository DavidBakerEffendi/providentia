Awesome but expensive. The drinks are excellent, we had the flavored margaritas and mojitos. For appetizer, we had the octopus dish, which is one of my favorite things I've ever eaten. For entree, I had the goat, which was very good. Gf had carne asada, which was very tender and cooked perfectly with a nice slow burn spice to it. Only thing keeping from 5 stars probably is the price (over $100), which is just too much to me for a place with a bar-like atmosphere (very loud music). Service was excellent.
