Although it is on the first floor of a plain brick office building, when you walk in you'll certainly feel like you are in a pub.  The food is your basic pub fare; the fish and chips is very generous with the fish and chips, the reuben is decent (and with plenty of sauerkraut which I like), and my policy of never passing up on gravy cheese fries (aka poutine aka the best thing to ever come of of Canada).  Of the beers, I only tried the Burly Irish Ale, but it was smooth and delicious, and I would recommend it.
