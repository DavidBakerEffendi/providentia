Delicious everything.  Loved the calamari sauce, and the calamari itself.  The fresh mozza was fantastic.  We had pizza, the baked rigatoni and the chicken marsala, and everything was cooked well.  The timing between appies and the main course was perfect, and deserts and coffee were great.  There was no rush for us to leave, and we were checked on frequently.  This would totally be a regular haunt if we were locals!
