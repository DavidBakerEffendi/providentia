I used to frequent this place but never again. I went today for lunch and was told they no longer serve tea or water. The cashier told me, "you should buy a bottle of water." Um, no thanks. What a waste of money and plastic. I pressed the cashier further, seeing a big stack of cups behind the register. "Yeah, but since the renovation our water pipes don't work anymore." Right. I won't be returning.
