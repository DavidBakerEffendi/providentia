I remember when Thistle used to be in Kearny so when it moved a few blocks away from me in Lyndhurst, I was so excited to try it because I had been craving good fish n' chips for a while. I went based on the good reviews of this place from other Yelpers. I got the Fish n' Chips that everyone raved about. Despite the fish itself being nice and flaky, the outside batter was way too greasy for me and cld have been rested on paper towel to soak it up for a bit. Even the fries that the fish were on top of were greasy due to the fish. Every bite I took, I felt like I was eating a mouthful of grease. I couldn't get myself to finish it due to that fact even though I really wanted to. Sadly disappointed...
