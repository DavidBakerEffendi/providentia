Becco is a Restaurant Row institution, having been around for many, many years.  Keeping theater-goers happy, as well as locals and tourists, Becco has a great ambience and reasonable prices.  While they focus on wine with an extensive wine list, they do have a full bar (no sangria, though) and can basically make whatever you crave.   We started with the Bresaola (thinly sliced beef), which was great, and the Tonnato di Vitello (veal loin topped with tuna aioli)...really my cup of tea.  Both were on the Seasonal Menu additions part of the menu. However, their main entree is where they shine.  They are very popular for their UNLIMITED pasta offerings, which are different every day.  On our day, they offered a four-cheese fusili, veal bolognese fettucinne, and a penne with vegetables and tomato sauce.  With any entree, you get a Caesar salad.  Their Caesar is delicious, along with their pasta.   If you're not into pasta, they have various menu options including roasted chicken, braised short ribs, and various fish options.   I also want to make a special callout on their service.  We had a party of 5 with a latecomer or two.  Our server, Leighton, was truly exceptional from beginning to end.   He did have to run on a break for some unknown reason, but informed another server who took care of us until he was able to return.  The GM, Jim B, really does a great job managing Becco, and is worth giving it a try if you never have. I would definitely come back to Becco again - if only there weren't so many carbs in Italian food.  ;)
