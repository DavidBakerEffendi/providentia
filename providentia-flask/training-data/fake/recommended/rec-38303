Had to give 5 stars. Pretty perfect weather so we sat outside. Cucumber martini type drink was good. Good tap beer. We had black bean burgers...basically awesome veggie burgers. Really tasty; I'd recommend if you were vegetarian or not. Service was first class. We had a question about directions and so the manager came over and talked to us, very nice and pleasant. No complaints whatsoever.
