Great place to grab a bite when in midtown! There is a buffet for hot food that I have yet to try, but there is always a long line. Now they rotate different foods every week for lunch boxes. However, the staples like certain soups and kimbap varieties are still available. I have a friend who studies at the CIA but still come here every time he's in NYC to eat the spicy rice cakes. Opens until late for late night cravings. No tip. More tables available now that they renovated and have more space. Good selections of drinks - alcoholic and non-alcoholic to share in plastic cups with your friends. Plastic utensils clean and always stocked. Nothing is over 10 dollars. Lunch boxes come with a free small soup or salad. Its always a great bang for your buck. I really like this place as a casual eating area or place to meet with friends.
