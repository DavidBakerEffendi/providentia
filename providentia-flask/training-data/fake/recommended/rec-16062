The food here is well-prepared and the atmosphere is quite cozy. It is a great place to gather with friends and socialize. The place has a cozy setting with low, dim lights, perfect to hide the imperfections. (At least it was for me!) Try the Gnocchi di Ricotta if you like the flavor of black truffles. It is in a cream sauce, but it is not as heavy as alfredo sauce.
