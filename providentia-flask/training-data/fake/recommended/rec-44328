I recently went here for a birthday dinner with my girlfriend and a bunch of my friends. We were a group of 10 and were seated at 6:30pm. They brought out our dinners cold and not all at once. Some of us had to wait long periods of time before they received their meals. I ordered a cheeseburger and when everyone started to receive their dinners the waiter told me that they ran out of hamburger meat and if I wanted to change my order. I don't understand how a restaurant could finally realize they were our of hamburger meat by the time they were serving everyone else's dinner. I wouldn't have cared I'd they told me this sooner but the fact that they didn't know until everyone else began being served as disgraceful and poor management. I had to wait even longer to get my meal. Throughout our stay there there were multiple times they ran out of stuff we wanted and was only find last minute. They didn't even look to offer us anything to take care of the cold dinners and for me waiting to get my new dinner so when we complained they offered us a a round of drinks for free. After having cold food, having people wait to get their meals instead of everyone being able to eat together pls being told lay minute of by the way we're out of hamburger meat it really wasn't a good way to fix the problem. I would never recommended this place and works instead make sure I know never goes there so they don't experience what we all did. Not what someone would expect when going out especially when to celebrate a birthday.
