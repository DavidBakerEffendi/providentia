The mofongo here was perfection.  I've paid three times more and had half the enjoyment at white tablecloth places.  The alcapurrias were first rate.  Freshly made, not pulled out from under a lght bulb.  The bistec encebollado (steak with onions) was just right.  Tasty and tender.  Two guys had the bacalao a la viscaina (shreded cod fish stew with potatoes) and were very happy.  The pernil was taaaaaasty.  This compared to anything that you can get back on the island.  It is basic and good.  If you want fancy food in a sparkling modern setting you will be disappointed.  If you think that mofongo needs lime to brighten the flavors you won't like it so much.  Folks, this is how the food should be.  A great traditional menu and flavors.   The place is very tiny and a bit run down.  The service isn't performed by tuxedo clad waiters.  It is home.  With homestyle food. The Food Channel was there filming a segment of "the Best Thing That I Ever Ate" or whatever that show is called.   They know a thing or two, those folks...
