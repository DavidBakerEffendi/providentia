believe the hype. it was good for me, i hope it's good for you. the quick: I waited 1.5 hours, full skeptic I dined and was impressed by Karaka Men Bowl $14 Lunch Yelpers are right, the wait is long from beginning to end wait rating: I would be willing to wait 48 minutes to eat here again First of all, waiting seems to be a staple of this place.  Saturday afternoon was a 1.5 hour wait outside.  This place has no trouble with business.  I went with some friends that recommended it.  I'm not a ramen fanatic but I appreciate a good bowl of noodles and also like to try new places so there we were. The restaurant inside is great.  Really modern, hip and dark cool.  The servers are wildly attentive, almost to the point where I felt watched.  It was a bit odd. Anyhow, we placed our orders and the food took longer than a person's usual expectations but the restaurant was running full capacity so I wasn't surprised.  Please also expect that a bowl of ramen will cost you dearly.  More than other reputable places like Shin Sen Gumi () which I already find pricey at $10+ for a bowl with fixings. So the ramen here is actually very good.  Almost amazing but pulled down by the wait and work to get here.  But the flavors on every level from broth to noodles to fixings were really great.  I didn't fall in love but my skepticism had to give it up for the quality that was apparent in each wonderful slurp.  I really enjoyed my meal and that's what I'm looking for from a restaurant. So while this place is majorly hyped, sky high priced and a tedious wait, you get a great dining experience.  If you're a resident of NY, I might wait for a less crowded time but as a tourist I'm willing to wait longer for an experience that I don't know can be matched on the West Coast at the moment.  Anyone willing to recommend a contender in SoCal?
