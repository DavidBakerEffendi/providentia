This is one of the best mexican restaurants in the area I have been to. I order take out from here often. My favorite dishes are the Salmon "Tequila Don Pepe" , the Salmon Yucatan, and the chicken flautas. The margaritas are pretty good and so is the tres leches...they have my approval, lol. The chips and salsa are good, and so is the guacamole. For appetizers, I like the chorizo dishes.
