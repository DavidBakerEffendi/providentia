So happy I happened upon this place on my bike ride through Astoria!!  This place definitely deserves the 4/5 stars it gets!!  The sandwiches were soooo tasty! I don't eat meat and was worried that a place like this wouldn't have options or they would suck - man was I wrong.  My friend and I shared 2 paninis - the artichoke with romesco, olive spread and goat cheese and the avocado with roast mushrooms, tomato, cracked pepper aioli and mozzeralla. Both were full of flavor and they didn't skimp on the veggies.  We also got a side of the truffle spread....in other words, heaven. We were so satisfied.  We also started with the beet salad which has lots of arugula. I am definitely coming back. The staff was super friendly too and their outdoor patio was really nice.
