Don't go here expecting good food, but you will NOT find a better environment anywhere else. This is the only place in Philly I'd feel excited to go with a large party to. It is all open air yet also accommodates guests who prefer to be under a roof. People playing ping pong, tables in legion clanging beer glasses festively. Smiles everywhere. Just a really nice crowd experience. If you are looking for romantic and intimate, go elsewhere, but if you are more outgoing, this place will really make you happy. Otherwise, don't waste your money on the fancier burgers. They are TINY and the $7 option for the regular burger is just as good. The soft serve was really whatever too. This is pretty much the only place I would go back to over and over again despite hating the food.
