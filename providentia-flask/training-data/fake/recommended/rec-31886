It's hard to branch out beyond the panini if you're a fan of fresh baked crusty bread and home made soft and creamy mozzarella.  The only sign that you're not in Italy or France is the more generous layer of shaved prosciutto, capicola, sopressata, etc.  This will keep you going all day as you tour Manhattan.
