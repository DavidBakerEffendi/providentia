I have decided to try their special frog legs with garlic sauce. Now I have had frog legs many times from various places and I have somewhat an idea of what is good and not so good. I also want to be objective and not tarnish their image just because it is not to my liking. Just to point out I have a culinary degree from French Culinary Institute and I have worked in a few Michelin starred restaurants. This by no means makes me the ultimate authority but above average would be a good start. Anyway, I got the frog legs and when I asked them how big the dish was, the lady said it was a very big dish and enough for me. FYI I am 5'9 and 155lb. Surprisingly, this price tag of $16 did not include anything else, not even white rice. She did try hard to get me to buy white rice for an addition of $3. I declined thinking, like she said, the dish was big enough. Now this order was TOGO, so I did not have a chance to see what I was getting. When I got home and open the bag I saw a saute of small frog legs of 3 frogs, which, if don't already know, is 6 small frog legs sauteed with a few button mushrooms and garlic. THAT IS IT. The taste was about 4 out of 10 but the texture is where it went completely over the edge for me. The legs were dry and extremely tough. Now look, there are plenty of restaurants that can justify charging prices as such but this is absolutely not one of them. This is a whole in a wall with a very sad dining room which resembles something 3rd world tacky. How in the world was I swindled to fork over $16 for such nonsense which left me hungry and disappointed is beyond me. This was my experience with Larb. Now I would love to say that, maybe, this was a one-off mistake but having an item on the menu as such is a bad experience that is bound to repeat itself with many costumers to come.
