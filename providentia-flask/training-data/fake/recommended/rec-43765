Everybody hypes this place so much. We went with some people who claimed it is their favorite restaurant in NY. Well, they apparently don't get out too much. The pasta honestly tasted like something I could make at home. Or at least get for a quarter of the price somewhere else. I like that it is all you can eat. But for $22 worth of pasta, they should let me eat there for a month for free.
