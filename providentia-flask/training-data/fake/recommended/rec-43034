Came here on a Saturday night before hittin The Box. Very crowded, got a table no problem. Made our way through the crowd, pass the bar, pass the fire place to the back of the joint and OMG not one drink spilled on me! Yay!! Had a seat next to two beautiful girls, ordered a few drinks, threw em' back down my throat and devoured some tasty appetizers, oysters, lamb chops and Â a fruit, cheese platter with honey covered pistachios and walnuts. Great atmosphere, friendly crowd, good service. Nice beginning to a fabulass night!
