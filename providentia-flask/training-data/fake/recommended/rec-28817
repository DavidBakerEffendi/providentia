I've never had hand drawn noodles before so I don't have much to compare this too but I can tell you they are significantly better than any other noodles I've tried. They are more doughy and have a lot of flavor and I strongly recommend to anyone craving noodles but looking for something new! Also one dish is definitely enough to split between two people!
