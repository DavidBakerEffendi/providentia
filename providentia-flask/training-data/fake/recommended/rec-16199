The delicious food here is only made more awesome by the wonderfully ironic feeling of eating non-kosher foods in the no mans land border between hipsters and Hasidic Jewish communities in Williamsburg. Pretty much everything on the menu is good -- you can't go wrong. As for the portions, they're small plates, so maybe 2 to 2.5 per person for two guys. The flavors definitely punch you in the face, but there's some subtlety if you try really hard to find it. Go to Dram afterwards for great drinks.
