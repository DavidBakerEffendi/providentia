Came here for Sunday brunch. (too bad chicken and waffles isn't on the brunch menu) We were sat and had our order taken fairly quickly. The pancakes, pork chop with waffles and Eggs Huntington were pretty good. Our walnut sticky bun was burned and the house-made sausage was bleh! Nothing special and definitely not worth the almost hour-long wait for our food to come out.
