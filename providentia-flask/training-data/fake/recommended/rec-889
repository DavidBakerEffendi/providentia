THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE I was at Atlantic City and took the train to Philadelphia.  After walking around the city, decided to go to Geno's since I see it everytime on TV (during commercial if a sporting event in Philadelphia, Food Network, etc).  So one would assume it would be good since it's on television. This honestly was the biggest waste of money and till this day, still hate myself for eating that dump.  First off, people that work there were rude as hell (I think it's just how Philadephians are).  I ordered a cheesesteak with light cheese whiz, fries, and a drink.  Believe it was around $14.50, which is also the biggest rip off on Earth.  I can get better food at a McDonalds' than this place.  The bread was hard as a rock, fries were awful, had no flavor even though I poured about half the salt in the shaker, and on top of that, they charge you for getting another fountain drink.  The meat was fatty, even fact, my gf was tearing off the fat that was on her sandwich.  It had no flavor whatsoever and SO BAD.  I actually had to force myself to eat cuz I felt bad for throwing it away.   I wouldnt even recommend this dump to my worst enemy.  This is just a tourist trap and highly recommend NOT GOING HERE!!!  I seriously have no idea how some of these people have the courage to write a positive review for this place.  Im only giving a one star because I have to fill it out, if not, I would give a 0.   If you are brave enough and still want to go, I seriously recommend you going to a restaurant in your local city and order a cheesesteak before.  Then go to Geno's....you'll see how bad it is.  TRUST ME!!!
