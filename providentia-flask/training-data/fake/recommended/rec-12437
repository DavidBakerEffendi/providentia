Not a big fan of chicken and rice but when I do have it, I always end up going to 53rd and 6th. And I always get the combo platter to go and get as much white sauce on the side as you want! They have it in little containers on the side of the cart and the hot sauce too. Lines are always long but service is semi fast so nothing to complain about there. I feel like this cart is a must visit for everyone that visits New York.
