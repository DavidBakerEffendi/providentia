For the chef's reputation, I really expected more. I went on Valentine's Day, which I know is a jam packed meal, but I just wasn't impressed. The food wasn't interesting, it was really loud, and I just wish it had been a better experience. The ambiance wasn't very nice, although the antique meat slicing machine they have is sort of interesting. I just felt it was disappointing; if my expectations hadn't been so high, I might've enjoyed it more.
