This is one of my favorite Cuban restaurants. The food is excellent and they serve you large portions. If you don't like loud atmospheres, then this is not the place for you. There is loud music always playing but I love the music so it doesn't bother me. The outside area is very cute when the weather is nice. Â IU have also had work parties in the separate room and its been great.
