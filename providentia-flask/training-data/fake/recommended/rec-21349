I love the pizza.  But the wings are hit or miss.  I have only ordered pizza and buffalo wings.  I never purchase sodas from pizza restaurants as they are too expensive.  But all in all the food is great.  Be very specific how you would like your wings cooked. I really like to order mines well done and crispy. Staff are nice I always tip.
