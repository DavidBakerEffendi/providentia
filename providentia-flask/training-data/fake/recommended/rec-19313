Visiting from NYC, you can guess I've definitely got strong opinions about pizza, and, according to the 'Best of Philly', this was the place to go. It did not disappoint. The Parma pizza was incredible, but on top of that, the service may have been the best I've ever experienced. Whoever manages this place should get a prize. Kudos to the whole staff for an incredible evening.
