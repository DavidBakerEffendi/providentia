A very nice little place in Montclair. It's a great way to get away from Jersey so to say it is very tropical. The staff is friendly and their outfits really feels like you are in Cuba. The food is amazing. We had the steak and it's so delicious. My wife had the chicken with coconut rice and it was great!!! Would definitely come back for a romantic dinner outside. Definitely reccomend this place.
