I've been going to this place for two years now. The service has always been great. The food...well I've had better. I kept coming here with my  other half just because it was convenient and the food was ok.  I've had three bad dishes at this place but it wasn't until tonight that i refused to eat what was given to me. 1. meatloaf...came out as burnt slabs of  something that tasted more like bread than meat. 2. Cream of mushroom soup....thick like gravy. horrible 3. Tonight's dish...Veal Piccata. This is the dish i refused to eat due to the thick skin that the sauce had developed and the bland tough veal.  I took one bite ( I should have never done that after having to stir the meat around in the sauce to get rid of the skin)..but i took a bite and it was tasteless. I immediately called over the waiter to let him know when the  tall male " host" cut me off to ask the waiter what I was having. He should have known by looking at it but he didn't. the waiter told him and then the Host proceeded to debate with me why the dish was ok. he couldn't understand what we meant by the sauce having a "skin" and the meat being tasteless. I had to tell him I use to be a chef ..thinking he would understand that I wasn't just a picky complainer. This isn't how veal Piccata should taste! I was pretty much offended at this point and the waiter couldn't believe what was happening. He apologized for the "host's" behavior and tried to right the wrong but i didn't want to order anything else. I either wanted the meal taken off my bill or  i'd pay and never come back again. To compromise the owner gave me a gift card in the amount of the meal ( I guess as a way to force me to come back).  I plan on going back to buy dessert or giving the card away..but i'll never order a meal at this place again.
