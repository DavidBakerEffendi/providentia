Great small restaurant in Hell's Kitchen. The food is very nice. Full of taste. It is a great place even for people who are not used to thai food. On top of that, the service is extremely nice, paying attention to your needs and keeping a warm, welcoming smile. I would definitely recommend it to anyone walking around this area.
