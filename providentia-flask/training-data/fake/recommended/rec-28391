One word: Meh. Brunch menu is less than tantalizing, but we found a couple of things that we thought would be worth trying.  I ordered the biscuits and grits, but asked them to substitute the biscuit for their jalapeño cornbread, because who can resist jalapeño cornbread??    They obliged, but it was an utter disappointment, as the "jalapeño cornbread" turned out to be two tiny pieces, about 1/2 centimeter in thickness and 1 /1/2 inches by 1 1/2 inches in size. WHACK! Everyone else was taken by the Rancherero dish, all much to their disappointment as well.  "Nothing to write home about, that's for sure," is what the BF described it as.  My friend ordered hers w/ scrabbled eggs instead of sunny side up, and she ended up not eating it--in fairness she probably should have been more specific about how she wanted her scrabbled eggs; they were not scrabbled hard, which is what she wanted.  The signature grilled cheese sandwich was quite simply NOT good.  And since the brunch menu leaves much to be desired and the signature grilled cheese wasn't any good, we won't likely be trying this place any other time of day.  The only star on our table was the coffee, but beware, there are no refills; you pay per cup. DOUBLE WHACK!
