The service was sub-par this past Saturday night fo our party of 6. We had a waiter named Paul and he was one of the worst waiters I have ever had. It took 15-20 minutes before we had menus and bread. He was out of the tuna rollatini and when another member of our party ordered it  (not hearing him say he was out he was rude and said as I said before we are out of the tuna) The polentra fries, shrimp and zucchine app ,and ricotta gnocchi were amazing. The seared sea scallops were mushy and not seared at all. Overall food was great but very slow . ALos, I had the tasting sampler before and felt the portions were more generous before the renovation and new menu.  Our dinner took four hours in total ! Of course Paul took forever for the check and earlier in the night never came back with a wine bottle opener !  Thankful for the assistants to the waiter because they were wonderful.  Dissapointed in dining experience !
