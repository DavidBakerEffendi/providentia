Room Service by far exceeds its name. I have fell in love. I planned my birthday dinner here. Room Service is so romantically lit that you can not spot it on 9th Avenue. The soft candlelight will be your guide. As you enter, the decadent elegance of the restaurant embraces you. The staff are well groomed and dressed. As you enter, the bar is at the entrance. The Barmaid provided menus that have CHECK IN engraved elegantly in Gold. Our wait time was 1 hour but after ordering our food came within 10 minutes. Mystical Magic here! We ordered the Curry Puffs and Spare Ribs for appetizers. Each succulent, spiced right and beautifully crafted. We also ordered Thai Iced Teas. I wanted the Lychee Iced Tea which was a piece of paradise! For my main entree I had Lychee Duck which was truly the result of a Foodgasm! Sweet, spicy...all the things you hope for in a good relationship. Our waiters catered to our every need just like a 5 Star Hotel. I had no room for dessert but the menu had SUITES engraved. Whoever created the concept of this restaurant is a Genuis. So tastefully done. I fell in love with the decor each piece in the establishment. Antique mirrors, chandeliers, gold faucets, glass chairs, leather tufted seating. Beautiful! Everything I hoped for. A fairy tale.
