So, I was just in Philly this weekend and decided to try a different cheesteak place other than my regular in North Philly.  When we came up on Geno's we noticed that Pat's was right across the street.  Shame on us for picking Geno's based solely upon the presentation of the venue.  Passing by Pat's looked a lil shabby, but the cheesteaks looked more appealing. The line at Geno's was long,but moved quickly..why? because they were shelling out already made sandwhiches.  The cashier was cool but when the person in front of us pushed the window back to hear the cashier, another coworker snatched the window back closed, which the cashier pushed right back open, THAT WAS RUDE. The steak on the cheesesteak had no flavor, and the only thing that made mine edible was dousing it in the juice from the cherry pepper.   Needless to say before gettting back on the road to VA, we retracked our steps back to NORTH PHILLY, and got a damn good cheesteak!!
