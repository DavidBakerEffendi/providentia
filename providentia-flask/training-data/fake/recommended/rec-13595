A whole bunch of friends raved about this place and talked about the always present line to get into the place so I had high expectations. Maybe my expectations were too high, because I thought the pizza was just okay.  We ordered two different pizzas with red sauce as follows: Pizza #1: Italian sausage, mushrooms and onions Pizza #2: Pepperoni, sundried tomatoes, and garlic I'm glad we ordered two different pizzas; Had I only eaten Pizza #1, I would have been extremely disappointed and would have wondered what's with the line.  It was bland and we had to add salt to the pizza.  Pizza #2 was WAY better.  Despite being full, the four of us devoured Pizza #2 because we didn't want to carry it home and we didn't want to let it go to waste, and we left behind two or three slices of Pizza #1. To be honest though I don't understand the hype.
