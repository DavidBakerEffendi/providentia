It's so fun to say: NAM NAM NAM NAM NAM NAM NAM NAM. It's also a fun way to spend an afternoon, drinking an ice tea, flavored beverage or soda in one of the caf√©'s three tables. There's a selection of magazine and friendly man behind the bar, ready for refills. As for the food, I'm a bun man and it get it 95% of the time I come here. The vermicelli, mixed with mint, hot sauce, flavored pork and crunchy vegetables is the perfect Sunday hangover food. One time I ordered the banh mi which was nice but not in the same league as the bun. It's also a better value, since bun can reach $9 or $10 at other places, while the banh mi is a normal price for the 'hood. Nam Nam learns from its mistakes - its forgettable pho is no longer on the menu. This place opened a block from my house, and I was worried that its somewhat tucked-away location would lead to failure. But in the last two years this place has developed a solid following. There's pretty steady takeout business and the three tables are constantly occupied. One complaint to end this - the delivery minimum is $25. With these prices, that's enough food to feed three or four. Drop that down to $10 (or offer a $1 delivery fee for smaller orders) and I'll double my biweekly visits.
