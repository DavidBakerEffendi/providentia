Apparently, this is a new place that opened in August, so I feel bad giving it a harsh review, but I don't believe in giving out pity stars. The problems started before even getting seated. We asked the host how long a table would be. He said 20 minutes, which is perfectly reasonable. We came back to check in 20 min and now he said it was 30 minutes, without acknowledging the inherent logical fallacy. This was not the last time that night we would be waiting. After finally getting seated, we were attended to by a very nice server, who forgot to bring us water or refill it throughout the night. The food came out in a bizarre order. Soups came out with the main dishes, and appetizers came out 20 minutes after everything else. By the time the edamame reached our table, we had pretty much finished eating everything on the grill and forgot that the edamame was even ordered. I ordered ramen. After everyone had gotten their food (minus the edamame), I was still left meal-less, so I asked a random waitress to check on my food, since our waiter had disappeared. She came back and said that the ramen was on the stove, so it should be RIGHT out. Well, if right out means 15 minutes later, then sure, it came right out. Literally everyone else had finished their meals before my ramen came out. I am 95% sure they completely forgot about my ramen until I mentioned it and then lied to cover it up. I tried to eat the ramen as quickly as possible so as not to hold everyone else up, but it was hot, so I ended up having to take half of it home. As for the grill items, the pork belly was fine. I've had fattier cuts, but this was fine. 5 pieces for $7. The vegetables seem overpriced: $3 for 5 thin slices of zucchini and $3 for two mini cobs of corn. Others in my group tell me the bibimbap and the tuna volcano were good.
