I don't live in New York anymore, but the first place I'm going to visit when I get back is Lamarca for their incredible tomato soup. My family and I have developed a serious crack addiction for it because it is the greatest you will ever have. It's to a point where I was almost a little tweaky when I asked the chef what was in it. Pair this with a ciabatta loaf and their broccoli salad and you can thank me later.
