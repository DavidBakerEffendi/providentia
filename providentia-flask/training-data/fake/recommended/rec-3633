This place not only makes Martha Stewart come out of her home confinement and review the brick chicken on her show (google it), which is their staple dish and is probably one of the best restaurants in Brooklyn. Another plus is that I live right across the street from this joint, and for those who complain it is too far from the station, welcome to my world. It is totally worth the trek. Their menu changes on a weekly/seasonal basis and thank them that they are bringing something original to South Williamsburg. I WILL SUGGEST THAT ANYTHING YOU ORDER WILL SURPASS YOUR EXPECTATIONS. (and yes I am shouting!!!!) One last thing about this place is that during the day it is the best place to buy coffee in the neighborhood. They usually seve coffee and housemade delicious pastries, bagels, and cookies till 4-5ish. The general good store is totally Frenched out with APC jeans, artesian honeys, their published food zine about their mini-empire (Diner, Marlow & Sons, and Marlow & Daughters), and other knickknacks you didn't know you needed. Come for the coffee, stay for the food and some magic from the Marlow & Son!
