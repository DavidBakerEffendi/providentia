I really like the place.  The grilled pork belly is to die for.  Another favorite is the spring rolls (lumpia shanghai).  There really isn't much I have to complain about except for the owner.  I guess I am anti-social when I eat but he can seem a bit intrusive at times.  I am sure he means well but I go there to hang out with my friends.   The food keeps me coming back though.
