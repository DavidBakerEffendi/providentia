I came here for dinner after my son's football game tonight and all I can tell you it was worse than losing the game. Our waitress was indifferent to the point that when we walked out and said goodnight, she didn't look up from her phone to acknowledge us. I regret leaving the $7.00 tip for our pizza and baked clams. The clams were adequate but not great. The pizza was ok, but salty. Â They had too many people walking around, but no customers. It took a long time to get our food. We only ordered a large pepperoni, a kid's pie and an order of baked clams. I definitely do NOT recommend this place!
