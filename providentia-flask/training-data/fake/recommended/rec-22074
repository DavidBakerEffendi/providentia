Nice to finally have a Mexican restaurant in the Maspeth area. Had the steak taco, cheese taco, guacamole as an appetizer and a side of rice and beans. The steak was very tasty and the beans were delicious. The guacamole was good but it had too many tomatoes for me and the rice was a little bland. Â Great portions for the price and they have a bunch of sauces you can add on to your dishes for free. Wait staff was pleasant and attentive. I will definitely be back.
