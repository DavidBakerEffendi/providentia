Great food in a decent ambience! Good location too (right off US1). Reasonably priced (e.g. the entree would serve 2 people or one person for 2 meals)! Our order: 1. Chola-Puri (was listed under appetizer but was reasonably filling!), 2. Gutthi Vankaya (a brinjal gravy which is a specialty from the state of Andhra Pradesh), 3. Chilli paneer (spicy paneer gravy), 4. Naan, 5. Mango Lassi All 5 were very good! Specifically, gutthi vankaya was awesome! The taste was quite authentic! Chilli paneer was spicy and good too! Would definitely visit again and recommend it to anyone who enjoys spicy and good Indian food.
