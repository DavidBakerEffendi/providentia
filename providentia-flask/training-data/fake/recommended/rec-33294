Great spot for dinner, I think we tried just about the entire menu and were not disappointed. Â The service was fast, especially for being packed on a Saturday night. The Paella stood out to me, was cooked to perfection as well as the goat cheese croquettes, so good. Great drinks, wonderful decor, and lively atmosphere, can't wait to go back!
