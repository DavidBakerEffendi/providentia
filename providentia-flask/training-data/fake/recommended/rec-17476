Plenty of good food at the right price. Our appetizer was huge. A trip to the salad bar came with the entrées (which included more than just salad). The entrées were large portions. We ordered the grilled filet mignon and jumbo shrimp, both fantastic. The atmosphere is great, the staff attentive and the location is easily accessible. Very trendy feel to it all.
