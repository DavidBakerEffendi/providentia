Headed here before seeing a show at the TLA. I picked this place based on the Yelp reviews I read and the location being with in walking distance of the venue. First of all, this place is huge. We walked in, went up steps, there are rooms to the right and left and then more steps and another little bar room. That is where we sat. The bartender, Pat, was super awesome and had great sexy hair!! ;-) He was attentive and friendly and offered samples of beer to one of the people I was with. The food was brought out hot as well. I did originally order something that was forgotten about, but it was ok bc it would have been a waste since I was stuffed and couldn't finish what was actually brought out correctly. We ordered the hummus plate. That was fantastic. I loved it. The fresh, warm pita bread was awesome. We ordered mac and cheese, and fried pickles as well. All of that was off the pub menu which was half price! #winning! The other girls got burgers, which they loved. They came with Cavanaughs Sauce. Basically a homemade, spicy bbq sauce. Had lots of kick and was delish! Glad we went!
