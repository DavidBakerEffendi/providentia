I love this bar. It is an amazing place to hang with friends and the patio is awesome in the summer. My only complaint is that it gets very crowded. Like crazy crowded. And then it feels like it is impossible to get a drink. Side note: I have some food allergies and they were very accommodating. I really appreciate it when places know what is in their food.
