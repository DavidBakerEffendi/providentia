Visited on 9/3 & was disappointed, not quite as good as in the past. Olive bread was stale. Stuffed meatballs app, was good as always. Chilean Sea Bass which was very small. (less then the size of a dollar folded in half) Sesame crusted AHI Tuna was also a very small portion. Mashed potatoes seemed dried out. Will make a return visit becuase we like the ambience of the place. Hopefully was just an off night??!!!
