I expected a great brunch from this slightly inconspicuous eatery, and the food exceeded my expectation. It was home for the hungry.  A quaint, friendly home with just enough elbow space to avoid tipping your neighbor's plate from the table.  I had a spinach and tomato omelet that was really good and came with a side of potato salad and greens.  It was good.
