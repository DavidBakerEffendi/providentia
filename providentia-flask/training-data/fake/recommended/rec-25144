It's amazing. My favorite mexican place in NYC. I hate to say this, but I'm from LA and have a picky palette -- it's still no LA joint but it's amazing in its own way. Order anything. It's all spectacular. But I always go with chips and guac and a cheese quesadilla. If u order in, get the nachos (the portion size is bigger in the restaurant than to go). They've screwed up my delivery order once but I don't even care!!!
