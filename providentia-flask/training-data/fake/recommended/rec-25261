Went here on a whim for a weeknight dinner out. Since moving here, I've been looking for a well priced, simple, delicious italian place for me to frequent. Although I live on the East side, this could very well be a viable option in the future. The ambiance is nice, although the place is pretty small. Â I enjoyed sitting out back in their covered and heated garden. The service was attentive, friendly and quick. Food was totally fine. I ordered an apple, tomato and goat cheese salad to start, with a zucchini angel hair pasta dish for the main course. Aside from too soft apples and too few tomatoes, the salad tasted fine. The pasta was more flavorful than I expected - I would recommend to a friend. The carafe of house wine for $23 was a good deal too! Overall, I was pleased. I could see myself taking my parents here when they visit!
