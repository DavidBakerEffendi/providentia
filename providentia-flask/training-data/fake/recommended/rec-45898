Pro: Great ambiance and decor, most tapas are tasty, good location, outdoor seating. Cons: Poor and pushy service, shrunken menu, overpriced. This place changed for the worst. I went here a few times in the past and the prices for tapas were reasonable, and nice selection. However, I just stopped in recently for a quick bite and the menu is a lot different, some items are still there but the PRICES ARE JACKED UP! I was puzzled so I asked the server if the menu has changed and she confirmed it. I also brought up the markup in prices and she explained that the portions are larger, however, I ordered some of the same menu items as I did in the past (croquetas, meat and cheese platter and Spanish tortilla and I don't see a difference in portion sizes. Their entree menu has also shrunk in options and also seem marked up from the last time I was there. Server kept pressuring us to buy a dessert more than once. (What part of NO do they not understand?) Overall disappointed, VIVO's service was never the best but they offered tasty food at a competitive price vs comparable Iberian restaurants in the area. In the past I'd recommend this place do to the cheap tapas and ambiance/deco but now, their service is still the same, less options in the menu but with highjacked prices! If you're going to spend this kind of money, you're better off going to Mompou, Casa Vasca or Fornos. The service at those 3 places alone is worth the money.
