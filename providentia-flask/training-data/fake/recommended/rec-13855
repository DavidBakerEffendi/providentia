Okay...I would give this place 4 stars for the food because it was delicious.  The pancakes were fluffy, tasty and topped pretty well.  I had the banana walnut version.  My other half ordered the country breakfast.  That came with a really juicy slice of ham with the most scrumptious hash i ever had.   Why the 3 stars you ask...THEY CHARGED $2 for extra maple syrup.  Fine..i understand it's house made, but give me enough to drench my pancakes in.  =) Plus, there was a 2 hour wait and apparently this is the case every weekend.  I will say that it was worth waiting for...just once.
