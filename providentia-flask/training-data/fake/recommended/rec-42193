I had a terrible experience.  I invited out of town guests and was raving to them about the food.   My friend dipped into the dessert and thought it tasted strange, so he flipped over the spoon only to see it was completely soiled.  We promptly alerted the manager. He said we were the 3rd table to complain about the silverwave.  It seemed they over loaded the dishwasher and the one dessert we ordered would be on the house.  My friend was tramatized.  I was embarrased.  Cleaniless is a basic expectation and this restaurant did not appear to take it seriously.
