Looking for something quick and cheap but not fast food...go to Woorijip. Many selections under this one roof...small or big portions...you decide.   Tried the packaged spicy rice cakes and honey chicken - both decent for packaged food. Didn't try the buffet line items (wasn't open for dinner time, yet).  Funny seeing the workers ward off people from trying to get into the buffet items as they're setting up. Also, cool that the place sells wine, beer and soju to go with your meal.
