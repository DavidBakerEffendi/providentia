Do it. Great place to take friends or a casual date. Nice and cozy decor, relaxed vibe, tasty food, and surprisingly inexpensive considering the portion sizes. If you live in the area (as I do), this will definitely be one of your go-to neighborhood spots. I recommend the chicken empanadas as an appetizer. Great flavor, nice size, and only $2! As far as the rest of the menu, I've eaten here on several occasions and ordered something different each time...I've yet to be disappointed :)
