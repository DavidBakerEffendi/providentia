Pretty disappointing both times i went.  on my first visit, i had very bland fish tacos (though the club sandwich my friend had was pretty tasty).  Our server didn't check back on us after our food arrived, and it wasn't until i called her over to ask about the brussels sprouts we ordered that she realized she forgot to put them in.   They weren't great when they finally showed up (comped), seasoned with mustard and soy sauce.   I returned for breakfast... service was fantastic this time, but the hash browns lacked any sort of crispness.  Breakfast sandwich was ok with well peppered eggs. I dunno... i really want to like this place, Life used to be a staple until it started to go downhill about a year ago...  but.... Meh.  I've experienced better.
