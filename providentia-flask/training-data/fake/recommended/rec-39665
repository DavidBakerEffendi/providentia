BRUNCH. yes, brunch is where it's at, at this particular joint. And, Arepas Benedictos, is where i shall reside! Poached eggs on white corn cakes w/ smoked salmon or serrano ham. Topped w/ Hollandaise. Holy Mother! It's at first really difficult to admit loving this plate of food - mostly because this little spot use to be Lechko's back in the day, before the Lower East Side was hip, and when you could still get eggs, toast, potatoes, orange juice and coffee for under $5 bucks. BUT I love this eggs benedict and I will return for it on ocassion, because it is DELICIOUS.
