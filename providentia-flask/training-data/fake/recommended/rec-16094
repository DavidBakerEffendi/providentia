Oh the bread! The endless fresh hot bread! The perfect utensil to scoop up the incredible hummus. Possibly the best hummus in NY. And yes I know how bold a statement that is. The place is great all around. Everything on the menu is awesome but it's really just the mezze's you go for. Prices are fair, portions are good, decor is comfortable and service solicitous. Only negative is the wine list; its not very deep and a bit pricey for what there is. Large with two floors of seating and many outdoor tables.  THe bar is tiny.  Always crowded on Thurs-Sat nights so reservation at prime time are a must or risk waiting up to an hour in the street. Its the perfect take out food for any of the concerts in the park.
