had a mediocre brunch here.  wanted to go because it was such a nice day and  could sit outdoors.  they also had some live music which seemed nice.  so we get there and there are 3-4 empty tables outside.  we check in with the host, who explains to us that there were no more outside "server" tables available.  meaning that we could order from the cafe menu and and take our food outside, but couldn't get brunch because those tables weren't designated for servers.  HUNH? it seemed stupid but we were hungry so we settled for seats in the back room. the back room decor is lacking with its nearly bare walls.  the ugly rugs looked like they hadn't been vacuumed in months.  dustbunnies in the corners. the service was polite but pretty bad- we waited at LEAST 35min to get our food.  and it's not like the place was crowded, or we were a large party or ordered anything elaborate. i had the eggs benedict, husband had pancakes.  my food was actually pretty good.  my husband's panckaes were terrible.  chewy like an old sponge.  served with a packet of syrup (kind of like what you get at burger king or on an airplane).   the bottom line is i think this is a place with a great location and a lot of potential.  i WANT them to succeed.  but i could see them not lasting long if the management doesn't clean up their act.  how? better service, creative decor, thoughtful presentation (just give me the BOTTLE of maple syrup for pete's sake), and a common sense seating policy for starters.  i'm sure this place is fine as a grab and go type cafe but not worth the time for a sit down meal. i'm really rooting for them and hope they make it better.
