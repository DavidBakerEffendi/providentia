From yelp recommendations I decided to come here during some work I was doing at the Public Library. From the library it's a nice walk and if you have your eyes open you can't miss Graso's. I got the Graso Reuben and it does not disappoint! Everything about this sandwich is good; from the roll to the coke slaw to the sauce. The bread isn't soggy and it's temperature is perfect. So glad I found this place, I will definitely be coming back in the future.
