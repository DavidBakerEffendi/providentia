I love this place! I came here for Sunday Brunch with my boyfriend.  It was his first time in NYC that weekend :-) before he moves here.  We arrived in the nick of time to get brunch and had to sit at the bar.  We were excited to eat here, especially b/c of the pumpkin pancakes on the menu.  My BF's eyes danced like old cartoon characters at the sound of eating them and enjoyed every moment. I had an omelette dish with feta cheese that was divine.  The placed served up great food, a romantic, rustic atmosphere and a start to a great Sunday.
