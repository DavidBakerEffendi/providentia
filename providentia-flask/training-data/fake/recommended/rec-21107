The Sub-Way is a local pizza place. It has nothing to do with the chain Subway (which has a franchise at the gas station down by the interstate). It is quite popular, but I do not know why. The sauce tastes canned, the cheese tastes cheap, and the crust is rubbery. It is cheap, but not cheap enough for me to keep eating there.
