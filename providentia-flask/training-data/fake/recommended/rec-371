I really like this place, it has a very casual and homey feel inside. My friends and I were seated at a table for 8, near the flamenco area (which I'll get to later!). Decor and service were great, so I don't have any complaints about that. We tried both the mango sangria and the blueberry champagne sangria; both were great. Not heavy on the alcohol side, and the fruitiness definitely came through. The tapas were great. Recommendations from our list were the chorizo a la plancha, gambas al ajillo, albondiguillas estofadas, and any of the croquettes. All of the food was pretty good, but prepared to order at least 2 or 3 plates per person; this is a tapas restaurant after all. The real reason we came on this Thursday was for the flamenco. It was a lot of fun to watch, mesmerizing at times with great music. It's definitely not an experience you can normally get. All in all, it's a fun place to go if you're in the mood for tapas, and definitely one of the better tapas restaurants I've been to. They don't have traditional jamon iberico, however, which is something I always look for at a tapas place, but otherwise, it's certainly good, and cheaper than many other tapas places out there.
