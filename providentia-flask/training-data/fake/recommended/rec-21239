Great tortas, and service.  The brunch special was a steal.  Bottomless drinking for an hour and a half.  Our waiter was very good and kept the booze flowing.  Only complaint was they didn't give you the last call warning when your hour and a half was up.  Guacamole was great with a side of tortilla chips AND mini warm tortilla wraps.  The enchilada suiza wasn't a red sauce but a little bit tangy, still very good with pulled chicken meat that was not sketchy.
