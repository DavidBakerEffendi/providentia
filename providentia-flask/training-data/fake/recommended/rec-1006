Great taste, less filling. Yeah, it's pretty darn good, but when you compare what you get for $9.50 to what you get for the same or less at other places, you feel kinda cheated. Perhaps you even feel like going directly to Geno's across the corner because you're still hungry, like I was after I went here. Go ahead and go here just to say that you did it, but be warned that it's kind of a tourist trap. Good, but overrated.
