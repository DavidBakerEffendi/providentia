We showed up as a party of 9 without reservations on a Saturday night. (normally a disaster, right? not here!)  They were amazing at accommodating us quickly & efficiently.  The food was amazing and everyone enjoyed the evening.  Since we were 9 individual women with completely different drinking habits, we begged them to separate our bills - they did this too!  Amazing service and fantastic food!  Thank you!
