Good food, attentive service, generous portions, good prices. The vegetable samosas were fresh. The Motor Pinir was creamy and delicious, the Aloo Gobi was mouth watering and flavorful. The naan was exemplary, and my dining companions' dishes (chicken tikka masala and Dal Makhani) were also fabulous. The place is tiny and the location is not great, but everything else is stellar.
