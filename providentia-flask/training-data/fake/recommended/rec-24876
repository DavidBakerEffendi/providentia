I was really looking for something special with the reviews. However, I just did not taste it in my slice. I had a plain slice while my wife tried the slice with fresh tomato's. Hers was definitely the better choice. I will give it another shot but it wasn't all that. Not bad mind you just not above anything else that you can get around here. Certainly not better than Vince's or Charlies in the Northeast. Or Tony's for that matter. Service was prompt and friendly.
