I heard this place was better than Jim's and of course with a shorter queue I thought I'd try it one day. I would give it a 2.5. I ordered a cheeseteak with provolone. There was absolutely nothing special about it. I'm not a huge fan of Jim's but I'd rather wait in line. I'm a Chink's, Steve's Prince of Steaks, Max's Steaks kind of guy. I like the real ones. This place reminded me of high school lunch cheesesteak. Sorry.
