I came here around 2-3pm on a weekday.  There are stairs down to the restaurant.  There were three people in front of us, but the party before my date and I was not all there.  Totto will  not seat you unless your whole party is present.  Totto is literally a hole in the wall.  It is tiny and quaint.  Totto was worth the trip.  My boyfriend and I both ordered the spicy ramen with pork.  The broth was flavorful and spicy.  Seaweed paper was included, which was a nice touch in texture.  We also ordered the ginger chicken bowl special of the day.  Everything was tasty and freshly made.  The place is small and rather hot due to the broiling ramen water.   Tips: Cash only, write you name down on a clipboard, have all of your party present to get seated quickly.
