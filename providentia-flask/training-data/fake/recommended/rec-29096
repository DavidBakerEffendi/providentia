Food was delicious and presented with all manner of nice little touches (a small glasss vial of tomato sauce served with the mac and cheese). Cool shabby chic decor, with a nice bassy background music beat. No beer on tap at all, just 4 varieties of bottles. Relatively pricey for what you actually get, but well worth the occasional trip. I need to return to delve deeper into the "dessert" aspect of this place, because we came here for dinner. Very high quality chocolate in the fondue. B+
