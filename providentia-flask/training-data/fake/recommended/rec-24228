The breakfast menu is great, very diverse and a few good surprises.  Everything we've had tastes fantastic and the service has always been nice - they check up on ya' several times without being in your face.  They also don't skimp on the portions.  The only thing that keeps it from being 5 stars is the food comes out fast, but it's never really hot.
