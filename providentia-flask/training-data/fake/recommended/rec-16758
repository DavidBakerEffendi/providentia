Squid ink pasta was amazing! Tomato cream sauce was fantastic - it a actually tasted like a real tomato cream sauce not a cream sauce with tomato. Homemade tiramisu was delicious! Right amount of coffee and cream. Restaurant itself was a bit claustrophobic, but hey it's NYC. Â Staff was super nice, and I ended up getting the squid ink pasta based on our server's recommendation. I'll totally come back here next time I'm in the city!
