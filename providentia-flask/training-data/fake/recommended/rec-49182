Couldn't be happier with the service, food, atmosphere, or pricing. The pork hock was unbelievably good. The hostess with the mostess did her best to seat us super promptly during Saturday primetime dining, and then also helped accomodate or seating preference (next to each other, so we could catch up). I'd pass next time on the caramel pudding, but the Wilamette Valley pinot was fairly priced and did the trick for the whole meal. Good job, Joseph Leonard.
