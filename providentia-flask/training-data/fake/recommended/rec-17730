Had a wonderful dinner for two last night. The place was packed, so we were glad we had a reservation on a busy Saturday night. They took us right away. We split the antipasto salad. It was delicious, but the tuna described on the menu was missing. The bread was absolutely scrumptious & we loved it. My friend had delicious veal...two very large slices very tender. I had the pencil points & Sunday gravy. Huge portion & fabulous! My only criticism is that it seemed they just didn't have enough staff. My waiter was constantly clearing and setting up other tables, so he wasn't as attentive as I would have liked. Many of the tables converted to larger setups & throughout the evening they were remaking tables for 4 to tables for 8 or more. I almost felt like I was behind the scenes of a stage show watching the sets being moved around. It was distracting from a very lovely room. I'll definitely be back...maybe not on a Saturday night, though.
