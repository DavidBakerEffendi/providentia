When we got there after ball drop, this place was extremely crowded with lot of waiting people. Waited about 20min to be seated on the table, and a waitress came to take our order. She told us seafood, mix, or dumpling tofu soup those are most popular, also asked how spicy level we want to make it each of our tofu soups. She was attentive and took our table carefully with fully explanation, why our food was getting delayed in kitchen, New Year's Eve night, not a big problem. Tofu soup was so great and rice came together. Refilled all side dishes, water and foods were enjoyable. Definitely loving this new place, price also was not bad to compare with other korean restaurant around the street, even cheaper. Highly recommended place to try it
