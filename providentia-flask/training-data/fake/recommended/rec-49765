Soooo good! My family is from Thailand and I've never been able to find Khao Man Kai in the city--and there's is great! They're thai iced tea is fresh, made with condensed milk and amazing! They're larb, pad ka naa, pad thai, pad see ew, and som tum are all very good also. Definitely come here if you want more authentic thai food on 9th ave.
