After driving by this place on the way to Fairway for MONTHS, it's FINALLY open!!! Yay!!! I really want this place to make it, I really do . I loved most everything about it. The space is great and the laid back atmosphere makes it really feel like a Texas bbq joint. Great bar, excellent beers on tap. When we arrived there was a long line that was barely moving so we went to Fairway to do some grocery shopping. We decided to give Hometown another shot so we went back after.  There was still a slow moving line but we stuck it out this time.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. When we finally did place our order it was expedited quickly. The food was a little disappointing, it pains me to say. There was nothing special about the ribs or any of the sides. Hopefully they are still fine tuning the recipes. Maybe more spice on the babybacks?   The things we DID love were the chicken and the Hometown sauce.  So so good! Advice for the (awesome) staff-- be more consistent and speed things up a bit! We'll definitely be coming back soon!!!
