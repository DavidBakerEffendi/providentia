I came here for a rather late lunch and avoided the wait on a Saturday.  My group shared the melt-in-your-mouth pork buns and duck over rice with scallion pancake on the side.  Both were super flavorful. Their white rice was the best I've ever had.  The flavor and texture of it was heavenly. They also have some good beer selections.  It is a tight squeeze in there so be prepared for an up close and personal dining experience.
