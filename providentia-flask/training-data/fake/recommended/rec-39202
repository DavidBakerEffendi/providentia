One worse Deli I ever been to. How can you mess up a ham salami and cheese sandwhich. Place was empty & hey took 15 minutes and forget to add mayo. They bring out the mayo in a cup no knife or utensils to put on.They had no fresh rolls it was tough to chew on. Cold cuts were not fresh and charge to get cheese on your sandwich. I ordered a side of french fries and they did not serve it until I was done with my sandwhish in which i was full. Then my husband decides to take the left overs his half of sandwhich and fries and they only give him half of the sandwhich. I could have gone to Subways and had better food and service.
