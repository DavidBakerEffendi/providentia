Firstly, love the decor of this place. It feels as if you've been whisked out of Hell's Kitchen to some flashy room with chandeliers, grey walls... a little bit like a club, but not really. I love it. The bad part was that I had no made a reservation and the waiter told me to wait for a few minutes. Apparently, a few minutes means 20 minutes. What made it worst was that they gave the people to a bunch of people who came LATER than me and that made me really mad. Of course I complained right away but it was no use. Anyways, I FINALLY got my table and the prices on the menu were reasonable. About $10-$16 for a main dish. As someone who can't eat spicy... I barely use black pepper... I ordered the ginger thai dish. I had chicken and veg in ginger sauce, it was good, although it tasted more lik a Chinese dish than a Thai dish.
