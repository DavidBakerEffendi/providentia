MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN NYC!!! 1. Great food, with nice presentation 2. Great atmosphere/love the decor 3. Great prices I came here two nights in a row, and of course one of those nights would be my last night in NYC. Drink: Thai iced tea was good- great balance of tea and sweetness. Most places overly sweetened the drink to where you can barely taste the tea anymore, but Room Service did a great job with the balance. Appetizers: Chicken Satay was good- the peanut sauce is already on the chicken, and the dish is presented with the skewers standing up on a block of cucumber. Tuna tar tar tasted AMAZING- a popular MUST HAVE appetizer- the menu said it has wasabi in it, so I was a bit hesitant. I ordered it anyways, and love it- there is a tiny hint of wasabi but it's not very subtle so it tasted great, and the tuna was fresh. Entree: Pad-See-Eu: Â I absolutely LOVE IT (with tofu and then with chicken)!!
