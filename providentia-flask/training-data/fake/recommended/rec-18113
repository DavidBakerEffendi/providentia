Ok. So, it took nearly an hour to get a table, but I'm still giving El Vez 5 stars. Service is on point, the margaritas are amazeballs, and the food is freakin' delicious. I had a frozen blood orange margarita at the bar while waiting for a table, my friend had a pineapple canella. Both super tequila-y and super delicious and fresh. The Cesar Chavez guacamole is ridiculous, it had some sort of magical balsamic-chile sauce on it. Even the chips and salsa are delicious. I had sea bass tacos (with sweet potato puree, scallions, fried jalapenos), and I strongly suggest that you stop what you're doing and go eat them right this second. Friend had shrimp enchiladas and said they were yum. It was my friend's birthday, they brought out churros with a birthday candle. Super nice and super delicious.
