You can tell that this is a place that takes pride in their food. Everything was delicious. They brought a roll for each person which was hot from the oven and very good. Make sure you get the pretzel with the beer cheese. Holy crap that was good. For the entree we got the buttermilk fried chicken. It was very good. Great selection of beer. Wasn't my favorite place in the world but it had good food at decent prices. This is a solid place. PS make reservations, apparently this place was just on diners dives and drive ins so its a little busy.
