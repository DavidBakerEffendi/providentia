Portion size is good. The hummus and yogurt are very tasty. Although there are some gems, for the cost of the food, I was expecting much better and tastier food altogether. The fish was dry, even burnt, and although we asked for it to be deboned, I had a mouthful every time. It was too dark for me to find the bones. Â Never got to enjoy that dish. The lamb was good but the street meat version I get for $5 is tastier. Although the place is busy you can still hear yourself and can have good conversation. Our wait staff was informative and attentive.
