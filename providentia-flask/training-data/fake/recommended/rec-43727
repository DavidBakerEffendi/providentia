He may be the original Top Chef, but Perilla isn't the top of anything. Except maybe "the most overhyped restaurants in Manhattan" list. My expectations were admittedly high, but the place just didn't measure up on this Wednesday night. A few pieces of the meal were champion quality, but too many major players were Vanderbilt-esque flops to merit any more than 2 stars. After waiting 20 minutes for our table despite a reservation, we were exceptionally hungry (a strategic move to cover up for the food to come? Or simply poor service?). Regardless, we started with the Perilla 75 and Cherry-Lime Gimlet cocktails--both very good. Now famished, AND slightly tipsy, we were primed to like the next dishes. And indeed we did. The venison sausage and faro risotto were excellent starters. But from here on out, the meal was downhill.The roasted duck breast entree seemed like it was going to be great, but it turned out to be a culinary mirage. All the individual flavors were good. The texture was great. But there was an overpowering sweetness that destroyed the dish. Simply cloying, without a savory balance. The hanger steak entree was an impressively heaping portion, but lacked a well-developed meatiness. A perfect dish for a lumberjack who's lost his taste buds. It was a disappointing case of where excessive quantity could not make up for diminutive quality. Overall, DIeterle's newer Kin Shop is far better. Go there if you only choose one.
