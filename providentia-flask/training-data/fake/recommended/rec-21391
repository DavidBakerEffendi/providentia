Favorite place for a margarita in the whole city! Happy hour is great. Half off pitchers and trust me you only need one. The chips and salsa are only $1! Can't beat it. The staff is super friendly. Perfect area next to the Piazza with outdoor seating. If you want a place to grab drinks after work or on the weekend, this is the place! Great place for both Mexican and BBQ. If you're in Philly, don't miss this place!
