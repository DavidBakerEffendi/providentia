Cool place. But food is overpriced and flavours are honestly nothing special :(. Place can get really busy but at least they call you on your mobile when your table is ready. Don't get that very often! Just not enough flavour or wow in the food selection. Does present itself as a hagi bar well though. Been 4 times now haven't felt compelled to go back since. Not unless a friend visits from out of town and describes a craving for 'Japanese tapas'. The place is definitely not boring though - hence the 3 stars. It has a vibe that is at least happening and popular if that's how you like to dine - and I do :) But I love food and flavour first and foremost - and I always leave the place feeling wanting. Try it you haven't. Worth it for first timers and I'll let you be the judge as a returning customer. * Busy and happening after work * Food is not bargain-basement so don't rock up looking to stuff your face on a budget. So be prepared to live a little. * Nothing is a 'wow' on the menu. I've tried almost all the dishes. Some are good - nothing is worth returning for * Sake selection is good * Can get busy - but they will call you on your mobile when your seat is ready. Winning! * Service is friendly, not the most efficient (as a couple times I've had to wait for dishes longer than expected when it was busy), but can't complain either!
