when it comes to weekend breakfast, htis is your place.... everything about this place is perfect from the service to the food, to the decor and coziness the menu is full of choices and is really really inexpensive... there was a line down the block, that I thought was way too cold to wait in... however after my meal and when i saw they were offering coffee and light fare to those in line ...... I would agree to the wait! I had pancakes and a side of beef sausage with lemon juice squeezed on top......so delicious.... the staff was very attentive milkshakes and malts looked delicous too! it is easy to see why this place is a hit and an easy favorite!!!
