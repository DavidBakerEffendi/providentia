THE HYPE WAS JUSTIFIED. I've been wanting to go to this restaurant for the absolute longest and tackled it last night. When we arrived the amount of people waiting (hella folks) did not scare me off.  The wait for this packed house didn't end up being too bad.   When we were finally seated (and I wrapped my head around their extensive menu) we started off with the Mango mojito and chicken/veggie eggrolls. The mojito was delish. Fresh and packed a punch. The egg rolls were more like spring rolls. Those were tasty but nothing to omg about.   Now my entree: Red curry w/shrimp and a side of brown rice. I don't even like Asian curry, but decided to take a walk on the wild side since I've been told this place is the best. The couple next to our table ordered the sour curry and didn't like it so that made me extremely nervous. The final verdict Delish! I am officially a fan.  The other places I've been to just aren't up to par with their versions. Lastly, everything was going well, their service was mediocre which I expected (thanks yelp!) and then this happened. Our waitress comes back and grabs the remaining tip. She then had the audicity to put her tip back on the table and "suggest" (I use the term very loosely) that we tip her at a higher percentage and walks away. Um, excuse me???!! I was so tempted to place my money back in my wallet and my girl friend was ready to tell her about herself. We chose to just leave as oppose to showing out. There is a way to speak to paying customers when your disappointed. Her chosen method was quite patronizing. Now had she spoken to us in a different manor I wouldn't hesitate to give more simply because the food outweighted the service.   I'd definitely come again,  but will never forget my first experience here.
