It's hard to comprehend the difference from a hand-pumped beer and a normal draught beer. We stopped here and they had a sly fox IPA hand pumped. I don't even care for IPAs but it was full and creamy and utterly delicious. We used it to wash down 2 orders of poutine - I could have eaten more. It's the best plate of heart attack you will ever have. Highly recommended.
