While my entr√©e was very good but not spectacular, the bread for the table and the olive oil with garlic were very tasty. Also, the very nice owner gave our table free bruschetta and tiramisu and chocolate cake! The desserts were absolutely delicious, and the service was great. I strongly recommend this restaurant!
