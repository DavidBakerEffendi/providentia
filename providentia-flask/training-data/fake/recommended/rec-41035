I've been here a few times. Employees are nice.. Although one time a waiter did not check to see the correct tip amount on a bill my friend and I split. I covered the tip as my order was more expensive and the waiter ended up keying in an even tip amount for both my friend and I. Very surprised. Though I still like this gastropub. Great atmosphere! Food is pretty good. I tried the steak frites and it was divine. Cider they have is Crispin and it comes in an elegant tall glass. It's not too loud which I really like. Will def be back.
