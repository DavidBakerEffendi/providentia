Great selection of beer on tap, including Leffe Blond, which helped soften the blow of Vol de Nuit being closed the night we were supposed to have a birthday party there (some big electrical problems we were told). They also have a great bottled beer selection, including Chimay. There are some big wooden benches in the back room, one of them super long, which was good for our big group. As the night wore on the crowd towards the front of the bar wasn't really my thing, but the back stayed pretty cool. As others have said, the food is just ok, but they do have a decent selection of pub food.. chicken pot pie, veggie pot pie, pizza, fries etc. The night we were there they were out of just about everything, which pretty much sucked since I was bent on having frites and mussels and ended up with a veggie pot pie. All in all, a good NYC pub though.
