I heard about this place online and met a friend for a quick sunday brunch/cup of joe today. Best Panini I've ever had the luck of meeting on a sunday...Crunchy, salty, with a touch of sweetness and a healthy portion of cheese (mmmm ham and cheese on ciabatta) Not only was the french chef/owner extremely personable, everyone working there was warm and engaging. Â Pleasant waitresses are an added plus to quick service and good food. Good vibe and will definitely come back again. Brooklyn stoops. Five stars.
