After moving from Texas a few years ago, I have been scouring the city for good Mexican food. Usually the versions that cross my lips are gentrified tacos and bland burritos, until now. De Mole makes great food typical of the northern states of Mexico. All of the food was fresh, tasty and extremely well prepared. Tamales were a good balance of masa and filling, the taco's are perfect size full of great fillings, the quesadillas are a fantstic "fried taco" version typical of central Mexico. Get yourself to this tiny little establishment and you will be happy.
