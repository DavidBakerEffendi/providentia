This place is true to its Yelp rating! This is a really cute place at the end of an alley way. We ordered an artichoke dip, pancake and white egg omelette and they are all so good! I really recommend the buttermilk pancake with strawberry rhubarb compote! The jam is a little sour but it goes really well with the maple syrup. I typically can't finish all of my pancake dish, but I finished all of them this time. Yes! It's that good!
