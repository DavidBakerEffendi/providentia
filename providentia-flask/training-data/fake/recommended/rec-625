This place is adorable. I tried it out for a weekday breakfast with a friend who was staying in that area. The coffee was delicious (served in a random thrift store-like mug) and the pumpkin waffles were pretty good too. We stayed for awhile, which I think bothered the server. I understand as I used to wait tables, but the place was almost empty and its not like it was an end-of-shift time of day. I'd love to go back for brunch where there seems to be a bigger menu.
