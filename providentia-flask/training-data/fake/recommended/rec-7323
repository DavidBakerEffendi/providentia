All you need to know is TROFIE NERO. I came here on a summer day in 2012 for my cousin's graduation celebration. We had a private room in the back and the service was excellent, though I expected nothing less. I think we had about 5 courses, but really the only one I remember till this very day is the delicious, heavenly, mouth-watering black squid ink pasta, called Trofie Nero. Admittedly from time to time, I dream about this pasta. I am way overdue for my 2nd visit...
