I am not what any of the previous posters have described as a "Hipster" or a "Yuppie," and my family has dined here numerous times in the summer and the fall. The atmosphere at PYT is great, there is outside seating if you do not want the kids around the bar. You can watch the Phillies and Eagles play on the big screen, or enjoy live entertainment on stage at the Piazza. The service has been just like any other place, if it is crowded then there is a wait. After that I adore the fact that even though it is a small space you are not rushed to eat your food, and are checked on regularly. The way the staff dresses has nothing to do with the quality of food and there is a host podium you can wait at to be seated, and if you are going to the bar the atmosphere is welcoming. Inside seating you are treated to the sounds of local DJ's during the week and on the weekends. The food is original and good I love the PYT burger and chicken sandwich, the Onion Rings are glorious, and milk shakes are thick and creamy. My husband has had the double and the triple burger and always clears his plate. Thank you Tommy for providing us with a great place to dine at anytime.
