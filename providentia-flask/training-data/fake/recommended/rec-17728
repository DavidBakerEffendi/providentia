Love this place... Actually there are two.   Ewing and Hamilton location.   Great authentic food at super prices.   We like the one in Hamilton for dining in.   The pork tacos are awesome and the beans and rice are the best around!   The guacamole is good but sometimes a bit salty for my taste.  If you like Mexican food you will not be disappointed.
