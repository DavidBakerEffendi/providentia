a great little gem of a place. all of the food is great! (except for this terrible bread pudding dessert. stay away. they were cool about it and took it off the tab. it was inedible) its not a real kitchen so order your food accordingly. meaning stick with cheese, charcuterie and sandwiches. the wine list is extensive and well priced. service is usually pretty neutral although my one complaint is that the servers/bartender never really seem all that knowledgeable about wine. the only person in the place that seems to know anything is this older gentleman who i assume is the owner. its fine to have an attractive wait staff but shouldn't they be tasting and learning about the wines? i say this only because i've waited tables/worked in restaurants and its important. there's not much food to know about so can't the servers at least learn about the wines?
