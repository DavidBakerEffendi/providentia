My friend and I finished our dinner in 10 minutes but waited for exactly 43 minutes after we placed the order (According to my check-in history). There were 4 sushi chiefs at the sushi bar but it still took so long. I had Sleeping Volcano roll and Rolling Fire roll (See picture). The sushi tasted good but not worth for waiting so long.
