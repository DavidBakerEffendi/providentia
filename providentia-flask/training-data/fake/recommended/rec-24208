Let me preface this with I've been to a lot of the brunch spots in Philly -  honey sit n eat,  green eggs,  Sabrinas cafe,  cafe lift,  and breakfast boutique. They all offer something a little different and its hard to impress me because I tend to be a picky eater.  However,  Cafe La Maude takes the cake in terms of freshness of food and quality of service. When you enter, its got a definite cozy European cafe feel to it.  Parking is sparse but by chance we ran into the owner who was so sweet and offered us a spot nearby.  He even dropped by later at our table inquired where we were from and how we heard about his place.  My friends and I all respectively enjoyed our meals and the serving size was pretty large.  Come with a hungry appetite :) I only wish this was closer to Elkins park because this is my favorite brunch location in Philly!
