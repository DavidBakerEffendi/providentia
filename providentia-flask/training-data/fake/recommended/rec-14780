If you're craving fresh oysters in University City, this is the place to go. The buck-a-shuck (raw) oysters during happy hour are fresh, although I can only handle three or four before moving on. They have a decent selection of "normal" seafood, like lobster, salmon, scallops, and the usual burgers and salads. Personally I'm a fan of the mahi-mahi tacos. The decor of the place is impressive -- one of the rooms upstairs is decked out in Penn paraphernalia, one of the back rooms has large windows opening out into Sansom Row, which looks cool around sunset/early evening, and the bar area is dark and, dare we say, a bit intimate? OK, maybe not, but it still looks cool. Â I probably wouldn't come here on a regular basis for dinner, since it is a bit on the pricey side, but the service is friendly and the experience is pleasant overall. Definitely a good place to bring a guest (or a date) if you don't want to venture to Center City!
