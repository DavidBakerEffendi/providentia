Sure, it's really packed, but they are fast...When I ordered and asked for yellow rice, they informed that it would take 5 minutes and asked if that was OK...I mean, not really going to complain about waiting 5 min for food (which is more than you will wait for the rest of your meal).  Quick service makes a hungry dude like me happy. Haven't tried the sandwiches yet, but the spicy grilled chicken meal and the breaded chicken are both amazing.  Only thing is I kinda wish the spicy chicken was a little spicier..but other than that - absolutely delicious.. Empanadas with the green sauce are also a must.. Not a place to bring a date or anything (although I probably would because it's alot of food and it's cheap), but just a great lunch place that will fill you up for the rest of the day
