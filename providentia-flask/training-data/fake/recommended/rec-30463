What a delicious brunch.  This place is super tiny so the wait (especially for a party larger than 4) was super long, but worth it.  They have great coffee and espresso drinks and the vegetable quiche was amazing-- balanced flavor, buttery crust, and served with a simple green salad.  Our 2 male companions ordered burgers for brunch and although I didn't sample those they both finished them so they must have been good.  Let's talk about the fries though.  Crispy rosemary infused fries.  Unbelievable.  I want to eat them with every meal.  We finished brunch with a slice of the much raved about peanut butter pie with 5 spoons.  Even if you don't think you have room you should order it.  Trust me. I'd definitely come back here again-- a really delicious and non-pretentious brunch.  Just how I like it.  Remember that it's cash only and BYOB (in case you'd like a mimosa)!
