I came here a while back with a friend of mine and my girlfriend my friend was very close with the staff so out service was nothing short then perfect! The food was OMG delicious I ordered a Carne Asada type of plate and a Michelada. Everything was made to perfection never have I seen such attention to detail! We received complementary calamari from our server because I repeat he was close to one of us (I wonder if we would have gotten the same service had my friend not been there) I would sure like to think so because I hold this place very high up in my Authentic Mexican food places!
