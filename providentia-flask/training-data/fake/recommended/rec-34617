Ruby's has one of the best burgers I've had in a while. I believe i got the standard burger - the "Bronte" burger - with a fried egg on it. I'm not sure if it is the marinade, seasoning, or the quality of the beef (or all three), but the flavor of meat was exceptional. It was also served on a thin panini-like bread, which also gave it a nice touch. I am deducting one star because it took an exceptionally long time to get our exceptional burgers. We waited about 45-1hr for three burgers after 10pm. The waiter did give us a free round of beers on the house, which was appreciated. No hard feelings. It was worth it. Heads up! Popular restaurants will always be busy. We arrived around 9pm on Friday and waited for about 40 minutes for our table (not including the wait time for the food). The waiter took our number and texted us with a 10 minute heads up, which was cool. Thanks mate!
