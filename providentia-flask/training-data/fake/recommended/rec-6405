Located off the hip meatpacking district and right by the Hudson River, it serves a eclectic menu of French, Moroccan and Asian influence. We had a big group so we tried a big selection of the menu. But nothing very memorable except I quite like the avocado toast (avocado, lemon juice and chili flakes).
