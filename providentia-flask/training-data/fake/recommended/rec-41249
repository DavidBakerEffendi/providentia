This was the fitting end to our night of grey goose shots. Stood in line for about 20 minutes and then ate the most delicious serving of chicken, rice , lettuce, pita bread, and white sauce known to man. For $6 you can eat twice or share it between 2 people. I ate the entire thing since I don't know when i'll be in NY again. Don't be fooled by the dopplegangers, across the street. Look for the yellow sweatshirts. White Sauce!
