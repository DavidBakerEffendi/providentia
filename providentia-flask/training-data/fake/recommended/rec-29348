The food here is outstanding! We had just about every oyster they had on the menu and they all were fresh and tasty. I would also recommend the different varieties of oyster shooters. We had the tequila and gin versions and both went down smooth. The wait staff was friendly and efficient, always quick to clean up and bring us fresh plates and top or drinks off. I will definitely be back!
