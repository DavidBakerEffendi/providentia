Go during the week! Weekend brunches = long waits for seating.. but if you have patience, it's worth it! Mozarella sandwich! Orlin Burger! best two things on the menu.. even though its all good!! sometimes theres a long wait for food, only downside ive seen.. great spot for dates or just hangin with amigos.
