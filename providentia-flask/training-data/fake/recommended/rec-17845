My son-in-law comes here with coworkers from PSEG on a regular basis and raves about the food.  This was their "go-to" place to eat when working round-the-clock during the Sandy aftermath.  We arrived with three kids and three adults on a Wednesday evening for dinner.  The service was friendly  and attentive - no complaints. I ordered the shrimp with garlic which was served cold with sauce so salty it overshadowed any hint of garlic.  The fried potatoes on my plate appeared as crushed - as in bits and ends, soggy and cold, not the usual full potato chip style.  Very disappointing.  My grandson had penne vodka with shrimp which was drowned in sauce, but was flavorful.    Granddaughter had chicken alfredo which was actually quite good as was a flank steak dish my son-in-law had.  My daughter had a chicken, shrimp and mushroom dish which also was swimming in sauce.  Less is more in regard to sauce. A better choice would be with rodizo as we watched it being served to other tables and it looked delicious.  Consistency seems to be an issue which the server should monitor.  My dish shouldn't have even left the kitchen due to the difference in the potatoes I received versus what the rest of the table had.  Appreciate the hospitality offered to the PSEG crew, but I have two favorite restaurants on Ferry Street that never disappoint.
