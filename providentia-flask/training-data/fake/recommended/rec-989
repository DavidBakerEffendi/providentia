The day before I went to Philly, my brother, dad and I tried to decide which legendary cheesesteak shop to visit, Pat's or Geno's? My dad had recently been to Philadelphia and he said we should go to Geno's. We rolled along with his choice and after we watched the Flyers beat the Penguins we drove over to Geno's. So, the most important thing to remember is that there is a whole system to ordering your cheesesteak. I honestly forget how it worked but I bet you 100%, most of Geno's reviews will tell you how. Anyways, the actual cheesesteak itself, was... OK. It wasn't the worst cheesesteak ever. I got the "provolone without". That means one provolone cheesesteak without onions. The bread was chewy, and the steak was good. It was also a bit greasy. Also, the neighbourhood in which Geno's is located isn't exactly nice. As we were eating our steaks in the car, some random local guy walks up to every car on the street including ours and asks us to wash our windows! I've never seen that in my life. All the houses looked sort of run down and not so nice. My advice is... If you want to see the best part of Philadelphia, go to Center City. If you want to eat a good cheesesteak, don't go to Geno's.
