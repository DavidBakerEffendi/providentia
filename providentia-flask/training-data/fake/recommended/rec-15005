The food here is amazing, the hostess was absolutely rude. Besides the rude hostess, the service was great!  I was impressed by the array of tequilas they had in house.  I did not know where to start with there, so I went with the restaurant week menu.  Their ceviche was one of the better ceviches I have had in a while.   The Mar y Tierra (surf and turf) was great!  Definately give this a try.  The tequila sauce was gentle on the pallate and worked well with the peppers that seasoned the meat.  You could definately taste tamarind and teh flavors were married very well together. The Tres Leche cake nearly made me lose my breath!!! Oh God, I am not a sweets guy, but I will always go back and try this! South of the Rio and Coming Up Roses should be drinks you have to try!
