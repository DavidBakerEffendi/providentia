If you mentally prepare yourself before eating at Fiesta Hut you'll love it.  The reviews stating the service is slow are all true.  I went with a large group and a few are regulars there so they filled us in on how the experience would be before we went but said the food is worth it which is definitely true.  Fiesta Hut is hands down the most authentic place I've been to in the tristate area.  The waitress is the same person washing the dishes but that goes to show the kind of establishment they are.  They're not trying to be a chain or a fast food place.  They are family owned and have been there a long time so it works for them.  We had the nachos, quesadillas and chili con queso- all were so good we didn't have a chip left on the table.  I had the combo of taco, enchilada and tostada which were all really delicious.  I could have easily drank the whole pitcher of sangria- it was that good!
