my boyfriend and i love it here. I like the shaved noodles, they're much easier to eat than the hand drawn noodles. but both are good. they also have these lamb skewers that are very, very, tasty. I always get the egg and vegetable soup. great little spot to come too on a rainy day. it's very decently price and super quick service. it's a bit crowded at times.
