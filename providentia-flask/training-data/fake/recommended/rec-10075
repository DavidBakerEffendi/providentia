The food was great (get the spring rolls!) and the prices were amazing for New York in the theatre district, the decor was almost as good as it gets but for me the space issue was a bit of a deal breaker. They shoved the three of us into a table fit for 2 in a restaurant stretched to capacity, we complained however and they accomodated us immediately. I would go back however because the food was great for the price and the drinks and service were fantastic.
