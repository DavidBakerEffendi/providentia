I am only a snob when one sets an expectation and fails to meet it. That said, I set out to try this place in my East Village hood. 1. Terrible acoustics and tight seating ... unless you want to yell don't plan on having a conversation when the place is full. 2. Ambitious menu in theory but poorly planned and executed. Take a bunch of stuff, plate it and serve it. No real magic there. Our food was really bad though couldn't finish it. I had the Cauliflower soup followed by the Squid and Navy Beans... I call it that because all I could taste were those under cooked navy beans - gagging still. Would have had the chicken liver mouse but after seeing it at the table next to me I decided against ordering that plop of grayish-brown circular matter sitting on the gentleman's plate. 3. The staff were very pleasant though... almost to the point i felt I was at a TGI Friday's in Columbus Ohio. 4. Cute decor... attracting the easily impressed and the folks across the river.
