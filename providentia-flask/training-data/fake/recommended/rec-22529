Perfect German comfort food, if there is such a thing.  Wonderful weisswurst, schnitzel, chicken paprika, a great bread pudding dessert, and a terrific black beer on tap.  In fact a really good beer selection.  Really, what more could you want?  Not fancy or expensive.  If you want that, go to Blau Ganz.
