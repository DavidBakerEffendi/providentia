Great People Great food..  My wife and I had the Chicken Tikka Masala rice platter & the Kathi Rolls.  One meal filled both of us.....  The next day (today) I got the falafel and there Tatee Fries with Masala seasoning for lunch and there mango Lassi.  All very good great food great price.  More than what you pay for I would go there again. 2 TV's to watch while you wait.
