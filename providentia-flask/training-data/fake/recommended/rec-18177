Oh my god. I love this place!!! Here's 5 reasons why: 1. The employees are awesome.  I love walking in there and getting immediate attention. A simple hello is really all it takes to take a place from being pretty good to great. And they always ask why I don't come in more. 2. I can't eat there more often because if I did, I would be huge.  Their sandwiches are GIGANTIC! It's basically two sandwiches in one. 3. While you're waiting, they love to give out free samples of whatever they happen to be cutting up at the time. 4. They always give out extra pickles. 5. Horseradish cheddar cheese- enough said.
