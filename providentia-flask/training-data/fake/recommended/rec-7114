We came here to dinner on the eve of thanksgiving day because we could not be bothered to cook a meal that night. We were surprised to find out that the place was packed with a 20 something crowd even with the foul weather of mixed rain and snow. They serve contemporary Thai cuisine, I had the Tom yum koong with shrimps and Moo Kraprow; saut√©ed sliced pork with peppers, cabbage, carrots and onion in a chili basil sauce with white rice on the side. Nothing really stood out in my opinion. Although the food portions are huge, the food did not blow me away. If you are looking for an inexpensive Thai restaurant in the neighborhood with an awesome ambiance, a separate full bar that serves cocktails and plays cool music while dining, this place is for you.
