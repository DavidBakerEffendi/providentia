Really, really random decor that somehow manages to work... and I think it helps make the restaurant open to any type of customer.  I went for my birthday in jeans and a shirt, other guests were in business casual.  Their bread is amazingly good -- sweet and salty and buttery and delicious -- and my only regret is that they served it so soon to when the meal came out.  I got the ahi tuna -- DELICIOUS -- and my companion got the Duck Duck Goose, which came with a few too many exclamation points on the menu but was still really good.  I don't know if it beat Firebox on the duck, but it was still great.  It's good to have a handful of special occasion restaurants in town, for the times when I need a really good meal, and I'm comfortable putting Dish up on the list with Firebox.  Yum.
