Was recommended by a friend and I can honestly say I'm so happy to have found this hidden gem! Not only is it byob but there's a liquor store two stores down from the restaurant. It's not a fancy place whatsoever and not the prettiest little place. It's clean, fresh food, great pricing and again byob. The rolls are small, I believe 4-5 pieces. I never finish my dishes but I was able to eat two rolls and a delicious spicy crab hand roll.
