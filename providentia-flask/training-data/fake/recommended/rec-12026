Get over your pig foot issue right now. For godsakes they don't plop a big ol' hoof in middle of everything you eat.  No, they use the collagen that is created from the hooves to add the depth and richness, along with flavorful meat from the area to create umami! If umami decribes a flavor profile can it also encompass the soothing complexity of simple but complex? What i love about really good, authentic Japanese food is how the order of things makes it easier for you to wrap your head around all that's going on. I usually get my hot pot fix at Arirang, but this was as much of treat if not more.  we had a nice selection of items that were all fresh, flavorful and perfectly executed. - spicy tuna roll - signature gyoza -  Hakata Motsu Hot pot with dumplings, chives and pork (once you've drained the pot, have them add rice, egg and broth to it. turn the heat back up and you have another dimension of the meal). - Sesame black cod (wonderful!) Service was very friendly and helpful with the menu.  And don't leave w/out your Pez dispenser treat.
