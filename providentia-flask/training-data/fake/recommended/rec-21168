My favorite brunch place in NYC! Feels like home by the warm yellow light and the Friendly stuff ! Warning for long wait! So either you wake up early and come before 10a, or you come leave ur phone# and they will text u whenever it's ready.  It's not worth to let the wait line ruin the whole experience! What's good ? Pumpkin waffle with apple butter and fresh apple in cinnamon sauce :))))) the waffle texture is chewy( some people may like crispy) Apple butter and  fresh apple is refreshing ! Healthy and fresh breakfast ! Caramelized banana French toast! Even my Mom love it ( if u know what I mean ..haha ! ) it's a bit sweet, but it's worth! My favorite is The Penelope sandwich which Croissant and Chicken apple sausage ! Oh mine ! That PESTO sauce and melted cheese KICK IN JUST PERFECT !! Drinks  ~ surprisingly the hot apple cider is very tasty ! I always like like Fresh squeezed OJ ! 4th visit already ~ still in love with it!
