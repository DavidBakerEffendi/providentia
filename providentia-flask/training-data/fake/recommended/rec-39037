You could say that after reading about Momofuku Ssam in a recent GQ, I was so enthralled that I traveled 3,000 miles to eat here. Truth is, work was the impetus for coming east, presenting the perfect opportunity to check it out. I was not disappointed. Two days later, the memory lingers well. Atmosphere is full of energy, and the decor is modern and inviting. We were lucky to get a table near the window, the perfect urban dining setting. Definitely try the steamed pork buns. Other yelpers and the GQ article author are not kidding - they are amazing, maybe the best ever. Serving them sort of like a sandwich with hoison sauce as the spread is genius. Beyond pork buns, the hamachi was good, the beef tendon excellent and the grilled mahi mahi incredible. Only negative was the wine - most bottles are above $50, with glasses in the $12 - $16 range. That's not for me. Instead, I recommend their $5 korean beer. The perfect complement to an otherwise delicious meal. For those of you who might be going out later, we went straight from dinner to TiÃ«sto, and had the fuel to dance all night. It was the perfect amount of food.
