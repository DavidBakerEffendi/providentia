After a couple hours at the art museum, we headed over the Fare on a Sunday afternoon (around 4:45) for an early dinner.  I was slightly disappointed to hear when we walked in that we could only order from the bar menu, and I wish they had told me that when I had called and asked if there was space for us.   We had a bunch of small plates: the sliders, cooked perfectly (rare, which is hard with tiny burgers!), and the fig pizza were my two favorite.  The fish tacos were not as exciting (a little bland) and the truffle fries were also just OK, not amazing.  They have a good beer and cider selection.  I'd go back to try their full menu.
