I was in the area, so I stopped in on a Friday night.  I was really displeased with my experience.  The place is way tiny, which makes me think it might be more of a take out joint.  Another reason I think that is that the only menus were the take out menus that were in plastic containers on the table.  I asked the server if this was the menu, and she rudely replied that it was.  The rudeness continued, as she treated us like we were bothering her during our entire meal (which only lasted 30 minutes because we rushed to get out of there).   I can always overlook bad service and ambiance if there's good food.  The menu is so uninspired.  There are only a few creative rolls, and it's such a small, generic sushi menu.  I ordered a special roll that had mango and was informed they were out of mango.  This limited my choices, so I went with spicy tuna.  It was pretty small and not impressive.  I won't be returning.
