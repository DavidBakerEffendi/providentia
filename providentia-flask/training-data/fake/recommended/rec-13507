This place is cozy. If there is a large party there is not much room for anyone else. We came in to try the classic meatballs after having a huge meal at another restaurant. The meatballs are nice and tasty/saucy, my friends practically licked the bowl clean when just half an hour before they complained that they were soo stuffed they could not eat anything. The portions are decent and prices are moderate.
