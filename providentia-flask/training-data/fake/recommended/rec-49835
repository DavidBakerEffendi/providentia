Very disappointing evening. New Years special soup for $30 was a dark chicken broth with inedible pieces of chicken bones with little black to grey meat on the bones. Hungry but could not eat it. Recommended salt and pepper prawns were cooked in the shells such that the only way to eat it was with the shell which was not cooked properly. Baby bok choy was also not up to snuff. On top of everything the service was terrible. Historically this was a very good restaurant. The owners who usually are visible were not to be seen. Clearly they need to know that their staff are not capable of operating without supervision. Feel badly about writing a poor review, but they should know and hopefully they can correct the problems.
