nice place, decent service, new outdoor patio in back is nicely decorated. expensive drinks (2 rounds 4 ppl = $140+ with tip). ouchie! but it's a good place to grab drinks in small groups or as a couple. for guys, it fulfills the trendy, kinda upscale, "you're not cheap", no driving/parking activity for the night.
