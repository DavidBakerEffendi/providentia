Yes, it's a dive, but the roast beef with provolone is worth a trip from Chicago.  Whenever I am in Philadelphia, I always stop at Nick's.  The people who work here are great and the sandwiches are buttery, salty, juicy goodness.  Tried the roast pork last time and it did not disappoint.  Also, I know this is lame for a 30 something to say, but I had a cherry coke last time I was there and it was probably one of the best I've ever had.  (I'm an afficianado.  Ha!)
