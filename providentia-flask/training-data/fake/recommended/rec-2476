OMFG FINALLY I have been waiting for you for months now halal cart! This perfectly ended my night and my trip to NYC.  I made it just right before the line rush, which I was happy since it was freeeezing at 1:30am. $6 for a lamb and chicken combo over rice and veggies and pita bread. That's a STEAL in Manhattan and for such ginormous portions!!!!!  I tried and tried to finish it all so that it won't be a waste since I am from out of town, but barely made it! My combo was smothered with white sauce from corner to corner.  As I ate my plate, I wanted more and thank god, they included another white sauce container in my to go bag :) !  I ate some of the hot sauce but boy! few drops of it was super spicy already! Go to the original cart!!!! It's not hard to miss with that line compared to the other side of the street's cart! Amazing, how amongst the vast selections of food in NYC, that this halal cart can purely satisfy your appetite for such a low price!  The simple things in life may be better than anything else :)
