I've eaten there twice.  Had Oyako-don the first time.  BIG MISTAKE (despite being pretty decent Oyako-don) You are there for Katsu.  Either pork or chicken.  You eat Katsu at Katsu-Hama or you waste your damn time. The first thing they bring out to you after you order your Katsu is a mortar filled with sesame seeds and a pestle to grind them with.  Do so until you have an appreciable amount of sesame seed powder, then prepare your dipping sauce to taste with the supplied jug of sauce. When you get your Katsu, it's as crunchy and crispy and moist as is conceivable for a breaded and fried piece of meat.  Savor this, for it is delicious. Just trust me, when you go to Katsu-Hama, ORDER KATSU.
