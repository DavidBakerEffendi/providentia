Great lobster risotto.  Also a really great place to people watch.  I came here on a cold winter night when I just got off an airplane.  I have no idea how everybody here looks so chic when it's so cold and dark out.  I felt like the odd one out.  Anyway, the food is amazing, the vibe is fun/chic/Parisian/a touch frou-frou but not too much all at the same time.  Unfortunately, if you are looking for good service, this is not one of those places.  I still think this is a place worth stopping by though if you are in town!
