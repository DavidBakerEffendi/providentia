Hostess and waiter staff prevents a 5-star rating.  Food quality and presentation keeps it up there, otherwise would have given it a 3-star rating.  Our table ordered salmon, chicken pot pie, and burgers.  Pie was great, salmon helping was small, burgers were well eaten.  Reserved weeks in advance and they wanted to put us at a really crappy table, so we through down the gauntlet and said "no."  Obviously they wanted to seat some friends at the table we waited for.  The hostess was ditsy and waitress less than caring.  The kitchen obviously carries the place.  Would go again, but not anytime soon.
