Can't believe it's taken this long to write a review to this place, we get food from here once a week usually & it's awesome! I'm not really a review writer so that should tell you something.  Delicious, fresh, made to order tex-mex w/no msg!  Plus, the owners are the sweetest people.  Definitely take out though, most people do, not really a sit down restaurant, although they do have seating & do crazy lunch business I've heard. Best Mexican food in central jersey hands down. Try it. Also, to address other reviewers busting their advertised lack of spice & heat- they do this so they can make food which is preferable to everyone. Their food is made to order, if you want spicy ask them & they will make it spicy! But I'd recommend saying lightly spicy at first & going from there, b/c spicy is HOT! Also, they serve hot salsa as well as mild!
