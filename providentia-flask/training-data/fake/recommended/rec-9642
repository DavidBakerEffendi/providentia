I went here today for my anniversary with my boyfriend.  We were looking for the place for about 5 minutes.  The entrance says pio pio on the side and is not very noticeable.  I got the jalea and my boyfrIend got el lomo saltado. His food was amazing. My food was pretty good.  The half size jalea is definitely enough for 2 people and is mainly calamari.  For our appetizer we got the chicken empanadas.  They were really good.  I had a pina colada which was not listed in the food menu nor the drink/wine menu.  The pina colada was not that good... I've had better and  was small.  I would definitely go again and try more stuff on the menu.
