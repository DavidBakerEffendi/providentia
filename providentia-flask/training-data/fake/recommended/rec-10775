Almost before cozying into one of their fetching banquettes, the aroma from the kitchen behind you wafts in invading your senses. I came with a group of 5 people and we enjoyed the sauteed kale and pumpkin fries to start, then dined on the lobster roll, spicy tuna burger, walter burger, and the salmon for our entrees. All of these dishes were soul-satifsyingly on point. I hogged most of the lobster roll which was perfectly seasoned with the just right amount of mayo (it's all about the mayo distribution) and delicately placed atop a perfectly buttered and toasted crunchy melt in your mouth roll. Are you kidding me!??! In Brooklyn? Thank heavens. They have a great pimms cup and I loved the bramble with gin, blackberries and lemonage. Everything we ordered and drank was delicious from start to finish. They play pretty good music and the bar turns into somewhat of a night-life scene as the evening goes on. I hear in the summer they have a beautiful garden out back. I'll be back.
