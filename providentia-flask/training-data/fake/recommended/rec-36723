This is a happening place.  I think this place opened in 1998 and to date people are still loving this place.  Throughout the years I've stopped by after a late night.  Beware ... there's a wait most of the time ... especially late night.  I will tell you that the best thing on the menu is the mac & cheese.  This is a great place to hang out with your trendy friends, eat, laugh, and people watch!
