I'm really glad to have these guys in the hood. I never ate at the truck, but after all the buzz surrounding this shop opening, I had to check it out. I've ordered just about everything except for the sweet potato burrito, which my vegetarian friends rave about, and I've walked away satisfied and happy every time. Jen who works during the day is very kind and sweet, taking the time to get to know her customers. I thought that I'd have to sacrifice awesome mexi-gringo food when I left South Philly, but thanks to Tom I don't.
