Delicious but tiny. I had searched cheap eats and it was on the first page. $14 for lunch...better at least get full. Nope. Tiny tiny take out box of food. I got the tempeh smash. I really enjoyed it, spicy and spiced correctly. The tempeh was cooked well too, something that you don't always get else where. But I'm still hungry 14 bones later so no 5 star from me.
