After reading the reviews, thought I'd check it out. So I went there on a Saturday with my family for the first time... Parking was a pain to find and had to pay. Finally got in and it was packed people. Hardly any place to sit. Waited to order. All the menus weren't written in one place. We ended up ordering 2 crepes, a Bastille sandwich, and large cappuccino which totaled $30! Thought it was expensive for what I've ordered but being it was my first time it was fine. The problem I had was waiting to get our food. We sat on the table for 45 mins. There were 2 other families that came after us and they both got their food right away. I don't know what happen back in the kitchen but we ended up getting our food to go because it was close to lunch time; I have to go to work; and my son was getting agitated sitting around. We didn't really had the best time coming here for the first time but the food was good. Cappuccino, crepes, and croissants were excellent but pricey. I got 2 macaroons for waiting all that time. Thanks. Lol. Probably will not drive all the way here for this type of service again.
