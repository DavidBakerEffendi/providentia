This is not far from my house so it's become a go-to place for me. First I want to say that the desserts will change your life. They are the very best thing about this place and there's a lot of good going on here, so if you're looking for dessert- this is your place: Belgian waffle with strawberries, whipped cream and ice cream, profiteroles filled with ice cream, molten lava cake (which I ususally dislike- this was amazing) Mocha ice cream, tarte tatin- have tried it all and it's all spectacular, and that's only half the dessert menu. Other than that- the burger and fries are great, the spaghetti bolognese is really flavorful, the roasted chicken is nice and the skirt steak is thick and lovely. They also have great wines and of course a wonderful selection of beer, although they were out of many the first time I went. People go here for the all you can eat mussels with frites and a Stella for $20 on Sundays and Mondays. I can't vouch for it because I don't eat seafood but I've always seen a lot ordered and people seem happy. They do the mussels 6 different ways. Prices are reasonable the place is clean and has televisions where you can watch the game without it feeling like a sports bar. For some strange reason the waitresses are usually lacking in personality and manners but the rest of the staff are delightful. It's a solid place and I really like it.
