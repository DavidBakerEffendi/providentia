4.5 stars It seriously smells like butter in here. Not like butter at a bakery, but butter fried in a pan... which I don't have ANY problems with. I tried the mussels in red sauce (delicious), salad, lamb, and the chocolate profiteroles. Seriously stuffed and ready to sleep after that meal! The dessert was especially amazing. There is only room for about 25 people so I saw many people getting turned away since they did not make reservations. The servers are super friendly. It definitely did feel like I was in a small and cozy restaurant in France.
