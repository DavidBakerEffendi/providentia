First of all, this place has great ambiance - romantic yet hip, the music at perfect decibal, charming backyard. And the service is stellar. Those two things are a 5 star. The food, I'd give it a 3.5 for taste and 4 for presentation. We ordered the bruschetta, squid ink pasta, the spaghetti, and tiramisu. Everything was better than average, but there are better Italian places in the city. Example: Enoteca Maria in Staten Island actually has Italian grandmothers (as in, these women barely speak English) cooking the food. Of course Sud can't compare. Also, the portions are tiny. As in, the smallest portions I've ever had in an Italian place. Which helps stave off the carb coma but how the hell can you call yourself an Italian place when a customer leaves hungry after a 3-course meal? We haven't gone back since, except for dessert and coffee. I'd rather go have dinner at a place with more realistic portions.
