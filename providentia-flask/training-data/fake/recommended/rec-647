We just ate dinner here.   We were very pleased and will be back (and hopefully delivery will be available soon?). The place was pretty empty when we arrived at ten of seven.  Fortunately we made it in time just for sushi happy hour.  $3 standard rolls! My husband ordered spicy tuna and yellowtail and scallion rolls.  He was very happy with the freshness of the fish in both and said they were great.  I ordered edemame and Bangkok pangang shrimp curry.  The curry comes with a choice of soup or salad. I chose the salad and it was the standard greens with tomato slice and ginger carrot dressing, very fresh and good.  The curry was amazing. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and the curry had just enough heat but didn't overpower.  Very flavorful, 7-8 large shrimp, and the veggies weren't soggy as if they had been sitting all day.  The portion was massive and I barely made a dent in the large bowl. BYOB right now, we didn't opt for dessert menus. Service was top notch. A bottle of iced tap water was brought out, and even refilled once.  I'm the person who hates asking for water so I appreciated that.  Our server was friendly and even though it was slow he didn't act bored or annoyed which was defenitely refreshing.  Prices are good, I recommend you try it!
