My boyfriend insisted we go here after reading about it on Brooklyn blogs, and once I Â found out that they were extremely accommodating to vegans, I was sold. We went on a Thursday at about 7 and it wasn't very crowded, so I can't speak for how it is later in the evening. The waiters were friendly and attentive and offered great advice for what pizzas to get. I ordered the Regina and got Daiya vegan cheese instead of the regular mozzarella for $2 extra: totally worth it. We waited about 15-20 minutes for our pizzas which were cooked to perfection. I think it's safe to say this is the best pizza I've ever had: fresh ingredients, delicious dough, and not heavy or greasy at all. While vegan pizza places like Vinnie's are great for drunk munchies, Paulie Gee's is a fantastic, high-quality meal. Paulie himself made rounds and checked up on everyone to see how their meal was, greeting me as his "vegan friend" and chatting about Daiya. Not only does he know how to make a killer pizza, he knows how to make a vegan feel welcome in the midst of mozzarella-laden pies. The only downside is that I can't afford to order a $15 pizza every night (or else I totally would.) Really, really, really great pizza. Really, really, really great service.
