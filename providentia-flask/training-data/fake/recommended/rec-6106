I LOVE Joya. I've been back many, many times since I first discovered this gem over a year ago. With Joya, the food is always consistent and the staff is so friendly! The only thing hectic about it is that they don't that reservations and its cash only. Otherwise, its alll good. REALLY. Its ALL good. I love a bottle of pinot grigio, an order of the spicy noodle with shrimp :) Try it out -- this place is kinda amazing.
