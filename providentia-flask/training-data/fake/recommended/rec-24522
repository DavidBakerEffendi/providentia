I went here for my bday last saturday based on the great reviews on yelp. I arrived about 20 minutes with my party of 8 and they were willing to seat us though 2 people havent arrived which was so nice. The service was a bit slow but it matched the flow of the atmosphere. We ordered the mussel (fantastic flavors and creamy), meatballs (so tender), warm feta and pita (average) and grilled squid (was eh..) for appetizer. I had the ares cocktail, which was a delicious. I had the grilled striped sea bass which was flaky and tender. I had a piece of my friend's hanger steak which was heavenly, soo tender and juicy, The lamb shank was a large serving and also, super tender. The goat cheese ravioli was very rich with flavors. I would def come back here for a relaxed dinner with some friends or family. The place is huge with two floors and a beautiful open bar right in the front. Adore the neighborhood, very relaxed.
