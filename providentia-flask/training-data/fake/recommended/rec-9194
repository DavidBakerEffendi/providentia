In the search for good Japanese food, Soba-ya fits right in.  It's not everyday that you find a soba shop with such variety.   If you're new to soba, don't be intimated.  Every menu item comes with a picture to help the newbies along.  The bento boxes and the daily specials are great options.  You have a choice of hot or cold for most soba dishes. Hot for the winter.  Cold for the summer.   Prices are reasonable given the quantity and quality of the food.  Lunch entrees range from $12-$20 and you won't leave hungry. Oh, also remember to try the desserts here.  The ice cream trio comes with yuzu, black sesame, and honey wasabi.  It's a lot creamier than the ice cream from Chinatown Ice Cream Factory and melts quickly.   I didn't get to try the green tea brulee, but if it's anything like the one at Gochi in San Jose, then it will be delicious!  Just another reason to return.
