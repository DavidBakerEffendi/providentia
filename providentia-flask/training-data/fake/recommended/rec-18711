I came here with a friend to get some dinner and drinks on a Saturday night. There was room at the bar for us to sit down for just a few minutes and order a couple of beers before our table was ready. They have 'gansett on tap, so that was nice. My friend and I each ordered burgers. The waitress made a point of asking for a temperature, so I asked for mine medium. The toppings were good, but, unfortunately, the patty came out as vulcanized as the hockey puck in the Rangers game on the TV. ;( The saving grace was the french fries. They were as great as promised, and the barbeque dipping sauce was really tasty. All in all, II was disappointed with the burger being way overcooked (2/5 stars), but I would give this place another chance based on the rest of the experience (5/5 stars for the fries and 4/5 for the beer selection).
