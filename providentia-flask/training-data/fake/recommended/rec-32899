Amazing.. possibly one of the best meals I can remember having.  We did the tasting menu, and were even able to customize it a bit to our taste.  The highlights were the spicy duck meatballs and the chocolate souffle, incredibly good.. I've craved both dishes since I went.  I would absolutely go back
