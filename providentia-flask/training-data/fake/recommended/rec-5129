Good service. Decent BBQ for NYC. Far too salty. As a southerner from Memphis and the Texas hill country it didn't fill me full of rage. Would get 4 stars if the beer wasn't served in Mason jars, which is stupid and kitschy. Best sauce I've had in NYC. Best meat tried was the pulled pork. EXCELLENT spicy collards.
