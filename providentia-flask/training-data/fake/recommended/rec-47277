Great addition to the neighborhood. Clean, minimalist decor with a very cool wooden bar with a slated wooden ceiling. Food is good. Portion sizes are a bit on the small side for the price point. Salt cod hash could use more cod. Good flavor but not enough fish. Eggs were poached perfectly. Sage pancakes were very good. The dates and apricot sausage were a great accompaniment, but they could have offered a bit more syrup. Coffee was very good. Same quality you get from their other restaurant, Milk Bar on Vanderbuilt. Overall a very nice meal, but definitely room for improvement. Owner, Alex, is very friendly but his staff can be a bit cold.
