Coming into the city for a show at the nearby World Cafe on a Sunday nite and with a good line of thunderstorms approaching, I tried asking where there was a good bar or a place for food.   Geeky Ivy students hadn't a clue and many of the nearby spots to WCL were closed (you'd never find that in Manhattan).  So the search began and after ping ponging a bit, I made my way away from town when the storm hit, and not a bar nor food place to be found.  I sought shelter at the Starbucks and was cursing my bad luck (and I wasn't going to order a blessed thing from them either) when one of the staff who was bringing in the tables & chairs told me the alley behind the store had some places.   It still pouring, I made a beeline that way (under the scaffolding) and found this spot.    Made my way to the bar in the back and I was in my element.   They could use a sound system to make the place a bit more lively, but that was my only complaint.  Waitresses and bar tender were friendly.  I only ordered the suicide shrimp and the mac & cheese.  Recommend both highly.  Nice presentation on the shrimp dish over cornbread and a jalopena mayo and a nice cole slaw.  Mac & cheese was as good as it gets and tops any of the very decent places I frequent near my home.   As I return to University City, I'll surely return to BBB and try some of their ribs or brisket the next time - that'll be the acid test.
