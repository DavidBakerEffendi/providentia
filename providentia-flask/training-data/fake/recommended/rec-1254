I am truly disappointed with the kitchen. The inside is gorgeous except the bathrooms are upstairs past the security and storage closet. Who builds Â a brand new restaurant and puts the bathrooms up a long flight of stairs? Anyways, we sat down and were greeted immediately but then waited 25 minutes at the bar for someone to take our drink order. There were at least 6 employees in ear shot. The food needs help. There was a stem in the avocado that I bit into. The clams casino was not released from the shell was just diced peppers completely covered in mozzarella. Horrible. The oysters were not released from the shell either. The clam chowder was amazing. Hopefully the kitchen gets some training. Oh yea and the newbie bar backs were being trained on chopping produce at the bar, like literally on the bar. It was a hot mess.
