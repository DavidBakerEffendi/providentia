5 Star for decor, 3 star for food! Excellent atmosphere and great place to bring a date if you're a Recessionista on a budget! Â Food, however, is okay. Unfortunately, there were a couple of times that I was very disappointed with the food and I can't remember exactly what it was, but I haven't been since. I find it that the food at the Room Service in Chelsea was a bit tastier. Overall, good food for the price! I do have to say, their Thai Iced Tea Ice Cream is AAAAMAZING!!! I have never had or seen it served in any other Thai restaurant!
