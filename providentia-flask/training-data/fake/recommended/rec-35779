A great little neighborhood bar, especially appealing on a warm summer night sitting outside or next to the large windows. A decent beer selection although not as extensive as one would like. Expect service to be pretty slow so don't go when in a hurry (especially seated outside) and the food is less-than-spectacular but we can always find something we like there.
