Made the reservation online for Wednesday 2/13 as it was my boyfriends birthday. After careful research on yelp i made the reservation for 8:00pm. Arrived at 745' ish. We were seated they knew exactly who we were. (on the reservation i noted it was his birthday and when they called me to confirm the reservation i mentioned if we can perhaps have a flan sent to the table.) they were amazing. The food! We had: The garlic shrimp - amazing! oh my! it was delicious! the skirt steak - amazing as well! the paella - my boyfriend loved it (i thought it was okay) the meatballs - not our favorite the goat cheese balls -   i loved them amazingly crunchy and soft on the inside. (the mister has never had goat cheese and fell in love) the snails - great experience so you can say you have tasted them but ive had better. coconut flan - i was too stuffed to eat it the mister ate it all (and he is not a big fan of coconut... ) I had the red sangria and he had the mango 2 glasses. :) since it was his birthday he got asked to join the flamenco show. It was amazing! We had a blast! he had  blast, enjoyed the food, enjoyed the show, enjoyed the service. Will i go back again? ummm YES! we are already talking about what we will have. Must go, must experience!
