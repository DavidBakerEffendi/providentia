I find it perplexing why people think this place so is good. Like seriously perplexing. I live on the same block, so I've eaten from their lunch menu a few times. The avocado sandwich is good but it's priced like an expensive lunch sandwich in a neighborhood where business men work, but this isn't that kind of neighborhood. You're charging like 8.50 for a cheese, sprouts, and avocado sandwich and the noodle people next to you are charging 1.50 for a giant container of tasty noodles. It just isn't cohesive to the price point in the neighborhood at all. Frankly, the noodles are better too. From what I've eaten it ok, just not at all innovative or exciting or different. And the baked goods are truly TERRIBLE. I bought a chocolate cookie there once and it looked really chocolatey, all dark brownish-black and rich looking, but it was totally dry and chalky tasting. Just absolutely awful. The apple turnover I had wasn't much better either. Admittedly, I believe Chinese businesses belong in this area, so I was never super stoked about this place. But I gave it a shot, multiple times, and it was just never good. Plus the folks who work there are rude neighbors. They're nice if you're a customer, but they're shit neighbors.
