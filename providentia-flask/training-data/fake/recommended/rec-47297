The ambiance is nice, but you can be seated kind of close to other people. Had the tuna tartare, pineapple fried rice (with the chicken), and the Room Service pad Thai.. (none of which were spicy at all, btw.) The tuna tartare was great. I'm not even a big sushi fan, but I couldn't help but enjoy it! The pineapple fried rice w/ chicken was kind of average- the pineapple added very little to the actual dish, and the fried rice didn't really taste any better than rice you'd get for Chinese take-out. The Room Service pad thai was just ok. I wouldn't order it or the fried rice again. The service was very good. We didn't have to wait long to be served and the food (especially our first dish) came surprisingly quick. Also, we never had to wait long for them to refill our waters or take a question. They do rush you in and out though and this doesn't seem to be the place you come to chill and hang out (Quick Service, ha ha ha..)
