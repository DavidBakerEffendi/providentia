This place is as great as they say. The small menu is actually a plus (as a vegan sometimes I get lost in vegan restaurants with a big menu... not used to having choices) and it's pretty safe to assume that anything you would get would be great. It's not expensive for NYC food but I do with it was a bit cheaper... The rolls are big but you might not be totally full after two (for 6.50 each) and that's a problem. Also, the miso soup wasn't great. But other than that the rolls were all great and definitely unique. You won't find sushi like this anywhere else...
