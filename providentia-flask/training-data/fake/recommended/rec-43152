SLAMMMMMMING!! ok ok now this is one of my spots to go to in harlem! i love it. this is awesome soul food! every time i come here i usually get the dougie fresh which is the Waffles & Fish combo. Â The fish is a whiting and its very nice! you get some good ol corn bread to eat as an appetizer before your meal comes! i love coming here i need to take a trip over there soon! i say anyone who wants some delicious food come here!! very good :)
