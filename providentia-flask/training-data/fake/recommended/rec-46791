This place is THE BEST PLACE for Vietnamese pho/banh-mi sandwiches, etc. I seriously can't believe it took me over a year to discover this place! Now, this is like my go-to place for pho and such. I think the prices are relatively cheap, comparing you get such a huge portion for less than $10! Sounds good to me :-) You'll see alot of NYU students here b/c it's hard to find places where meals are less than $10! I came here atleast 3 times now with 3 different people, and each person I come with LOVES this place. I've tried the saigon shack pho, banh-mi sandwich and I can't wait to try some of the other options on the menu. This place is usually crowded, but if you come at non-rush hour times, you should be seated immediately. I usually don't make reservations and I get seated instantly. The service is decent too! Great place for a quick lunch in-between classes or meeting up with friends.
