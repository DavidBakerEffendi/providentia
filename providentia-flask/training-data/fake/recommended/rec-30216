This is a classy, great service, great Italian food establishment on the border of the Meatpacking District.  The outside is smartly decorated like a country home in the middle of the city.  The bar is trendy/casual, and the restaurant is pretty spacious and only moderately noisy for a NYC restaurant. I had the oxtail saffron cavatelli, delicious.  Desserts were generously sized - think salty caramel/chocolate/carrot cake/types of desserts.  The house made Limoncello was a nice dessert too.  We also had a number of appetizers, the best was the polenta and truffled mushrooms. A great pick.  I also like the airy feel of the dining room - lots of ceiling windows that turn a natural light space during the day into a dark cozy room in the evening.
