Definitely one of Astoria's hottest spots, particularly for brunch on the weekends.  You may find yourself waiting..., with good reason!  The food is delicious and fresh and the staff boasts exemplary customer service.  Apparently they bought the space next door and are expanding.  I'm sure the local yocals of Astoria will be extremely happy as it will be the best thing since sliced bread. One bathroom for such a fabulous establishment simply just won't do! Construction to be completed Fall 2014.  Shhhh... You didn't hear that from me!
