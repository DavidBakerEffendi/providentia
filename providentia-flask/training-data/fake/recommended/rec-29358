After having John's Roast Pork on our last visit to Philly, one of my husband's co-workers told us we "HAD" to try Dinic's in Reading...the best Roast Pork he had ever had. Since this was our last visit to Philly for a while, I'm so disappointed that we didn't just go back to John's. It was SO much better. There was nothing wrong with Dinic's, and a trip to Reading is always fun...I also shared a crepe with my son and bought some interesting cheese while there. I guess I just built it up so much that it was a kind of a letdown. If you are looking for a delicious Roast Pork, go to John's Roast Pork. If you happen to be in Reading and want a tasty lunch, Dinic's will suffice.
