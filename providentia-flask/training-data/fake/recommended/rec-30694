Oh Fung Wah bus, my parents hate you (even more than they did after the decapitation incident) for making me 75 minutes late for our Perilla reservation. While my folks may never understand my undying, irrational affection for the Fung Wah, we all agreed that Harold really got EVERYTHING right with this little West Village restaurant. The hostess was extraordinarily gracious and accommodating about our table of four being only half-present from the 9 PM reservation until the arrival of a local friend and I at nearly 10:30. I was very grateful that they seated my folks right away, without my friend and I; some places are very finicky about this. My mom's second-favorite chardonnay of all time, Santa Barbara Winery, was serendipitously served by the glass, which, along with the scallops appetizer, took the edge off of their awkward wait for me. Our waiter was young, warm, and enthusiastic, if a bit nervous (in a very endearing way). I had the special for my entree, black bass (happily served with the crispy, delicious skin on) with fresh corn, bacon, shaved truffles, and truffle oil. Really, really incredible piece of fish; an ideal summer dish. Vegetarian dad loved the sheep's milk ricotta ravioli, mom raved about the hanger steak (I had a bite, and not just the steak, but also the spinach and mushrooms served with it, were swoon-worthy), and my friend loved her poussin. Us young people indulged in dessert (how can you not at a place like this?): my blackberry linzertorte had the freshest-tasting berries, baked just enough to deepen their flavor while preserving their shape, in a perfectly crumbly, ever-so-slightly spiced crust. The buttermilk ice cream served atop was perfect. My friend was still talking about her banana hazelnut tart with molasses ice cream the next day. Harold was chilling at the bar with some buddies as we left, near midnight. He had good reason to be smiling and laughing; his restaurant is an absolute winner.
