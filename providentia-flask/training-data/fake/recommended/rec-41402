I got a chocolate croissant and almond biscotti from the bakery. The almond biscotti was super sugary and lack of any other discernible tastes. The chocolate croissant was soft, too buttery, and again super sugary with mediocre chocolate. If you like sugar this is the place for you. For me...meh you get better pastries from Whole Foods.
