Excellent food and professional service. Came here with my friends just because and was seated quickly. Thai ice tea for all of us. A bit on the sweet side but it was very tasty and definitely one of the better thai ice teas that I've tried. The lunch specials were great and extremely reasonably priced. Choice of soup/salad , an appetizer, and an entree all for 9 bucks. I ordered the grilled porkchop with sticky rice. At the end of the meal, I realized there was a small piece of either fur or hair stuck inside the sticky rice and at the time I just plucked it out thinking thank god I'm done eating. I asked for the bill and I told the waitress that I found a piece of hair inside the sticky rice but it's okay because I'm done eating and she immediately apologized and when the bill came, she told me she had taken off the Porkchops altogether. So basically I got the Porkchops for free because there was a tiny string or fur or hair inside the sticky rice which I really wasn't planning on eating to begin with. I felt the food was good and the service was professional. Definitely would come back!!!
