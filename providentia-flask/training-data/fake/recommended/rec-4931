Food is good, but not enough to put up with the fact that the owner is incredibly rude.  Be careful you don't visit him when he is busy, god help you if you try to interrupt him while he is on the phone...hire a darn person to answer your phone if you can't greet you customers! Because the initial traffic is strong he thinks he can treat customers with disdain.  Hope he learns that this tactic will have customers not returning.  I will not be.
