Very busy/popular on a Thursday night.  Waited about 20 minutes, before two spots at the upstairs bar opened. Split the hatch burger and the umami burger and ordered the truffle fries.  The beef is well seasoned and delicious.  The truffle cheese gets a little overwhelming after a while (it is a bit salty), but the fries were cooked really well.  It's a little small for what you get (quantity-wise), but the quality is quite good.  Will come back. Thanks also to our server/bartender (the guy who looks like Adam Rodriguez who's on CSI: Miami --- he said a few people have made that reference too!) for very friendly service!  Chill guy, made conversation with us, recommended his favs.
