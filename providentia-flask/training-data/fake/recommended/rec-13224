We were a bit rushed for another appointment so we just had entrees, but our meals were very tasty.  We had the duck confit and avocado crab cakes. The duck is definitely recommended and well made.  The crab cakes overall were good, but I didn't get the avocado... it didn't add anything (either taste-wise or texture-wise) to the crab cakes and it probably could have done without them. I'd come back to try a full meal here.
