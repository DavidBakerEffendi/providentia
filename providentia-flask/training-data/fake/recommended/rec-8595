What can I not say about Hoagie Haven?   Being a calorie-conscious adult, I don't know how we didn't gain 50 pounds drinking and eating at Hoagie Haven back in college, but I wouldn't change a thing. It's a definite for anytime I'm in Princeton for Reunions or stopping by.  I love the chicken parm (with lettuce and tomato, cause why not?).   I've found the newer more experimental sandwiches fun and interesting, but not as homey as my beloved chicken parm.   I will love Hoagie Haven forever.
