A great mom-and-pop-style restaurant. Great comfortable atmosphere with great service. The food is always good. I've almost tried everything on the menu, but now that I've moved away, I can't go back to my favorite Thai restaurant. Hopefully, nothing's changed since I last went. My faves: fried tofu, pad thai, their thai iced tea, spicy beef salad,...(I could keep going.)
