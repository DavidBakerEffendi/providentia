Expect the waitress to growl at you (no matter what language you speak). Expect the tables and possibly the utensils to be a little sticky. If you're a party of one or two and come at a reasonable meal hour, expect to rub elbows with strangers. But most of all, expect amazing noodles. I go for the hand-drawn noodles because I can almost finish a whole bowl by myself. With the chewy, dense (and very yummy) knife-cut noodles, I might get through half. Might. The beef noodles are the classic, but if you're feeling meatless or particularly broke, the egg and vegetable noodles are great too. (If you're vegetarian, you'd probably do better at Kingdom of Vegetarians. I'm pretty sure the broth in the egg and vegetable noodles is the same as the broth in the beef.)
