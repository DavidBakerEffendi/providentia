I was expecting a LOT from Pat's. Only because on FOOD FEUDS they won. But this place was nothing like what I was expecting. The meat is pretty thin and the sub is not as juicy as GENO'S. There isn't much flavor in the sub too. I can't really say much due to my bad experience. But I have to say that if you want a good cheese steak go across the street to GENO'S! This place may have more options, BUT it costs more to get other things added, even to get onions-.- This place is also 24/7. But you'll see that this place is a bit empty compared to Geno's.
