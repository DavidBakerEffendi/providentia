2 amazing things I ate here: 1) One of the appetizers. Forgot the exact name of it but it's bone marrow with oxtail marmalade and it is incredible!!! One of the most unique and tasty things I've ever eaten. The key is the French grey sea salt that you're supposed to sprinkle over it.... Mmmmmm.... 2) Oysters! I believe I had 2 west coast oysters and 2 east coast oysters. All were delicious. The place was small and dark but I very much enjoyed it!
