Glad to see a healthy option open up in the neighborhood (I love you, Lincoln Fried Chicken, but I can't eat you every day). You can find me here this summer ordering the TBLAT (turkey, bacon, lettuce, avocado, and tomato) or the Greek salad on nights where I sure as hell won't be turning my oven on.
