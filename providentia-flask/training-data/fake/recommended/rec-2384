Top Shelf. I love Noodle Soup.  I'd have to say it's one of my courses on my Death Row meal, if that ever happens.  But you know something, I don't know if I really ever HAD noodle soup before I ate here.  I ordered up some steamed potstickers, which started the meal perfectly.  They were terrific.   Then..the soup arrived.  The glorious broth, the goodies abound (I got roast pork & dumpling) the aroma... Get the picture?  Then I had my first slurp of the hand drawn noodles.  Yep, I never had noodles before. I'll be back.
