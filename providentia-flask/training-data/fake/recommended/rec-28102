It's enjoyable, sort of, but way overrated on Yelp, and you don't get much for what you end up paying. You think you've ordered enough selections to cover your group, and then it turns out you get maybe a bite or two out of each plate with a group of three people. I'm glad I checked it out once, to try the interesting food creations, but I won't be going there again.
