I would have given Taqueria LES 4 stars if some of the dishes weren't so. freaking. salty. Management should really attend to the salt levels of some of the dishes here. I ordered the chorizo quesadilla and the ground beef (picadillo) tacos. Both were salty as heck. My friend had the fish tacos and chicken sopes. Not as salty and pretty good. The servers also seemed pretty aloof, which wasn't pleasant (bussers seemed much more attentive). I'd come again, but with fingers crossed so as to hopefully not get another salty, salty dish.
