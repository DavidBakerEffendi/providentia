Four stars only because it's a little pricey. However, it was here that I had the best iced caramel latte of my life. As a former barista, I know my lattes and this one was spectacular. The pastries are great as well, and I love to come here and settle for the better part of a Saturday and study. Welcoming atmosphere, great, casual ambiance.
