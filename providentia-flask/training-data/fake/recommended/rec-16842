Got at least two hours? Definitely eat here. If not, you will be frustrated. We forsook our spot on the list at Lucali and snagged a table at 9:50 p.m. on a Saturday night. It's still BYOB, even months after it opened, which is a nice plus. It was a teensy spot, Â only five tables, but they've since taken over the former flower shop next door and retained its aesthetic, so you have the choice (if you're lucky) of turquoise clam-shack decor or whitewashed tulip-y sophistication. The menu is written on kraft paper attached to a cute red-painted hanging door type of thing: totally cute. I had a truly awesome Thai cod curry, which seemed slightly suspect for a French place but was delish. The BF was impressed with his tuna steak nicoise, and he is not impressed by much. Unfortunately our companions had to go pick up a visitor at Port Authority and got their food to go. That is because it was over an hour between the time we ordered and the time the food came out. Now, the food was really good, but that is a bit ridiculous. It's fish. It's three minutes a side. Our waiter was really cool and friendly, and so was the cook. But after our friends left, he was pretty quick to condemn them for leaving, saying: "My food takes time." Wellllll, I dunno about that. Again, it's fish. He just couldn't keep up. And the restaurant was not even that crowded. He simply wasn't hustling. And I was a little irritated at the disrespect shown to paying customers after they had gone. Luckily, the food was delicious, but it's just a question of your willingness to put in the time. I missed a rock show I was really looking forward to for this reason. Which sucked, but at least I had an awesome dinner.
