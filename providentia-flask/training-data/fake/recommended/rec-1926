This was my first meal in Philly, so Nan Zhou Hand Drawn Noodle House will always have a very fond place in my heart.   I kind of eat like a stereotypical guy.  I like fast, cheap, tasty, and lots of food.  You sit down and the menu only gives you like 10 options, you order it, and then VIOLA the food appears in front of you! So fast! wha! Anyways, if you like it quick and dirty, go here for wholesome Chinese noodles. The only part that sucks is finding parking if you pick up delivery but you can just park your car in the red/loading/handicap zone for 2 mins. to get your take-out! You're welcome for that illegal tip.
