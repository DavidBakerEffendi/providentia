My favorite traditional pizza in Burlington. Funnily enough, it reminds me of the great pizza I've had in Boston, not Manhattan. They really do put out some great work on those pies. The all you can eat pizza/wings night are a great deal. I love that they'll make any type of slice you want. Sometimes, I would go in and want eggplant, sometimes olive. Why choose? Get both! Without ordering a whole pizza. The atmosphere in Manhattan is so casual and down to earth, it's always a nice place to just go an relax with friends while having a beer and eating delicious pizza. I also highly recommend their cheesy garlic bread. For real, guys, it's outstanding. It also really didn't hurt that I had a crush on the bartender here, haha. What can I say? There's so much to recommend about this place, including the servers!
