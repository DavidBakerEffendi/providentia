Impeccable service.   I'm not sure I've seen more attentive servers.  Do they have hidden cameras on the table to let them know when your card is turned to green or what?   Meats were mostly yummy, we did find some too salty. Salad bar could use identifiers.  We had no clue what some of the items were.  When you have someone who has food allergies this is an issue. Would be very fun with a large group and we'll be back.
