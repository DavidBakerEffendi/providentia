I finally just got a chance to head over to Hibiscus last weekend, and I'm ashamed that it took me as long as it did. This place is amazing. My husband and I went for lunch with our neighbors and between us we got: two jerk tofu wraps, the seitan fajita wrap and the chickpea and kale platter. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food (even my carnivore husband!) and we all vowed to not be strangers. The owners are so warm and friendly as well. Seating was kind of limited (we had to push a few tables together to accommodate our party of four) so in the future we'll probably do takeout. So happy to have this in our neighborhood!
