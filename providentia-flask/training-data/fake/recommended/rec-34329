My husband and I ate there Saturday night and it was AMAZING!!!!  Joanne, our bartender, was phenomenal, friendly and right there.  The service was outstanding.  We did not have reservations, so we did not mind the wait.  The place was packed and we waited 30 mins.  The Hotsy-Totsy Shrimp were unbelievable!!  Delicious!!  My husband had the Cowboy Steak, and compared the taste to better NY steakhouses we have dined in, perfect taste, perfect temp.  As I'm not a red meat eater, the choices I had were limitless.  I chose the California Chicken Club, which was also delicious.  From start to finish, drinks, service and food, we thought it was FANTASTIC and already made reservations to go back on Valentines Day and our Anniversary....a great great time was had.
