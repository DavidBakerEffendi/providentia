We arrived around 6:30 PM and had no trouble getting a table.   The later it got, it got loud.  Not the place you would go for date night.  And if you want great food, knowledgable, pleasant, friendly wait staff, this is the place for you.  Nice size menu with plenty of variety and it all looked delicious.   The chicken was amazing as was steak.  I will definitely go back.
