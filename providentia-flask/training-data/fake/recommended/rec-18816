Just finished a superb Pat LaFrieda burger atop an Amy's Bread bun. Add a little Vermont cheddar, awesome fries, and an Aspall Cider, and you've got a great dinner. Nice, low key vibe, friendly bartender, soul music on the stereo, TMC Classic Movie on TV. Around 40 seats, plus another 15 at the bar makes it a nice size. Good place for single women. Several are working on their laptops, with no one interrupting them. Very nice neighborhood place.
