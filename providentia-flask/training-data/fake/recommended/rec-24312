I like this place because it's sort of a " find". Tucked away, off the busy street, with its own small parking lot, The King and Thai Restaurant is small and cozy in a former house, with only 8-10 tables. Coconut soup and Pad Thai is good and traditional. Many other choices. A good place as a hide away, if you don't want to be seen with your date...
