I drive past Butterfly all the time and we finally made it there a few weeks ago. For an appetizer my boyfriend and I split the shumai sampler and it was EXCELLENT. I chose the chicken and vegetables from their "healthy" menu section- despite being very simple I was very happy with my meal. The Steamed chicken sliced thinly was very moist, served with steamed vegetables that were nicely cooked, fluffy rice, and a nice light brown sauce. My boyfriend chose a dish (we can't remember the name) but it was a variety of seafood served over noodles with a clear, rather slimy sauce. I can't pretend to be an expert on authentic Chinese food by any means so perhaps this dish was prepared exactly as intended, but it was NOT for us. Overall, it wasn't a bad experience but nothing so great to compel me to run back ASAP.
