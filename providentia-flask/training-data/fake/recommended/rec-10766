If you leave this place without trying the truffle burger you will regret it. Unless you hate truffle. I came here with a group and I split the truffle and classic burgers with a friend to get a taste of both. I first tried a bite of the classic and was blown away (I was also pretty hungry after waiting over an hour for my table) but when I tasted the truffle burger I didn't want to go back to the classic. I also tried a bite of the specialty 5-spice duck burger, which tasted too sweet to me. One of my friends got the "trust us combo" which I would not recommend. I won't reveal what it was but the side dish and the drink were not all that exciting. I didn't mind the small size of the burgers because you don't feel overly full at the end of the meal. Other sides that I enjoyed: the truffle fries and the pickles.
