I had friends from the Bahamas come up to visit, and since they were kind of obsessed with the Carmine's down there, they insisted on going to the Carmine's here. But instead of going to the original location, they decided to be super touristy and go to the Times Square location. Always make a reservation, even if you don't think you'll need one. I'm not the biggest fan of Carmine's - but it's great when you're planning meals for large parties because of the huge portions and great service. I don't think you're supposed to be blown away by the food - but it's alright basic Italian food in huge family-style portions. We ordered way too much for 8 people - and I ended up having leftovers for the rest of the week. We ordered the Caesar Salad, the Fried Calamari, Stuffed Clams, Chicken Parmesan, Steak (Medium), and Penne alla Vodka. The stuffed clams were really good, just a bit oily. The fried calamari was absolutely delicious but my favorite was the Caesar Salad - ours was lightly dressed (thank goodness), because it was so crisp and light even with the Caesar dressing. The entrees seriously disappointed me. The penne was good - but there was way too much sauce. The steak was overcooked, even though we ordered it medium. Maybe if we ordered it medium rare (or just rare), it would've come out medium. The chicken parmesan was alright, but it also came with what looked like an inch of extra cheese which made it way heavier than it needed to be. So basically - if you need a place to eat with a group of friends, go to Carmine's. If you want extraordinary Italian food, go somewhere else.
