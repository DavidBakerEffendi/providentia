The food was pretty good.  My only complaint was that in an effort to keep bare aesthetic, the bussing staff removed several plates that still had food on them while we were eating.  Not sure what the rush was, as there was no wait that night.  Eagerness to turn tables aside, the food was delicious, the wine list tasteful, and the overall experience was pretty good.
