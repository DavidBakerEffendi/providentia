So happy to have this place not far from my apt, the owners give the place a really great vibe, I never have a bad time here. There's always great music, cozy lighting, hot people and awesome food, a real chill place that isn't divey. The lamb (small plate) is next level, the Tako Taco, incredible. My favorite dish, (I'm vegetarian) is the fish and chips. The fish comes head-on, the fries are great, a simple dish elevated by the presentation and flavors. My foodie friends dug it, and started dancing when Nas came on, BIG UP.
