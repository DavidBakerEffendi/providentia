I came into this place thinking that there would some kind of Hawaiian flare or decor because of the name but that wasn't what I got. What I got was very modern decor and a lounge-like ambiance.  I think it would be a cool place to hang out and have some drinks after hour because they have some interesting looking drinks on the menu. My friend did get a mojito-like drink and it was huge so you get your money's worth. As for the food, I got sushi which was kind of on the bland side. My roomie got the Ahi and Lobster Pizza which was really good and again large in portion.  We all shared the carrot cake. This is probably the only thing I can rave about. It was very large and looked like a fourth of a cake. Great for sharing and de-li-cious!  Six of us shared this dessert and we were pretty satisfied. One little thing that I would ask these folks is to at least put the Loco Moco on the menu. How can you have Kona in your restaurant name and not have the Loco Moco?
