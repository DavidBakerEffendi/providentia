Overall, I like this place: good food, nice ambiance (love the art deco theme), and the dill paloma is one of the best cocktails i've ever had--seriously, try it! And props to the host for accommodating our party of 6 on a sat night with no reservation. Just FYI, if you order the ceviche, it says that it comes with plantain chips on the menu, but they didn't make it to the table. After inquiring to our waiter, he said that the menu says it comes with the chips, but it "doesn't really come with them." Hmmmm, interesting. Not sure if that was true or not, but for $14 (and the dish was so-so, not fantastic), I want my damn chips! We asked nicely for the chips, and got some typical wburg hipster tude in response, but he brought them and we didn't get charged extra. Hope the restaurant "fixes" the menu soon! Despite that, the dill paloma will keep me coming back for more...
