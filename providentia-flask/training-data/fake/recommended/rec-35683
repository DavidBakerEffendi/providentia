We had a reservation for six people, but had to wait for more than an hour to be seated in the restaurant. We had the prawns, risotto, mushrooms, artichoke, pork belly, lamb, organic chicken, fried potatoes and the cheeses. They were all very good except the artichoke and mushrooms. These were'nt fresh tasting, they may have used canned. The fried potatoes were amazing! The desserts were ver good as well. Overall, great tasting food and pricey. I would'nt recommend for groups larger than four. Seating can be a hassle. The waiters were friendly, but were always on the run.
