I'm very on the fence.  There was great food, delicious wine, a lovely bartender and waitress, cozy atmosphere, and a pretty cool crowd...but I am still not over my front of the house experience.  The pretty hostesses told us that it would be a 20 minute wait for a table for 4.  I thought, perfect, just enough time to squeeze into the bar and grab a glass of Malbec.  Two more glasses and a tequila shot later, we're still waiting!  We ended up waiting an hour and a half before being seated.  I was super annoyed and made that very clear to the hostess and manager, unfortunately they pretended not to notice.  I've worked in the restaurant business before, and this is typically their cue to offer us a glass of wine or appetizer on the house for our troubles...they didn't take the hint. The rest of the meal was great.  We devoured the yummy bread, fried artichoke appetizer, and more vino.  I ordered gnocchi in a black truffle sauce, which definitely gave me a tummy ache for the rest of the night but was well worth it.  Our waitress was cool and seemed to enjoy serving us, which is really the most important feeling you should get from a server. In conclusion, I will definitely head back to Uva.  This time with a granola bar in my purse due to my skepticism of the pretty hostesses and their estimation abilities.
