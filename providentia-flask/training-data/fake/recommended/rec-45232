We have been wanting to come here for a while after hearing and reading good things. Stopped in on a Sunday night,busy but able to get a table without a resv. Nice modern decor and a somewhat of a hip vib I thought.Decent Wine selection but we just ordered a few glasses of Chianti. Started with CLAMS ORGENATA and the clams were tender with a nice "bread dipping" thick textue garlic sauce. The ARUGULA Salad was also  very good with a Lemon Vinaigrette dressing.The Arugula was fresh and just slightly bitter like it should be.Nice portion for the two of us to  split. My wife had the SNAPPER MARICHIARA  that come with a couple of clams in a sweet light red sauce along with a side of PASTA. I had the VEAL ROLLANTINI that was served with mushrooms in a light brown sauce also  with a side of PASTA.Both dinners were very good and the Pasta side was not just an after thought,it was a nice portion with a fresh red Gravy sauce that you just wanted to wipe it all up with your bread! We finished with Italian CheeseCake and The Reginetta, that was a thin layer of chocolate sponge cake, with amaretto ice cream, raspberry sauce and an almond paste crunch dressed with chocolate syrup.Both very good. It appeared the crowd was a mix a regulars (Good indication) and first timers like us. The price was a right and sevice and food very good.Total bill for all the above mentioned food with 3 glasses of wine and 2 espresso's was $120 including 20% tip.Will definitely come back as well as the couple we were chatting with that was also there for the first time. Matthew the owner is very friendly and there to greet you when you come in. He makes sure all is going well while dining and appears to  have the touch of running a great place.
