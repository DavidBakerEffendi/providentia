When I think about New York, and of course its natural and overflowing appeal as the 'other' great city, my mind drifts happily to this place.   This is such a wonderful establishment that by not stopping by here on your way through - you are quite simply missing out on experiencing everything a restaurant tries to do to make life more grand. The drinks, the food, the highly UNPRETENTIOUS staff, the decor, the neighborhood - it is like this place is just MEANT to lift a persons spirit up so high - only you don't fear ever being let down! And one more thing -  if I ever moved to New York, I would without a doubt find a place a block away so I could come here everyday - that is how wonderful this place makes me feel.
