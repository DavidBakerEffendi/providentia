Meh. This is a great bar to go and relax.....and thats about it. I used to drink there all the time, then realized that no one ever looked like they had fun. Everyone just went there to talk it seemed. The beer selection and prices were steller. Food was good, but very expensive. A good bar to bring a date too, but don't expect her to be impressed.
