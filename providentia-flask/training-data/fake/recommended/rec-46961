Stumbled upon this place after waiting over 40 minutes at Sabrina's. Cafe Lift sat us immediately and the service was great. The cafe mocha was the prettiest drink I've ever ordered & it was equally as delicious. I had the mushroom frittata with toast & the best red potatoes. I also love that you can order one buttermilk pancake on the side. The homemade hot sauce was definitely hot but so good with the potatoes. The food was fairly cheap for the generous portions you receive. I would definitely go back to this place.
