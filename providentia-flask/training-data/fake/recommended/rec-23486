First off, Cafe Ghia, you need to change up your menu. Very little has been added since you've opened. I live around the corner and visited your establishment at least a dozen times. Child, please. Food is greasy, burgers and steaks usually overcooked and some of the waiting staff is extremely rude. Good place to stop late at night for a drink. This place as the potential of being great. Don't become another half-assed Bushwick restaurant. Seriously, make a seasonal menu or something.
