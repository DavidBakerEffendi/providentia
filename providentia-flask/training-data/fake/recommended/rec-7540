Based on reading the reviews, I had high expectations, but found it to be an underwhelming experience.   The atmosphere (or lack thereof) is just one big, loud, brightly lit rectangular room with not much in the way of styling. It was busy, which we thought was a good sign, until our food arrived and only 3 out of 4 people got their food.  Turns out they forgot to put in one person's order.  So she had to wait another 20 minutes for them to cook her meal.  Granted, it was busy, and sometimes these things happen. The preparations were all pretty basic.  This is not necessarily a criticism, more of an observation, since there are a lot of people (including myself) who can appreciate a plain piece of fresh fish.  But I guess I was expecting something a little fancier in a classy and sophisticated town like Princeton. My fish wasn't very good.  It tasted a little fishy and a few bites tasted almost rancid.  The sides were also plain.  The dishes that the other people had at our table were all good or somewhat good. It's not exactly cheap, but we didn't feel it was overpriced either.   If I didn't have such high expectations, I might not have been underwhelmed.  If i went in knowing nothing about it, I might have walked away saying "ok it's decent for what it is".  Either way, it still would be just 3 stars for me.
