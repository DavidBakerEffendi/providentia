Just got back from dinner at PT and it was fantastic! I went with a small group of friends (7 of us) and we sat in the back patio, which was lovely! It was small and quaint with strings of lights and wooden tables. It had a very relaxing atmosphere, a great way to spend a summer night. Everyone ordered different items and everything was delicious. The service was also great--very friendly and fast. I would recommend PT to anyone looking for great italian food with a wonderful atmosphere. It's perfect for dates or small groups. I can't wait to go back.
