This place is excellent for brunch.   Everything I've had is fabulous and the service is wonderful.   Try to shakshuka or Yemenite malawa for brunch.  You will not be disappointed.   I haven't been there for dinner yet but would like to try it out soon.  The wait is usually short if anything at all and the wait staff are very friendly and accommodating to large groups.
