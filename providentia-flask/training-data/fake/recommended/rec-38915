Smallest burger i have ever eaten.  If you are over 10 years of age go for the double burger.  Everything is extra here, including tomato, lettuce, bacon (weird round thin slice of something they call bacon).  French Frys were tasty, but really Milton Diner frys were better and cheaper.  Tried it because of Yelp, but no need to go back. they serve coke products.
