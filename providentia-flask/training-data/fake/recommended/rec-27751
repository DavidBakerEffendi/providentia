Really enjoyed our recent evening here.  Went for a special Blackboard Eats dinner and were happy to be discovering a cool little spot that we can visit next time we are checking out galleries.  Food was top-notch, the drinks were very good and we found the service to be knowledgeable and on top of things.  Looking forward to going back and trying more items from their regular menu.  A nice addition to 10th ave.
