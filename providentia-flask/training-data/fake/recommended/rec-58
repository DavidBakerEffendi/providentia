Jose Garces once again does it right, with mongo sized burgers, fresh cut fries and amazing beer and whiskey selections. Had a founders breakfast stout on tap while i was there, amazing. Try the Blenheim's wheated whiskey if it is still on the list it is a real nice change of pace and very flavorful. Space is limited so show up ready to wait or come later in the night, you wont be disappointed..
