Came here last winter during/after a massive snow storm, 10+ inches if I remember.... Love NYC, weather does not stop them from keep on keeping on!! Decided to do a food tour of some eateries around Manhattan. Went here with high expectations BC I heard about the Vegas location. However, I walked in and it felt too franchise-y to me. Thats mostly a personal thing. Between two people, we just ordered one burger meal with truffle fries. The waitress was nice and attentive even though she was showing a new hire the ropes. The burger is on the smaller side but not terribly tiny. I thought it was decent but nothing mind blowing. I'm Asian, so I'm use to msg... So i guys my taste buds didn't find it "unique". Lol The fries were good. Overall would definitely try it again with alcoholic beverages. Despite a snowy day, it got busy as the lunch crowd came in.
