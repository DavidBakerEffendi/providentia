Corner Bistro is one of those classic NY institutions that offers the magical combination of relaxed atmosphere with the right priced food. The burgers are delicious as others have noted, in fact it's about the only thing on the menu. That being said, the burgers patties are the size of a small fist and cooked to perfection with the classic American cheese topping. The atmosphere is move dive than dinner but the perfect place to catch up with friends over a beer and burger.
