I've never had Filipino food until I came to Jeepney, and I am in love.  Their bicol benedict is unreal and a must-order during weekend brunches.  Ube pancakes and the chori burger are a close second.  I also love that everyone from the bartender to the servers to the cooks are super friendly and accommodating.  I've never had a bad experience here. :)
