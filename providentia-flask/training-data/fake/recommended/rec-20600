Had dinner last night (Saturday) with friends.   The place was empty. I am not used to seeing this. The decor was not very inviting and I agree with previous comments about the staff, nice but a little gritty. The food was ok, but nothing was memorable. The gobi fritters were bland. The lamb byriani resembled Chinese fried rice. The shrimp vindaloo was our best dish with the shrimp nicely cooked with a spicy vindaloo curry. The chicken TM had a nice creamy sauce, but the chicken was way overcooked on the tandoori.  The naan was fine. Overall, I understand why they moved from main street Montclair to Bloomfield. The competition was too good.   The best part of our experience was the company we were with.
