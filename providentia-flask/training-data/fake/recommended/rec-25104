Positives:  I read the reviews and then tried take out from this place and I have to admit... I thought the food was a lot better than it was given credit for.  We have a very large Indian population in San Diego, and I would say my expectations are pretty high.  I got Paneer Tikka Masala and my BF tried a Lamb curry dish.  We both enjoyed our meals to the fullest.  The portions were very generous, the accompanying chutneys were delicious, as was our garlic naan.  Fast forward two days... Negatives:  We decided to go back for another dinner but opted to dine in this time.  Our food (shahi paneer and chicken curry) were again delicious.  The problem lies in the service.  My boyfriend (turning 30 in two weeks and sporting a very full and not even slightly prepubescent-patchy beard) ordered a Taj Majal beer.  The woman serving us quizzed him harshly about his ID, bent it (not in the appropriate "I'm a professional door guy and I know what I'm doing" manner, but rather in the "leave a crease so you can wait in line at the DMV for a new one" manner) and then stared at him silently for an awkwardly long period of time until he finally said "If it is this big of a deal I will do with out".   She sent another man out to check his ID and grill him again before bringing the beer (which was at that point not enjoyed).  There was no need for this, the ID is current (and recent- so it looks exactly like him).  It should also be noted that I opted out of enjoying a drink with my meal after witnessing this extraordinary exchange.  I am 26 with a current ID, but wasn't in the mood for any additional debate.  This experience ruined our meal.   I highly recommend this restaurant for take out- the quality of food is spot on.  Dining in is okay too- just don't expect to ENJOY a beer casually with your meal unless you're looking to be interrogated like you're 16 and sneaking through your bedroom window at 2 AM.
