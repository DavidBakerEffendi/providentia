The portions are good size, the food is very favorful, and you can bring your own bottle of alcohol!   My only complaint was that when trying to ask the waiter a question about some additional things on their menu after ordering he grabbed the menu and walked off.   The place gets crazy crowd and chaoic on the weekend so make reservations or go during the week.
