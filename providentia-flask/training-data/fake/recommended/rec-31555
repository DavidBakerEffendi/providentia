My wonderful husband of 32 years took me here for our first date over 34 years ago. It was so romantic and beautiful... a magical night that I will never forget, It hasn't changed and the feeling still overcomes me each time we visit which is not often enough, it is like Shangri la .There are too few places like The Manor ...and yes will be back soon
