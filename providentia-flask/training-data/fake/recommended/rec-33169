PROS: -Romantic lighting and ambience -Friendly service...prompt yet relaxed -Picanha was amazing...it was my first time trying the dish, and I'm in love with the combination of flavors and textures! -Passion fruit mousse and coconut flan were DELICIOUS CON: -Tried both kinds of calpirinhas (lime and passion fruit) and found them watery Still....can't wait to return here on my next trip to NY!
