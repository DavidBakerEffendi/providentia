Generally speaking, this is a great restaurant but I am always reminded of how dell'anima is just a notch better.  Good space, no hassle, great wine selection.  If you go for brunch, bring a healthy appetite.  The selections are delicious!!!!  But so heavy and rich that you won't be able to eat for the rest of the day.
