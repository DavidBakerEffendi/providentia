A group of five came here for dinner recently, and we all left happy. Front of the house service was very kind, as they directed a friend and I to the bar to grab a drink and wait while our table was being prepared. A staff member then found us in the bar to let us know the table was ready. Plenty of in-house beers to choose from, though they were out of my first choice, the oyster stout. Luckily, the red ale I had was a very good backup plan. I never met the guy, Â but George Washington must have had a good sense of taste, as the chicken pot pie, which the menu said he had, was very good. It had big pieces of chicken and myriad seasonings and vegetables. Be careful for small bones though -- probably just a fluke. Bread was served with dinner, and not before, which kind of seemed odd to me. The bread, which had a hint of anise in it, was good, though. Others got corned beef and cabbage, a beet salad and a burger, and they all seemed satisfied. All in all, nice place. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there again, but I enjoyed it.
