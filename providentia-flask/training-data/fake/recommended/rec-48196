If you're too stubborn to go anywhere else, order the "Old Fashioned." Pros: Open late "Old Fashioned" cheesesteak Cons: the regular cheesesteak Straggly looking sandwiches Cash only In my continuing trek for a great Philly cheesesteak I stopped in at Philip's because it was top 10 in a GQ article.  Mistake number one. Philip's is fine, it's not great.  The price you pay for what you get is reminiscent of Gino's & Pat's but with less flair and there's nowhere else nearby to go. Cheesesteak cheese was not shredded, it came in a big ol' slice that they dropped in thinking it would eventually melt.  It didn't.  Meat was a bit dry, low to no seasoning, bread tasted like it came off the back shelf of a low cost supermarket. The "old fashioned" was definitely the way to go.  If we had a time machine we'd go back and all order an "old fashioned."  It had an au jus type of dip, peppers were spicy enough to taste yet mild enough to enjoy for those who can't take the heat. Fries: crispy, broad cut, hot, never burned
