This is one of my favorite restaurants.  Everything was perfect - start to finish.  The best part is BYO(Wine)!!  Since the cuisine is seafood, I recommend bringing white wine.  It blended very well with everything we had.  I had the Skate, which was utterly divine.  The fish was flaky and it rested on a creamy leek sauce.  It immediately melts in your mouth.  It's a tiny place with lots of personality, and the people there are incredibly friendly.
