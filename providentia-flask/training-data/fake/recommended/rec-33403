service is fast and good went on friday night for spanish music and really thought the guy was ok. with a name called spanish fridays i was expecting a serious guitar show - i was expecting more singing.  the guy just played guitar for hours.  i guess it makes it where you can have a conversation all night which is good food is good, and we ordered the paella for 2 along with some tapas.  goat cheese tapa is awesome overall a very good place for a date because of the lighting and ambience. this place might be the best I will find in NYC for authentic spanish dishes because i was very impressed with the tapas and paella.  tapas are also awesome and have a lot of selection. the presentation for the dishes are nice also. you can tell they dont just throw everything together... i grew up in houston and was exposed to alot of homemade spanish food through friends and family. so if you have had homemade paella then you will notice the difference.  However, this paella is probably the best i have had from a restaurant while in the USA. will go back just trying to give an honest opinion and not trying to give out 5 stars =) i recommend this if you want to hear some live spanish guitar, and eat some good spanish food.  was definately worth the trip out. blue oysters on special for 1.50$ each before 6.30 on fridays. showed up at like 730 and missed the special.  planning to head back a little earlier so i can hit up the oysters!
