One of my favorite restaurants in NYC. I usually bring a couple work friends for some light bites and quick drink. Our usual 'go-to' items are the mushroom pot, marrow, and beef tartare--all amazing. They've got amazing cocktails as well... The Rum and Raisin, Celery Gimlet, and Cold War are my faves. Be sure to make a reservation or you'll be stuck at the bar.
