So here's the deal.  I don't mind expensive food, but I do need that expensive food to be nigh on transcendent or at least be something more than I can make in my kitchen, especially if you're using cheap cuts of meat: I'm looking at you short ribs and pork butt. Some of this food was great.  The pork buns were awesome as were the sweet breads.  I liked the rice cakes.  The winner of the evening was the steak ssam.   I, on the other hand, ordered the short rib hot pot for $24.  First, more than half the pot was full of potatos.  Second, it just wasn't a special dish.  The short ribs weren't very meaty, letting me know that they were the super cheap cut.  I was disappointed.  The hype might have gotten to me, but I expected more. I would like to go back, because there was a lot of hope in some of those dishes, but I don't think I'd be willing to wait very long for a seat.
