Love this place! The food is authentic and the Sangria is amazing..of course you have to BYOB. But this is one place I don't miss getting to when I go home, which is about 3 times a year. The service is good..only 2 complaints...it's small and they don't take reservations so if you get there between 6 and 8 pm on a weekend, you can expect a line up the stairs and out into the back parking lot. Second complaint is it is NOISY! Very hard to have a conversation..the atmosphere is loud and festive and the birthdays are over the top with bongos and all so don't expect a quiet intimate discussion here! but just not something anyone should miss!!
