Cozy atmosphere but subpar food. The food was lacking some serious flavor. From the olive oil on the table (tasteless), to the bread they brought (cold), to the pizza we shared (bland, bland, bland)... they were all lacking flavor and freshness. The Caesar salad would've been passable if it wasn't drenched in fake Caesar dressing.
