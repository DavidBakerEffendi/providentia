after hearing much fuss about this place, I had to make a trip out there to try their kati rolls.  The kati rolls are a bit small and they need more meat!  I got the Unda Beef Roll.  The beef was well seasoned, but it wasnt as tender as I'd hoped.  I think for the money, I'd rather go to the Biryani Cart on 46th and 6th
