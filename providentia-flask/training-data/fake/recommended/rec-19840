Best Brunch in Brooklyn!! Amazeballs! The line is no problem. Put your name on the list and then take a walk around the neighborhood. They will call you when your table is ready and all is good. Let me just say that the entire staff of Buttermilk Channel is a shining example of what excellent and caring customer service should look and feel like! While having brunch on a very busy Sunday, we brought an 11 month old child who was the center of attention. She was treated with the most amazing love and affection by so many of the servers and management. If you can find mgr Michael, he will make sure you are given the very best of what Buttermilk has to offer. Next, if you can request Chelsea as your server, she is truly fantastic. She will lead you through an exceptional dining experience. Â Warm, friendly, and caring. I truly could go on and on about how well we were treated here... Now for the food-- it's straight up Delish!!! No joke, the reason the line and wait are long is because the food rocks. We had a brunch feast and each item was perfectly seasoned. Portions were large, and so yummmmm. First off we were given a plate of sweet baked treats that satisfied every flavor sense. The scrambles were so tasty and fresh!! Every item we ordered was hot out of the kitchen and made to perfection. Even the prices are really fair for how high quality everything menu item is. Try a spicy Bloody Mary and you'll be having seconds for sure. Even the hash browns are crispy perfection. This place is fun, the vibe is pure and so incredibly inviting. From the music to the smiles, I am going to be craving this spot until my next visit to Brooklyn. Well done. Thank you for the remarkable experience!!
