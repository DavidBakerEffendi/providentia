Went here on a Thursday night in the prime of summer.  Inside was relativity empty while the sidewalk out front was packed with people hangin', eating and drinking. I went in with my dining partner and we were seated immediately. The first thing I noticed how loud it was. I could barely hear my thoughts or my dining partner who was sitting directly across from me. I thought to myself, I must be getting old if I can't hear that well anymore. Our waitress was polite and quick and served up a delicious margarita. It was very cool and refreshing and I wish it lasted longer. The flavor was very sweet and I could have drank 100 more. I ordered a carnitas burrito. It was very disappointing because it tasted like it came from Chipotle. I was expecting something a little more authentic. It was a good burrito but not great. Also they need to go to burrito wrapping school, if Chipotle can  wrap a burrito just fine, then Dos Segundos could probably do it just as well if not better. I would like to come back here and try some of the other dishes since I do love Tex Mex food and there was so much on the menu I would like to try.
