Way back when, this was the first Thai restaurant we tried when we moved to Parsippany, and it was great.  One of the greatest things about this restaurant that I absolutely love is that they have a listing of their spice levels on the menu and they make it how you request it.  Most of the places in the area just don't seem to make their food with the level of spiciness that I want, especially when I order in person and they see I'm Caucasian. As for the food, each meal I've had here had been delicious.  The Tom Yum and the Tom Kha soups are both favorites, and can start you off with a nose-running spiciness if you can't handle it...but they are both amazingly flavorful without saltiness.  The Chicken Pad Thai here, always a great meal to base a Thai restaurant on, is so full of flavor that it might be my favorite place to get it.  The noodles are never overdone and the seasoning has been excellent...very tasty.  I've also enjoyed the Me Ka Tee and the Guay Teow Rad Kaeng and both were excellent.  Oddly enough, I really love the Jasmine Rice as well, just that slight hint of flavor...mmmm. The reason for three stars?  The prices...I love the food here, but the price of the food in comparison to the serving size just doesn't equal a good bang for your buck...and thus the reason that we don't eat here as often as I'd like.  I love the food here, I just wish their prices were a bit lower...
