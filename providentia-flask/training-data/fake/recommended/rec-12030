I've had pancakes from all over. None, I repeat none, compare to the light, fluffy and eclectic pancakes you get here every single time. My top choices: bacon, blueberry, chocolate chip. The omelettes are HUGE and delicious. The eggs benedict is great and...wait for it..comes with a SIDE of three buttermilk pancakes. The Dutch Baby is very good and different, and certainly worth a try. My favorite thing on the menu could be the cinnamon almond french toast though. Fantastic every time I order it or anything else on the menu. My only criticism is that they don't offer normal bacon. Only thickcut is available. I love my bacon and wish you could get typical thin sliced with your breakfast. However, if this is the only complaint, you're doing things right.
