I recently ate at Pacifico for the first time last month with a friend and thought it was quite enjoyable! By far some of the best mojitos in the area! The lobster quesadillas were to die for and the guacamole was yummy! The entrees were tasty and portioned appropriately so as not overstuffed. Desert was to die for...definitely have to have desert here! Btw...the presentation of the dishes was exceptional! Chefs made potato and caramel nests...too cute! Waitor service was exceptional! My water glass never reached empty, the waitress gave helpful advice, attention was paid to us throughout the meal, silverware was replaced after each course, the list goes on! My only gripe is that it was slightly pricey! I'm not one to complain about prices or nor did i gag at the prices...but the portions could be slightly larger and i wouldn't mind the prices as much! Even my mojito had a bit much too ice for the price...lol!
