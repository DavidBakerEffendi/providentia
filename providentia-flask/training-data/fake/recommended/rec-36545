Best Eggs Benedict ever!!! Ok so I'm a breakfast freak. I grew up this way, so blame my family. I love eggs in the morning and Balthazar has been in my list for years. My girlfriends wanted ti do brunch so it was the perfect excuse to host it there. Everyone ordered different breakfast type food and all were more tgan pleased. Get the huge bread basket its sinful and delicious. My eggs benny was perfect! I wanted more but it was gone before I knew it. Orgasmic! Why 4 stars? Due to their popularity you have to reserve far in advance for a group of 8 and the seating is very tight! I plan to return when I have just one person for easier seating.
