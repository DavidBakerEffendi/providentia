Another crepe spot. Good, nothing makes it spectacular but what do you expect? The crepes are very very good. I've never tried a savory crepe but the sweet crepes (strawberry, banana) is usually what I go for. But they have a lot of interesting options on the menu. What's different about the crepes here is that are folded and turned into a cone shape. A new experience if you are used to crepes on a plate! They take credit cards. Small place though! (Like most other crepe shops)
