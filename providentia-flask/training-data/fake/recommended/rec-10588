Amazing all around. I've been here a few times and the food never disappoints. The calamari is perfectly cooked with a light coating. The margarita pizza is some of the best around. My boyfriend has had the veal Romano and has enjoyed it as well. The desserts come from the bakery next door and are out of this world. Definitely worth trying if you're looking for authentic Italian food.
