Sushi is my favorite food. Sushi Yasuda serves great sushi. By the powers of logic, that should make it one of my all-time favorite restaurants. Unfortunately, the ambiance at Sushi Yasuda kind of sucks. It's a very business-y kind of place, so not great for a date or a night out with friends. Go if you are wearing a business suit. Don't go if you are wearing jeans. Do go for the awesome prix fixe lucnh ($22.50).
