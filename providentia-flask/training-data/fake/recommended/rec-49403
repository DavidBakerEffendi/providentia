WÃ¶w, I never thought vegan sushi could taste so good. I tried the Spicy Mang and the Nutty Buddy. Spicy Mang is not spicy at all. The peanut butter sauce on the Nutty Buddy is to die for! Presentation is spectacular with all the colorful veggies. The whole meal was so creatively displayed I didn't even want to eat it. It's affordable and leaves you at a good full. The only thing I am concerned about is the seating. The tables are extremely long and narrow. Seats are very close to each other, so expect to be sitting by a party of strangers.
