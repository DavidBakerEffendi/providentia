I loved this place when I was first introduced to it. However, now that I've ventured out to other Greek restaurants in the area and in NYC, Stamna is okay. The food doesn't really do anything for me and I'd rather go to another Greek/Mediterranean restaurant over this place now. The food has a little flavor, but it's nothing that's amazing. You can get the same traditional Greek dishes from other places and it's actually something to remember. For a first-time Greek food place this is fine, but if you actually enjoy this type of cuisine go to a better Greek restaurant. There are a few others that you can find on yelp in the area. The atmosphere is nice and the service isn't bad. It's an okay place
