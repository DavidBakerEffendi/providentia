Every week day between 4pm and 7 pm - with a few exceptions - Brauhaus Schmitz has all their draft beers for $4. That means you can get any of their world class crazy great beer and sometimes rare beers for $4.  I need to say that again, because you think you read that wrong: ANY draft beer they have is $4 from 4 pm to 7 pm.   Aventinus?  $4.  A BIG giant 17 ounce Aventinus is $4!!  A 12 oz BOTTLE of Aventinus at the Foodery is something like $12.  You can't buy this kind of beer and this amount of beer in Germany or anywhere else on EARTH for $4. How about a giant 17 oz Spaten Optimator?  $4. 17 oz Paulaner Oktoberfest:  $4. Ayinger?  They got 'em, and guess what, they're $4. I don't work there, they're not payin' me, I'm just letting you know that the best god damned German beer on tap in the city is $4. Also, the girls wear those push up bra things, so there's that... Here's the only thing bad about Brauhaus Schmitz:  The music.  UGH.  They constantly play that stupid oom pah music.  It's dopy.  Stop it.  No one wants to hear it.  It makes Brauhaus feel like you're at Disney's German Pavilion. I've been to Germany, no one plays that terrible music.  Quit it.
