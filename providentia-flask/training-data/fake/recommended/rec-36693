GREAT TAPAS :D Squid in ink w rice (txipirones en su tinta), lamb skewers (pinchos morunos) and the simple toasts with salsa were my faves. I also had a glass of the most delicious red wine from southern Spain - unfortunately they don't post their wine list and I can't recall the name - but I think about it all the time! Aside from the awesome food - the ambiance is nice. I'd recommend going with one other person so you can sit at the bar and get the skinny on special dishes and wines fro the very friendly bar tenders. This is a great stop if you're gallery hopping.
