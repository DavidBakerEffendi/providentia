First off, the food was unique and very, very good. Happy to support a local small business, whenever possible. Ordered the beef and lamb rolls (#10 and #11) and both were spiced perfectly with incredible flavors. Reminded me of a hole-in-the-wall Indian version of Chipotle; bravo to the kitchen staff. Once I was able to place my ordered, got my food within 10 minutes. However, being 3rd in line upon entering to a nearly empty restaurant, the lone cashier decided it was prudent, without a backup cashier present, to close out his cashier at that exact moment. We waited and waited.. And waited some more. A line began to form and went nearly out the door as he slowly recounted all of his receipts, while paying no attention whatsoever, to the growing line of customers. Finally, about 15-20 mins later, his boss angrily instruct for him to get back on task. This was unacceptable and ruined my entire experience. So while the food was truly terrific, the service left a lot to be desired. And service is a very important part of any restaurant, regardless of size. Fix that and this would easily be a 4-4.5 star place.
