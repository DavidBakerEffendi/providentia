A trip to Philly wouldn't be complete without a stop at Govindas.  Although last time, my friend and I drove here at 9 PM on a Sunday - and they were opened until 10 - yet they had the doors locked and said they were closed.  Messed up, right?  The soy protein bomb thing is amazing...and finish it off with the vegan peanut butter bomb.  DAAAAAMN!!
