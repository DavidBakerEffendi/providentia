Stay away from the Cocktails! Even at their Happy Hour Pricing.. they were just not good! I sampled the four drinks that my dinner mates ordered and I was glad I stayed with my beer. Nashville's style hot chicken was prepared by having the chicken marinated in buttermilk, breaded, sauced using a paste that has been heavily spiced with cayenne pepper. This is the first time I ever have Hot Chicken so I don't have other to compare toe's how was the chicken?! My dear friends ordered the extra hot Hot Chicken for me. The spice was not as intense as I expected but it did have enough heat. The chicken itself was quite juicy and 3 piece and a side for $13 which is quite reasonable in price. The other items we ordered were not as memorable Crispy fried shrimp? Cured Ham? Apple Pie A la Mode? I would come back to Peaches HotHouse for the Hot Chicken, but just the chicken.... Extra Hot with some iced cold beer?!
