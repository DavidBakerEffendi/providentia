As a student at the New School, I'm constantly looking for reasonably priced, delicious, and hip (because New School) eats in the 14th-11th St, 5-6th avenue radius.  Hu Kitchen is directly across the street from the new University Center building, and it has tree stumps for seats, so I was expecting it to be flooded with students. It wasn't. I opted for a combination plate, which includes an entree and side for somewhere in the $12 range. I opted for the chicken and broccoli. Now, due to my own stupidity, I ordered a 1/2 chicken instead of the 1/4 chicken that is usually included in the combo. So, I ended up with a $20 lunch and too much chicken for one person. Nevertheless, the chicken was very well prepared, and I'm not going to let my personal grudge against chicken portions sway my overall opinion of this place. The broccoli, on the other hand, was surprisingly spicy. I couldn't put my finger on what the spices in the broccoli were exactly, but it was a bit overwhelming. I went back a few weeks later because I was still in New Year's resolution diet mode and I wanted some overpriced vegetable juice between class. They didn't have the green juice with added apple and ginger that normally pacifies vegetable adverse people like myself. I ended up getting whichever green juice in the display case looked the healthiest. Taste-wise, it wasn't as good as Liquiteria. It was a bit more... Watery? But still, $10 well spent, I guess. Overall, if you're in the Union Square area and you have a lot of money and absolutely need some chia-seed, kale, coconut water, green juice bullshit come here. If you're with a friend who  has a lot of dietary restriction, just loves being generally picky, or is from Los Angeles, this would be an excellent place to bring them.
