Woke up at noon, after dreaming of a tasty burger, so I went to Mark's for some sliders and passed Pommes Frites on the way there. Ordered my sliders to go, went back to Pomme Frites to pare it with some tasty fries. Great dipping sauces, I asked for some recommendations and the guy at the counter put three different sauces on a heavy napkin with a few fries for me to figure out what I wanted. Definitely do this as it's the only way to figure out which of the insane number of sauces to buy. My only complaint: They cut their fries so irregularly that the really thick ones are a little under done and the little ones a bit over done. It's nice to have diversity in the fries, as long as the largest ones are still fully done. I do believe they do the double fry here - fry them till they're cooked at a low temp, let them rest, then fry them at a high temp till their golden awesome. I only made it through half of the smallest size order with my two double sliders from Marks, and still went into a food coma that led to a three hour nap. A bit expensive - 6.50 for smallest size with three sauces. Wish they had a kids size so I could actually finish the portion and justify the cost when eating them with something else from another place.
