One of the most fabulous dining experiences of my life!! The food is presented like works of art. The tastes and flavors are AMAZING!  True, "farm to table" dining.  Every aspect of this restaurant is an absolute home run! The staff was tentative and friendly. The chef himself came out and chatted with us.  The decor is modern and elegant. We will definitely be returning. Side note, after dinner, we decided to have a nightcap in the restaurant's bar. We were fascinated to see the television screens in the bar were actually live streaming the head chef executing the dishes on the pass! Very cool to watch!
