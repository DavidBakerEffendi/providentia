I've never had better Greek than at Kanella.  It's a crowded space but there's a reason it's so packed.  Our server was incredibly detailed in his descriptions and everything that came to the table (there were six of us, IIRC) was amazing.  I won't bother detailing what we ordered because you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!
