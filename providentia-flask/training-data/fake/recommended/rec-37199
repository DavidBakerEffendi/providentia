Stopped in a whim for lunch, as a change from the typical sandwich fare, and I'm glad I did! As I was checking out the lunch buffet, the hostess came over and answered all of my annoying questions, and was very patient and accommodating. The buffet is small, but they had a nice variety of dishes available and plenty of vegetarian options, which is what sold me. I got both vegan dishes - lentil dal and a spicy veggie dish in a tomato sauce - rice, lots of salad and plenty of naan. It was all very tasty - the veggie dish was a bit on the greasy side, but that's not super surprising with Indian food, and the spices and flavor were great, and the lentil dal was delicious. The naan was warm, soft and goo, and the salad was very fresh, with a nice amount of fresh veggies (not just lettuce!). I took my lunch to-go, so I can't speak to the service as a sit-down patron, however the hostess was nice and helpful, brought me a nice to-go container and bag for the naan, utensils and napkins. The $10 price tag was a bit more than I'd spend on lunch all the time, but for a tasty, satisfying meal, it was worth the cost and a much better alternative to the lame sandwich.
