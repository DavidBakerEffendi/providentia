One of the few places in the city where you can get a decent lunch for around 5 bucks. Â The sandwiches are packed with meat and rotisserie chicken platters have sides such as mashed potatoes, mac & cheese, brown rice, steamed veggies and soup to choose from. It gets a little crowded between 12 and 2pm due to all the suits taking their lunches at precisely the same time, so if you plan on going, prepare for a free-for-all in lieu of an organized line at the deli counter. I am not opposed to giving a blue-haired old lady a kung-fu chop if it means getting some Kennedy.
