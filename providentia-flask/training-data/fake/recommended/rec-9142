holy halal! i got the gyro over rice and the gyro sandwich.  it was the best tasting flavorful gyro i have ever eaten.  the white sauce is some kind of magic in my mouth and the spicy sauce is really spicy, which is a good thing!! i inhaled both...only$10 for two dishes! they are not stingy with their meat and hot and fresh! what else more can you ask from a cart on a street?? deli-ci-o-so!
