One Wednesday afternoon, a friend and I sat in the sunny corner booth for something like five hours.  It felt idyllic: we had a breeze coming in through the large open windows, a view of the street framed by happy-looking flower boxes, and plenty of fresh cocktails (wine only, though).  The vibe at this place is usually tranquil, the staff is calm (obviously, since my friend and I chilled for such a long time and they didn't freak out about it), the decor is cool rustic as apposed to cute rustic (cute rustic is annoying), and every time I'm here I feel like I'm not in New York City anymore.  The food is good, too.  The kale salad is a number one hit on the vegetarian charts, and for the brunchers: try the biscuits and jam.  It is pricey, so casual lunch spot this is not, but if you have friends in town, or it's check day, treat yourself.
