awesome beer selection. The food is awesome but not very healthy. My fav part was the suicide onion rings. I normally stray away from spicy, but the spicy kick that these rings gave you only lasted a few seconds on your pallet and was off set by the sweetness of the onions, making them very addictive. The fried pickles were fried in a tasty beer batter, but the pickle was a little bit overwhelming, maybe pickle chips would be less intense. The chicken fried portabello sandwich was tasty and the fries that came with it were seasoned quite nicely. I think I gained ten pounds but I left happy.
