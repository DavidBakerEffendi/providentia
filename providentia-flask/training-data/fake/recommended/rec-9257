It's oftentimes difficult to find restaurants with a true commitment to quality ingredients integrated with creative and simple dishes.  Cookshop has accomplished this with flying colors. Recap: Purselane Salad with Mission Figs and Toasted Hazelnuts Rabbit Liver Mousse with Peaches and Italian Parsley Goat Meatballs with Yogurt Sauce and Dandelion Greens Pheasant Leg with Chanterelles, Fingerling Potatoes, Green Olives & Green Beans Strawberry Almond Tart with Lemon Curd and Milk Ice Cream Either I am deprived or these guys had a great night of service because it was undeniably delicious.  Truly balanced in every way:  proportion, seasoning, temperature, plating.  I would imagine that they are consistent every day judging from the dinner hubby and I had tonight.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it... Total with tip: 105 (with a generous tip) 1 Glass of exceptional red German (yes...red German!) wine (complicated name, as usual) 1 cappuccino 1 bottle of still water plus the 4 aforementioned items Very subtle ambiance...this place is definitely focusing on the food. So if you like large portions for low prices, this may not be the place for you.  But if you like quality-driven food with what we think is affordable and consistent.....YOU HAVE TO CHECK OUT COOKSHOP! Will definitely go for brunch someday....
