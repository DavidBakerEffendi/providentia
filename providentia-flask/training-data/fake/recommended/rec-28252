Just amazing! The menu takes comfort food to a new level. Do not let the name fool you. It's not a greasy joint but comfort food with hints of refreshing taste in your mouth. The salads are all very tasty, we love the pear salad. Had the crack n cheese!!! Must have but I think they're retiring it for the fall. Sad! The pork belly sliders were very good, the fried brussel sprouts was also tasty, the desserts were simple and the fried chicken is a winner! We live living in Sunnyside and happy this great restaurant is in the neighborhood. It gets busy around dinner time, but leave your name and phone # and they call you! Most of the time the wait is not long. Also, they have an assortment of beer...compliments the food!
