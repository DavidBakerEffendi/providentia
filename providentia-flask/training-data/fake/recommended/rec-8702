i was craving for some chicken but looking for something different, being a Filipino i decided to get a taste of the famous 'chicken joy' (go to my country and ask this to anyone, i doubt anybody will say 'i don't know that'). the size is a bit bigger but the taste of the chicken is the same the way it is made. get the gravy they serve because that will complement the taste. downside of this place: - service is slow, you will be standing in line for about 10 mins, so if there are about 5 or more people ahead of you, expect a longer wait. one thing i noticed is that there were a lot of crew moving around the counter and just chatting altogether but not even helping out the next customer in line. manager and supervisor was walking around and not even helping out. - french fries is not fresh. you know that french fries are good when it just came out of the fryer. even when it cools down, you will still get a good bite. the one that was served to me, was so tough that you know that it was sitting on that warmer heater for a long time. seems like it was overcooked or re-heated going back for more...i'd rather fly out to my country for the real deal! i was there 9/24 around 5:30 pm
