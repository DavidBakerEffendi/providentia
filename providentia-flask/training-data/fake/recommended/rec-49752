I would recommend this authentic thai place in Burlington/Winooski area! I love moo ping, suki hang and their dessert, kha nom kok even their 'no whining sign'. Also, their Kua Kling is SOOOO GOOOD! Its spicy enough to cause runny nose. But it was really good. I can't find any thai places that serve Kua Kling in New York as good as tiny thai does. The price is reasonable cheap, service was phenomenal. Went there for 2 days in a row when I visited Vermont and it was packed both days. This restaurant will definitely be on my to do list when I go back to Vermont. Thank you, tiny thai, for your hospitality and good food (:
