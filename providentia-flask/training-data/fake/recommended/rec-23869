BEST roast pork sandwiches and arguably the best cheese steaks as well.  If you go during the lunch rush you'll most likely have to wait in line for a bit; but I promise it'll be worth it. Friendly group of people and the sandwiches are all very fairly priced.  For the value; they are MUCH better than Pat's or Geno's.
