I must have done something fantastic in my previous life to have Barboncino open up directly across the street from me. Every pizza I've tried here has been amazing: the margarita is exquisite, the sauce perfectly tangy and light, the balance of crust, cheese, sauce, and basil absolutely perfect. The cherry stone clam pizza haunts my dreams, and the arugula's flavor combination is nothing short of genius. The wine selection is great, the service attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere perfect for a meal with friends or a date, though I also find myself getting takeout pretty regularly too. A few minor notes as to why I didn't give this 5 stars: the two appetizers I've tried (fire roasted peppers with burrata and the white beans and pesto) were both a little boring in comparison to the amazing pizza. In my opinion, you're better off saving room for more pizza. Also, the tables should have oil and vinegar for those who like to dip their crust. Finally, based on my experience I would not recommend visiting the bar just for a drink, as the atmosphere at the bar isn't nearly as friendly as that in the restaurant as a whole.
