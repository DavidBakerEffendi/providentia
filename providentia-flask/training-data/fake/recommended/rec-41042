Visited this restaurant on a Thursday night.. The ambiance is good and the wait staff are attentive..We got a table by the front window opening onto the sidewalk. The restaurant is a 1/2 mile walk from the 14th Street PATH. The food is what really made the visit worth it. The guacamole sampler is a must-try : you get 3 types of guacamole with a bowl of chips. All 3 are amazing twists on traditional guacamole. For entrees we had the cod with truffle butter (excellent), lobster tacos(v tasty) and the enchiladas. The food is not your run-of-the mill Mexican food smothered in cheese and beans thats served by chain restaurants, . Each dish has a distinctive flavor and texture. The portion sizes are just right, especially if you have guac and cocktails beforehand. For dessert we tried the churros and the banana cake with ice cream. The churros were crispy but the banana cake was only average. I would definitely go back.
