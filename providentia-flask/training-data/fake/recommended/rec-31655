I came here for dinner a few Fridays ago and left satisfied but slightly underwhelmed.  We ordered the cheese empanadas for our apps, and they were very tasty...bigger and cooked to perfection.  However, my entrée was what I was disappointed by.  I ordered the vegetable fried rice and it could've used a lot more flavor and seasoning.  Besides, my entrée, everything else was decent.  Nice ambiance, good for a date or catching up with a friend.  Not too loud so you can get deep in conversation.  I may be willing to go back and try it out again.
