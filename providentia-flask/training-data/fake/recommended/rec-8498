Went here for our anniversary. Waiters wear the red jacket and the bussers are in white shirts and suspenders. Linen covered tables in a nice and quiet and intimate setting. Pricey, but this is NY! Â We started off with 2 bowls of pasta e fagioli soup. It was ok, just..lacking something. Bread was crusty Italian loaf and tasty pizza bread. came with butter. No oil? It's ok. She had Chicken with cheese, potatoes and asparagus. Very delicious. I had the Linguine Sinatra, which is Linguine with seafood. Very good, pasta was cooked right, Lobster was removed from the shell, the clams and other seafood was fresh and the gravy was good. Too much to eat, took the rest home. Service was top notch. Had more than one server take care of us, the busser even crumbed the table. All in all, I'll definitely check this place out again. bill wasn't oo bad, add on 2 glasses of wine and a bottle of Pelligrino, the bill was $120 before tip. Well worth it.
