Creating an account on Yelp just to write a review for this place. I have never experienced better service in my life, and I admit I was taken aback slightly by it-- previously, I had held a stereotype that New York wasn't exactly the place for that. My family and I had tickets to the Daily Show last Thursday, but I also had a professor that required me to take an online final at a time when I couldn't head back to our hotel, and there were no normal Wifi hotspots (e.g. Starbucks or Dunkin) in sight. Fear not: we emailed American Retro before we went and got the nicest reply from one of the staff, who we immediately ran into when we walked into the place. I wish I had got the guy's name, but he ran around getting me the Wifi password for the place and gave me and my family amazing service. As an aside, I had the pizza tater tots while writing out an essay, and they were godly. My family was equally pleased with how good their meals are, so bear in mind this place is great in many more ways than just their service. To top it all off, my mother forgot her credit card here, but our awesome server ran across the street and caught us waiting in line at the Daily Show to return it to us. All I can say is that this guy, along with the food/environment/other staff, made me seriously reevaluate my opinion on New York City and on what "customer service" means as a whole. Thanks so much for reading, and I hope I can go back to this place every time I visit the city. If our server happens to read this, I'm convinced you are an angel. Thank you for being so considerate, patient, and funny!
