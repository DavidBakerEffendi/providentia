Sometimes you want a classic Greek style pizza, and this place totally delivers. Â Try their chicken pizza, crispy chicken on top! Big fan of their subs, too! Italian combo and add some capicola! Classic pizza shop style with great toasted roll and a bunch shredded lettuce ... Sooooo good. I'm glad this place is here.
