Great brunch deal. For $25, you get all you can drink for 1.5 hours plus either 2 tapas and 1 side or one 12" pizza. The tapas/side seemed small but I got the pizza anyway. The sausage & caramelized onion pizza was amazing. The room in the back is cool - there is a sunlight so it almost feels like you're outside. The waiters were attentive with the refills. I'm sure they don't use the world's finest champagne for the mimosas and bellinis, but they were pretty good.
