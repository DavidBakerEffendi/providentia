it may be blasphemous to say this about an insanely popular spot, but: i didn't dig it. A+ for the atmosphere B's all around for the food we came for a late breakfast, ordered the french onion soup and eggs norwegian.  not bad, but not DELISH.  and the prices weren't very good for what it was... perhaps we came with too high of expectations, but i won't feel compelled to come back again anytime soon.  loved the vibe though!
