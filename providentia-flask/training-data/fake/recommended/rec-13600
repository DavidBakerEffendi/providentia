What is the hype about? It's dingy in here..very dive-y. Â I just wanted my burger and leave as fast as possible. I was very uncomfortable. The burger to me was tasteless. I dont understand the hype. It's just ground beef shaped into a hamburger...with no seasoning. Okay. Anyone can do that. Doesn't matter not coming back.
