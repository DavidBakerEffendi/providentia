I like my food like I like my men. Cheap and Fast :D with a free show! Merely kidding. However, if this Noodle house is actually a man, i would be all over him. For $5.25, I was given a decent bowl of beef brisket noodle soup with chinese pickled veggies within 5 minutes and a good seat facing the kitchen. What makes it a good seat, you asked? It's an open kitchen, so I can catch glimpse of the men making the noodles from scratch or check to see if they are spitting in my food. The peanut noodle is pretty good too, surprisingly. Like all restaurants in chinatown, come for the food, not the friendly service (its efficent though). I would love to stay there all day staring at the noodle guys as they create delicious noodles out of nothing but flour and water. But after ten minutes or so, they might think I am being a creepster or crushing on them.
