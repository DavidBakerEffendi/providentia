I was initially hesitant because of the limited menu, but I'm over it. Knowledgable, helpful and friendly staff made me feel like a regular. Noise level a little high at happy hour, but by 8 it was cozy. Too much wine to describe, but unintimidating given the advice provided. Loved the red wine, oxtail risotto balls and our charcuterie/cheese plate. Kale salad needed something to balance the fresh lemon juice dressing, but overall the food quality was high. Dessert was a '73 Madeira, sophisticated and aristocratic. My girlfriend enjoyed a suggested Spanish red vermouth, that was unexpectedly delicious. Thanks Terroir, we'll be back.
