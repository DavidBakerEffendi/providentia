This is a great place for dinner! Good price, good food and good service Me and my boyfriend were in the mood for french and decided to go here to try. We always like to try new places and french is our favorite food. On a friday night, as soon as we came in we got sited right away. There was only one person takin care of the entire restaurant, and there were about 6 tables with people of 3 or 4!! I order a glass of pinot blanc which was very good. Appetizers: the pate (yummy!! Generous portion.We took it home because we wanted to save some room for the entree) Entree: Paella . OMG the best I ever had, it was so delicious, the seafood and chicken taste it so good and fresh. My boyfriend had the Steak Frites MR, which was delicious too! The steak was so juicy and tasty, cooked at the perfect temperature. We couldn't finish the entrees. We took them home and we sadly couldn't have any desserts either because we were so full. The place started getting busy, and it was amazing how our waiter could handle all the tables very well, give very good service and make everyone happy. I am coming back to try the rest of the menu!!
