Went here with fiancé and friends for New Years.  We were very impressed by the overall experience.  The price-fixe menu for New Years was impeccable and really stimulated your taste buds.  Obviously not the most affordable but definitely worth it if you want to splurge for a special occasion.  The staff was super friendly and provided great service throughout the evening.  Enjoy!
