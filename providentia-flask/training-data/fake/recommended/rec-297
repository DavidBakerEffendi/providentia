Came here for a quick Brunch after watching the entertainment spectacle that is Lafayette st. on Marathon Day. While the restaurant was severely undermanned & seemed unable to accommodate the sudden rush of diners, the Steak & Eggs was absolutely delicious, packed with flavor, & a relative bargain for New York standards.
