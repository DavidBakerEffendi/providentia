Getting pasta delivered by Seamless is always a scary proposition. Getting seafood delivered by Seamless is an even scarier proposition. I've had the Lo Mein Saltido from Coppelia delivered no less than ten times and each time its absolutely delicious. I cannot describe what the interior of the restaurant is like, the wait staff, or anything else on the menu. But if you want one item on the cheap that is spectacular, this is your dish.
