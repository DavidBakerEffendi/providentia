Went there last Saturday with friends.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  I went old school and ordered the Turkey Platter dinner.  Service was fine, drinks decent and we liked the atmosphere.  Prices were reasonable too.  The one negative comment I have is that our table was really sticky!  The waiter wiped it clean but it stayed sticky.  Guess that's what happens after years of BBQ sauce.
