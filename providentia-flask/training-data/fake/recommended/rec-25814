The Italian-American food here is fantastic, hands down.  The kind of place where you get a chicken parm, but not something authentically Italian. The family atmosphere among the staff is charming, but at the end of the day they also don't really care much about customer service.  Depending on who answers the phone when you call to make a reservation, or who greets you when you pop in to ask about a table, they can be downright rude.  They just don't care.
