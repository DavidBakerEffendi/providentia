Although the pizzas here are absolutely fantastic as well as the salads, I will not be returning here... At least not for late night.  I arrived to Bar a short time before last call after a late night of work. At 1:30 last call was called by them turning on the lights, I then ordered another drink for my friend and I. At 1:40 the bouncers then decided they wanted everyone out and came over to my friend and I and told us "you girls need to leave". I told him that I had just ordered my drink at last call and that I thought I had til 2am to finish my drink. He then told me he was closing that particular room and that I was to move into the other one. As I work in the restaurant business I know the feeling of wanting to get out of there and go home. I apologized and moved toward the other room. I was stopped at the hallway where the bouncer told me to finish my full drink quick. I was then told by the other bouncer that he lied  and he continued to taunt and harass me by saying the cop was going to cuff and tase me. Needless to say this place has terrible customer service and I will not be returning, regardless of their amazing pizza (which is why I gave it two stars rather than just one).
