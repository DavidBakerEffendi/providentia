Solid. Neighborly. Well priced. *Cue the State Farm jingle. But seriously, I like this place. Cozy but not deafening, energetic but never overwhelmed. The only dish I would warn against ordering is the crudo - everything else is tasty. There's a cute "outdoor" under a glass dome/heat lamp space in the very back.
