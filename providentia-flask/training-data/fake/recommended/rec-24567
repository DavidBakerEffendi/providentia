I'm a Cuban via Florida and I miss Cuban food immensely. This spot is the real deal. The decor is typical of Cuban restaurants in Miami. From family pics to celebrity photo-ops. There are maps of Cuba on the walls and a pic of Celia Cruz :) They even sell Jose Marti t-shirts! I highly recommend their bistec palomilla and rice with black beans. The maduros are always sweet and sticky and their arroz con leche almost made me cry of happiness. If you're a Cuban missing La Patria or just need some authentic homemade food like Abuela used to make, take the 7 to Queens and visit this place. This restaurant is so good Mr. 305 himself should write a song.
