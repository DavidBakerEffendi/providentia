For Â all those complaining that this isnt the Original rays or that they came here for that, I have news for you its Prince street pizza and by far way better than the Rays that was here before it. I grew up in the the neighborhood and have eaten a slice in every pizzaria in the LES and East Village and I have to say this Place Rocks. Their square slice is beyond comparison. Im not going to compair Prince pizza to my other pizza haunts because they are all good in one respect or another, but Princes Pizza is top notch. Forget Rays its not here anymore. Whats here now is one of the Best Pizza joints in NYC bar None...oh and by the way stop Whining about lack of seating its an NYC tradition to grab a slice and go you should all be lucky that there is seating in here at all........
