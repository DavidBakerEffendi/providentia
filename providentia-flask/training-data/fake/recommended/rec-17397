I've been to Senoritas a few times and always had a great experience. They are one of the best Mexican places in North Jersey. The food is flavorful and tasty with just enough spice to it. The chips and salsa you get when first seated are also great. You can tell the salsa is homemade and not from some can. I've had fajitas, tacos& burritos at this place and all were great. Very nice sized servings too. You won't leave this place hungry. They also have a very nice drink menu and they make a great pina colada. The d√©cor is nice and the seating comfortable. It can get loud at times due to the attached bar. But overall Senoritas provides a great place for really good Mexican food. Consider me a fan.
