This place is the closest thing to northern california that you can get in Princeton-- not unlike Berkeley's "juice bar collective" Tico's has excellent fresh squeezed juices, and very delish lunch specials. -do not miss the lunch special of fresh pork tacos with rice & black beans (very high quality yummy juicy pulled pork and all ingredients are fresh and perfectly seasoned) Note, however, that SPECIALS are definitely the key-- some of the standard menu has been less inspiring-- the nicoise salad, for example, Â is a disappointment. But as my friend Natashka said to me when she visited Princeton, "for hangover cure, or just to retain your youth, try LEMONADE SPIKED WITH GINGER at Tico's".
