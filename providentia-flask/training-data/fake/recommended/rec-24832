I have NO idea how this place has 4 stars, it was horrid! I am actually writing the review as I sit at the table waiting on them to take our check with so much unfinished food. My friend ordered the eggs benedict which came with fried potatoes. The fried potatoes were not prepared correctly, they were boiled and drenched with olive oil. The eggs benedict was mediocre at best. I ordered the Rouge Burger, let me just tell you, I am a burger girl. This THING was tasteless and boring. Our bill with no drinks or tip was over $40...now we are walking to another nearby spot to have a real brunch. Do yourself a huge favor and go somewhere else. In my friend's words: I want to throw up. I want to throw up for multiple reasons. 1. It was disgusting 2. I was just done in the ass for $45 3. I have to go wait in line somewhere else.
