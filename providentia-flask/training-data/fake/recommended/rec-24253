Here's the thing: as a grad student, I need a place to work that isn't my kitchen table, is close by, and keeps me outfitted with coffee. If that place could be sunny, have cheap(ish) delicious sandwiches, and offer a generous discount for bringing your own cup? B2, I will finish my dissertation here whether you want me or not. Reasons for greatness: -$1 for coffee when I bring my own cup. No, it's not Japanese-pour-over-whatever, but it's a dollar. A dollar! -Wonderful sandwiches on good baguettes. -I really like that the baristas give you a spoon and a napkin no matter what coffee you order. Odd but nice. -Outdoor seating for people- and dog-watching. -Lemonade in the summer. -Last but not least, plenty of outlets, and kindly baristas who don't trouble me when I come in for one (one dollar) cup of coffee and stay for four hours. Thank you!
