My friend's favorite bar in Philadelphia. We went two nights in a row when we were in town last weekend. First night, downstairs bar, sampling the downstairs tap. Second night, upstairs, trying the mussels, fries, and deep fried bread pudding (all of which were delicious). I discovered a new Belgian fruit beer that I love: Katel Rouge (?). Gorgeous. Friendly staff, with lots of beer knowledge and little snobbery. Just the way I like my beer poured. Thanks Eulogy!
