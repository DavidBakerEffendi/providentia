Pros: Food is Great Family Style So If You Go With A Large Group You Are All Set. Con: if you can make a reservation or be ready to wait I have Been Coming To This Fine Establishment For The Past 10 Yrs. I Recently Brought My BFF To Eat Here This Past Weekend & After Spending 2.5 Hrs waiting to be seated I must say it was worth it. I will let you know this the hostess who doesn't have the mostest Michelle is RUDE and very uninformative. We would ask her what the wait time was she would not only give us wrong information but she would give us a dose of attitude I honestly felt like telling her to tone it down a notch or two she is only a hostess (no offense to all other Hostess ) not the executive chef or owner of the venue. After such a long wait We finally decided to approach a manager and ask him for assistance not even then did Michelle's attitude change. Carmines if you are reading this please place people that are customer friendly in the front area and people like Michelle in the back there is no room for unfriendly staff who look like they don't want to be there working with customers. I will not let her poor attitude stop me from coming back because the food speaks for itself.
