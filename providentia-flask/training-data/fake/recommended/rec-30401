I can't stress enough how much I love this TriBeCa gem - the buzzing energy, the delicious smell of food, and the occasional celeb.  I've been here twice already for brunch, and I'm determined that next time I'm in town, I'm coming here for dinner. The service is fantastic - very attentive and friendly.  The food is UH-MAZING!!  If you're looking for the perfect meal, it MUST be this: Sheep's milk ricotta with truffle honey served with burnt orange toast - heaven.  Pure heaven. Lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberries and meyer lemon curd - so so so delicious and fluffy Crispy garlic potatoes - the perfect balance of savory with the 2 items mentioned above. Also, don't forget to have a mimosa here...one of the best I've had. The prices aren't too bad considering the quality of the food and great service.  I highly recommend getting a reservation.  I heard parties get quoted an hour without.
