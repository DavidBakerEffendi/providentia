Came here for Omakase lunch to celebrate my husband's 30th birthday- often been for regular lunch but not the whole shabang. Sushi was truly superb, they catered to our every whim- hot tea replaced intermittently, well spaced servings so as to enjoy the meal, anticipated exactly what we would enjoy, we didn't feel at all rushed and it was melt in your mouth heavenly sushi. Superbly prepared and unequivocally worth every penny! We had 15 pieces EACH- scallop, crab, squid, shrimp, eel, toro and rainbow trout were my favorite. $200 less tax with delicious mochi green ice-cream to share. They were so generous and treated us to a fruit plate on the house for my hubby's b'day. So impressed by the no tipping policy (in accordance with Japanese custom) in terms of how well they take care of their staff. Definitely sit at the sushi bar for the full experience. My favorite chef is Tatsu. Something very low key, minimalist, high quality about it which makes it irresistible. Couldn't say a bad word about it- you truly come out feeling like a better person :) Perfect for a special occasion, or if you just like to treat yourself mid-week!
