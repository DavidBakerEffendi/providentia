It is very difficult to dislike a Japanese restaurant, especially in downtown Manhattan area. This one is introduced by my friend at first, so I decided to try it out. I have to admit it was just perfect, food, service, atmosphere, everything...we were so hungry at first so ordered udon as the starter. All three of us loved the soup! Besides, the sashimi combination and the steak were also delicious. The plum wine was the best I've ever had as the taste of plum was strong.
