Never order when you are super hungry.  So,  yet again,  we ordered too much because everything looked so good.  Had rice and black beans,  chicken,  oxtail,  and the stewed chicken. Everything was really good. I just wish food was a little hotter,  temperature wise (was only warm)...but can't go wrong with cheap and good.  But if you want excellent Dominican food,  make a trip up to Washington Heights.  FOOD is legit up there. Mmmmmmm....
