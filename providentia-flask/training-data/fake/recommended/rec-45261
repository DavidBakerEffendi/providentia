As a Scot  I was sadly disappointed with the entire experience. I took my family here who are visiting and was ashamed that we spent $75.00 on a 5 suppers.we walked in and immediately noticed the old bad grease smell.  We ordered then went into the gift shop to buy some sweeties and that. We noticed the cook microwaving sausages and were not pleased with that. We went back to the table and heard the microwave turn on 5 more times. Within minutes the waitress brought over our food. I ordered sausage roll dinner, it came with chips (actually frozen fries) that were cold and old, beans that were cold and two sausage rolls that were stone cold in the middle. I told the waitress after she already came back with twice microwaved beans and she took those to be microwaved again, the rolls ended up inedible at both ends due to the constant microwaving. My husbands sausages were microwaved then deep fried, they were black at the ends, it looked as if you could write with them. The fish was thick with hard crunchy greasy batter. My father was served a glass that literally had a crack the full way around the glass. The waitress apologized so much that we felt sorry for her and tipped her $15.00. The cook however joked and laughed about my cold food and never apologized. The owners of The Argyle need to be checked for serving ts absolute offense of Scottish food to people and having the cheek of charging 13.95 a plate. DO NOT EAT HERE.
