Review Summary: Ambience: 3/5   Food: 2/5   Service: 3/5 As the other reviews have mentioned, this establishment is very well decorated. It is a fitting place to  have an intimate meal, and the service is fine, et cetera. But really, let's get down to what we're all here for and talk about the food. I picked out this place to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and was sorely disappointed. The food definitely tastes better than it looks, but that isn't saying very much. We started off with the Scallop Capracio and the Rainbow Ceviche, both of which were the best-looking and best-tasting dishes of the night. Then we tried a few of the rice-paper/soy paper rolls, which came recommended by the waiter. I must say, these rolls were nothing special and even a little strange tasting. Although I liked the appetizers I could not overlook how mediocre the sushi was, and I left feeling quite embarrassed that I had suggested this place at all. If you have been swayed by the other reviews and still want to try Zento out, please do not do it with someone you are trying to impress.
