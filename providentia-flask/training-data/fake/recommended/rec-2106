We found this place while strolling through the area, and we're glad we did.  The menu is limited in choices, but the food was good.  The atmosphere is very nice, it is a small restaurant with shared tables.  The service was friendly and quick.  The burger was prepared as requested, but didn't quire fill me.  I would go back here if in the area.
