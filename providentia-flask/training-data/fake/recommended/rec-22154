My wife and I love this place. We've already been three times and I see us coming here as often as possible. We both love drinking wine and it very refreshing to have restaurant with an extensive list that is all moderately priced. Plus all their reds are kept in a wine cooler so they are served at the proper temperature. The food is fantastic and their specials are always killing it. The pork buns, when they have them are phenomenal and the last time we were in the had some of the best sweet breads I've ever had. We love this place!
