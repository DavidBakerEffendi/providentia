"If you're looking for a place that can please your chocolate needs, then this is the place for you". In Spite of that, Max Brenner's didn't "please" me all too well. The food is of little quantity for the prices and i wasan't satisfied with the taste either. The service was nice and welcoming but the waiter i had gave me the wrong order. I do love the desserts though. If you ever decide to come here, buy a dessert or else it won't be worth your time. The tables are cramped and the place is usually rather busy. All in All, come here once for the experience, but don't make it a pattern of a place to eat.
