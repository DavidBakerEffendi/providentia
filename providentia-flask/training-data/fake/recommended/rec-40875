LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. wandered into this little spot after walking aimlessly from bedstuy on a sunday afternoon, 4th of july weekend. many places were closed because of the holiday, but chop chop was thankfully open! the food was wonderful, and the service topped of the whole experience. otis was so sweet and aquarius (chef) was hilarious and kind. i got the plum ginger lemonade, which was super yum, and the breakfast sandwich. i also asked for some sides of their aioli. the chipotle aioli was superb. the lemon one wasn't very lemony, which i shared with aquarius, and he was very open to the feedback. awesome. friend ordered eggs and bacon and a salad (she's staying away from the gluten these days) and she said it was delicious. the guys gifted us with some pastries, which i had to eat, since friend was avoiding gluten (remember??). chocolate croissant thing was tasty. would definitely try more pastries. the menu was a lot more robust than you'd think, because of such a tiny space. fret not, they'll whip you up a masterpiece in no time. can't wait for my next trip to brooklyn! ps - they offer bike delivery too! sweet!
