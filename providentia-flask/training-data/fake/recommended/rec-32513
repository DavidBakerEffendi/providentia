Just went for happy hour and didn't have any food. The wines by the glass are super cheap during happy hour (around $6 a glass) and they have discounted bar snacks as well. Both myself and my friend were less than happy with our wines, I had the Aglianico and he had the Riesling. The bar tenders were nice but when I asked for recommendations, I like earthy medium bodied reds, he gave me a taste of 2 and neither were very inspiring. Considering this place is out of the way for me, I would not return. Also, on Sundays they have a meatball special and the place was full of families with lots of kids around, which I thought a bit weird for a wine bar. Not really the ambiance I was hoping for. I really wanted to like this place considering the large selection of wines by the glass, but it just wasn't for me.
