This little French Provincial place is one of the most popular places to eat in West Village. It is THE place for Sunday brunch and in the last couple of years it has grown the dinner crowd as well. One of the reasons it's so popular is their BYO policy - bring your own alcohol (usually wine) and they'll de-cork it for you and provide you with wine glasses. The other reason for its popularity is the food. To quote a ditsy blond we overheard as we were leaving the place: "I love eating here, cause the food is soooo good!" The food is good, but it's not as good as you might expect after seeing the size of the waiting line that usually wraps round the corner. Come early - 6:30 to 7:30pm to avoid it. The entree challenge was once again a draw. My boyfriend got the chicken in cream sauce baked in puff pastry. And say what you will about the french, but they know their puff pastries. I had the baked talapia special. Specials are a recent innovation in Tartine, they can be hit or miss. Sticking with the menu is always a good bet. The place is also famous for their desserts, though for the life of me I don't know why. They might be baked on premises, but then they sit in the display for a while and lose their freshness appeal. Bottom line, the desserts are passable, but nothing to rave about. If you're in the mood for something sweet after a dinner at Tartine, stop by Magnolia Bakery, which is a block away, and pick up some cupcakes - those will definitely be fresh, since they're bought up as soon as they come out, though you might have to once again wait in line.
