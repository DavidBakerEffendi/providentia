Honestly, I really wish I could give this place a higher rating. Their other locations are absolutely stellar, but the Callowhill Sabrina's just keeps disappointing me. The chicken noodle soup comes out cold, the eggs benedict is always askew (i.e., poached egg sits on the plate next to the english muffin, which is soggy from excess poaching liquid), and the coffee is either cold or overbrewed or both. The only thing they always get right for me is the bagel with lox platter, which just require toasting the bagel and then putting a bunch of raw ingredients on a big platter. It's not even like I always go at busy times... And the people who work there are just the sweetest so I can't even direct my displeasure at them, I just leave feeling really confused about why I keep allowing myself to spend all this $$ on meals that are consistently subpar. Dinner last night was a total waste and the restaurant wasn't even that full, maybe 5 tables full. And I saw at least 4 servers walking around. So call that the final nail in the coffin, I will not be visiting this location ever again.
