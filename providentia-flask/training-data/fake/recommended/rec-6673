Mmmmm, love that Kimchi sandwich!   Small little deli owned by Koreans who have a great selection of sandwiches created by the owners as well as outsiders hoping to post their recipe on the make-shift menu board at the deli.  There's a site dedicated to the deli, where if you have a great recipe idea, they'll use along their other popular sandwiches.   Talked to the owner and she was very generous and gracious to me...but then again I'm Korean so I got the "VIP" treatment. If I'm in the mood for Kimchi, I'm heading here.
