Was on my way to Lombardi's a few blocks away, but when I got there they were closing in about 15 minutes-boo! I searched for a new pizza spot on my phone and luckily for me-Prince Street Pizza shows up! If I've never been to a pizza place, I always go with their regular slice first so you can tell how good the place is. I ordered 2 regular slices & they were great! Perfectly cooked on the outside, the sauce tasted delicious & I was definitely craving more. The place is pretty small so groups of 2 people is really the way to go here. EDIT: Went back again the next day & they were nothing but super helpful and nice! I told them I was hoping to bring pizza back to California with me & they were so excited to make it happen. They wrapped the slices really tight in plastic wrap and put them in a bag so I can bring on the plane. The slices tasted absolutely delicious after popping them in the oven & everyone was happy. Thank you again, Prince Street! Can't wait to come back and get more slices.
