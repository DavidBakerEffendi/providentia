Pros: michelada (spicy beer), habanero margarita (that habanero tequila is stout), guacamole, enchiladas mole, steak tacos, ambiance, music selection, the staff, the "Godfather Seats" Cons: always a wait, no reservations, habanero margarita (did i mention the habanero tequila is stout? caveat emptor!) All in all, love this place and will be back many times
