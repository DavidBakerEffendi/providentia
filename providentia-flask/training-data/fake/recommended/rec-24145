Came here for brunch the other day. Love the atmosphere. The place was super crowded but we had reservations and got seated right away.  I thoroughly enjoyed the food....from the assorted bread basket....to the mushroom soup (which was very flavorful and delicious)....to the awesome eggs Benedict.  The food came promptly and made to order. My only slight complaint (not really a complaint) was the attentiveness of the waiter. While he was a great guy and very accommodating....he was stretched too thin.  Not horrible or even bad service, just not deserving of a 5 star. So 4 it is. Will definitely return
