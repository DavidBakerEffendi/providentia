I grew up eating Pepe's and was 21 before I tried the other NH pizzas.  Pepe's is the best.  The white clam pizza is unmatched for garlicky goodnees and huge chunks of clam.  Otherwise, you can't go wrong, even with veggie. Get the biggest pizza possible because half the joy is a long and floppy piece of pizza. And my grandparents bring butter for the crusts.  Double the joy.
