The music and the cocktails were good, but the bartenders have no respect for customers. I've been scolded in very rude manners for asking if i can order. After that we sat at the bar and also took us another 30 mins to get the bartenders attention. It is really employees only. I'm regretting spending a beautiful tuesday night here. Horrible, horrible place.
