I could not wait to write this review. Although I can't really tell you about the pricing because we chose the Restaurant Week Lunch Menu: 3 course for $25. The service here is fantastico. I absolutely love the people here. Everyone was polite. We had about 10 people waiting on our table. My gf and I ordered the same thing which was zuppa di zucca, Gamba di pollo, and torta di olio. Portion seem small but I left satisfied. Each dish came out in a timely manner and tasted delightful. Yes the dessert is really simple but I didn't want anything too sweet. The decor was simple yet beautiful. There is coat check available so you don't look uneasy at the table. I had a wonderful time and Â my friend is planning to come back already!
