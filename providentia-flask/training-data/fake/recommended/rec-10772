My husband and I had a great time here It's a little pricey but the food was pretty good and the drinks were as well, the only thing I didn't care for was the children's portions, $6 for 3 shrimp on the kids menu with a few apple slices -_- I should have ordered my monster a full portion. Beautiful view. Cheers.
