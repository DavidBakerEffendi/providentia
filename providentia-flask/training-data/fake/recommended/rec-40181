Fantastic beer list, and one of the most beautiful tap walls and over all interior build outs.  The "fries" were incredible. Taleggio truffle fonduta smothering the potatoes. Also the flat breads were very tasty and fresh. Service was quick and friendly.   Can't wait to go here again. Definite stop for any craft beer lover or foodie.
