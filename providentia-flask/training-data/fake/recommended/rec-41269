I'm glad I tried this place because of all the hype, but the broth of the Akamaru Modern just didn't blow my mind. The spicy ball of paste on the top was also a bit unnecessary. It was a kind of in between spiciness that gave it a neither-here-nor-there flavor. The noodles were also straight and on the thin side, versus the al dente wavy noodles that I prefer in ramen. I noticed some of the other ramen came with this kind of noodle, so it could just depend. For all the rave over the Akamaru Modern though, I just wasn't impressed. I also tried the pork buns which were raved about, but I didn't think it was worth the price. The iceberg lettuce it came with also wasn't to my liking. The prices were quite inflated too, possibly because of the fame and hype that this place as has. Even though this is New York, I still couldn't justify in my mind a $15 bowl of ramen and $9 pork buns. The venue had a very trendy vibe though, and it would be great for groups, since they had some longer tables. They seated us community style with different parties all at the same long table. Nobody seemed to mind, because they were all about getting some ramen! There was also loud top 40s music blasting with the waiters yelling out Japanese phrases every now and then. Â  Glad I tried it once, but probably not going to be my go-to-ramen place. Luckily there was no wait at all for this place at 6pm on a Monday, because it wouldn't have been worth an hour long wait.
