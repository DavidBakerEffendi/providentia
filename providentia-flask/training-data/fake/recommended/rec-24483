The atmosphere was awesome the food was horrible.  We ordered the Garbonzos Fritos, and the Panceta Con Albaricoques to start with two glasses of wine.  The waiter made the suggestion for the wine and we enjoyed them very much but the food was so bland and dry that we decided not to have dinner there.  The pork belly dish was the driest and tasteless pork I've ever had.  Our bill was over $70 and I felt we got robbed.  I was surprised by the good reviews this place has gotten because I'm usually a very generous person and I've never walked out of a restaurant before.  It's a beautiful restaurant that needs a new chef.
