So the wife is out and I want a Steak Walk over to the newly expanded Butcher Bar. Nice space, thoughtful service and order a rib eye I've been to pretty much every steak house in the city more than once, Maloney and Porchelli, Smith and Wollensky, Peter Luger, Keens, and more recently Porter house in the Time Warner center. Now its my own fault for not asking "How much?" but $58 really guys? Rib eye at Poterhouse a couple of weeks ago $49 yeah yeah yeah it doesn't include the side but really $58 Bucks Good luck
