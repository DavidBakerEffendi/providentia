Being Asian I grew up with dumplings. Aside from the handmade ones by my own mother, aunts, grandparents, I'd also have had store bought ones, specialty stores ones. Therefore, to say this is THE BEST? I couldn't concur. Don't get me wrong. I am not saying this place is bad. All I am saying it's mediocre. I had pork and chives, boiled. My partner had a sugar-free soy milk in clear plastic portion cup. I do enjoy the dumplings' skin. It's chewy with great bounce and texture but the meat inside is questionable to being the best. This tiny place is ran by very friendly and hard working people. I can see the crew working away with no signs of slowing down even approaching closing time. They close at 10pm but by 9:45pm more people were still lining up. I asked to use their bathroom in the back and it was horrifying. After I flushed the water spewed out of the toilet, making the wet bathroom floor wetter. The bathroom was kept pretty ghetto. I am just glad I had no stomach pains afterwards.
