Came here with my partner after a day of traveling. We had a Groupon deal for this place and it definitely exceeded my expectations (Groupon Now can be a bit of a crapshoot). It seemed like it could get pretty busy, but we were lucky to be seated outdoors right away. Tria has well-arranged sidewalk seating. Our server was attentive without being up my ass (which I hate). The wine and beer list are excellent and very reasonably priced. We had some bruschetta, a brie cheese, and a flourless chocolate cake, all of which were yummy (although the bruschetta is a bit overpriced for what you get). I will definitely be back here when I'm in town next. I know that if I lived in the nabe, it would be a staple.
