Rye may be a New American restaurant first, but it's bar should not be overlooked. Drinks are a bit cheaper out here at 10 per, but the bar is not as well stocked as some of the places in Manhattan, or Dutch Kills for that matter. But again, this is a restaurant first and the quality of what they have is great. Try the Blood and Smoke, it's earthy, complex and smoooooth. Oh, great food too and pretty damn good prices. 3.5 Stars yelp.com/list/best-cocktâ€¦
