New to the area, but have been treated incredibly well the past few times I have been here.  Order takeout and despite a full house, I had my food in less than 10 minutes.  Great vibe, yummy drinks, good food.  Highly recommended!  (the food is pretty simple and minimal, but that's perfect for someone trying to stay fit)
