LOVE queens comfort!!! I've been an Astorian for 5 years now... Hands down best brunch spot. However, the wait is a little too long... Avatar rules! But they always tell you it will take a lot shorter for the wait then it really does... And then when you feel you've waited that long.. Another 25 minutes isn't worth leaving over. Today we waited for about 1 hour in a half for a table for 4! When we put our name in we were told 30-50 minutes. Besides that, Queens Comfort is the shit! I got an amazing Benedict (can't remember the name) and make sure to ALWAYS get the disco tots. My next visit will be my 5th... And I can't wait to join the "5 timers club"!! Keep kicking ass queens comfort!!!
