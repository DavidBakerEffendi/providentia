My boyfriend and I were walking around looking for a little spot to grab lunch when we found this place. It's on the small side and very casual but definitely a good find. The cheesesteaks were really good (the best in Philly according to my bf, it was his first time visiting). I agree though that the cheesesteaks at John's are some of the best I've had. We sat in to eat lunch and the staff were very friendly and personable the entire time. We really enjoyed our lunch there and would go back again.
