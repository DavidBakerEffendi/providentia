Big Wong - what a name. After you get past all the jokes, you will find an authentic Cantonese noodle and soup shop. Â Great soups including won-ton. Fabulous chow fun, lo mein, vegetables, and the best soy sauce chicken in NYC. No kidding do a quick survey, while your walking through chinatown ask the locals where to get the best soy sauce chicken. I did. I even asked waiters in other restaurants, all roads led to Big Wong. Don't expect much atmosphere. Unless you like a local, authentic, older style place with Formica tables, tough staff, tea in water glasses, and utensils in stainless steel containers on the tables. The place is always packed. It gets pretty loud. All of this is part of the experience. If you like authentic Cantonese noodles, soup, duck, chicken, pork, vegetables, and sweet rolls. You won't be disappointed!
