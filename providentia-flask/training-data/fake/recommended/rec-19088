Went here after hearing so much about this place and the burger... did not live up to the hype.  Burger was too overpowered by the blue cheese so I couldn't really taste if it was a good burger or not.  All the reviews I read here on yelp said to try the gnudi, but it was too rich and not balanced out by anything else.  Actually I liked the two specials of the night better which were mussels and a burrata dish.  However I could find those dishes at many other restaurants that wouldn't require waiting for an hour.
