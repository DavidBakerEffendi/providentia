Great, friendly service.  Nice atmosphere though a bit dark and can get noisy.   Well made cocktails though wasn't impressed with the wine list.   Menu had a wide range of choices.  Lots of fish choices and everything sounded good. Started with the Foie Gras and Fried Oysters which are both awesome.  The Oysters are definitely a must! Entrees: Duck Breast:  I don't like duck but got this on their recommendation and it was excellent.  It was very tender and not as oily as most duck.  Didn't taste too gamey either.  It was delicious. Snail and oxtail ravioli was excellent.  I wish there was more though.  Portions were large enough though. I will definitely come back here to try some of the other dishes.
