I came alone at a dinner time and got seated by the bar without waiting. Ordered pork miso ramen and it was really nice!! I first thought that the soup was too greasy and the noodles were too hard but later found them go along really well. The meat was tender and the fat part was actually delicious! This tasteful food coming in adequate proportion at a reasonable price just give me a great reason for a second visit!
