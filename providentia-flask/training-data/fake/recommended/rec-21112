This is a great restaurant with a very friendly staff. The prices are affordable, "mid range" (not dirt cheap for a college student, but definitely below a pricey restaurant). My wife found the falafel to be a bit too crispy, but I have been very happy with all of their standard fare. I eat there fairly often, as we just moved into the adjacent neighborhood.
