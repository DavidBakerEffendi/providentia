In Philly on travel decided to do a taste-off between Genos and Pats. After reading the other reviews I was prepared to be disappointed. But instead I was thrilled. Perhaps they recognized me as as visiting foodie and whipped out their special meltingly tender, fabulously tasty steak (with whiz and onions) while secretly sending a grisly tough and tasteless sandwich over to Pats. However, at least today, it was no contest. Genos sandwich was a fabulous, messy, delicious guilty pleasure.  Pats tasted like bad high school cafeteria food. Lets be clear  - this is a cheese steak. So 4 stars needs to be taken in that context. But Geno's sandwich rocked. At least in the eyes of a sober, ex NYer.
