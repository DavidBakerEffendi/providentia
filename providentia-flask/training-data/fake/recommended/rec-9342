Down right to basics and yummy! Yeah sure west village trendy but not here. Casual, and cash only. From what I can recall I don't think they take credit. Love the burgers and nice cold beer. The spot is an old pup. Just keeping it real while the area keeps on changing. It's good to go somewhere that is what it is and no need to defend because it's perfect!
