The wings are really good. I'm also a fan of the burgers. It's just off the beaten path, so it rarely gets jam packed. Even when the Zog Sports post game drinkers come in, there's usually a seat at the bar. As an ex bartender, the thing that makes me a repeat customer is THE STAFF. The bartenders are all pros...Lucy, Liz, Audrey and Jason. Mgmt are solid guys as well. They're always playing local sports and on Sunday they have the football ticket. This place has become my new favorite place in Hell's Kitchen!
