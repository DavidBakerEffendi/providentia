Ok, this was my first experience with Vietnamese food so take this review with a grain of salt. The restaurant had a nice feel to it, good layout, plenty of light, lovely decor.  The wait staff was extremely attentive; my water glass was never empty.  The menu was somewhat large and confusing for me so I ended up going with the BBQ platter based on other yelpers' reviews. When it arrived, not long after we ordered it, I was blown away by the presentation. The food looked beautiful! Although I can honestly say I'm not positive what to call most of what was on the platter, I did recognize the spring rolls and lettuce wraps right away (those also ended up being my two favorite things).  I wasn't crazy about everything on the platter, but enjoyed the new experience. Also, the sweet and sour type sauce and peanut sauce were both very delicious. Thank you yelp reviewers for helping me make my first Vietnamese dining experience a positive one.
