Odelia: "What do you guys wanna do for lunch...?" Me: "Meh, I don't care, you pick." Usually I'm a bit of a control freak, and even if I say, "you pick," I secretly mean..."pick something I would pick." When Odelia suggested Woorkijip, though, I entrusted my Thursday lunch experience in the hands of Yelp, and it's online menu (which can be found at menupages). Rush, rush, rush. Buffet ($6.49/LB). Styrofoam? Really? What is this...1941 (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stâ€¦)?? Longgg lines, intensity. Big city, downtown. I heard that the pork lo mein was nothing to write home about, and the "cheese" croquets ($2.50) were very disappointing...but holy fuck were those veggie patties de-LISH ($2). And a serving of seaweed salad anyone? Only $1.50. Yes, please! I can't wait to revisit this gem of a place. KOREA, HERE I COME!
