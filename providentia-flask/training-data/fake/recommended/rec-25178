I've been here a few times, more times for lunch and once for dinner (meaning I've been here in the afternoon and once in the evening - there's no separate menu or anything haha). I was not disappointed any of those times, but I felt that lunch was better. Why, you ask? I strongly believe that it depends on who is preparing your grub. The first time I had the pulled pork sandwich with all the (free) pickled vegetables. Fair warning: Those red peppers are NOT sweet, they are VERY hot, especially if you eat all of them at once because you think they're sweet. They are pretty generous with the meat here, which is a plus. Overall, I was very satisfied with it despite making a mess while eating it. The next time, I had the brisket sandwich. Oh boy. The guy cutting the meat decided the brisket he was cutting was too small so he went to the smoker and got out a brand new glorious one...salivation ensued. After cutting the plastic wrap off, he rubbed the buns all over the slightly blackened and very juicy outside. Â A great mix of lean and not-so-lean meat made its way onto those buns, again with all the pickled veggies sans peppers. To this day, it's still one of the best lunch meals, especially for the price. I did not get the bun-rubbing treatment the other times I've been there but the food is always consistently good. I know someone who had the third rack of ribs and he seemed very satisfied. A note about the seating: It's cafeteria style so there's sometimes a wait for seats unless you want to sit directly across from a stranger. For quality BBQ in the LES at less than $10, this is the place to go. Also, do try the Ginger Ale. It's a bit pricy ($3) but very worth it.
