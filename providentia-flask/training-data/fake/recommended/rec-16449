Went for breakfast  on Friday February 10 with my girlfriend and enjoyed the food and the service was attentive. I  accidentally knocked over my drinking water and within seconds they were bringing paper towels to dry the mess. Our food was good, I had an omelet and the chimichurri potatoes weren't that special . My girlfriend had an egg avocado dish in  biscuits, she wasn't in love with the combination but the meal overall was decent and the host was personable. Coffee could have been hotter but was offered refill at mid way point. I will definitely be going back to check out the dinner menu based on yesterdays breakfast.
