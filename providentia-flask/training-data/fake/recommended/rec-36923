Hey NY'ers, I mean YELPers.  (I wish SF'er would be reading this but prob. not)... I had the opportunity to come to NYC all Christmas week...and have Sunday supper at Jane.  It was one of the best overall restaurant experiences our large (personality and quantity) group had. I had the Steak Frites- Marinated hanger steak, rosemary fries, bearnaise sauce...It was fantastic. I am a stickler for meat cooked to a perfect medium rare (closer to rare) and mine was prepared just like me likey likey... I typically get to a restaurant early to check out wines, the staff (hot waiter, fantastic visiting bartender) so I knew I was in store for a good evening meal after meeting them both as I sampled a Temparnillo and a Malbec.   This place has a great value Sunday supper, inviting warm aesthetic, terrific menu, "on-it  staff" (dang, I wanted to ask the waiter out...) so you should stop reading my review and make a rsvp now at Jane.
