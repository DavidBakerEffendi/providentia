This was... good. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. We came here for a quick lunch and they were able to seat us right away. This place has pretty tight seating, so be prepared to a.) listen in very closely to your neighbor's conversation and b.) be able to literally rub elbows with the table next to you. We got two pizzas and both were good. The toppings were all very fresh and tasty, but the crust was like a giant cracker. I don't mind a lot of crust, but when it's a giant oversized cracker, it gets old pretty fast. I'd probably come back again if someone suggested it.
