Wow.  I was thinking the food wasn't going to be that good based on all the hipster-looking people wearing oversized sunglasses indoors.  But after the appetizer arrived I changed my mind. We started off with a scallops with risotto (recommended!!).  Very buttery risotto, had these little green seasonal vegtables, and scallops slightly seared.  Loved it.  My friend got the big pork chop, and I had the halibut with lobster ravoili.  Pork chop was very good.  Not quite as good as NOPA in SF (heh...why do I always compare everything to SF restaurants...but very close).  My halibut was cooked perfect, the meat was very moist and flavorful. For dessert we had the beignets with sugar, fruit jam, and nutella.  Anything smeared with nutella has to be delicious, and these beignets were no different.  Will definately be coming back next time I'm in town!
