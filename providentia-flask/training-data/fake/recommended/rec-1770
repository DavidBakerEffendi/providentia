My friend loves this place so she brought me here. It was up-scale diner food, for sure. Had to have the disco fries, since everyone on yelp seems to dig them. They were good, but not amazing. Chicken and waffles were also decent, but nothing to write home about. I would come again to try some other options off the menu.
