Que Rico! I was recommended by a family member that works close by in the city hall! I was pleased with the recommendation. Ordered my usual, a Cuban sandwich and an empanada. The Cuban sandwich had more meat and goodies than a usual Cuban which I embrace! Bring on the food! The empanada was cold though but tasted yum. I was impressed with the fast table service since we walked in during the lunch rush and there was a long line for the take out area. I will go here again to try other foods on the menu in the future.
