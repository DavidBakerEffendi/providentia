Was worried about tiny portions for a huge price but Boqueria more than exceeded my expectations - it was excellent!  Went with two visiting friends, one a vegetarian and all our food was delicious!  The pan tomate is great; manchego was just 2 pieces for $5, but then again, only $5.  We all enjoyed the patatas bravas and the mushrooms.  I had the mackerel and the salsa and oil drizzle made me want to lick the plate.  Whenever creme brulee is an option that does it for me, but I wasn't a fan of their version; we also found the churros a lil dry.  However, I would go back just for the Spanish toast dessert - soooo good, another plate licking temptation.  The pitcher of sangria seemed a lil overpriced at $34, however it was good and not too sweet.   All in all, I'll would definitely recommend Boqueria and look forward to trying the Flatiron location too.
