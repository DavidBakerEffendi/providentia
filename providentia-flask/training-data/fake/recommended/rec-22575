So lovely. Went here for dinner last night with my sister and my bf. We had a wonderful meal, with wonderful service, and the dessert was absurd how delicious it was. Â  Everything was cooked to perfection. The mussles were ridic. The hanger steak my sister ordered was so flavorful and so were the potatoes. My salad paled in comparison to the burger my bf ordered - I end up stealing bites of his. But be sure that that salad was REALLY good. The price was just slightly less than $100 for three of us with wine, mussels, dessert, and three entrees. We took half my salad and half my sister's take home too. This will definitely be the place I take my out of town guests from now on. So perfect. Can't wait to come here for brunch. I'm not a sucker for themes at restaurants or anything, but this place really is solid. Great little French place for sure. My only gripe? The Eiffel tower pictures. Meh. Could do without and we'd still get the idea. I mean, the server was French. The menu was in French. We get it. Overall the decor is fine, just a bit cheesy is all. But it is pretty enough for the neighborhood.
