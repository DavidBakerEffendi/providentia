Maialino was good but not as awesome as I expected. The wine and wine steward were amazing. She presented me with 4 wines to taste and we discussed each one. Her recommendations were spot on. The food portions were adequate but the flavors were not as robust and complex as I expected. The next time I'm in NYC and craving Italian, I will try Lupa.
