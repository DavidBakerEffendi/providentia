This was one of the best restaurant week deals this year (a couple months back now, but for future reference).  Between two people, the restaurant week deal got us a free wine tasting, four apps, two entrees, and two desserts.  All of the food was quite amazing.  I would particularly recommend the green bean appetizer and the beignets for dessert!  The only complaint - part of the restaurant is not as pretty/good ambiance as the rest, and of course we were there.  Try to ask for a table in the main section!
