This place is the best sandwich shop in the USA.  I am a touring musician and I have searched far and wide for the best sandwich.  I have been all over the US and nothing beats Paesano's for a sandwich from sea to shining sea.  My band's manager, who also tours the country regularly, told me it was the best, and he was absolutely right.  My bass player agrees.  So there you go, 3 people who were looking for the best sandwich place in the USA telling you it's #1.  Every ingredient is just  fresh and delicious.  I am a vegetarian, but all the meat eaters love the meat sandwiches too.  I order just 2 different sandwiches, the eggplant and the chic pea pancake.  Both are beautiful, soft in the right ways and exciting.  I've had other philly hoagies and this one destroys the competition.
