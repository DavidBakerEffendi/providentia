By now, everyone knows the name Carmine's.  For those who may have gone on life hiatus or reside under boulders, you have been missing out on an experience that is practically a New York City rite of passage. The family-style menu provides portions large enough to feed a small village. I'm not really one to dine family-style, but I also can't finish an entree, here, by myself. I always opt for an appetizer, and as monotonous as it may be, I get the portobello parm every time.  It's just so... good. Mushroom and sauce and cheese, oh my! Despite the large dining rooms, both upstairs and downstairs, this place can get crowded, leaving you standing by the bar for what feels like decades to be seated. Reservations are recommended. The dim lighting and dark wood interior, with pops of red, provide a very authentic Italian feel that only adds to the experience. Because of the volume this place does, the waitstaff seems to be constantly frazzled. The kind of frazzled where they smile and give you the attention that you pay for, all the while, obviously thinking through the laundry list of tasks that they have to get done in about ten seconds after leaving your table. The menu may appear rather pricey, but once you order a bowl of pasta (or a chicken parm like my cousin did, against my warning) and they present you with a plate of food large enough to feed a small village in Zimbabwe, you'll see that it's really a steal!
