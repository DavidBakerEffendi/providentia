I have been coming here many times, by myself or with friends when I'm in town. I'm sad to say that I am not coming back here. I'm still at the restaurant and this waiter is the waiter from hell. I asked for another glass of water because it had something in the water and he didn't even say sorry or cared like nothing happened. That's gross! Just looked away and gave me another water. I spend at least $60 all by myself. I hardly have Filipino food so I always get excited when I'm at a Filipino restaurant and tend to order for more than one person. He took forever to give the menu and then take my order. I had to ask him to take my order. The food is good but service sucks here and this by far tops today. I'm disappointed because I visit here often when I'm in town. He is not a waiter. He basically take your order, bring your food and that's it. You will have to flag him if you need anything. I guess he is not getting a tip today LOL! Don't deserve it! I took a picture of him so you guys know who it is. Grill 21 Unfriendly Waiter!!!
