New hotspot in Hartford on Front Street? Yes, NIXS is serving up tasty American style tapas and a new spin on modern cocktails. The atmosphere is modern, upscale, and most definitely trendy. The staff members are young, hip, fast, funny, and great. Some things you may want to note before coming here: I would recommend coming here during the week for happy hour before you venture in on a weekend. It fills up QUICK, to the point where you may be brushing shoulders with Hartford's finest at the bar, or even waiting outside on the sidewalk for a table to eat. Make a reservation! It tends to get loud here also, and turns into a party after dark almost always, with rotating local DJ's that spin beats until the wee hours of the morning. Other than happy hour, this is a wonderful place to come before or after a show at the next door Infinity Hall in Hartford, or any special occasion event. NIXS also frequently partners with local businesses around town, and works with vendors to promote other products, drinks, confections, and more - great local community support!
