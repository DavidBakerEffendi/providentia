This place is gross. Came here and there was 2 fruit flies in my drink. When i told the waiter he looked at me like i was crazy as if i put them in my drink! The flys must of been in the ice. So he brings me a new drink and he brings me back another with more ice aka ice infested with fruit flies!!!!!! Hes the bald waiter with the buck teeth cant miss em. Â I ordered shrimp in garlic sauce the shrimps still had shit in them which is gross. Fruit flies and shit! The dessert was also stale and The rice n beans was deff rice a roni! It was terrible. everything was BAD i will never come again. If you want fruit flies and shitty shrimps make your way over there.
