I am a UConn student from out of state. When my family friend came to town I wanted to take her some place nice that was on the way back from the airport. The Mill On the River turned out to be a great place for this type of occasion. The setting is unbelievable. The walk to the front door makes you feel like youre entering a fairy tail restaurant. Once seated you will be overwhelmed by their robust wine selection. For food I ordered the Redfish Nouvelle and it was phenomenal. Perfectly cooked and great portion size. I would certainly come back here just for the food alone. The reason I gave it four stars was based on the clientele the restaurant caters to. It felt like a geriatric eating club when we were inside but it made for great dinner conversation!
