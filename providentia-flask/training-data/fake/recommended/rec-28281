WOW! The burgers here are OUTSTANDING! I was a little anxious when I saw how small the place was - probably can only fit about 20 people - and there was already a wait when we arrived but I'm glad we stayed. The burger was tasty, the bun was soft, the sauce on it was delectable, and the portion was huge. I always have to eat fries with my burger, but this was stood alone and didn't need one other thing. I'm a fan!!!
