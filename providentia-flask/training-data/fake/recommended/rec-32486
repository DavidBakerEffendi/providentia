Small store front place that serves amazing food. Service was efficient and quick. The server was friendly. I had a very large bowl of Chicken with rice noodle pho. The soup's flavors were distinct yet blended together really well to make a very delicious meal!  I also got a plate of basil and bean sprouts to add to my soup for only $1.50.  My husband had the Beef Pad Thai. The pad Thai had a different flavor than other places I have been.  It was delicious. The portion was the usual size for only $9.95. I cannot wait to return.
