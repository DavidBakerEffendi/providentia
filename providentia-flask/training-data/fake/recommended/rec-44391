What a great little joint.  The pizza is amazing...and the great craft beer selection is wonderful.  I had the Bard's Brown and it was true to its name with a great taste that hit the spot after a long day of work.  The salad was not as great as I had expected but the Vermont Goat Cheese extra add on for $1.50 was out of this world good!  I elected to do half/half on the pizza...which the crust was thin and organic - so it is healthy right..LOL.  I did the Vermont Sausage and Equilibrium...both were phenomenal!!!!  The quality of the ingredients was superb.  I chose to take my food to go and watch Monday Night Football so I cannot attest to the service.  However on that note, my pizza was not smoking hot as I would of thought it would of been just out of the wood fired oven...but very tasty nonetheless.
