Few bars in Philly hold memories for me in the last two years like Johnny Brenda's. This review is long overdue, and it makes me happy as I recall the times I have been here - just casual dinner and drinks, to dance my ass off with friends to West Philly Orchestra upstairs, to play pool downstairs, just a stop while bar hopping in NoLibs, I even came here to see a show just by myself one night - Johnny Showcase, and it was amazing! Downstairs, they have good vegetarian options; the eggplant parmesan is my usual goto - not the best I've had but it's bar food and my expectations are not too high and JB's doesn't disappoint. Also have a decent beer selection downstairs. No matter how crowded the place was, I never had to wait too long for a beer and to get my food order in. There is one pool table, so depending on which night you go, there might be a wait - if you're serious about playing pool, this shouldn't be your destination anyway. The upstairs music venue is one of my favorites in Philly. It is an intimate atmosphere - you can either stand right in front of the stage or take the stairs up to the balcony where they have a few tables - either place you are so close to the performers. For someone who loves live music, it offers a different kind of atmosphere compared to the bigger and more crowded venues. The ticket prices are usually around $10-15. The bartenders are always quick, efficient and friendly. The floors are sticky, but I don't really mind that. Johnny Brenda's should definitely be on your list of places to checkout in Philly if you're a live music fan.
