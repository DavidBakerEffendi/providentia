The sushi here is delicious and interesting, and relatively inexpensive for what you're getting. The sushi "bomb" is not something I've had before and I really like it. It's basically like nigiri with maybe a little more rice, but then they add the extra stuff that you would usually find in a maki roll, but just piled on top. The staff have always been nice and attentive. The location is almost idyllic, on the outskirts of Williamsburg. Definitely hipster-esque, but it's quiet and a welcome respite for a late morning/early afternoon meal. Much better to come here in warm weather when they open the place up to the outside. When it's colder and the place is sealed off, with dim lightning, it's a little more dreary.
