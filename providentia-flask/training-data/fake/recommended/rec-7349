Although this is a restaurant with a full menu, I was there with two friends on the way to a en event, so we ordered a number of sides and startes to share with our cocktails. Duck confit wings and the pickle juice cocktail worked well together. I'll bookmark this one to try again. It's a good option if you're ever stuck at the Javits Center and needing a place to meet up for business after a long day.
