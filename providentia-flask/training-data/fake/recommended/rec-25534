I absolutely love this place. The food is fresh and interesting, and to me the prices are quite reasonable for what you get. Yes you can get something similar from a food cart, but I honestly believe that most food cart meals are underpriced in order to stay competitive. Anywho, my boyfriend and I stop through here every once and a while. I usually get the pork arepa, which is moist and delicious. The plantains are well-cooked, and I always leave wanting more of those. My boyfriend got a quesadilla the last time, and he also enjoyed it. For apps we ordered the mexican corn and the ceviche. The corn was delicious, but the ceviche left something to be desired. I would not recommend it. We are also not generally a fan of their jamaica (hibiscus water) or horchata (rice milk). It's fine, but I've had lots of both before, and those just miss the mark. In terms of service, it's usually pretty good. The last time we were in, our server was quite attentive, but seemed to get a bit flustered toward the end when a few large groups came in (and as a result it took her a while to get our check). However, on another occasion we stopped through at the last minute to make a reservation for a large party, and they accommodated us quite well. Everyone in our party raved about the quality of the food, the decent amount of vegetarian options, and how it was a great deal. Overall, I think it's a solid 3.5 to 4 star place, and I can't wait to go back for tamale day.
