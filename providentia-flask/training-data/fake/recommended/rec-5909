I've been waiting to try Osteria for a while now. I finally got the chance on my birthday, June 14. It was everything I had hoped and didn't disappoint. I immediately appreciated the ambience, though it was surprising to find the restaurant located in such a run-down area. I would have liked bread for starters, as opposed to those long, thin breadsticks, but that's a pretty minor thing. Let's cut to the chase - the chicken liver rigatoni is MONEY. It's that ridiculously delicious. I don't eat weird things so for me to order chicken liver rigatoni and clear my plate, well, that's saying something. It's damn good, trust me. I ordered it on the recommendation of a family member and she was right on the money. The pasta portions are typically small here, but the rigatoni was large enough and rich enough to share, which my husband and I did. We also ordered a margherita pizza for two which was plenty to eat. I have to say, though, that I was least impressed with the pizza. For a Mark Vetri restaurant, I expected the pizza to be out of this world. It was just mediocre. That being said, we probably ordered the most boring pizza on the menu. I saw others raving about their pizzas. It doesn't matter though...the homemade pastas are worth the price of admission. The desserts were really good. We ordered two - the cannoli, or three mini-cannolis filled with ice cream - and a creamy nutella tart that was very subtle but delicious. Our server was EXCELLENT. Really knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. You can tell they really train their staff well here. I will definitely be back.
