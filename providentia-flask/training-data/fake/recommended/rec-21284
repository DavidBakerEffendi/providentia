Heard about this because I was reading on yelp about Little owl. We walked by and since it was early, we were able to get a on-the-spot reservation. Very well executed dishes that were fresh and brought out the natural flavors of the veggies and fish. Lots of window so you can just enjoy the NYC afterwork scene. The street it's on is also super cute. We were full but there's an ice cream shop across the street and to the right that was tempting.
