Well let me start by saying the food is usually delicious. However, the service is poor at best. Tonight, we got a pizza that was so burnt it was black all over. When we told the waitress, she ignored us???! I got the managers attention and he did replace the pizza however was surprisingly unapologetic about the waitress' poor attitude despite the fact he knows I am a regular and have not complained in the past 5 years though I have dined at Zavino at least 50 times. In the service industry if you provide awful service and are rude on top of that, you should be fired. Zavino always has a wait, and if you're going to receive awful service like we did tonight, it's definitely not worth the wait.
