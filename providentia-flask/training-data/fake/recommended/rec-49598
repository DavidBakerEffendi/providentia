I'll jump on the bandwagon. This place is great. If you are looking for a vegan sushi spot with a bunch of mock fish, this is not the place for you. Instead, the folks at Beyond Sushi make inventive salads, wraps, individual pieces, and rolls. I've now been half a dozen times, in parties ranging from just me to a group of four. As a result, I've tried about everything on the menu. The rice paper wraps are like really spring rolls, my favorite being the Nutty Buddy. Honestly, all of the rolls are incredible. Be sure to get whatever the monthly special is, but also try the Spicy Mang, Green Machine, and Mighty Mushroom rolls. Seating is tight. Expect to wait if you plan to eat in. That said, the service is great and the chefs quickly fill your order. I'm glad to see so many positive reviews and hope Beyond Sushi is around for a very long time.
