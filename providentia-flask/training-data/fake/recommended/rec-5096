Blackboard Eats!!!  YAY!!!  Whole lobster!!! Double YAY!!!  Red Hook... boo =-| My friend said the lobster here was possibly even sweeter than eating a lobster in the state of Maine.  I might have to agree with her.  A whole steamed lobster 1.5-2pd with potato salad, cole slaw, sweet corn, and a Maine Root soda.   Muah!  Life is good!
