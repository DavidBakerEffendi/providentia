The restaurant/bar is very middle of the road for me.  I don't have anything wonderful to say about it, but I don't have any horrible to say about it either.  I really want to like it more, but I just can't every time I come.  First off, it's always really crowded, so be prepared for it to be loud.  Its one of those places where you feel rushed to place an order as soon as you sit down but then the waitress is nowhere to be found at the end of the meal.  My mom claims the burgers are extraordinary here and maybe next time I should try one.  I had quesadillas for dinner.  They were okay to bland.  I really expected them to be more flavorful.  They weren't awful, they just weren't great either.  Also, my drink order came out completely wrong.  For something that only had a couple things in it and is very typical, it was weird.  I also had to ask two different members of the waitstaff for water before it finally arrived.  Maybe it was just an off night when I went so I will give it another chance, but I have yet to be impressed.
