My review is based on sampling the other ramen, but mainly ordering the terakawa ramen. Usually, when trying a new restaurant out, i tend to order the house special. If Â it's named after the restaurant, it should probably be their best dish and in this case, it was. I've been there twice and ordered the Terakawa bowl both times. I've sampled friends' dishes that went with the standard ramen, shoya and such, but they were vastly inferior. I would not recommend ordering those at all. As far as the standard ones go, the noodles are different
