They have some good dishes. They also have some that just didn't go together very well. My first visit, I would've given a 4-5. Second, unfortunately didn't make it so. Â The 3 being in between. It's not terrible. I just felt that there should be some consistency if the returning customer is expecting the food to be great the second time as it was the first.
