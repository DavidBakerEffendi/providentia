San Francisco needs one of these!  This place is out of this world.  I mean we got there late, they let us order and we manga'd on a delicious chicken olive risotto.  God was it good, hot, creamy, complex in flavor, ah, still dreamin' of it.  If we lived there, it would be a once a week must. I love staying in the W Village and can't wait to come back
