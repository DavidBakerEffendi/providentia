2nd time we went & food as fantastic as before!  Great Thai food at a very reasonable price.  If you're afraid of Thai because you've heard it's super spicy, please go and ask them for something tasty but not hot.  You can also ask them wait staff  to adjust the  heat in a dish  and they really do because everything is made to order.  They are very accommodating but also leave you alone when you want peace but are there immediately if it looks like you need help. A+ dishes: grilled chicken green curry (with avocado slices, carrots & potatoes; green massamam chicken curry (also tofu); all of the dips that come with the appetizers esp the vinegary clear dip with diced cucumber; yum yum noodles are to die for says Nikki (son's girlfriend); Singapore noodles with veggies; major quantities of high quality vegan and vegetarian offerings including vegetarian duck!; hubby loved the Ocean Cry - it was huge amount of very fresh seafood, delicious creamy green curry sauce; son had Singapore noodles with veg and he loved it. We've had the appetizer platter, to see which app we want to get, but ended up getting the platter again, the spring rolls, satay and fish cakes are delicious.  BYOB, which I love; they bring buckets of ice.  The staff is very nice and professional and accommodating.  Everything is super fresh, tasty and cooked to order by a think a Thai grandma!  Sticky rice with mango is sublime. So is the pumpkin pudding, which is really like a custard with pieces of pumpkin and spices. Really nice place, the decor is a little dated (red strings in door), dark lighting and chairs a bit tired, but the cost is very good for such high quality food.   Please go;  I'm so afraid in this economy that high quality restaurants like Red Basil will not survive.  It is really a great place, serving highly tasty food at a very good price point.
