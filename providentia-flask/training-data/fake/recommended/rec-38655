I was totally skeptical of El Vez and all these other yelpers didn't calm my nerves. Tales of overpriced chips and crowded tables gave me pre- El Vez diarrhea, but I was pretty surprised when I went there...even as a vegetarian non-drinker. I went to El Vez with three friends on a Thursday night and it was packed. My friends said the drinks were good and were also strong- my water was good and strong too! I really liked the nachos manchego (did I spell that right?) and my friends liked the lobster and crab quesadilla, enchiladas and some sort of meaty nacho appetizer. I'm a super duper cheapskate and didn't think it was toooo overpriced. I didn't get post- El Vez diarrhea either- which is a very good thing!
