Be prepared to wait in line. Keep an eye out, if you can get a seat at the counter, you will get your sandwich much faster. I really enjoyed the roast beef sandwich with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe. Had the pork with sharp provolone and spinach and thought it was good too. Take your friends here! While it isn't a philly cheesesteak joint, the sandwiches here are still unique and delicious!
