Uva's decor is nice and very romantic. We were seated in the garden-type section in the back, which is much less hectic and crowded than the front of the house - if at all possible, try to get seated here - it seems impossible to carry a conversation fluid conversation otherwise. The food was also good, but not so groundbreakingly delicious that I would fight the crowds again to eat it again. Maybe a three star rating is a little harsh given the overall good experience we had here, but I had very high expectations for this place, and found that the delivery fell a little short. Â Worst of all - I was still hungry when we left - portions were small (or my stomach is just very large...)
