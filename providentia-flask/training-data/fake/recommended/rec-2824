I'm ruined.  That's it.   Both my girlfriend and I  are going to have a hard time trying to top this place.    Thankfully we are under 30, and we have over 40 years to search.   I don't have high hopes in beating this.    Casserole. Terrible name, fantastic service, food. Better than words can describe
