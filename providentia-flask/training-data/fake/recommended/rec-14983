"Deep South" is one amazing concoction-- I highly recommend this cocktail, although it's a bit summery.  A drink is only as good as its bartender, and this guy surely has it together.  The staff is wonderful.  It seems like a great place to work.  The bar area is beautiful and intimate, as is the entire establishment.  Everyone in the restaurant seemed very happy with their meals.   However, I've been trying to stay away from gluten.  I was really in the mood for a burger.  Brioche-anything sounds amazing when I want gluten!   I started with the Caesar salad, which was pretty standard (but the breadcrumbs were particularly awesome).  I had the burger w/fried egg and subbed cheddar cheese.  I ordered the burger medium-rare, but it came out medium-well; no big deal, because as a whole it was delicious.   I couldn't finish my gigantic burger (I think that was a first).  The sweet potato fries that came with my burger ruled. I felt a little silly for ordering a burger at a such a cute, romantic place with an extensive menu.  But sometimes I just need a burger.  It hit the spot.  Can't wait to try that fried chicken with collards...  Next time;)
