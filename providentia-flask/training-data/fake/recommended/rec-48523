Atmosphere is rich with the Irish Culture from the friendly staff, excellent booze selection, comfort food with an eclectic twist to some classic dishes.  Curried fries pack a punch that is worth the taste bud adventure.  Seasonal specials are always worthwhile.  Although it's location is a bit further away from the downtown party, I prefer it's cobblestone street and traditional european pub design.  Definitely a regular stop when I am in Hartford.
