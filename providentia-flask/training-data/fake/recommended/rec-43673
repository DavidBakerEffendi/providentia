Last night I had a great experience! The food was delicious and there was live blues music (Saturday night). We had the fried green tomatoes as an app and the peanut butter cake and chocolate fudge cake for dessert. Since I'm a vegetarian, I got the bbq catfish with the mac and cheese and french fries as sides. It was all amazing. Â Get the Donkey Punch drink! Pros: Great and quick service Great Food Nice Ambiance and block Cons: over an hour week on weekends
