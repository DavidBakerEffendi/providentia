this year my sister decided her birthday was going to be a multiple event celebration. as such, dinner at the new pizza shop on franklin was on the agenda. yay! barboncino! i walk past this place on my way home and had been looking forward to checking it out. well alrighty then! it's a beautiful space featuring exposed brick, a giant wood burning oven and super cool light fixtures. the ambiance is laid back and the food is deeelish! we started out with the salumi board and moved on to shared four cheese with pepperoni and sopressata picante pizzas. mmmmm! so good and garlicky, i was glad i was out with my sisters and not on a date. the only part that sucked was the lack of spirits. i was very confused. i mean, why the giant bar if they don't serve alcohol? well. it turns out they don't have a liquor license yet. oh. and speaking of dates - barboncino is a great spot for a casual one, especially if you don't like the person you're dating. i keed. i keed. i'm joking, however i had to make it a point to mention the married couple sitting behind us who barely looked at each other, let alone speak. maybe it was just a really long day, however i'm glad they at least had the opportunity to enjoy a tasty meal (even if it was in silence).
