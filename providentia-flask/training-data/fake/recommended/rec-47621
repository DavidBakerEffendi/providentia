I'm far from an expert on Middle Eastern food, but I was eating three people who are and we all agreed it was delicious. I was hesitant to try a restaurant that serves Middle Eastern and Pizza....just doesn't seem like a normal combination to me, but it was raining and a short walk from our hotel. After going over their huge menu, I decided on the Mixed Grill with my two sides as the garden salad and the hummus. The hummus looks homemade and not some pre packaged stuff you get at most places. It was thick, flavorful and delicious. My salad was surprisingly good, but the dressing had been sitting for a while and was nothing but oil, pretty gross. They put it on the side, so I just used the hummus instead. The naan/flatbread they give you comes out warm, but was lacking. I've had much better. As for the meat, perfect! Tender, juicy and full of flavor! Lamb, Chicken and Beef. I was in carnivore heaven for a little bit. The service is slow because its all made to order. I would rather wait than have some dry meat that's been sitting under a warmer. The lamb is cooked just like they do in the Middle East (slow cooked rotisserie style) and you can watch as they cut it off for your meal. While we waited, we also saw them hand make and toss their pizza dough. It looked and smelled delicious! If you're in the area, give this place a shot! Its not a $5 dinner or fast, but its worth the price and the wait.
