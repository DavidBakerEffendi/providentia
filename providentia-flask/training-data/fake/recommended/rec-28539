I miss Miami mainly because of my frequent dining companion (a lovely Argentine) and the food. Unfortunately said lovely Argentine returned home today and I'm left with the memory.  So I prolonged sweet thoughts by heading to El Cocotero to have a favorite shared dish:  Arepa Guayanesa. FYI:  An arepa is a corn-cake, looks like an English muffin, but tastes way better.  Guayanesa is farmer's cheese.  Salty and delicious! The arepa is awesome...better than Miami  memories.  Thank you El Cocotero for making a bittersweet day better.
