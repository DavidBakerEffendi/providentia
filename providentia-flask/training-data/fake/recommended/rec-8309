Even though Farmhouse Tap & Grill came along after I had spent 4 years at UVM, I still think of this restaurant when I think of the amazing, warm, environmentally conscious atmosphere Burlington has to offer. Whenever someone asks me for recommendations in B-town, I always immediately say this place. Fantastic, classy environment that is laid-back at the same time. Downstairs is a great area, perfect for dates. Back patio is great, also perfect for dates! Inside and outside of the restaurant...perfect for any kind of meal. Veggie burger w/kimchi = best burger in the world! And the fries with several options of homemade sauces? To die for!!!! I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!
