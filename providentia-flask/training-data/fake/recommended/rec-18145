Really friendly bar tenders, excellent music, reasonable prices for beer.  The acoustics could be a little better, but considering the stage is in a corner next to the bar, it's not bad.  There were a lot of boys wearing skinny jeans, but other than that, a pretty young, ecclectic crowd.  Tickets are cheap.  The only warning I have is watch your pockets/bags.  I had some cash swiped from my coat pocket when I was carrying it around.  That's not a reflection on Johnny Brenda's though, so I didn't dock them any points.
