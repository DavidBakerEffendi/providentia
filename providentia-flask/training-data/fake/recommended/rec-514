Upgrading my review after a really good experience in a big group post-Hurricane Sandy. One of my friends was stuck in New York after his flight to LA was cancelled, so we got together a big group of people for dinner. Room Service was able to accommodate 15 people for dinner with less than 24 hour notice. Awesome. We had a $20/person minimum, but that was easily achieved considering everyone had at least one drink. We split our group into three sections, and our section ordered Coconut Calamari, Chicken Pad Thai, 2 Beef Pad See Euw, Papaya Salad, and Red Curry with Chicken for 5 people. This ended up being a perfect amount of food. The coconut calamari was delicious. The tempura wasn't too thick or oily, and I loved the bits of coconut and the spicy dipping sauce. Delicious. Papaya salad is always a solid choice. Thie chicken pad thai was ok, but the pad see euw was a big hit, necessitating a second order for the boys in our group who felt like they didn't get enough. Red curry was also a good solid dish, but I thought it could have been spicier. Service was great for us, considering we were such a large group. And it only came to about $26 / person including tax and tip. Awesome.
