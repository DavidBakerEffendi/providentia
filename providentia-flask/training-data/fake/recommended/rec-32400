This has got to be the best breakfast spot in Bayonne. Everything is made with love and the staff is very friendly. Relatively small place with a very cozy atmosphere . The Talya omelette is amazing!! Â Freshly pressed orange juice w that? Of course!!! My only beef is that they open when I have to be at work... Other than that, a MUST have breakfast !
