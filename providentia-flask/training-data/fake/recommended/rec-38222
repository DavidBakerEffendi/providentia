For starters..my rating is on the food. If you are looking for ambiance and atmosphere this isn't your place.IF you are looking for awesome authentic mexican food, GO there. Great favors all authentic. We loved the tostadas and tamales. Everything was delicious. The area isn't great and the restaurant isn't fancy at all, but it doesn't matter because the food is that good.
