This place is by no way glamorous in anyway.  But they make a mean chili dog and their fries are nice and crispy.  I don't think I would want to go here at night since there is a seedy looking motel right behind it.  But if your looking for a quick no frills bite right off the highway and its daylight out...this is a great place to stop.
