Food: Amazing! The Tartufata was the best mushroom pizza of my life so far. Peperoncini shishito peppers were cooked and seasoned to perfection. We also had incredible Burrata and a couple pastas that were delicious. Service: Terrible! We felt really pressured when ordering food and also witnessed drama between the wait-staff. One waitress greeted us and then another waiter took our drink order. The first waitress the came back to get our drink order. When we told her we'd already been taken care of, she literally said, "what the f**K," rolled her eyes and walked away. Extremely unprofessional and surprising. Ambience: Love it! Amazing dim lighting. The decor has a old-school Italian trattoria, but a bit more glam. We sat in a great cozy booth. Nice balance of class and comfort.
