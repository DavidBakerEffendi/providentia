Today was a rainy day. Rainy days are best met with a nice hot bowl of noodle soup. So to Nan Zhou Hand Drawn Noodle House we went. Happy and satiated we left. Four of us got the beef brisket noodle soup, which is pretty fantastic. The noodles, being handmade, are soft and chewy to a perfect consistency. The broth is flavorful and not too salty. The meat pieces were pretty good too. I sort of wish a couple of mine were more meaty and less tendony... but that's not a major complaint. Only noticed that in my bowl today. Two others got the "noodle with pork soy sauce" which is basically "jja jiang mien" with the shaved noodles, which are basically fatter noodles. Both dishes taste great with the chili sauce, so I recommend mixing some of that in your dish when you go. The best part is at the end, you don't even come close to breaking the bank - each dish is about $5-7!
