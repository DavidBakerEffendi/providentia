Didn't try the coffee, but I had the tiramisu for 2, which was deeeelicious. The tiramisu is served deconstructed, so you get 6 lady fingers plus a saucer of coffee and a saucer of cream with cocoa powder on top. Each ingredient by itself is nothing special, but once you dip the cookie in the coffee and add some of the cream, it's crazy good. Only downsides: the place is pretty tiny, so if you get a table, prepare to be cramped. And sizewise, the tiramisu for 2 might as well be a tiramisu for 1... I coulda scarfed it down easy. But I figured I should leave some for my date.
