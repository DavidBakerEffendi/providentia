The three of us chose Shanty on the Shore to celebrate my daughters 15th birthday. We won't be going back at all. The food was tasteless and very overpriced. There was absolutely no ambiance at all except for the overbearing smell of rancid frying oil. The service was slow and virtually non existent until check time. The same waitress had the table next to us also with three patrons. I admired the service they received and was appalled at the service we received. She made repeated visits to the table next to us and ignored even our request for coffee with our dessert. So much so that had I paid for the bill which was generously covered by our host, I would not have left a tip. The only thing that tasted any good were the whole bellied fried clam starters. They were lightly breaded and tender. Salmon platter was tasteless and dry. No cocktail sauce was offered with the shrimp. The scallops were tiny and definitely not fresh as were the shrimp covering the scallops . The shrimp were dried out and tough to chew. Dessert consisted of an Amaretto Pie that tasted like a store bought freezer vanilla pudding pie, not even a hint of Amaretto there at all. When we asked for coffee we incurred a long wait with 1 creamer each and no refills. They skimped on all condiments like butter, sour cream and tarter sauce but they were very generous with the coleslaw which had a funny after taste. Sticker shock came over our host who graciously paid the bill totally over 115.00 and he reluctantly left a tip. Definitely not a pleasant experience. Would not recommend this place to anyone. Most restaurants would at least recognize a birthday recipient in some way. Not this place. Lesson learned? If you want good tasting seafood and prompt, pleasant service.....you won't find it at a lakeside restaurant called The Shanty on the Shore? Even Red Lobster would have been a much better quality choice and much more reasonably priced. Unfortunately, there isn't one in that area.
