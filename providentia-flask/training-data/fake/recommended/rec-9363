I tried this restaurant as part of a team dinner at work. Everything was very good. The Momofuku Bo Ssam Lacquered Pork in Lettuce Leaves dish is something I still drool over when I think about it. The pork is so tender that you do not need a knife to cut it. You just take tongs and pull pieces of it off to put in lettuce leaves. They have multiple sauces you can put on it. The ginger sauce is amazing and my favorite. For other great places to eat in New York, please see my personal list at rookerville.com/2013/09/â€¦
