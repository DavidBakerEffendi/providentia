Friendliest most competent service making it our ideal place to enjoy a dinner before walking 'round the corner to sit for a lovely concert.                  Counter and waitstaff are always kind and help us if we arrive late so that a fab meal appears before you can bite one of those pickles from the amazing self-service salads/condiments bar or take the first slurp of coffee. The Pastrami Sandwich is a consistent work of art, so satisfying that I just don't wanna try anything else although I admire all the platters served to table surrounding me. Great atmosphere. Wonderful meeting place, too. I've never been "hustled" to leave prematurely when conducting a meeting there. And, when I'm on my own personal time, I always find that I'm relaxed 'cause the service is so friendly and fast.
