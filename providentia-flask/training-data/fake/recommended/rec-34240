A friend recommended this place to my boyfriend and I, and ever since our first time, we have been frequent visitors. Both dining in and taking out. The crostinis are so delicious, the bread is great. My vegetarian friend also loved these and there were plenty of meatless options. The panini's are great, I have to say the Soppressata with hot peppers, asiago and basil pesto may be my favorite. Great place for a date, can't wait to sit out back on the patio this summer!
