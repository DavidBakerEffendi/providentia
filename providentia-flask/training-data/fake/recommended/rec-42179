This review is not of the food but of the service. Blue Ribbon is supposed to open at 4:30. Normally we don't eat early dinners but we wanted to have a pre-fast dinner for Yom Kippur which started around 6:15pm. We stood outside when their bartender waved to us that we should wait 5 more minutes, at 4:45, he disappeared inside the restaurant. Needless to say, at 4:55 we got annoyed and went elsewhere. I've been coming to this restaurant for years and probably won't be returning because that is not how you treat customers who are waiting outside. If they weren't ready to open, he should of came outside at 4:30 when he saw us waiting and said they were not going to open for a while, we would of gone elsewhere and not waited outside for almost half hour while he stood there and put lemons in their containers. Very unprofessional.
