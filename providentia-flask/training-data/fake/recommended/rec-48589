So the wife and I aren't total organic, granola loving hippies...ok, she is, but I'm not. This place came recommended by both a few friends, and the local city guides. It wasn't part of our original plans, but we found ourselves in the neighborhood prior to going to the Mutter, and we thought, why not? It wasn't super crowded for a Saturday afternoon, but it did have a steady flow of people coming and going. The communal seating isn't something I'm in love with, but I think it adds to the ambiance and direction of the restaurant as a whole. There were plenty of options for vegans, vegetarians, and carnivores alike, and with no real emphasis on promoting any one lifestyle choice over another. Â The lack of pressure and preaching really impressed me, and warmed me up to eating there. Plus supporting a local business that promote organic and green living never hurts. We shared a Green Kale soup, and turkey chili. Both were excellent, and they had plenty of option for seasoning them to taste. It was cold as crap outside (1/19/13) and hot soup really hit the spot. I had a green detox juice, and the wife had an apple pie smoothie. Both were awesome. The meal was incredibly low calorie, and very filling. Something that a guy who's trying hard to lose weight and get healthy really needs. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to stop by and have a quick bite.
