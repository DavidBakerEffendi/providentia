This is a cool place.  I can't say that I go here often (not in my neighborhood), nor do I enjoy it on crowded nights, but as a neighborhood bar, it's great.  It's also a rad venue, although R5 was quick to take that over.  They have a good beer selection and a nice menu.  Not the cheapest, but it's about par for a hip dive.
