Came here last night to enjoy some home flavors... My friend and I had the pulpo con pimenton, which we thought would be the Spanish pulpo a la Gallega and turned out to be a tiny plate with few pieces of pulpo, some olives, a heart artichoke, 1 red pepper and lots of guindillas... We only wanted some pulpo with pimenton, thanks! The pulpo was just ok, you don't need to order that dish. The pintxos or montaditos were much better. We both really liked the smoked salmon one and the tortilla with morcilla was ok, too. The goat cheese one was tiny again. With the size of the dishes we were served seems like in Spain we are always starving. It is hard to get full for dinner with such small portions of food!! Service was nice and good enough.
