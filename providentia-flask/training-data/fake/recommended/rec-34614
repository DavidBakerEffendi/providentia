We have had noodles at many places but this was by far the best.   Parking is a problem and they only take cash the service is tepid in english but the quality of the food is great. We had the beef noodles and fried chicken noodles. The tastes and meat flavor was excellent.   We are putting this on our bookmarks to try again.
