I would make sweet love to Old Nelson's if I could.  Home of delicious sandwiches, chips, juices, sodas, snacks, and really, most anything you'd want a corner shop to have. The sandwiches are reasonably priced.  I end up stopping there every morning for coffee and a bagel since it is across the street from my work.  In fact, I end up spending too much money there since it is too easy to sneak on over when you have a few extra minutes and buy some snack or drink! The reason for four stars and not five is that i think their salads are crap.  i had a ceaser salad once and it looked delicious.  however, the dressing was awful.  it was more of some sort of italian dressing.  also, i give four stars since they take too much of my money from being so damn addictive!  more of my own fault, but i like to blame others!
