Incredible. Inspiring. Freshly made. Quality Ingredients. Cheapest lunch within 20 blocks. I could write a long review about this place, but quite honestly, it's unnecessary. If you work in the area, make this place your regular spot. Go there, get soup, make sure you don't throw away the bag, there's an apple in there, just because.
