I don't think I can ever have any other burger ever again. Umami Burger blows any other burger I've ever had out of the water. You have no idea how excited I was when I heard New York was finally getting our very own Umami Burger. During all this hype of the grand opening, I only had to wait 30 minutes for a table of two, but I've heard larger groups being asked to wait for an hour, which isn't TOO bad. I definitely think it's worth the wait. The whole idea of umami is the 5th taste -  savory. I honestly had no idea it would be this good. With my bf, I split the manly burger, truffle burger, and truffle fries - truffle all day, everyday.  The truffle burger was my favorite, and this is the burger i've been waiting for my whole life. Listen to the waiter's suggestion and get it MEDIUM RARE! It's soft, juicy, and full of flavor. It's so savory it makes your mouth water even while you're still eating it. The umami ketchup they give is really great, and the perfect compliment as well. The manly burger was good too and so were the fries, but I wish they were cut in thicker slices or gave more! I finished those babies in no time! But if I'm wishing for things, I would want bigger portions of everything there. I can't wait to go back and order something off their secret menu. I've heard of other creations such as the kalbi burger, duck burger, and b.u.b burger. I will be back!
