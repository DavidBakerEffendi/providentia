It's hard to live up to the hype. I'd heard about this pizza place the moment I stepped foot in Manhattan, and maybe even before I got to NYC. So it's probably reasonable to expect that the experience can't really match up with one's imagination. That said, I was surprised, though, at how mediocre our pizzas were. The toppings were perfectly fine and generous, but the experience was lacking on several fronts: - Service: Servers were too kool for skool: not in a hipster way, more like in a "I've been in NYC since before your grandma was born, you visitor" kinda way. Not particularly friendly and pretty macho. - Ambiance: A very basic, red-and-white-chequered table cloth kind of classic pizza place -- which is perfectly fine, except that tables are really crowded close together. In addition, pizzas are served on ridiculous concoctions which force you to reach up, elbows bent and tucked into your sides (so you don't elbow the friendly stranger seated next to you), so you can grab, carefully, a slice to slide onto your plate. - Finally: the pizza itself. Both of our pizzas arrived with slices which were obviously and unpleasantly charred on their underside. A look revealed actual burn spots on both pizzas. In addition to being charred, the crust was actually amazingly soggy, making it even more difficult to grab a piece to place on a floppy paper plate. Oh well.
