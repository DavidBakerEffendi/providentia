Amazing FRESH fish for days.  It is VERY rare to find a sushi restaurant that actually serves good SUSHI and not all the pomp and circumstance such as hibachi, etc.  Hibachi and steak are great but I am writing this review because Kouzoku's excels at fresh, raw sushi and sashimi dishes.  Sit at the sushi bar if you can, Tony is an artist and will make beautiful trees or flowers out of sauces on your plate on a whim.  Excellent yellowtail, tuna, salmon and eel.  The only thing I was disappointed they didn't have was TORO or fatty tuna.  But I think it was because it was December, in rural NH!  I lived near the ocean in CA for many years and ate at sushi restaurants up and down the coast.  Surprisingly, and happily, Kouzoku's is a diamond in the ethnically un-diverse rough of this area.
