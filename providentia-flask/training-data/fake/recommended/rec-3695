Five starving girls. One damn long wait. At least three requests to "step aside please." A curiously pompous host and a redeemingly sweet waitress. Four shared appetizers. Four scrumptious noodle dishes. Sixteen candles on the bathroom wall. One bottle of wine. Three doggy bags. Zero credit cards accepted. Twenty bucks each! Four well deserved stars. Many more visits foreseen.
