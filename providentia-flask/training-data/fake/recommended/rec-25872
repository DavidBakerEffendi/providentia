Had a fantastic lunch here over the weekend in the idyllic back garden.  The food was absolutely delicious.  The bbq duck sandwich tasted like a unique play on pulled pork; it was served on soft, perfect bread with well-cooked french fries.  The pasta special, spaghetti with eggplant, stewed heirloom tomatoes, green chiles and parmesan, was wonderful too.  Not that the portions were stingy, but it was definitely the kind of dish you could have kept on eating and eating until you're obscenely stuffed (but happy!). We had chocolate fig cake for dessert, which was a real medley of flavors (passionfruit sorbet and coconut ice cream came along with it); very tasty.  Given it wasn't that crowded, it was a truly relaxing Saturday lunch with friendly service.  We'll definitely try to come back for dinner.
