This restaurant is incredible, I have nothing but amazing things to say about it.  I strongly recommend starting off with the watermelon mint iced tea. I got the Cajun Cat Fish as my entree, which was cooked perfectly.  My friend and I got  a ton of sides for the table, and my favorites were definitely the collard greens and the potato salad.  Even if you think you're too full for desert you should get the banana bread pudding anyway, you will not regret it.  Sandra and everyone else who works there is so friendly and welcoming.  I would encourage anyone to give Sandra's a try!
