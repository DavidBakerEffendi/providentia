I've heard such great things about this place so we decided to try it out for Sunday brunch. Walked in , the hostess was having a conversation with her friend. Couldn't even do the easiest job in the service industry. Say hello. Sat down took awhile to get a decent but not very good Bloody Mary. We both got chicken in waffles. They were okay at best. So little chicken. Luckily we saw someone next to us get it first so we ordered potatoes which were amazing and bacon which was good. Very disappointed. Never coming for brunch again.
