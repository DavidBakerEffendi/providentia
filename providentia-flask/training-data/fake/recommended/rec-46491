The first time I tried this place in August it was pretty good, but I went there with my wife tonight, seriously, yuk! I ordered the prosciutto funghi. I sent the first one back because it was burned. The next one came and it was less burned but still pretty charred in spots. Â I understand that this type of pizza is supposed to be crispy, but not burned. The prosciutto tasted like oscar mayer cold cuts and the mushrooms tasted like they came from a can. I was dissapointed, My wifes Pizza was burned as well. The service was not great either. I will not go back.
