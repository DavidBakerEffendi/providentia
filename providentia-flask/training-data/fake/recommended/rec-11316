Not impressed.  It's an attractive place, and the food tastes good, fine, whatever, but I was under the impression it was a real Indian restaurant, and not like a Stephen Starr place, as in expensive, imitation cuisine.  Service was poor, they forgot things; it took a while to get things, including dessert menus, and when we finally got them, one was the vegetarian dinner menu instead.  And it's always a bad sign at dessert when a waiter says "we're brewing a fresh pot of coffee now", which means you'll get it Thursday.  Even the table was weird and awkward to sit at, with it being almost too low to get your legs under.  Save your money and go to King of Tandoor and leave satisfied every time.
