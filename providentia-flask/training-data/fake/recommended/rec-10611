Went for breakfast and the shop is trendy and quite lovely. Ordered 2 breakfast dishes and after ordering the wait was 50 minutes. For two dishes?! There were people who came, ate and left. Yet we were here waiting with no explanation other than "it will be right out" after a near hour wait. Saw one of our dishes come out and was brought to the wrong table and then returned to the kitchen where it was served about 7 minutes later. Sure wish the service was better or at least an explanation was offered. Food was ok, menu was creative and eclectic, but service sorely lacking.
