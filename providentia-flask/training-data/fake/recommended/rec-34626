Wow, This place makes an amazing sandwich. The bread is great. The meat is great. The veggies are fresh The sauce is good and has just the right amount. Pretty easy to get in and out. Only issue I have had was my first experience was frustrating as I ordered online off of their website.  Showed up after it said it would be ready and the confirmation email said it would be ready, and when I got there they hadn't even known about my order yet.  So i was put at the end of all of the people there and had to wait a while for the sandwich in addition to the time I had already waited.  On a normal day it wouldn't probably have been an issue, but I had a SHORT time window and that is why I pre-ordered online. I did eat here again the next day, as the food is that good, but will probably avoid when in rush in the future.
