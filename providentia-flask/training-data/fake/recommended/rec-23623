Overpriced, crowded and a tourist gimmick. First the menu is a big board that you have to get up to see. A real pain if your eyes are bad and it's crowded. There are NO menus they can bring you. The pastas didnt really come mixed, so you pay through the nose to get, say, manichotti with chicken ($65) or Seafood and linguini ($55). Get reservations but expect to not seat for 10-15min after. That's just how they schedule it. Oddly the bread is cold!! I asked but they don't serve the free bread hot; I thought focaccia was supposed to be served warm. Total buzzkill. The lasagna was iffy, way too much tomato and not enough meat and cheese. Service was so-so.. The people delivering the food and refilling drinks were nicer than our waiter. Bottom line: If everyone wants to eat the same thing, great, if not you're going to get MAJOR ripped off by ordering individual meals. One person CANNOT eat the entr√©e on their own - that's how they charge so much because they give you a lot of food.
