10th anniversary Friday night dinner no kids. Gypsy pepper appetizer was great. Skirt steak entree was great except for some exotic "crust" that isn't a crust but a spread of something on top of the meat after its cooked. Fries and salad that came with entree were top notch, well seasoned and dressed. Wife got three appetizers. Iceberg lettuce was not the typical buttermilk wet disaster. The menu failed to mention the other dominant flavor is whole Parsley and our server gladly took it back and replaced it with a no Parsley version. Wife cleaned plate. The octopus appetizer was deep and rich. Too heavy in a good way and the portion size was appropriately mid-sized. All the baked stuffed clams (10-12) disappeared. Complaints: broccoli side dish should have indicated something more than "sweet and sour". When I asked the server, Â who was fantastic, what the ingredients were (after the meal) she said maple syrup and black anchovy oil. Would have liked to have known that ahead of time. Like on the damn menu. The bread was subpar. Either reheated for too long or just not good. Something like an overdone focaccia. The horseradish spread wasn't enough to get beyond the flaws. Service was exemplary. Staff knowledgeable. Atmosphere perfect. Interior comfortable. Portion size on my entree was a bit small for prime skirt steak but with an app i didn't leave hungry. A few little tweaks and this place could be a complete winner.
