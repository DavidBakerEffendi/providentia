YUMMY. Although I haven't had ramen from many different places, this is probably the best I've had. The pork buns are a MUST! The bread is perfect and the pork so flavorful. Both times I went I got the super spicy ramen and would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bit of spice! The decor of this place is simple, yet cool; I really like the group seating in the middle. However, other than that, it's pretty simple. The bar area is small but suits the Â restaurant well. With regards to the wait times.. Yes this place is BUSY but I really can't complain about the wait time. The only thing that is a bit annoying is that they will not put your name on the list until your entire party has arrived. I've been once for lunch and once for dinner and had to wait longer during lunch hour. I will def be back for more Spicy Ramen and delicious pork buns!
