Great find in EV - casual, inviting without any pretention. We came around 7:30pm on Friday night and waited for about 30-40 mins for table of 4. We were happy with everything we ordered - pretzels ($8), flatbread w/ mushroom ($12), kale salad ($9), buttermilk fried chicken ($18), duck gumbo ($16), tater tots ($6). We split the apple cobbler and that was probably the only thing I didn't particularly enjoy (i think they used preserved lemons in it) - should have ordered banana beignets. Because we split everything, the bill was reasonable for dinner and drinks for 4. Service was nice and unobstrusive and the food came out quickly. The meal starts off great with the rolls they give and I love the chocolate cookie they give to everyone when the bill comes. The restaurant is dimly lit, has dark wood and red velvet booth seating in the back. It's appropriate for all groups & scenarios - you can go here on a date, with visiting parents, or group of friends (6 or less). It's on a quiet neighborhood street so it's nice to escape the hustle and bustle of NYC for a couple hours at The Redhead.
