Get educated on the pork anatomy and what you can get out of it.  This place has such a great mix of the right foods you wouldn't think go together on sweet sweet panini or crustini bread.  After I first went here I just couldn't stop going back until I had everything on the menu (some more than once).   Recommended without reservations.
