I have been going to Anthony's Cheesecakes since the day they opened. I always know that I will have a good time there and leave smiling....not just because the food is OUTSTANDING, but because everyone that works there and the clientele are wonderful people to be around.  It's almost like Cheers, but without the beer. Anthony knows I am in the process of working out and doing my best to watch what I eat. I showed him my menu from the nutritionist, and he went out of his way to prepare foods that I can eat. I don't know any other restaurant in town that will add items to the menu to help a customer.  I can't write a blog about all the delicious dishes I have had at Anthony's Cheesecakes that will go on for volumes. Even though the days of me ordering Waffles with Cookie Butter are long gone....it is still one of the most delectable choices on the menu. I'll save them for a cheat day! Thursday dinners are packed! Make a reservation. But definitely GET THERE. You will never be disappointed.
