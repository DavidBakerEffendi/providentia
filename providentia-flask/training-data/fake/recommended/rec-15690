Great Italian restaurant.  The staff is very knowledgeable about the various dishes and the wine list.  One thing to note, you can't get many mixed drinks here.  No Appletinis just the basic Martinis.  They don't have an extensive list of mixed drinks but they do have special drinks.  Your best bet is to order from the wine list. The pastas are well prepared and your ordinary spaghetti dishes.  The only downsize is that you can't use a credit card or a debit card.  You have to pay by cash.  Other than that I would go again.
