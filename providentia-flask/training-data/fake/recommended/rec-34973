Another great find in Newark. The sushi is fresh, the portions are plentiful and the taste is very good. The lunch boxes are a great deal, you can't go wrong. Don't have time to get out of the office? No worries, they deliver! If they say they're going to be there in 30 minutes, they are. Try it out, you won't be disappointed!
