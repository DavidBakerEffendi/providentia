Searched for the best ice cream in NJ and this came up. Went in at 11 o'clock at night and tried their cookies and cream ice cream while my fianc√© had a brownie sundae. The ice cream was so creamy and delicious! The only negative was that the brownie on the sundae was not warm and seemed a bit stale. On another note, we sat across the table where they shot the last episode of the Sopranos!
