We just came from here and had a very nice meal.   The food was inventive and interesting, and very tasty.   our favorites were the pork buns, scallops, and the chestnut bread.  Andn I'm surprised of the mentions of bad service here--our waitress and the chef himself couldn't have been more helpful and gracious.
