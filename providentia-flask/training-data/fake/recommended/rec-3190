Dear Sunny and Annie's, Wow, I'm alone in bed right now, but thanks for just giving me the best 3:45 AM sandwichgasm ever with your hearty, value-packed "Mona Lisa" consisting of a chicken cutlet(s), mozzarella cheese, basil and roasted peppers! As the governor of California once said, "I'll be back!" Cheers!
