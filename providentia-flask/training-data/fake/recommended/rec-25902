Pros: 1) Guernika peppers, which should be properly called Pimientos de Padron, and in the case of Tia Pol are actually Shishito peppers) are great! I was very excited when I moved to NYC and found that they had these here! 2) Torta de Santiago-- SOOO DELICIOUS! It's a light almond cake with a lemon flavor and this version has a little dulce de leche ontop. It is sooo good. I've definitely gone only to have these two items (and of course a pitcher of sangria). 3) Sangria is tasty, though somewhat sweet. Cons: 1) A definite hole-in-the-wall. Absolutely no decor that I can recall (or would want to) and it is extremely dark and can get jammed packed at night (and mid-afternoon I must add). 2) Smells kind of funny if it is warm out (ok this only happened once but we ended up leaving because of it). In any event, I love Tia Pol and constantly go back because it has three of my favorite things: Spanish Wine, Pimientos de Padron and Torta de Santiago! Definitely a good place to go but only in small groups.
