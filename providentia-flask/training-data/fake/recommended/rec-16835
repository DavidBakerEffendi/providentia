Ok. I've been to Ruby's twice in the last two weeks. After dying for a decent coffee for over 3 months, a friend recommended this place... said it was run by a couple Aussie guys, who make Aussie style coffee... SOLD. Anyway popped in for breaky and got my caffeine hit.. and twice. The coffees are amazing. ! Thanks Dylan. I've heard the burgers are equally brilliant and will have to try those next time. The place is tiny but intimate with share benches for a very social experience. Love it! Thanks boys : )
