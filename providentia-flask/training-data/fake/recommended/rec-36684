I personally did not absolutely adore this Halal Chicken cart meal so much as to award five stars, but the boy thought it was possibly one of the best meals New York could offer. Apologies to Morimoto, Gordon, and even to you, Thomas Keller. Apparently you guys have nothing on these Halal Cart boys. So, there we were, one of us zealously ecstatic to stand in line with other equally enthused famished patrons, and the other freezing her ass off. I'll admit that the aromas really were quite inticing Â And the promise of at least 3-4 pounds of (messy saucy savory) grub for $6 is quite a steal. Such is the allure of street food. This location seems to be the busiest, since it is the original cart (or so I've been told). Expect a bit of a wait at 2am, or find another cart within a block or two with half the line.
