This is for sure my new favorite place! I've been here 4 times, and each time i've had a great time. The first time was with one of my oldest friends for lunch, we went because they had Hill Farmstead Brewery beer on tap, and we were both dying to try it out. We ordered the cheese plate YUM! it's been a few months but i distinctly remember the cabot clothbound cheddar which was perfectly paired with Vermont apple butter and maple candied walnuts. We then split the Kale and Arugula salad with blue cheese, a herb vinaigrette, local apples, and candied pecans. The salad was fresh and crisp and wonderful. We also had two Edward IPA beers. I went two weeks later with the bf, and we each ordered a burger delicious local beef, with cheddar, bacon, and pickled onions. The meat was flavorful and cooked to perfection. They also gave you a choice between a side salad or hand cut fries. It comes with multiple home made condiments, ketchup, mustard, and aioli. When my family was in town for the holidays we decided to try and get a reservation at 7:30 on a Saturday night for 10 people, i was happily surprised that we could get in, and everyone loved it. More burgers and beer... yum! I then went one night just for drinks, the bar staff is knowledgeable and helps guide you to a perfect beer. The interior is very cosy modern, the staff is friendly and efficient. I can't wait for warmer weather and eating and drinking outside. I highly recommend lunch or dinner here.
