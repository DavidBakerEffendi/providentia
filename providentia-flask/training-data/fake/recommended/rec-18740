Not the most amazing place on earth, in my opinion - but very good meatballs.  We each tried three different slider combinations (definitely the way to go, to maximize the amount of combos you can try) - I had chicken with pesto, which was great, veggie with parma, which was also great, and spicy pork with mushroom gravy, which was eh.  Also tried the husband's traditional beef with marinara, which was okay.   We also had ice cream sandwiches (me, key lime and him, mint), which were oh-so-accurate with the flavors it was a little too much.  My face puckered at every bite of my key lime ice cream. Not a bad date though, with our total coming to about $50, and us leaving stuffed.   The only thing is that the food comes out super quick (not surprisingly given all meals are different compositions of the same meatballs), so we were out of there in under an hour.   Would go again, but not for my next meal out. Also - no wait at the bar for us, since we came to this LES location which, by being in a more trendy location, has a later "rush-hour" than some other spots.
