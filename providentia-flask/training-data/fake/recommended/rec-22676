Went here for the first time after moving out of the neighborhood 3 years ago. Â When I lived in Ditmas, I went semi-regularly because it is an amazing restaurant and now I have to wonder whatever possessed me to leave a neighborhood with such a wonderful restaurant (seriously considering moving back). The burger and fries are probably the best in all of New York, and that curry mayo! I have literally written to people all over the world about that curry mayo, so if you can get there, you should go. The space is light and airy and beautiful and the food is fresh, full of flavor and cooked in that magical way that only people who truly love food can do. I really can't speak highly enough of the Farm on Adderley, few restaurants make me feel so at ease both in atmosphere and food.
