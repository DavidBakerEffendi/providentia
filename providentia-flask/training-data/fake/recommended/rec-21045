Came here with my wife for dinner last night -- we'd NEVER had a taste of Creole/Haitian food before, so we were excited. IT DID NOT let down... The food is absolutely terrific: The jumbalaya soup, the Bayou Salad, and the Saveur Creole beef were all magnificent. My wife got the salad and a beef dish as well. Rice and beans sides, along with black mushrooms. ALL with a nice, Haitian spice that was great. My beef here wasn't with the food, it was a bit with the seating and wait time. The seating is very tight inside -- now the ambiance of S.C. is GREAT. Dimly lit, "paintings" (which were a bit suspect) around the area, but we had to talk to the people sitting behind my wife about hitting us with their chairs throughout our meal. It IS very tight inside... The wait time is also a bit long. It took us about 25 minutes to receive the check and we had to ask multiple times. Upon that, we used a Restaurant.com gift certificate of $25 towards the meal, which the waitress used incorrectly. It turned into a 15 minute debacle of how THEY view their relationship and usage of Restaurant.com differently than it's stated on the actual gift cert., which was a bit odd and shady. I had to speak with the manager to get what we should've originally, but Ron was very nice about it! Bottom line: GREAT food, GREAT atmosphere...seating is tight inside, and wait times for your bill and meals may vary...but great, nontheless!
