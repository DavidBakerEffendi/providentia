I was craving wonton noodles.  I went here after reading the great reviews on yelp.  It was Saturday morning and I walked 30 blocks in anticipation of my noodle reward.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype.  The broth was very good, but the noodles were too soft and lacked the chewy texture required to be called truly excellent.  I'll keep looking for that elusive bowl of wonton noodles.
