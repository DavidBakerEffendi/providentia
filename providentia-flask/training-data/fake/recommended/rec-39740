Went here last night, we got seated right away. Everyone was very nice and explained to us that it is a soft opening, they didn't have beer on tap and were not talking credit cards yet. The food was good, it was what i expected from this type of restaurant that seams to be the trend right now. The portions were a bit small for the price, the app was bigger than the main course! Check it out, Â it's a nice add to the hood.
