Who was the genius who decided to open up a ramen place next to a college campus? Ramen Bar has quickly become quite the staple among off-campus dining choices for its location and cuisine. Now I try to eat healthy, so I'm not much of a ramen cook myself. However, when a craving comes along, Ramen Bar is a reliable option to hit the spot. I usually opt for the tonkotsu ramen and its variations (chashuramen and kara kara) and have found every bowl I've received to have the same quality and portions, so at least it's consistent. The appetizer menu is fairly underestimated, especially the takoyaki and agedashi tofu. On a Friday night I also believe there was some sort of half-off appetizer deal that is definitely worth taking advantage of. As for the sushi, another thing Ramen Bar has come to be known for, I have not personally tried it. I suppose in a pinch I could get my sushi fix here, but at the price point ($10-12 per special roll) I would much prefer to head into Center City for cheaper and higher quality sushi. I am always skeptical when Asian restaurants try to do too many things at once. In general, Ramen Bar provides delicious ramen and food in general. However with a base price of $10 per bowl without toppings, it is an expensive option. I do have give a nod to the great waitresses that work at the restaurant and provide great service. I will also be back to try the happy hour.
