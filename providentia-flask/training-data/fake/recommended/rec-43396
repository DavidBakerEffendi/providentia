A welcome addition to the neighborhood! Great food, great service, great atmosphere (especially the outdoor seating!). Â The eggplant fries are awesome. I'm excited to do some outdoor drinking there when it gets a little bit warmer. It's a family-run place, so it has a few quirks that could irk some people, but as long as you are a normal person who doesn't freak out if the food happens to takes a little long to arrive then there will be no issue. The people who run the restaurant are incredibly friendly and welcoming.
