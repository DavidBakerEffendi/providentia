A friend and I came for buck a shuck oysters and really enjoyed our time here. The oysters were of really fine quality and paired nicely with the house wine, only $4 during happy hour. We also ordered the calamari, which was extremely fresh and almost decadent. We sat at the bar, and the service was quite good there. Ordinary prices can get up there, but happy hour during buck a shuck Mondays is the perfect time to go if you're looking to save a little but still enjoy some good quality food and drink. You can certainly find me here on subsequent Mondays.
