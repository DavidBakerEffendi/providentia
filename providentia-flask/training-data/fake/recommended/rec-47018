Been here many times.  Staff are always friendly, and breakfast is usually pretty good. I found the dinners to be fancy-looking, but not great.  I thought the price was a bit high. My recommendation is to get the breakfast to-go, as during the weekends the sidewalks are packed with people waiting to get in.
