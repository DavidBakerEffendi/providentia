I'm a sucker for any restaurant with a Nahuatl name, but when that same restaurant has amazing tortilla soup TOO... say it ain't so!  Everyone at my table ended up ordering a bowl of the soup after they tried mine. I ordered an Horchata to drink (my favorite, and I couldn't believe it was on their menu), but they said they made a "bad batch" and wouldn't serve it.  Strange, but... thank you I suppose? The restaurant is small, with a quaint downstairs, lit mainly by candles, decorated with tile and cute carved chairs. I will say that the appetizers are definitely small, not made for sharing. BUT the entree dishes are big and make up for the hunger that you think you'll be leaving with at the end of the meal.  We ordered ceviche, huarache de horongo, guacamole (you pick the ingredients), and soups. The guacamole is delicious too, I highly recommend adding fresh garlic to it.  The pollo frito is the house special, which I got, but I think next time I want to try their steak.   They make some strong drinks (especially if you know what kind of tequila to ask for, I recommend Corralejo).  The dessert was a-ok, nothing to write home about, but I would definitely try the flan next time for a switch-up. Its one of those places that you'll go over and over again until you find what you love on the menu... and then you'll go there and only order that... over and over again.
