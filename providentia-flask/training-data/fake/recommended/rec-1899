Great place to sit down, and have a cheap Kenzinger. The menu is pretty tasty, albeit limited and not as cheap as i'd like, but its hard to go wrong with anything. The upstairs has more of an nightclubby feel, and thats where the numerous music acts perform. The balcony overlooking the stage area is a nice spot to watch whatevers going on without being in the thick of things. I go here much more than I probably should, but that's not a slight against the place, its just so easy to default to it. Reasonable beer, decent food, and an easy to find location.
