I'd say 4.5, I've been here three times, and it's worth the price. The food is so delicious here, really authentic quality Italian. The foccaccia breadbasket alone makes me feel sorry for those not eating carbs- so delish. And the appetizers such as zucchini flowers, beet salad, burrata are perfect. Pasta is very tasty as well, as was the creamy gazpacho soup I had. All in all my favorite fine Italian dining in Soho/Tribeca.
