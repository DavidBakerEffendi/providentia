My husband and I went to Philly for my birthday and made a reservation at L'Angolo for dinner. At first when you enter the restaurant, it is quite cramped and all the tables are very snug and close to each other. The food and service however is definitely worth the sacrifice of space. Our waiter was incredibly nice and allowed us to each order two half-entres each since we couldn't make up our minds on what to order. We also had forgotten to bring wine (like so many other PA restaurants, L'Angolo cannot sell alcohol), but our waiter generously filled us two glasses of left over wine a party had left behind the night before. The food is AMAZING. The veal ravioli was one of the best things I've ever had. I also ordered the spaghetti with meatballs, and the meat sauce was sweet and delicious. For dessert my husband had the tarimasu which he loved, and I enjoyed a chocolate torte with raspberry sauce. YUM! Its not outrageously priced, either. I definitely recommend L'Angolo to others who love Italian food!
