This review is for the hoagie, not the cheese/meat counter. I read the rave reviews of Salumeria, and was expecting something fantastic.  Really, I'd have settled for just plain "good", but after my third bite, the blatant mediocrity of Subway would have been an improvement. I was seriously underwhelmed. I ordered a roast beef sub.  I'm fairly certain that the brownish looking stuff they put in my sandwich was a Florsheim factory second.  Seriously, I have had kosher roast beef that was more moist and juicy. This stuff...it was one step away from being jerky.  For an establishment that prides itself on its meats, this is not acceptable.  Next time, I'll go to Tommy DiNic's.
