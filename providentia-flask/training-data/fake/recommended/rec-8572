Ok have to be honest to the palate in my mouth and true to the food. That being said. Here we go!!!!! Ordered Bangkok galore sadly to say disappointed... The drink was from a can and had an after taste of metal. Sent it back got the same thing. Told waitress no good taste like metal. Ok next the mussels were in a thick garlic sauce with chunks of green pepper and onions. Not a whole lot of mussels. The Singapore noodles is the way to go. The black pepper chicken also hit the button. Also ask for fresh lime on the side to squeeze on top of the chicken. I tried to salvage the drinks but not happening. Perhaps if they squeezed fresh lemon in the drink then the Bangkok would have Ben a true galore... Mango needs lemon cause it pops the flavor. So water was the savior and the crab cake was subpar no flavor and tasted fishy. Again I've come here before and the food was right on. But the male waiter wasn't working and he does a real good job in checking the food and drinks. Can't remember his name but he knows me so I will have to peek my head in for now on just to be sure. The chicken wrapped in pannan leaf was aromatic but failed in taste but on a plus side good presentation. Stuffed chicken wings were sold out and that's what you want as an appetizer. En closing my fellow food critics keep eating and be true to the food. To be continued........
