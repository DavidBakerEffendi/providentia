Went to Penelope for brunch on President's Day with two friends. There was a 45 minute wait but the host was great and sat us at the bar after about 20 minutes. First thing I loved about Penelope was the coffee near the waiting area because I'm the kind of person that can wait for food in the morning, but not for my caffeine fix. Also, I went there in sweats and rainboots and felt completely comfortable because the crowd seemed easy-going. Not one of those places you'd feel uncomfortable rolling out of bed to go to! Once we were seated, we ordered. The bartender was friendly and answered all of my friend's questions about the menu. The food was served promptly after we ordered. I got the 'Sam I Am' which was pretty good, but my friend got the Spinach Pie which seemed like the better choice. I will definitely explore the menu a little more because I'm sure most of the dishes are better. The fries here are amazing! Each brunch prix came with juice and your choice of a mimosa or tea/coffee. I think 14.50 is a very reasonable price for what I was served. Â The atmosphere is very cheery, perfect for a brunch spot and the service was perfect, but I wasn't especially happy with my dish.
