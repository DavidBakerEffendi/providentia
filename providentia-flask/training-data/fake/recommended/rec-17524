The best Cuban food I ever had in my life! Good music, friendly staff and beautiful atmosphere. If you order the right meal, you can split it for two people. I recommend the seasoned Steak and Sangria. Good prices considering the authenticity of the cuisine. Unbelievably good. Bring Pete to the Bronx, otherwise, I will have to keep driving to Montclair!
