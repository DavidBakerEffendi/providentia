Myself and a friend came here this past weekend from a rec. from my sister and her boyfriend. Did not disappoint. There's no reason not to give it 5 stars because it's exactly what we were looking for: the portions were not ridiculous, everything was well thought out (i.e the yogurt sauce contrast on the spicy lamb meatball appetizer), and it was all a great value. We shared the spicy lamb meatballs, the house made pickle plate (should be called house made PICKLED plate because it's not different pickles...just a few pickles and pickled veggies), heirloom tomato salad side, and the mixed grill. Very doable to share 2 apps, and entree, and a side if it's just 2 people.
