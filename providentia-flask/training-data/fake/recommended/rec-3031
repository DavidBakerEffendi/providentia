Jordan's Hot Dog and Mac is the place to be! A wide variety of hot dog choices, sides, and even burgers for those of you who don't do dogs. I had the Mac Dog...initially thought it would be weird, but on the first bite, was reminded how much I liked hot dogs in my childhood Mac n' Cheese. Also had Foxon Park soda selection that we love! Our second visit, and still very pleased. A family run business. We were happy to be kindly greeted and remembered by the owners!
