Ate here a couple of months ago and wished we had similar restaurants closer to home.  The food is fantastic.  We ate a large variety of dishes from the dates to the lamb and everything was great.  We had to have the lamb three times.  I like having the kitchen open for viewing but I wished we could have sat at the kitchen bar.  Some sort of rule change closed that option down? It's more expensive than I'm used to but so is everything else in NYC.
