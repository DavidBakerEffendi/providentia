I have been here at least a dozen times.  It is a fun place. The beer selection is MEH.....the food is absolutely terrible.  All of it. The bathroom situation is miserable.   I stopped there this past Friday night...and oh how things have changed.  The place was packed with Pauly D's and Situations......wall to wall.  Girls with poofs stumbling around looking bad.  The bouncers now reflect the clientele.  The south Jersey kids obviously found out about this place. Say what you want about hipsters, but I would take them all day versus the bros.
