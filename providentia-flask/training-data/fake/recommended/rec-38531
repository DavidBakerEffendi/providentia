Omg I finally found a vegetarian friendly spot, where EVERYthing is vegetarian. Okay, let me back up. I went to Philly for a concert and while driving, I spotted this place. My friend looked it up and saw it was all vegetarian. I though woah. Even the shrimp....even the shrimp. Before we departed Philly, we stopped by and since I've been a vegetarian for 6 years, I was kinda wanted something kinda resembling a cheese steak. I ordered the chicken Â cheese steak on a sesame roll. Eh. Bread was too chewy but I could taste the potential. My friend loved her shrimp wrap and because of that, I'm willing to give it another chance. In fact, Im even willing to try most of the menu. Where this place loses a star (besides the chewy bread) is the fact my friend had a discount deal and I the cashier didnt wait for us to pull it up for our discount. We'll use it next time....
