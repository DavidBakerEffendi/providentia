Recently went to Libretti's for the first time for a work holiday lunch.  There was a special, limited menu due to the size of the group, but there was a chicken, veal, and seafood option.  For a lunch, the portions were great and the meal included a salad, pasta course, and entree.  The bread brought to the table was fresh, warm, and a generous size. The service was attentive and the pace was well-timed.  If I'm back in the area, I would definitely try Libretti's again.
