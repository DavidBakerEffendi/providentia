Went here last night and will never go back! They should take DINER off their name. They are now trying to be an upscale bistro. The typical diner menu has been replaced by a limited selection menu with offerings like carpaccio, ahi tuna etc. oh they still have hamburgers and sandwiches for $11-$12 each. The last straw was when I asked the waitress for a slice if cheesecake and she said ,"we don't make cheesecake anymore, it's sad". Good thing there are a myriad of diners left to try in NJ.
