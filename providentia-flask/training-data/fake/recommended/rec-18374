This place was great for brunch. It's a tiny spot though, so it's not the best spot for big groups. I'd make a reservation. I split three meals with two friends, and they were all fantastic. My favorites were the chicken and waffles and the banana bread French toast. I've never had chicken and waffles before, so I was a little nervous to try it. I was so pleasantly surprised! There were so many flavors going on at once! And banana bread turned into French toast- why haven't I thought of this before? So moist and flavorful! They take cards, which is great if like me you rarely have cash. I'll definitely be back! Maybe shrimp and grits next time? Only if I can convince whoever is with me to get the chicken and waffles so I can have a bite!
