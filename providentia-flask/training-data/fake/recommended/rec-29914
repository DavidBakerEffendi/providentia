This is an amazing addition to the UES!  I am so happy I finally went in.  As I was walking on 2nd Ave last week someone from Abaleh was standing outside giving out samples of falafel with tahini.  I thought to myself, if this place is willing to give me a delicious full piece of falafel as a free sample, then I'm willing to give them a shot. We decided to go to Abaleh for lunch today.  As we walked in we were greeted by extremely friendly staff.  They explained how the ordering process worked.  We decided to get falafel in pitas.  The pitas were fresh and looked golden.  The falafel looked extremely fresh and were literally fried right in front of us.  They loaded our pita with hummus lining the inside (what a concept -- a little for every bite).  We were told that with the pita we were able to basically choose as many sides as we wanted that would fit.  (I'm so used to going to places where they charge you for every little addition).   The food was delicious!  The only thing I am upset about is that I hadn't come to Abaleh sooner.  Abaleh was so unbelievably clean and the staff was so helpful and nice. I will definitely be back and maybe even try the smoothies -- they look amazing and were so popular.   This place is a must!  It is definitely the best Mediterranean falafel I have had on the UES.
