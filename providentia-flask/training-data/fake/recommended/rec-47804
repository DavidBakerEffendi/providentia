This place is on par for an Italian joint. While the food was pretty good (not overly amazing), the service was just okay. The portion size of the pasta primavera was ample, but the spaghetti with sausage was mostly just angel hair (very little sauce). Great ambiance, despite the photos of tragedies that befell Hartford, which line the walls.
