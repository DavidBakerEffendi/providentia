Went to the Roberta's pop up shop near the BMW Lab in the East Village. I had a terrific eggplant sandwich .  Since Roberta's specializes in pizza I asked why there was no pizza available for purchase.  The snotty hipster doofus behind the counter said said there was no room.   There IS plenty of room, TONS of outdoor space.   The confusing part is - if you specialize in selling pizza. why don't you sell pizza?  I know it is very easy to build an outdoor oven.
