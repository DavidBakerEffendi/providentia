Great, intimate atmosphere, and beautiful modern decor, good service, owner very nice. The food- where to begin. WAY better than my normal Thai down the street (the one with the chandelier) and actually a bit cheaper too! We did dumplings, I had the curry noodle dish (highly recommend), and we had green tea ice cream with Azuki beans. All fantastic! Great place for a dinner date that wont put you out! Highly recommend!!
