Visiting from out of town and this place was recommended by a friend. The food was excellent. First the waiter brought pspad to the table. Then we tried the veggie samosas, lamb and chicken tikka masala and garlic Â naan. The waiter then brought a dessert to our table and said it was seviyan. Whatever it was it was good. Good tasting food at a good price! You can also bring your own bottle of wine which was nice.
