We arrived exactly at 7pm on a Saturday, had to wait 20 minutes to be seated which is fine and to be expected at a popular restaurant. The pizza is everything you've heard about it-- everything tasted fresh and delicious. The beer selection is phenomenal. The only complaint was that the staff were annoying and rude. I had two people (one of which was our waiter) come up and ask us if we wanted to "put that in a box" while we were clearly still in the middle of eating. We had only been actually seated for about 40 minutes, most of which was spent waiting for the pizza to arrive. Rushing patrons to get out is rude and bad practice. I don't care if there are people waiting an hour to be seated, I arrived earlier so I'll stay as long as I need. And to interrupt a conversation and meal to, more or less, say "get the hell out" is insulting. For a restaurant to be considered "great" it takes more than just good food and drinks. AF seriously Â needs to prioritize service over volume.
