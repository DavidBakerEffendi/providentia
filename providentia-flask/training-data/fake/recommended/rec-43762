First off: you cannot possibly go wrong with bacon wrapped dates.  Anywhere.  It is just one of those foods that is impossible to screw up.  And these ones were especially good.  They were especially large (2-3 bites a piece) which made them extra-delectable!   And 4 different types of sangria on the menu?  Yes please!  Mine was white wine based (honestly, tasted more like a mimosa, but that's fine, I like mimosas) and my friend had the special, which had grapefruit (sounded gross to me, but she enjoyed it).  The food was delightful. Only minor gripe was the service.  By the time they brought my friend's salad, she kind of wished they hadn't. It had been so long since we had ordered and since they had brought the rest of our food that the salad was sort of unnecessary.  But vegetables are good for you so she ate it anyway.
