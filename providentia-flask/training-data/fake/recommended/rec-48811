Steak lovers in my family love the steak here. All of the food is of high quality and very filling. They so have a kids menu which is nice. They didn't give it to us on being seated (though at least one of my kids is clearly in that range at 7). Â While the service is friendly, it's also very slow. I'd expect more attentive service given the prices and class of restaurant. Overall, it's a lovely place and very expensive.
