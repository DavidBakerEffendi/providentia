Ordered out for delivery last night and I figured I'd give them a try only because I got a deal $15 for $30 in food. The food was good, except for the calamari, which seemed undercooked. The food was a little pricey, but with the deal it was fine. My biggest complaint was that it took 1:15 minutes to get the food and the food wasn't warm. I can deal with the food not being warm,I just put it in the oven for a few, Â but that's too long to wait for food. If you want my business you need to hire another driver or get faster drivers. It was a Wednesday night, not Friday or Saturday.
