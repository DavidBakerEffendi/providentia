I was on the hunt for a great cheesesteak when visiting Philadelphia and after some research decided to try Sonny's instead of Geno's and Pat's. I got the cheesesteak with whiz and onions. The bread was good but I thought the meat was a little flavorless. The whiz and onions helped but I was still a little underwhelmed from my high expectations. The folks behind the counter were friendly and the spot seemed cool, though I was there on a slow night.
