Popped into Rudy's late night on Friday, and I must say, they had the most friendly crowd in the city. Now, I know it sounds silly, but on a Friday night, you're looking for places with a great vibe, right? Friendly people with whom you can dance and party and talk to while grabbing a drink. That crowd. Well, Rudy's has them- all of them- so head there when you're in the mood to meet some awesome new partners in crime.
