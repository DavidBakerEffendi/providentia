Ok so the waiter was pretty nice when taking our order. We ordered  wings, cheeseburger, and southern border chicken wrap no fries because i have the WORST LUCK WITH FRIES lol. Wings- DEFF WASN'T GOOD (really chewy not cooked and the blue cheese was probably expired)  it seemed like they threw it in the microwave to heat up. Southern Chicken wrap- Delicious!! Crunchy from the lettuce Chicken soft and easy to chew. Cheese burger- Good... Smooth and Cheesy i would go again to see what else can be consumed :-)
