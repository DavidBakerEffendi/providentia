Ordered the New England Hake, and it had a slight bleachy flavor. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe it was just me or that my cocktail had gone to my head. I mentioned it to a friend the next day and she informed me that fish smells and tastes like amonia once it has started to decompose. Wish I knew better while I was there, and I'm *really* glad I didn't get sick from the old fish I was served. I won't be back.
