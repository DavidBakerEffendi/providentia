I love Talyas..it's one of my favorite breakfast/ lunch spot in Bayonne.. However, I would recommend going on a weekday and not the weekend. The staff is phenomenal; however, since I Â a brunch connoisseur I typically avoid it on the weekend because the wait is much longer and it's too cramped. Overall this is a hidden gem in Bayonne! I highly recommend checking it out on a weekday morning or afternoon if it's your first time..and get to know the staff because they truly make the experience!
