The setting of the place is wonderful, the atmosphere is cosy and elegant at the same time, the staffs are friendly and helpful. It is a great place to impress your visitors and friends. It is also quite expensive, about $50 per person for dinner. I had been there several times. My last visit was to celebrate the closing of my new house. The weakest point, however, is the food - the selection is boring and the taste is average at best. Â I had a lobster that was way over cooked and drowned in a repulsive tomato based source that was way too salty, veal steak with mouth feel resembled the texture of the napkin, and rib eye that was as blend as water. But the portion is big.
