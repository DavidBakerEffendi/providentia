I went here with my boyfriend.  Great place for a date.  We ordered the red sangria.  It was very tasty.  The pitcher was around $35, so reasonably priced.  We ordered around six small dishes to share.  All of the dishes we ate were fantastic.  We had scallops, lamb skewers, patatas bravas, and several other dishes.  The restaurant was a little loud for me, but we went at prime dining time (8:00), and I usually prefer a quieter atmosphere.  I would highly recommend Tia Pol.
