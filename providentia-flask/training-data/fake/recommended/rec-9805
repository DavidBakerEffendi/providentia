Heard a lot about this place before trying it myself.  The truffle fries have crack sauce.  Really savory and creamy and soooo goood.  Their house ketchup is interesting and different as well but their burgers were just...so so.  Luckily we came late on a week night, and were able to snag immediate seats at the bar.  I'm not sure if it would have been worth a really long wait...
