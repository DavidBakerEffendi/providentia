Great little space for friends gathering or a date. I'm amazed at how many people they can pack into this place but it doesn't feel overly crowded which is a plus. Lighting is a bit dim and the decor is not what you would expect at a Thai restaurant.  Almost like a hooka lounge feel with vinyl button couches, rusty framed mirrow on top and a ginormous crystal chandelier encased in glass in the middle of the room.   Food was pretty good. the girls shared a mussel appetizer and two had squid ink pasta while I had Pad See Ew.  Squid ink pasta was better.  Portions are great and we all left feeling full. They do not take reservations for parties less than 5 so be sure to go there around 8pm on a weekend if you have 2/3 people. Otherwise the place fills up fast.
