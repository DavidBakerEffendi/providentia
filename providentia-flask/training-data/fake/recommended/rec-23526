Wow I am amazed at all the great reviews posted here about this restaurant...yet my experience here was terrible...I went with my family for the first time(and last) First we waited a LONG TIME to be seated...then when we finally get a booth, we waited a LONG TIME just to get the menus, which looked like flyers. Â The Waitress was super SLOW and we even considered leaving, but we were starving! We placed our order and not to sound like a broken record the food took so long, they gave us the entrees first and asked if we still wanted our appetizers.....I wish my experience here was as good as the others reviews here....
