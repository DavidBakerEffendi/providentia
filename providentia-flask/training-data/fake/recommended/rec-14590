Pros: Great ambience Food is spectacular Service is great Did I say the place was decked out and epic? Loungey Lunch specials over the weekend Yellow curry fried rice in an omelette Cons: Tofu basil was not great. Smelled fish like. I'm saving the fifth star for consistency. If and when I come back more I will update.
