One of my favorite spots in the city. The pizza here tastes so fresh and the crust is simply amazing. As for small plates, I Highly recommend the Brussels sprouts and spaghetti squash. All the cocktails are amazing as well. I have been coming here for a couple years now and will continue to return. Highly recommend!
