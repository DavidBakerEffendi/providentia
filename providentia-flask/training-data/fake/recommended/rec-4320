For the price that you will be paying here, the food is mediocre at best. I paid around $13 for a burger, fries, and a drink. You don't have to look far to find much better, and more reasonably priced burgers elsewhere. On a plus note, they have a good variety of burgers here, which they will cook to your preferences. The fries are pretty decent too. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is kept very clean. Bottom line: At these prices, you can get a much better burger at an actual sit-down restaurant.
