Wow. Bouley. What can I say. The restaurant is like a hybrid between a French chateau and you rich jewish grandmothers living room. We disregarded the menu, and asked the chef to give us 13 courses with paired wine. I recommend this for foodies. We got 4 fish courses, 5 meat, 3 deserts and cheese course. All with the most amazing paired wine. one of their meat courses was a whole chicken cooked in a dough sealed glass container on a bed of alfalpha grass. Chicken cooked this way, dissolves on your tongue like sushi. HIghly recommend this fine French/American eating experience.
