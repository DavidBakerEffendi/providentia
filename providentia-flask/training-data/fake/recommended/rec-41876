Excellent range of foods from comfort to more sophisticated served in a very pleasant atmosphere by a very accommodating staff.  This is an excellent choice for a well-conceived and executed menu that won't break the bank.  Count on spending roughly $45 a person for a full meal with modest drinking.  If you start ordering bottles of wine and cocktails you can run up the tab significantly, but, then, that is true anywhere!!!!!!
