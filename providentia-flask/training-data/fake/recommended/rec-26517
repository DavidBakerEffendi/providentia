I've definitely had my ups and downs with this place.  If it the food was good one time, the service was bad. The next time the service will be good, but the food is lacking. I pretty much have decided no more El Camino for awhile though since my last visit. I can make excuses for the service because it was the opening of the Piazza and a lot busier there than usual on a Saturday afternoon, but when I ordered the simple 2 eggs any way dish and never got my hash browns I was annoyed.  And then two minutes later when I noticed a black ant-like slug crawling on my plate I was downright grossed out. Yeah, I should have said something, but I was too bummed out from such a terrible brunch that I just wanted to leave. If El Camino Real is empty-ish you should go since I have had good meals here before. But if they're full, all hell may just break loose onto your plate.
