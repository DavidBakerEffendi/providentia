The folks at Il Pittore were so lovely and accommodating, even when half of our table showed up twenty-five minutes late for our reservation. Service was outstanding, and our server recommended a fabulous wine for the table. The food was exquisite, especially the baked ricotta and the swiss chard ravioli with truffle oil. Also, the dessert portions were very manageable - a trio of sorbets was the perfect finish. The space is really pleasant - not too loud or too crowded, and the plant lined skylights do an excellent job of opening the room up and bringing the outdoors in. I would recommend coming for an earlier dinner just to enjoy how nice the light comes through. Overall, a truly wonderful dining experience! We will be back!
