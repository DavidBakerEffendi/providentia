The wait was WAAAY too long. We waited over an hour and that's just not cool for a place that sells meatballs. Also, when we were finally seated, my seat was touching the seat of the person behind me (same situation for my bf). Pretty claustrophobic. Not to mention that there doesn't seem to be enough staff at the restaurant because it would take forever for us to get served. We got the special that night that included a pesto sauce that was delicious and redeemed the whole experience in my mind. We tried a bit of everything, sliders, heroes, risotto, and the balls with the focaccia. If I got back, I probably wouldn't order the hero and would just get a bunch of 4 balls w/ focaccia and various sides. The wholewheat hero was just not worth it as a healthier option. I thought the bread tasted awful and ruined the meatball. The ice cream sandwich for dessert was great though. 1 was enough for the two of us to share.
