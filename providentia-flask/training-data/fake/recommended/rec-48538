I was here for an early dinner, so I never got a chance to check out the upstairs area, that has a pool table.  I believe it opened at 8pm.  The bartender, Joe (I think) was friendly and very attentive.  I was greeted as soon as I came in.  There was a good mix of regulars and bigger groups.  I had a delicious brunch burger with back and Sriracha sauce, yum.  The place is very punk rock with eclectic art and decor.  I totally want the great octopus chandelier.
