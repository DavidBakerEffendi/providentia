I recently went to this place with a group of friends. I liked how there was a giant picnic tables outside, made it feel very southern in the middle of BK. The wait staff is also very friendly, very casual. I ordered the gruelle & mushroom mac and cheese with a side of collard greens (at the insistence of one of my friends) to try it out. I feel in love with the mac and cheese, and although was hesitant to try the collard greens (I usually don't like collard greens) I was surprised at how delicious it was. My friends ordered pulled pork, and ribs, and they loved their food. The saying goes "you know the food is good when people just shut up and eat" and that's what we were doing! great place, great food, great ambiance.
