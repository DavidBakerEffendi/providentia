This was our first authentic cheesesteak experience, and I gotta say that I'm happy we picked Sonny's.  It's in an easy to get to location.  The steak itself was great (we got the traditional), and you can see them make it in front of you.  I gave it a four only because the sandwich was a tad dry.  It needed a bit more cheese.
