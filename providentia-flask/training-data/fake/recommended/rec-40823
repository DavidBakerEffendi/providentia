I visited this place last Monday... Actually it's a modern Sri Lankan restaurant with black n white interior... The owner is really friendly and helpful.. I ordered a seafood fried rice ..... OMG... I can stop eating it... It was absolutely that good... Then I ordered another one to go...waited little bit more as they prepared everything fresh and hot... I highly recommend this place to anyone to taste real Sri Lankan taste...
