A typical tavern-bar kind of eatery. It's not too far from us and offers a lot of different food, and is definitely a very gluttonous option if me and SO decide to go. It's never a yearning, but more of an option when we don't want to think about where to go out to eat. The bar area is usually where we end up, at one of hte tables on the outer part of the room. There is also a dining room area too. If you're eating at the bar it gets Â little crowded. They also grill right at the bar certain foods, so most likely if they got that fired up, you'll end up smelling like your food. Their portions are pretty immense and quite filling, and I've never finished any sort of entree I've gotten there. Their desserts are quite good, the Tollhouse cookie pie is my favorite -it's basically a slightly soften cookie in the shape of a pie slice topped served warm with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and chocolate syrup. The prices are pretty reasonable. It can get crowded during peak hours like on Friday and Saturday nights.
