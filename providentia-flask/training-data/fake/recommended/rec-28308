The Best.  I go there for coffee almost every morning and they have the selection between their normal great coffee or special Vietnamese coffee. All the prices are perfectly low but this doesn't have any noticeable consequences on the food quality.  The lunch sandwhiches are all amazing except I am not such a big fan of the pulled pork they have, try the number 4!
