After completing a charity walk in Central Park, my teammates and I were hungry and looking for an affordable brunch/lunch.  When we exited the park and found ourselves near Columbus Circle, I thought of Ivy.  I had been there before for drinks and wanted to try the food. We sat down for brunch about 11:45 and the place was empty, but the food was great!  I had the red velvet pancakes with cream cheese drizzle.  They were sweet but not overly so, and thick but not heavy.  I left feeling full but not stuffed.  With coffee, entrees and tip the bill was less than $20 per person, a bargain for midtown Manhattan! As we ate, the place got a little more crowded, but it definitely seemed like if you wanted to come and do the $30 unlimited drinks with a brunch entree that you would be able to stay awhile and chat.
