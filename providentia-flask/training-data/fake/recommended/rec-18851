Everything on this menu is great, but the Italian pulled pork (my default) and the brisket are both EXCEPTIONAL and worth the extra dollar or two. Whatever you get, make sure you get it with sharp provolone, which I didn't know about until I ate here (and my life hasn't been the same since). While you're at it, go ahead and add something else (broccoli rabe, sauteed spinach, hot or sweet peppers). You really can't go wrong. I just graduated from Penn and have moved out of Philly and this is honestly one of the things I will miss the most. If I could eat here everyday and not die 30 years early I would do it.
