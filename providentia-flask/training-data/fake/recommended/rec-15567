Such a perfect middle eastern brunch place. I went there with my friend and we fell in love. Their eggs florentine are delicious. Moreover, they're served aside the perfect potatoes hash with crunchy corners and soft centers, perfectly seasons with a hint of slice in the back if your throat. It's great. Their challah French toast is so tasty I would definitely recommend it. Moreover, they have an option for a side of malawach. We were so excited about this. And their malawach (pan fried dough) was perfectly done. I don't know if they make the dough on premises or not because it definitely doesn't taste the ones available for purchase in the freezer aisle, but ill say this. It's flaky and layered and tastes great even on its own. Their labane is perfectly tart. At my house its a staple and I was shocked to see it served with za'atar. It made me feel right at home. I loved it. Of course, no brunch is complete with a Bloody Mary and mine was just spicy and made just right. Then again, any place that messes up a Bloody Mary has no chance of remaining open for business hahaha. Cafe Orlins has a fantastic middle eastern menu and I enjoy returning to them every time I go. Oh and their service is good too. It's not amazing but it's not bad either. The one thing that I'll say is that you should expect to wait for a table without a reservation at the door. Stop by, make a reservation and then walk around and come back. That's my best opinion.
