This is probably the only restaurant where even a simple plate of fresh vegetables was amazing. There is not one thing that was wrong about Bohemian. You feel like you are in a friend's living room having the best meal of your life. Fantastic! PS: the fish is to die for even though the restaurant is renown for the meat since it is right behind the butcher store.
