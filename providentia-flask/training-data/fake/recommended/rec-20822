When I took a trip up to Jersey recently , I was searching for somewhere casual for lunch. I was pointed in the direction of Hapgoods. The deli's atmosphere was Clean and appealing. The meal delivered was just as enjoyable as the friendly service. I felt very comfortable and at home at Hapgoods , and I am looking forward to eating there again on my next trip up.
