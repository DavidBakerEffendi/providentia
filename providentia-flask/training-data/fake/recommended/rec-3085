This was my first time trying Puerto Rican cuisine and I loved it! The restaurant is a very cute mom and pops place and you feel like you are at a family house. Everyone who worked there was very friendly and very sweet. They treated us very well and couldn't ask for better service. The food was delicious and we cleaned our plates. I would absolutely return and recommend everyone to check this restaurant out.
