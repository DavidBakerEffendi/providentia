I frequent Moto but I figured it was time to write a review! And a little update for yelp, Moto finally takes credit cards! This place is my go to neighborhood spot. They consistently have amazing food, a wonderful ambience, and great service. Sometimes the live music gets a little too loud and intense, but I suppose that's all part of it. The other great thing about Moto is that it is quality food for the right price. Servings are medium-sized and the food looks and tastes great. Their wine and beer selections are also reasonably priced, and they offer a wide variety. This place is great morning, afternoon, or late night. A little hard to seat a lot of people at once, but they do the best they can. I like it most when I'm just with one other person or a small group. enjoy!
