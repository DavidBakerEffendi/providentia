Cheap, plentiful beer, large burgers with fries and bacon: these are the hallmarks of an evening at the Corner Bistro. I am still looking for the best burger in Manhattan, though. I return to the CB when I can see that it's not crowded, but I prefer not to wait in the abnormally dank bar for a cramped table.
