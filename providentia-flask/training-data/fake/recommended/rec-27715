Saturday night, friends staying over and you are searching for a good restaurant which is willing to serve you food post 10:20PM (when half of the restaurants on oak tree road are closed). We walked in the door expecting another 'Sorry kitchen is closed Sir Sign', but to our surprise person at the front desk greeted us with a smile and was very willing to serve us warm food. A group of 4, we ordered. (Mostly ordered veg because our friends were strictly vegetarian) Sweet corn soup - 5/5 Paneer Lakhnawi - 3/5 (not enough seasoning - mild) Veg Manchurian - 5/5 (Very good - with Gravy) Schewan noodles - 4/5 (very good, but i think quantity should be more) Rice & Rotis - 5/5 The soup was awesome, best out of the rest i have had so far around this area. Chinese was killer(#indianStyle). Definitely going to pay another visit to try some more delicacies.
