This place is great. Good hot dogs and a great outdoor patio... good beer menu. And kids. What is with the kids? I'm a mother-- I get it. You want a beer and you want family time. This place is very accommodating to families, but at some point, enough is enough. My daughter is away with her father, and I'm out for a night of adult time. Instead, I'm listening to a colicky baby and several (several!) toddlers who's parents think its cute when they scream (really scream) for attention. I've brought my daughter here. She's ten. She's quiet and respectful, and if she wasn't, we'd give due respect to the rest of the patrons and excuse ourselves. I think that maybe the establishment would do well to impose some sort of after 7, no kid rule. Doesn't feel like a bar as much as a daycare. I should mention that this atmosphere of noisy children is not an isolated event. The last two or three visits has been the same. Last time, it was enough that we had to change tables, and watched another party do the same.
