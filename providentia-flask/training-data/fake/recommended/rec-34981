Went here for a nice Saturday night dinner a couple of weeks ago. The ambience was superb. Very relaxing, loved the interior! Food was great - had the Tofu Pad Ped. Nice big pieces of tofu filled with great flavor. Medium spicy which was just the perfect heat and met my expectations. Service was great. Will be returning.
