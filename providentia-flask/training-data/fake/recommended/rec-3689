This place is great! The ambiance is fantastic, like a little neighborhood joint that's been around forever.  Very romantic for a date.  My boyfriend and I were definitely the youngest people there by a generation, but it was not weird.  We went Memorial Day weekend (when all of NYC is out of town) so there was no wait, and service was attentive.  BYOB is a plus.  The food was really solid is not knock-your-socks off.  Portions were definitely healthy.  I mentioned to the waiter that scallops in the cioppino  had kind of a metalic after-taste, and he comped us a delicious flourless chocolate cake.
