First off, McGillin's is (if not THE oldest) one of the oldest bars in Philadelphia. They have a wide selection of great food, a really good selection of good local and not so local beers. Plus they have nacho night on thursdays where you can get a heaping plate of nachos for $3! Every time my friends and I go we get Original Sin Cider! If you like ciders this is definitely the best cider and it's the only place to my knowledge that you can get it on tap! Good and cheap times are to be had by anyone who goes there. My only gripe about it is on the weekends... too many people but go there during the week and its awesome. P.S. Gabby is the best waitress there so sit in her section, its usually in the back left hand corner from the entrance on the first floor and as always tip your waitress/bartender as they are always on point here! In other words there is never an empty pitcher on my table and my friends and I usually drink a good amount.
