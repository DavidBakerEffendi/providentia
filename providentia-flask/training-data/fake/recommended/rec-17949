i ate here a few months ago. My wife's job decided to treat us to dinner. We had 1 1/2 pound lobsters each. This place has private parking, but be warned that on weekend nights this place is packed and Â you might not be able to park there, also be ready to wait 1 hour or more for a table at times. They serve Iberian food mostly on the spanish side of things. This place is good for a date, It has a cozy feeling, its not very loud, and well decorated. Service is fast and effecient and at time you will have 2 or 3 different people bringing you different items. They usually serve you a big loaf of special bread which is designed to stuff your stomach prior to the food comming, so that you are not able to finish your food and go home well satisfied and with a doggie bag. Even if you are hungry, resist the temptation of eating bread once you get there.
