I was very excited when this restaurant opened and it certainly did not fail to impress. The decor is modest but the food is extraordinary. The fried chicken is wonderfully spiced and made fresh to order but that's not even the half of it. Everything I've had on the menu, both chicken and Korean, (which with school right there has been quite a bit) is out of this world and the staff is very pleasant and always ready with a free sample. This restaurant succeeds on all counts and I hope it will be there for quite some time.
