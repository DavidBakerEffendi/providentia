Have been to this food truck close to a handful of times and will continue to go.  One of the better food trucks in the midtown east area. Have only tried the rice dishes Both the Moroccan Kofta and Merguez have been super flavorful and juicy.  The tilapia was cooked perfectly but not as well seasoned. TIP - Do not douse both the red hot and spicy mint sauce over the food unless you want to set your mouth on fire.
