We loved the homestyle Italian food.  However, the restaurant was very busy and service was very slow.  It took 20-30 minutes before our waiter approached our table.  He did not tell us the evening specials, never brought us the clams oreganato that we ordered, and we had to ask for water.  Finally, another waiter took over our table, but that was at the end of the meal.  If not for this bad service, i would have given Piccolo Angolo 4 stars.
