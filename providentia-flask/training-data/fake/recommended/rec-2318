I thought this place was quaint and the atmosphere was nice. The only downside was that it was quite loud. However by around 9pm, the crowd starts to thin out, so it was fine. We were able to get a reservation (same-day), which was great - and for a larger group of 5. My experience overall was A-OK at Melograno. I did have a wonderful salad of the day that consisted of grilled/sliced artichokes and arugula. My main dish was a pappardelle pasta (tomato based) with shrimp (literally three pieces) and scallops. It was simply ok. I had the warm spiced chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream that was good, but not out of this world.
