This place is super tiny and crammed full of people.  The waitresses are fast, and the menu confuses most people.  It is set up as a "create your own" kind of situation where you choose the protein you like and pair it with the noodles that you want.   I ordered the knife cut noodles fried (not in broth) because I was wanting some thick chewy goodness.  What I received was a plate of the most oily and limp tiny pieces of noodles that I have ever attempted to eat.  After three bites, my stomach began to shut down and hurt immediately.  However, the table next to us ordered the same exact thing and the noodles came out looking completely different, long whole noodles, not broken into pieces and not oily.   We had the cold and spicy cucumbers to try to cut the grease, but they were oily as well.  Tasted great, but very greasy. My husband had the pork chop noodle soup with thin noodles and the noodles were good.  The pork chop was whole, floating in the broth, and very tough.  The soup tasted just like the gravy from KFC, I am so not kidding! I left here hungry and confused.  It is really too bad that I had to have this sort of experience here.  With the glowing reviews, I did not think that would ever happen.
