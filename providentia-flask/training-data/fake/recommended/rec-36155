Ok, let me tell you....my 14 year son has a trained pallet for sushi and only eats the sushi prepared by the disciples of JIRO.  That said, this sushi was weak!   my son says "horrible!" "Tiny portions" "sea urchin didn't taste fresh, and looked like vomit on a bed of rice"  "the clams were chewy in the miso soup". From my own experience, I felt the service was arrogant, the lights were overly bright, and the sushi chefs didn't seem interested.  Buy a ticket to seattle with your money and dine at Shiros:)
