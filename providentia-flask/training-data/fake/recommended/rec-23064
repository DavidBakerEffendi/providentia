Greeted by the hostess who was wonderful, smiling and found us a great place to sit! Food was a little bit slow coming out, but it was a Saturday morning, so that's expected. Although, later found out it was a problem with an understaffed kitchen. Very clean place, friendly staff, nice menu(bit different than the menus by me), and a good place to go for a decent, inexpensive meal.
