So much better than expected. And, dare I say it: so much better than current state of bistro fare in Paris itself. The bread was terrific -crusty on the outside, moist and chewy on the inside. We both had the soup of the day which was an excellent squash soup laced with dark green streaks of extra virgin olive oil. I thought it was a little under-salted but my husband didn't (and we are usually on the opposite sides on this.). I had the mussels in white wine and garlic which came with plump fresh mussels in a terrific broth (the bread came in handy once the mussels were gone -mmmm) and good skinny fries. My husband, who'd just come back from Paris, had "pan roasted" chicken with string beans and potato puree. He loved it. He said he'd tried four different times to find this meal in Paris but, unlike years past, had not succeeded in finding it. We will definitely go back. The restaurant was small (and the tables quite close together) so reservations would be smart. They apparently have a prix fixe brunch on both Saturday and Sunday we know nothing about but seems like it might be a good deal. (advt price was $14.95)
