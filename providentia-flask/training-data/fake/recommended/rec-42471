I had a groupon for this place. I purchased a roast beef sub, turkey sandwich and a couple of salads. My husband was upset because he felt they were stingy with the meat. My turkey was average-typical deli type. I thought the salads were good; potato, macaroni and coleslaw were all homemade which scores big in my book. My husband thought the salad was bland. The staff was nice, but I won't be going back with or without a groupon.
