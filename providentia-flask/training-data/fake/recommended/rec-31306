This is simply one of the best places to come and eat in NYC and one of my personal favorites that I could never tire of dining in. It's a small and unassuming place that you could easily pass by, however it has a huge following and you'll understand why once  you've been here. Firstly the space. The combination of "extremely popular" and "small" does mean reservations at least 10 days in advance are recommended if you want to be dining at peak time in the evening, although trying your luck can sometimes work as like every restaurant  they have cancellations. Once here you will find a small and intimate looking dining room where that ambience seems to be well suited to small dinner parties and dates alike. Diners can opt to sit at the bar which I prefer if dining in pairs or at the tables. The dining room and restrooms are spotlessly clean. Now for the food: I can honestly say I've never had any food I did not like here. They have a marvelous selection of plates to share and the sushi and sashimi comes highly recommended. My personal favorite dish is the pork belly skewer which is beyond delicious. Hot Pots however are probably what this place is best known for. They come to the table raw, containing meat of choice, covered with broth and stacked with greens and spices and are cooked and served table side. I want to keep on coming back until I've tried all of the food here several times over in different combinations. And the Service: Very friendly and efficient without being rushed and always with a smile. Once you have been here a few times and build up a rapport you are greeted by name. I have been coming here every so often for years now and hope to be coming back for years to come, this place really is five star in pretty much every respect.
