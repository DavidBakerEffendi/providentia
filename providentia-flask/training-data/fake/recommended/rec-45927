I love this diner so much! I come here every once in a while for a bite.  The servers here are very polite and patient with their guests which is a + especially in a food establishment.  They have a variety of foods that you can try.  I usually get the mozzarella sticks and the pizza fries (my favorite).  This diner is great for lunch and dinner.  I cannot wait until my next visit.  I recommend coming here, you will not regret eating here.
