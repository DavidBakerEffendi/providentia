Ah one of Jose Graces's place... I admit the man has some talent for being an iron chef. Â  Tinto has a romantic ambiance where the lighting is balance enough to enjoy the artsy view of your dinner plates. And the mirror walls reflect the stretching feel of a good size room. My date and I were placed in a room closer to the kitchen where we don't mind the background noise of the happy chit-chatters and the light cling-clangs of the kitchen. We weren't that hungry so we ordered 4 tapas. I wouldn't recommend 4 tapas for 2 famish people. The recommendation is 3 tapas per person. But if I was hungry, I think I could destroy 5 tapas and then some. The menu includes the credit of the staffs like the ending of some movie (well that's nice of them). Our selection was the pulpo, pork belly, albondigas, and the green beans. The green beans were an afterthought to cut up the protein pattern. Oh oh watch out for the food paparazzi as I described it in my head while my date took some pictures of the dishes. These tapas are sure pretty. First dish: pulpo (grill octopus) came out with bubbly foam on top and a side of streaking sriracha-like sauce. Fresh, slight crispy-chewy with a nice spice. Second: pork belly was crispy, flavoring, and delish. I could eat like 50 of these if I was self-gluttony bastard. Third: albondigas (meatballs) came with little skews and a pouch egg in the middle of the dish. As my date described it as "savory ", I reply with "yummy". I was lost in words with all the overwhelming flavors (which made me felt kinda dumb haha). Final the afterthought: surprise-surprise, these green beans were man-oh-man (no homo) good. It came with almonds, dates, little oranges, sprinkle paprika, and deliciously good sauce. I wasn't expecting it to be one of the best green beans I've ever tasted. Overall my experience was satisfying and I would recommend it. However, the glaring of beautiful green eyes and cute little giggles helped that experience.
