I wouldnt recommend this place. The steaks arent simply that good. They dont taste good nor does it look appealing. Grills where dirty. Me, nephew and sister went here for my nephews birthday. My nephew isnt picky he will eat just about anything and cheesesteaks are his favorites. Neither of us cared for it. We bought the left overs to parents. No one cared for it. My mom was the only one that said its not too bad. The counter people where friendly and despite the semi long line they where quick. Â Cant describe the taste not that it was horrible but i would say a notch below mediocre.
