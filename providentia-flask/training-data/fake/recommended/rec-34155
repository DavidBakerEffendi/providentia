Yum. Only had a type of calzone here.  Piccante. Cheese ham mushrooms and hot peppers. Real good.  Came out quick and cooked perfect. Nice and crisp - not crusty and dusty. Cute babers for service too.   Been in jury doodie for three days and this was the best I found so far Yelp delivers! Bet happy hour is fun here - nice spot
