I went to Palo Santo this past Saturday for a friend's birthday dinner. The place was recommended to the bday boy by another friend of ours who knew the chef/owner to Palo Santo restaurant. Because my friend had connection, we got free oysters, glasses of champagne and extra desserts on the house. Pretty good. =) The place is quite lovely inside. Love the back where it exhibits a small garden where they plant their own herbs, etc. The view looked awesome at night. I had a pre-fixe dinner which included an appetizer, an entree, and a dessrt. For the appetizer I ordered the Anticuchos which is organs meat that came out kabob style. For the entree I forgot the name but it was a rabbit dish. The rabbit meat was soft and saucy. I wish the dish came with white rice because it got a bit salty for me. It does come with this corn pancake topped with black beans. Overall the entree was pretty good. For dessert, I got a bread pudding cake topped with vanilla ice cream. I was a little disappointment when it came to the desserts because I really wanted something else. I had asked the waiter what kind of desserts they had and he listed about 10 kinds. By the end of our dinner, he told us there were only two types of desserts left. However, I see that as a good thing. Like the dessert, I was told that there were only 5 rabbit left for our table of 14 people. The restaurant does not over order things which means they will run out something but which would also mean they do not keep old things in the freezer and the food the desserts are always going to be fresh. We were the last party left... Oh well. Overall, it was good food in the good restaurant with good friends. =D From my friends' orders, they all stated their dishes were good; Pan Roasted Bluefish and the Steak dish(Forgot the name). As for the appetizers, Tortilla, Avocado, and Blue Cheese Salad.
