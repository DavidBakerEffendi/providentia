After hearing good reviews from my family, I finally had the chance to try this place. On a recent visit to NJ, I decided to give it a try and ordered food to go. The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. Once we ordered, we were greeted by one of the owners and offered complementary plantain chips with a delicious dipping sauce and lemonade. The food was reasonably priced and ready quickly. I ordered the stewed chicken with white rice and red beans. It was everything I love about Puerto Rican food. It was very authentic with a ton of flavor. I also ordered a slice of cake, which I did not like. Overall, the dinner was great and I can't wait to try another dish.
