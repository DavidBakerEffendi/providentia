I sincerely am shocked by some of the bad reviews. I visit for a bagel at least once a week, and I NEVER have been treated badly by the counter service people. I always am waited on by a high schooler and not once have I experienced anything remotely like the rudeness described below. I've been a customer for two years. They're kids, you guys, cut them some slack. Anyway, the bagels are always fresh and tasty, as are the sandwiches (again, just my experience). Very happy to be a return customer!
