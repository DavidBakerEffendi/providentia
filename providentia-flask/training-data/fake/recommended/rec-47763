All right, I love this place!!!! I've been there more times than any other place.... It's a college crowd, with all kinds of people. It can get very busy in some nights, and some others not that much.... They have pizzas that usually save the late night... LOL Great songs ( Whoever is the DJ, We love you!) and it is just so much fun! Great Drinks, good looking bartenders, hot bouncers... not bad! The only thing is that sometimes you can have problems with the amount of drunk people being super annoying. Once someone threw a glassbottle on my group and some of my pals got cut. There was blood everywhere, it was not that fun. But once we told the security they were really atentive and helpful. Big chance you will witness some drunk deplorable situation, the place gets wild! Â But big chance you will have a great time as well!
