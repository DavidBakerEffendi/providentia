The Decor here is absolutely beautiful. I was a picky eater growing up. So this was my first time having Thai food. I picked a safe dish for me to eat. Sadly I never had curry or any of that type of food. Needless to say it was good. I chickened out on touching the spicy sauce. My best friend has been here before and loves it. She had a huge bowl of soup! Which she enjoyed. This little hole in the wall spot is pretty amazing. I look forward to trying more of their food again and take the spicy challenge!
