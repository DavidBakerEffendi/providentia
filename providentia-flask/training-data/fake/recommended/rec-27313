I've been a few times and while it's good and cheap, I feel the value is why people say it's great. Do you know those friends from home that love 7/11 and swear by their hotdogs. While worlds better than 7/11, the same principle applies. I'm not here to trash this place though. The food is good for the price and it's tasty. I would call this a stop for when walking while a bit hungry and not a place to seek out. There are much better places in Chinatown if you are Yelping for a destination. Also, watch out if you're taking the dumplings to a bar or elsewhere. They have a pretty funky odor if you're not eating them and will draw attention from over 15 feet away (personal experience).
