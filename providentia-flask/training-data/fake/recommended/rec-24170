Fresh ordered sushi sitting on the counter for 15 minutes before it gets to the table makes it NOT so fresh. The server barely checked on my table as we're low on dopamine, our glasses are less than half filled, and our impatience level rose. We stared in torture at the sushi we ordered just sitting so deliciously on the counter. You would think that such a small restaurant such as this would be easy to maintain, but apparently it wasn't for these servers and they weren't even packed. Ha! Before our drool almost hit the table, we finally got our sushi...*hallelujah* **drumroll** The sushi rolls were nothing spectacular. *womp*womp* If you ask me, they were bland. It tasted like spaghetti with no sauce. Incomplete. I had to soak it in soy sauce & wasabi to taste anything at all. Let's just say I wouldn't come back here again. It's pricey and not worth it.
