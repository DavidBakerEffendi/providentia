I ordered delivery from Beyond Sushi and an hour later I got a call that he was here, but he was not. 15 minutes later I called the restaurant who told me the delivery guy had given my food to "someone who worked at the building." Needless to say, I will not be ordering from here again and I advise you not to either, or they will give your food away. :(
