Went here with my boyfriend who swears by this place. I, on the other hand, didn't really find it all that amazing. Sure the chicken and rice seemed a bit more flavorful and well-cooked than other food carts I've been to, but with all the hype surrounding this food cart, my expectations were much much higher. I'd recommend people still give this cart a try since it is a tourist/foodie attraction now and for $6, you can't really regret the experience. I just think the food doesn't quite live up to the level of hype. If you do visit this food cart for the first time in your life, just bear in mind that this is still food cart food. It won't be as fresh or well-prepared as something you'd find in a nice restaurant. No snobbery intended. Just a fact of the matter. No matter how much hype, it's still street food. Food: 2/5 -- ok; not great but not bad either Service: 3/5 -- efficient and organized; it's a food-cart... not much else to say Atmosphere: 2/5 -- a bit cleaner and larger than other food carts but still just your average food cart kind of environment Overall: 2/5 -- decent
