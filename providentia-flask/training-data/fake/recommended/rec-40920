It was my first time coming here a week or two ago. I came inside I ordered a sausage pizza. I go to sit down on the little bar strip they have and there is leftover food sitting there. the waitress finally cleaned it up after she got off her phone. The pizza was so oily I had to wipe it off. Overall I was not impressed by this place.
