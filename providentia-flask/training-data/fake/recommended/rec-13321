My friend told me about this place, but he couldn't remember the name, only that "they give you huge slices of whatever bread you want to sample, and they have butter and honey there for you, and the bread is really, really good, and the place isn't exactly downtown".  After some yelp research, I was excited to have found it, and it lived up to the hype and then some.  I tried a free sample of the challah and it was spectacular.  The other choices that day looked amazing too---a cinnamon swirl bread, something with blueberries, plus the regulars (white, wheat, etc.), scones, and cookies (there were big cookie samples too! Oatmeal chocolate chip the day I went). The bread is a bit on the expensive side ($6 for a loaf of challah) but I would definitely pay that for the quality of it.
