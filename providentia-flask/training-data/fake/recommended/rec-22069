Hooray for awesome places to eat in the neighborhood! My boyfriend and I popped in here after wandering around looking for delicious food, and wow were we successful! Not empty, but pleasantly uncrowded Â - though I can't see it staying that way for much longer once this gem is discovered by the neighborhood masses. Service was a delight, our server was genuine and friendly. The meal itself impeccable, the creamy polenta blew my mind! We'll be back very soon!
