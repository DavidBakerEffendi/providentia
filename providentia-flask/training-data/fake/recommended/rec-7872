Took my girlfriend to brunch on Saturday. We ordered chocolate french toast and tuscan chicken sandwich. She loved her french toast and my sandwich was pretty good. I wish they had more items on their menu, specifically a few more non-breakfasty choices to choose from. Service was good, food arrived within 15 minutes, and price was very reasonable.
