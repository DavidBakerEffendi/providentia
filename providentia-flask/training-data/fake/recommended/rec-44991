Restaurant week goers know that 9 times out of 10 you get shafted. It is always with some trepidation that you turn to the last page of the menu praying that you will see an option other than grilled chicken. Yet for some reason, we continue to try it out with the hope that one dinner will be worth the $35 deal. As it turns out, ilili (did I spell that right?) is the holy grail of restoweek dinners. SO MUCH FOOD. So much GOOD FOOD. Tapas. Between three of us we got baba ganoush, hummus, spicy shrimp, lamb sausage, sweet cheese, and salad. We could have gone straight to dessert from there... Dinner was braised meat, chicken with aioli, and risotto. Dessert: some sort of halvah candy bar, mini doughnuts, and clotted cream in rose water. It was just great. So much variety. The space was enormous by new york standards and would be an excellent option for larger parties. Yum. Its 9 AM and I'm already jonesin' for some shish kebabs.
