This perhaps is one of the best breakfast place in east village.  Too bad it's so crowded and line is so long.  If it wasn't for that, I would have given this place a 5-star rating.   Their food is amazing.  And damn, hottest girls in east village all go there to eat.  Yum yum.  Just kidding. Service kinda sucks but when it's that busy, you can't expect to have the greatest service.   Anyway, this place and Table 12 are the favorite breakfast places I frequently visit.  And so should you.  JK :D
