So what happens when you're at an awesome indoor/outdoor bar like Frankford Hall and it starts to pour? You make new friends as they shove up against you to get out of the rain! Nonetheless, this place is really cool and I can't say much else that hasn't been covered in other people's reviews. My only tip...don't go when its about to rain!
