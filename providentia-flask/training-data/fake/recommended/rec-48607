For starters, I'm not the biggest fan of SPICY spicy food, the kind that make you grow nonexistent balls and sweat them. In fact, and I'm kind of ashamed to admit, I don't eat kimchi very well because it's too spicy. I'm Korean, so I get a lot of crap for it. Anyway, so I was a little apprehensive when my friend and her boyfriend hosted a luncheon at this place known for their spicy food. The 8 of us sat at a round table with one of those round spinning trays for foods in the middle. The Han Dynasty guru of the group ordered a bunch of stuff, ranging in hotness from 2-10, I think. Since we had a lot of people, we got to taste a variety of foods: peanutty noodles, shrimps, beef, spicy cucumber, fish, etc. As we carefully tried each one, there were a lot of "mmmm"s. Not too many "oh F*@# THAT's SPICY!!!". In fact, their food was surprisingly not that hot. The Han Dynasty guru made us guess the spiciness level of the fish on the scale of 1-10, and my friend and I guessed 3. Well, it turned out to be a 10. Most items were very delicious and full of flavors and texture. I think it was a fantastic way to try out the different items, and it only came out to $15/person including tip. The waiter/owner chased us out to the streets because of the tip situation. We definitely paid tip, so not sure what happened.... but the service was definitely very brute and not all that pleasant. And we were with a regular/owner's friend too! So I can only imagine how the more sensitive people feel about the service... Overall, it's a good place to go with a group of friends if you're new, go if you're craving some good, pretty spicy Asian food without frills.
