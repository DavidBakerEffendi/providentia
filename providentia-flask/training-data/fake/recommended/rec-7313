I really loved this place. The drinks were strong, and the food was amazing, a real calorie fest and sooo yummy.  Our bartenders were super cool and super fun. Irish Truffle Fries - we were almost fighting for them.  They're super good with their ketchup which I hear has truffle oil or something. Cheese tots - not on the menu but ask for them, super good. We had, and all split: Truffle Burger Truffle Special The Original Hatch burger Out of all, the Truffle Special with the egg, and time butter, was really the best.  I think the Truffle burger on its own is pretty good, but the egg just puts it over the top.
