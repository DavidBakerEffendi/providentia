The classic baseball meal has never been my favorite. Nor is a hot dog something you'd see on my grill at summer cookouts. Still, Hot Diggity has earned my adoration and praise as the best new restaurant to open on South Street in years. This new spot on 6th is, sadly, surrounded by many boarded up storefronts, as is the norm in our neighborhood now. But the shop's green walls, urban lighting and long rustic hightops are inviting enough -- even before you see the food. I sampled the Big Kahuna on one of the hottest days of our recent heatwave. The Sabrett's beef dog, topped with spicy pineapple salsa and habanero aioli, was surprisingly refreshing for such a sweltering day. Juicy pineapple mixed well with savory beef and the creamy/hot aioli, though the grilled red onions and and sweet guava mustard were barely discernible through all the different tastes. My only complaint: the juicy salsa left my Liscio's mini roll soggy on the bottom and the meal difficult to eat without making a huge mess. That's not to say I wouldn't order it a dozen more times, though. Mmm. A Surf N' Turf special was billed as a Philly classic (I most appreciate their Philly dog for its lack of anything pretzel or cheesteak-related), inspired by the Levis version, wrapped in Bacalao fried fish and topped with vinegar-y pepper hash and spicy brown mustard. Not something I'd normally order, but a pleasant and delicious surprise (my boyfriend had this, and I enjoyed it more than my own order). Service is quick and friendly. This former falafel joint is clean and open, with plenty of seats for an eat-in meal. An illustrated menu (by Philly guy Hawk Krall) will lead you through the 10 heavy-loaded creations, laden with flavored aioli, savory toppings, relishes, cheese, sauce, fruit salsa and more. I eschew the use of the word "gourmet" when unwarranted, but it's appropriate here. The dogs are creative, filling and worth coming back for again and again.
