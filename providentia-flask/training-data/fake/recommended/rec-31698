I've been to Mambo several times and have never had a bad experience.  I've tried just about everything, including the mofungo,  churasco con chimichurri, arroz con pollo, tyler steak, pollo maya, empanadas, etc and haven't tasted anything I didn't like.  The mofungo can be a little salty and garlicy, but I still like it.  It's always nice to bring a few bottles of wine and have them make sangria; it's delicious!  The teas are also good; very flavorful.  My absolute favorite part would be dessert.  The tres leches cake is one of the yummiest things I've ever eaten; I've never tried anything else and am not sure I ever will.  I've also never had a bad experience with the servers.  On my last visit, Phillipe was our waiter and he was great!  I was with three other people and we were in the table all the way up front in the little area by the windows. On the plus side, it was much quieter there than it is in the rest of the restaurant.  Unfortunately, it was also much hotter.  That's the only check in the negative column for me when it comes to this place.  Certainly not enough to keep me from coming back.
