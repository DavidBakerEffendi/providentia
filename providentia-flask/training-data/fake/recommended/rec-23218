This place was WONDERFUL!!!!! Nice spanish guy owns it. You would never know that from the food. This is true Italian!!!!!! The pizza pies are awesome an so many to choose from. What ever you like they have it in pizza. Lots of other choices and subs and salads and full Italian dinners. There is a formal dining room and a lunch dining room. I had the meatball parm sub and was gastronomically delighted!!!! Can't go wrong here and I will be back !!!!
