Cheesesteaks are to die for!  I've never been to the "famous" cheesesteak places in Philly (e.g. Pat's, Geno's etc...) but I know many people who have said that Dalessandros blows them out of the sky.  After eating a Dalessandro cheesesteak, I would find it hard to believe that there is anything better.  I recently stopped eating red meat and the chicken cheesesteak is almost as good as the regular cheesesteak.  It's primarily a takeout place and at times, the line can go out the door.  It's definitely worth the wait.  The service is also very good and the workers are friendly.  The one drawback is that they pretty much focus on cheesesteaks so you can't even order a side of fries.
