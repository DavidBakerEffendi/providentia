My wife and I picked up pizza from Reservoir Restaurant recently. After all of the excellent reviews of the pizza I must say that I was disappointed.  That is not to say the pizza is bad at all.  It just fails to meet the high standards and expectations of this part of Jersey.  The crust seems to be a thicker version of what you would find at Star Tavern.  It is not an airy or flavorful crust at all.  That is my chief complaint with Reservoir and Star.  Sauce was good, though not evenly distributed.  Notwithstanding, it is a very good pizza. (note that they run small, no big 16" or 18" pies here)
