Nice gem in BK.  I have to admit, I"m a sucker for brussels sprouts. If you have them on your menu, I'll come in and try your food and obviously get the sprouts.  Sunshine Co had a brussels sprout hash with an egg on top.  I'm not a fan of a sunny side up egg, but they have turned my opinion.  The hash was so delicious!!! I wanted more.  I HIGHLY recommend this spot if you are looking for a nice casual brunch with a small group of people.
