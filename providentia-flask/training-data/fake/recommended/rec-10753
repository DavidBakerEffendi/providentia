My review is only for brunch, which is the only times i have come here. Great spot for groups and a boozy brunch. The food is not great but good. I always get the chicken quesadilla. Unlimited sangria (8 kinds) comes free with any entree. Place is very loud so if you are looking for a quiet or intimate brunch this isn't it. Tip: Reservations usually need to be made a month in advance.
