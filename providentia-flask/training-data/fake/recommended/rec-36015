The escargots were delicious and the service was impeccable! The only reason I am giving it four instead of five stars is that we had a reservation for two at 8:00pm and had to wait until almost 8:30 to be seated. That's a pet peeve of mine! Our waitress was funny, attentive, and knowledgable and she suggested delicious wines that paired perfectly with our delectable dinner. This was one of the best meals I've had in a LONG time and would highly recommend Balthazar to anyone who asks!
