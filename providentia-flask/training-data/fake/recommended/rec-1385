I was lured to Mood Cafe by all of the positive reviews, and it has since become one of my favorite spots in the city to grab lunch, and I always stop there when I go to West Philly. There are so many flavors going on in this chaat, many of them I'm not accustomed to together. Looking at it, you're wondering how it can all come together, but it somehow does, and does extremely well. As other reviewers have mentioned, the owner is really friendly, will happily cater to your tastes, explain what's what, and walk you through the menu. It shows that he is passionate about what he's doing, and enjoys exposing people to new tastes. However, the last time we were there he had mentioned that he would probably be working out of a new restaurant that he opened, so I can't speak for the new guys.
