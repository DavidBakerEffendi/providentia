My fiance and I, both very well acquainted with authentic ramen, were disappointed. When served, the noodles looked undercooked. Upon eating, there was a very obvious starchy taste which lasted throughout the whole meal. The chefs should have at least loosened up the noodles to ensure thorough cooking. Two positive things, each deserving a star: the broth and chashu.
