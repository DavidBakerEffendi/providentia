This is one of my favorite korean restaurants in NY, especially sun du bu jji gae! I used to go to Keun Jib before this one opens, although Keun Jib is good too, this place is better for tofu I feel. You can also choose the level of spicy, and make vegetarian option too. Pretty authentic korean food!
