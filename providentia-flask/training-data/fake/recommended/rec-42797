This was one of several Speakeasy bars we visited on our trip. It was simply fantastic! The drinks were delicious, it wasn't too crowded, so we grabbed a table by the very front in the corner cove and enjoyed our lovely drinks (Bellini, Millionaire, Storm) and conversation. The atmosphere was great and mixologists were wonderful - can't wait to go back!
