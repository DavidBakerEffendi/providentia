Host:  "How many in your party?"   Me: "Just me, and I want to place an order to go..." Host: "Just go to the chef, and place your order." Me. "Great." I placed my order, and the guy making the pizza asked me if I wanted a small.   I figured I will want some breakfast in the morning, so let's get a large....   And thank goodness I did.   There is nothing that can compare to a real brick oven fired pizza!!    You can taste the wood, the smokey flavor, the crispness of the fire is baked right into the dough.   The price is like $30 (i think).  Well worth the size and amount of food I got.   My only precaution would be the neighborhood.   Looked a little rough, and is a block off the high traffic areas.     I AM NOT FROM NEW YORK - so if my first impression is Way wrong, I'm sorry.     Now there wasn't homeless people, and gun totten gang members walking around - that's not what I mean.   It was just poorly lit, and not heavily populated... just my observation. Won't stop me from going back each time i'm in NY though.
