I've passed Room Service probably over 100 times on the way to and from my HK apartment.  Every time that I've passed, there have been people spilling out of the doorway waiting for tables.  I never stopped to check out the menu because the swanky vibe led me to believe that there were swanky price tags to match. However, overwhelming hunger and laziness to walk further than a block led to my first Room Service experience this past Saturday. Two word overview: BLOWN AWAY.  Keep in mind, my five star review is based purely on ambiance and food.  The service, especially during rush hour on a weekend, is extremely sub par. For starters, the decor is amazing.  A huge chandelier hangs in a glass case in the middle of the restaurant and is accented by crystal pieces that dangle above the bar.  Add in some dim lighting and clubby tunes- BOOM.  Not knowing what to expect as far as pricing, my jaw dropped when I opened the menu.  For $8.90, you can choose from a variety of fried rice, noodle or sauteed dishes with your choice of chicken or veggies ($1 extra for beef). The best part- the portions are BIG and the food itself is AWESOME.  Where else in the city can you get a bougie vibe without sacrificing good taste and/or a full paycheck? GUYS- this is the perfect place to bring a date.  She'll definitely dig the atmosphere and you'll love the prices. Room Service has definitely become my new go-to Thai place. Pumped.
