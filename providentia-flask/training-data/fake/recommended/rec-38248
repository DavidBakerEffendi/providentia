I was here approximately 2 years ago and got a parasite from the elk chili. So tonight I go back to face the beast but it's no longer on the menu. So tonight I ordered the veggie nachos. Bangin'. For an entree I had the braised bison tacos. It was like eating beef jerky in a taco. Very dry and no flare. I sat outside which is great this time of year with the exception of the overly curvaceous waitress serving the tables behind me. Every time she walked by I wore some new food or drink on my lap courtesy of her hips. I probably won't be coming back unless it's just for drinks for a while.
