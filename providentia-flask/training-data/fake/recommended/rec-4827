This place is great! Strange set up, way bigger than I expected, and a little kitschy... but the sushi was delish! I went in for an early dinner and got the vegetarian options for sushi, and the peanut avocado was TO DIE FOR! The vegetable gyoza was so incredibly scrumptious! A side of hibachi noodles - ok!! Edemame, good good GOOD! The service was great, everyone was pretty friendly.   The sushi bar had a really neat design to it, and you walk right by to get to the seating area.  They also have a whole side dedicated to hibachi, if you like that sort of thing.   The bathrooms were even nice! I am pleasantly surprised, and SO glad its not far from home and easier to get to and park than some places in the heart of downtown.
