Came with miss Nazee and this was probably my favorite pizza I have found in Philly. I'm quick to judge Philly for having blah pizza, so I was so pleasantly surprised to have the fresh flavors this place had to offer. I got a lamb sausage and pistachio pizza which was super tasty and Nazee's brussell sprout pizza was spot on fantastic. I don't know whose not giving this place 5 stars but they're silly. You can't underestimate a fresh brick oven pizza in a quaint, but adorable environment that's byo and innovative as hell with their pizzas. Our server was a tad on the grumpy side but we came on a rainy Tuesday so I'll let it slide for such great pizza.
