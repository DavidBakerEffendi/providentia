The boo and I ate here last night on a whim.  We sat at the bar and were greeted by a strikingly handsome bartender named Andrew who had fancy purse hooks and presented hummus out of thin air.  The beer list is pretty diverse so we were happy about that - I had some Red Ale that I LOVED.  Onto food.. Meh.  I like the entire concept of organic, local, fresh, etc.  I like it a lot - I like feeling good about what I ate and knowing that it was healthy.  But I also like to eat and be full.  We got the bar snacks thinking we were getting a deal on an otherwise pricey regular menu option.  Not so.  For $9 we got tiny bison sliders that were on top of a slice of bread the size of a wheat thin....for another $9 we got two mini fish tacos where the fish was more like a fish stick, and we had no idea what kind of fish it was.  And we got fries for $4...they were good but it was like 6 french fries!  So, obvi we were still hungry and to avoid being gluttons we split an entree and a "salad".   I say "salad" because I got the roasted kale with bacon dressing and a fried egg.  For $8 I got a bowl of roasted kale with a fried egg on top.  It was bland (I know they don't season because they want the food to stand on its own) but with salt it tasted just like the kale chips I cook in my own oven for $2...oh I mean $2 for 2-3 servings the same size as what I got.  The egg was different, it made me think oh next time I make kale chips I'll put an egg on top.  But this was nothing special.  The boo ordered the flank steak with chimichurri and we subbed brussel sprouts for green beans.  That was a very good meal - the chimichurri was fresh, the steak was a good size, and the brussel sprouts were served with caramelized shallots or red onions. If you're gonna go here, expect to drop some bones and wind up eating again later into the night.  The concept is cool, some of the food is very tasty, but you just need to order smarter than we did.
