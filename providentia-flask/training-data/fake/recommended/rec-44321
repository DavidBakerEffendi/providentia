I never write any reviews but I am for this one ...Went to this place with my wife on a recommendation tried one of there famous fresh brewed beers which was very good but then didnt expect on how Amazing there food was for Bar food I though I was eating at a High end restaurant the Pig Knuckle was Amazingly soft tender and full of flavor as so was the fall off the Bone tender Smoked Ribs. If you love soup my wife is in love with there French Onion soup....I cant wait to go back and try the rest of there food....Atmosphere had a very nice unique setting ...Its a definite must try place...
