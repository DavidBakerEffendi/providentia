I loved this place. I went here for a first date. Although the place was buzzing with activity, it was still quiet and could have a conversation without screaming at each other. The decor was pretty cool. Where we were sitting, there were these old school coal irons :) The wine list was long. The menu is also brimming with various options. Service was also awesome and the waitress didn't balk at repeating the list again for us. Another important thing was that although the place was full with people waiting, they didn't rush us into leaving. I always like that. I ordered the Penne Gratinade - Must eat. Very happy!
