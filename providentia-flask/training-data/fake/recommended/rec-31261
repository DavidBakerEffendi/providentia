This place is just all around goodness! Finally stopped in for lunch and just because their lunch special is $8 doesn't mean that it's any less delicious (much better deal than what you get across the street at yum yum). Loved their Tom Yum soup (super flavorful) and steamed dumplings. The Singapore Laksa and Pho Bo do not disappoint either. Will have to try the Vietnamese pork chops next time I'm there. Good thing it's not closer to my office or else I'd be there everyday!
