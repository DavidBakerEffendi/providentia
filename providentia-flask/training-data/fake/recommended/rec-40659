Mixed feelings about our 3rd time at Audrey Claire. We stayed away for a while due to subpar food, but gave it another shot on our anniversary.  My wife is a vegetarian, I am the opposite. She enjoyed the arugula salad and pea risotto, nothing special with either, pea risotto needed seasoning.  I had the short rib flat bread first, it was great, great flavors, very nice portion size. Then the pork chop happened, stay away at all costs...very bland, very dry, not good at all. I would guess the reason for this is it sat out as we took our time with our first course, which to me, is inexcusable. They were not slammed, there was no rush to turn the tables, very disappointing. General feeling to me is that the wait staff cares a lot more about the customers than the kitchen. I would have gone 3.5 stars if I could have because of the staff. Excellent excellent service start to finish, the host was friendly and personable, and our waitress Christina was outstanding. Funny, personable, made you feel special, just great all around. She offered me a replacement course, but I passed (the comped the pork chop), the short rib was enough. Right off the bat Christina told us,we had no option but to order all of our food at once, we usually like to put in appetizers, take our time, enjoy our wine, and then put in entrees, but their policy is all at once. Christina realized we wanted to take our time though, and let us sit and enjoy the bread and some wine before we put in the order. And also let us sit and enjoy the rest of our wine after we paid our check. It is loud inside, but it adds to the vibe, despite a second time being disappointed with the food, we would definitely go back if we could sit in Christina's section again. Disappointing food, but great time overall. Also, the price range is tough with this...the average would be around 35 per person probably, but that falls into 31-60...
