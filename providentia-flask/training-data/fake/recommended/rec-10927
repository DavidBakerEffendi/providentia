Haters gon hate. 1 point for awesome pina coladas (reasonably priced, giant size = $11) and buckets of beer, 1 point for the view, 1 point for trying.  We went around 4 on a Saturday afternoon and immediately got seats at the bar.  There was already a two hour wait for table service so we decided to forgo that.   The bartender was super nice and attentive and we were able to order food from her which came within about 20 minutes.  Not too shabby.   -2 points for the bar being cash only (at least it was that day) and the ATM downstairs not working.  Other than that the only problem I had with the place was the douche standing behind me and my friend complaining loudly about everything! If you hate it, leave! My god man. Get a grip!
