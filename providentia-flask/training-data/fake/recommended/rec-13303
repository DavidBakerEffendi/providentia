Great breakfast!  We got there at 10:00 and waited an hour and forty-five minutes for a table.  But not to worry, there's several coffee and tea spots just up the block. By the time we were seated at 11:45, the wait was 2 1/2 hours.  The hostess tried to seat us at tiny counter in front of the door...couldn't even move my arms.  They told us it would be another 10 minutes if we waited for a table...having already invested half the morning...we waited.  30 seconds later a table magically became available.  We ordered the blueberry pancakes about the Southern breakfast and shared.  The pancakes...pretty dam good.  Just don't pour then syrup on top since it will just soak right in.  The Southern breakfast was good and we ordered a biscuit on then side.  The biscuit was great, but would have been better if it was served at least warm.  Oh but the cheese....YUM! Great wait staff!
