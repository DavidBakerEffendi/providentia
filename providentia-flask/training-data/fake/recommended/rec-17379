We used to live close to this place and I miss it.  A lot.  The dried sautéed string beans are one of my favorite food items of all time.  Twice cooked pork was amazing. I don't remember having a dish that we disliked. We really couldn't go wrong with this menu.  Make sure if you go in you get the Chinese menu, not the American Chinese menu - we tried some of the more usual items (general tso's, etc.), and it was no better there than anywhere else.  But you can get more authentic Chinese food here, and it's divine.
