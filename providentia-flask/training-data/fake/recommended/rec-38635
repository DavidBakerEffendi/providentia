OK, let me start by saying, I LOVE THIS PLACE. The food is always great, the service is wonderful, the variety and selection are fantastic. This has to be my favorite bar in all of Philadelphia. I am never disappointed whether I'm eating a cheeseburger or some empanadas... and for dessert some tiramisu or creme brulee. The great thing is, this place is not pretentious. The prices are fair and they have quality everything. It's also a great place to enjoy numerous bands. If I could give it 10 stars I would :)
