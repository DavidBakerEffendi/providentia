This is an excellent restaurant and a fun little trek out for an adventurous, even romantic dinner. I didn't do much 'trekking' when I lived around the corner, but was thrilled to have Saraghina around in an otherwise residential area. In short, the food is good, ambiance is extraordinary, and the service is average. I've stuck to the classics on their menu. The margherita pizza, market salad, and have dabbled with the calamari and desserts. I once ordered the orecchiette bolognese. It was flawless, but I'm just a bigger fan of the pizza: the margherita pizza sauce was subtle and sweet with a perfect thin crust that was charred at the bottom. Sobering Note: a carafe of wine between two people will turn your evening sloppy since it is an entire liter (vs a standard 750 ml bottle of wine)
