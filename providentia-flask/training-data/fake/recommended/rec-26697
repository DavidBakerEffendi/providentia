Can't understand the bad reviews of this place.   It is what it presents itself as; simple, organic, non traditional.  They don't gouge you with unreasonable prices and the portions are fare...see what i did there. My experience with the staff was that they are very attentive.  The owner was making the rounds (even though he neglected to stop by our table, but that's OK- this time).The place is super cute and it's nice to have a grown up restaur/bar on fairmount. It's definitely worth a few tries.
