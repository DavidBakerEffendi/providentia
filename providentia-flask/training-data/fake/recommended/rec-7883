The white dog cafe is a quaint little cafe that offers a delicious menu and cozy atmosphere. They no longer have bottomless drink options but they did lower the price to make up for it. The prices may be a little steep for a breakfast stop but it's well worth it. Everyone in my group enjoyed their meals. Our waitress was adorable and nice. The decor is very cute and interesting. It's definitely worth checking out!
