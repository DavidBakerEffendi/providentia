Found this place via Yelp, and decided to try it out. We're glad we did! A cute little restaurant that wasn't busy at all on a weekday evening. Service was great, and the food came quickly. I ordered the pollock, because I wanted something more authentic. It was absolutely deliciously cooked, crispy on the outside, and sitting on a bed of amazingly spiced mashed potatoes. For the price, we were very happy. Would definitely visit again if I'm in the area.
