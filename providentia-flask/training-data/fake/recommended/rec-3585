Here's 2 things to frame where I'm coming from: 1. I grew up in rural, southeastern North Carolina. 2. I more or less stopped eating meat 6 years ago, but will eat certain types from time to time. Alright, so the first time I went to Pies N Thighs was about 2 years ago. I was in pursuit of finding a NC style pulled pork sandwich, one of the few types of meat that I will occasionally eat. Pies N Thighs had the best reviews of any place I found at that time. Now that I've eaten their bbq few times, I must say that while the pork is decent enough (we are in the North after all) and it satisfies my craving, the bottom bun is always SO SOGGY, which I have yet to understand. Is the pork soaking in a vat of vinegar or water beforehand?? Weird. But let's proceed to the biscuits and the hush puppies. Again, these hit the spot in terms of satisfying my childhood cravings. The best part though is that they have honey on the table. Mmmmm, honey on biscuits. Along with my bbq and biscuits, I also always order the hush puppies. These babies are hard to find north of the Mason Dixon line, and while these fried cornmeal balls are sometimes a little too salty for my taste, I can't not order them. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the tartar sauce on top of them. Oh, and speaking of fried food, the donuts are pretty bangin' as well. On the flip side, I have noticed the portions here have gotten smaller over the past two years, which is both good and bad. Perhaps more bad than good since southern portions are always huge. I have also noticed the crowd here has gotten even more trendy and hipster-y. And can we talk about how fast South Williamsburg is gentrifying?! It's terrifying. But I digress. Overall, Pies N Thighs never fails to satisfy my southern comfort food needs, though it may not be the most authentic or the most delicious.
