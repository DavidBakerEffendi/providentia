I bring out of towners to Coppelia every chance I get. I even dragged along my family for brunch on Christmas eve and they made room for all 15 of us. My favorite dinner order is an avocado milkshake (fantastic!) and the Cuban sandwich. The cocktails are also fabulous, particularly the spicy Michelada and the mojitos. For non-pork folks, the veggie burger, salads and beef empanadas are also excellent.
