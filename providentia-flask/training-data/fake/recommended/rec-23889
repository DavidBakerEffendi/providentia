I have only had breakfast here, and even then, only three times over at least five years. Thus over the long run the place is immaculate, service is a good (recognized servers from years ago so it's consistent in staffing to some extent), and prices were great. My last meal there was modest as I am dieting: Three fried eggs, grilled tomato slices, and multigrain toast.  Best such breakfast in town.  And LaColombe coffee was made so well it tasted just like I was at LaColombe. I love Port Richmond and I love Mercer Cafe. Give it a try.
