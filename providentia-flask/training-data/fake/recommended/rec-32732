Love this place!!! Although they don't have the most extensive menu they have a great selection of pasta and it's just made rely well. The tomato bisque is delicious and I haven't tried all the pastas yet but I have been there at least 5 times and have enjoyed each dish I've gotten. Quick service and good prices. Would recommend for lunch most definitely!!
