I've been hearing about peaches for the entire year I've lived in the neighborhood and just now made it over there. Had I known how good it is, I would have been there first thing. I'm from the south, so good southern food is important to me. And HOLY MOLY is the food delicious. Grits grits and more grits. I had a hard time choosing which to get- but I was not disappointed with the broccoli grits. Only $13 and it filled me! I did have a slice of the cornbread as well, which came out piping hot and fresh. The perfect sweet and salty ratio. I was wishing I had more. I also shared some Mac and cheese with my friend and that too was rich and creamy delicious. Lastly- try one of their cocktails! I'm not a big drinker so one cocktail had me a bit tipsy and it was so so good. (The Rosie P) I can't recommend this place highly enough and I can't wait to go back. I went on a Friday night so the service wasn't super fast but they were busy so I wasn't even bothered! Yummmm.
