When i got there, they had our reserved table already set up for us. the place was empty too so we probably didnt really need to make reservations. the bartender and waiters were nice, but let me warn you... all of their dishes are so small! even their entrees! their entrees are the same size as their tapas but almost double the price. my friends and i order a bunch of dishes to share and i ordered the pork belly as my main, it was pretty good not bad nothing to rave about though. the dish only had 3 thinly sliced pieces with sauce. i was not full by the end of the meal. we order desserts too i would like to add. overall the place was ok, i wouldn't come back again.
