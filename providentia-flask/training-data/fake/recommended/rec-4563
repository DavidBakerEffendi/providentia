We are happy hour regulars at Dish. I'm a fan of the Dish burger. They occasionally have issues getting medium rare correct but it is a good burger. I recommend their happy hour. I find the service to be good (though some of my friends disagree on this). Stylistically it has a nice clean and modern feel which I like.
