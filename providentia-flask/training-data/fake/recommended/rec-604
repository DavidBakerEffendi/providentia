This sweet little place has amazing paninis! My goal is to try every single one, but so far, my favorites have been the chicken cutlet (the spicy mayo is that good) and the mortadella. The tomato soup is great too. I also really like the atmosphere of the place-- feels authentic. Lovely find in Astoria!
