Best Banh Mi I've had in the NYC area, by far! My mom is Vietnamese and banh mi was always her favorite thing to feed us on the weekends that she didn't feel like cooking. Even though my family's favorite Vietnamese delis are clear across the US, this place manages to hit the spot when I'm homesick.... They've got perfectly crunchy, fresh, french bread and balance the ingredients well, without adding too much or too little of anything. The #1 is definitely the way to go... and I love that their smoothies are the same flavors I grew up with. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in the area. :)
