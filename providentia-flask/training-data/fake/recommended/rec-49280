The staff was very friendly and helpful. The food was quickly served and bountiful in quantity. Although there was nothing that we ordered (souvlaki, gyro, pizza, and stuffed shells) that was extraordinary, everything was very good. That said, the pita is delicious! Warm, soft, buttery. Also, the tzatziki sauce was undeniably yummy. It was a very pleasant dining experience, and we will certainly return the next time we are in Newington.
