Over priced, food sounds interesting but not impressive at all. The rabbit dish had fat strings that were stuck in my tooth and had to be pulled out by hands (not pleasant during a meal!). House rolls were basically per-made rolls that were warmed up in the oven, nothing special. The house cured ham was not bad, but wouldn't come here again.
