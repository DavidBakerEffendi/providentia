My husband and I finally had a chance to celebrate our anniversary (without the kiddies....yeah!) and we decided to dine at Cafe Matisse. One word.... Perfection. We had a table in the outside garden and I swear we were transported to another world. The ambiance, food and service were outstanding. I loved everything we ordered....especially the duck. This was a surprising find for us and I highly recommend it to those who enjoy the art of food. We are planning to bring our friends next time....can't wait.
