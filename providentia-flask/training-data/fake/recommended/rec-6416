Found out about this place via YELP.  I love Greek food.  Was turned on to it about the same time this year last year.  The quest for the best grape leafin the city continues!  Came here for my birthday dinner. Kefi was outstanding.  To start we ordered the meatballs and the fried calamari.  Both were excellent. I really enjoyed the meatballs and the leftover sauce for dipping.  Calamari was pretty standard, but tasted great. I had the roasted chicken as my entree.  It was AMAZING.  Cooked perfectly.  Succulent, crispy, moist, bomb.  Served with small potatoes that were equally as good.  Others around me had ravioli.  I didn't know ravioli could be made into a Greek dish, but was very happy I tried it.   A birthday walnut cake with some walnut ice cream was brought out which were compliments of the house.  A nice gesture. The food at Kefi was as you probably gathered, delicious.  I will definitely come here again but I'd like to try another place first.   Kefi is a giant restaurant with millions and millions of tables. It has a downstairs floor that is nearly as big as the top floor.  We were jammed in a corner near a loud air conditioning unit with nearly no light.  I'm pretty sure we got that table because we were 10 minutes late for our reservation? Not sure.  We called ahead though.  Atmosphere is a big thing for me and I was so so on it for Kefi due to its size.   Kefi was a great choice for my birthday.   I would have given five stars if they served grape leaves and if the restaurant didn't look like Ellis Island  registration/booking hall circa 1880's.  (not a joke on immigration, but a slight on Kefi's PACKED vibe)
