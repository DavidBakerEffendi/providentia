Once again, Yelp lures me unsuspectingly into a new restaurant with inflated rave reviews, and I'm left wholly unimpressed. Yes, the food was edible. Yes, the food was warm. Other than that, I don't think I could have asked for a more unremarkable meal. I ordered the Pad See Yu, which represented an incredibly bland offering. Its honestly so hard for me to describe because it simply didnt taste like anything worth remembering. Don't let the 4 star rating fool you, this is a sub-par lunch spot at best. It being surrounded by other Thai restaurants of similar fares makes this an easy place to miss.
