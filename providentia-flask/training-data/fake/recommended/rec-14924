I loved the beer selection here. The food options and the menu was very well thought of and the preparation was quite unique. I ordered the popcorn (of course) and pulled pork. My friend ordered the Brisket.  The first thing I loved was the portions, we had enough to last for lunch the next day.  The atmosphere is a very good blend between a dive bar and a hole-in-the-wall Southern Restaurant with the perfect ambiance for groups no larger than 7-8 people. I would highly recommend this spot to college alumni and businessmen looking for a happy hour spot.
