Was at the Queen Museum of Art, and wanted to try something other than Chinese food in Flushing.  And I'm glad I branched out! This place is small, simple, and very, very focused on empanadas.  They have three overall types:  flour, corn, and whole grain, with various options of fillings for each.   tried one beef, one pork, and one spinach & ricotta.  And it is fair to say they are the best empanadas I've ever had.  I'm inclined toward the flour, and the light, flaky outside was pretty pitch perfect. Okay, not the most convenient for many, but it's not such a bad idea to step out of your comfort zone every once in a while. VoracoMeter=8
