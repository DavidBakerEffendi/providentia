I always love this place but lately find out when you go for the lunch time, "Soba" is extremely fresh and even better than many soba place in Japan. I took my mother a few days ago and she was surprised how this restaurant offer you a great Soba, just like a quality soba place in Japan. Â I like their choice of menu, my favourite is cold soba such as "Mori"with Uni side and "Butano kakuni" ( Pork belly ). The food is very fresh and staffs are always welcoming.
