Great tapas.  We lived around the corner when it first opened the door, so we were there a lot in its early days and got to know the co-owners and the waitresses.  Sometimes we would get complimentary dishes (authentic Spanish dishes but experimental for Americans).  I'm glad to see that it is doing quite well.  Definitely one of my top choices for tapas in the city.
