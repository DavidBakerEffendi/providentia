Awesome Chicken curry cutlet great shoyu ramen there's always a lot of people here it's that good there's just this rude waitress who likes to boss around you on what to eat first in a bossy manner I almost forgot I was the customer food is awesome though I hope they re train this particular waitress knowing she's the oldest looking in the lot of them.
