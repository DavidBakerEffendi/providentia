Delicious 99 cent Blue Point Oysters on the half shell during happy hour.  Comes with the usual lemon and tomato based sauce with an added bonus: a cilantro vinegrette that is absolutely delicious.  The disappointing part of the meal was the clam chowder.  For $10, I expected a decent amount of clams that were no where to be found.  Also, the server did not offer pepper with the soup -- this to me is an unacceptably low level of service. All in all - 3 stars.  Go for the  happy hour oysters. Period.
