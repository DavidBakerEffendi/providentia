The food was decent. Being from California this food doesn't come close to delicious authentic Chinese. It may be authentic but it lacked deliciousness. Now onto the service: First we arrived and were given sushi menus only to have waiter come 10 min later to take our order and tell us "the sushi master is not here."(strike one) next we put our order in and waited 20 min only to have my kids food come.( at least they brought his first cuz he's only 2) 15 mins later they bring my gf's food, at this point my kid is done eating. (Strike 2) i ordered an entree and a side of fried rice. They brought my side of rice with my gf's food and while waiting for my dish i found that I had almost finished my rice. So at this point we've been seated 45 min Already and my entree still hadn't come.(strike three) at this point my gf is done eatting i full on rice and my kid has been done. Now I've been trying to cancel my entree but the waiter never came to our table this whole time except to take our order and drop off the two meals. I had to ask another waitress to have our waiter come back. I told him to cancel my entree and he replies oh its almost done at which point i replied were all already done and ready to go. He said "chef berry bizzy" and let me tell you there were people at like 10 out of 20 tables. Service 1/10. In the almost 1 hour we were there we never got one refill for our water. Not 1!!!! My waiter didn't deserve a tip but i left him $3. Â  Recap: Food: 7/10 Service 1/10 40% or F
