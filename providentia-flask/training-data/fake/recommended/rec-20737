Where to begin? Let's start with a legitimate Thai restaurant that resorts to tarted up female staff and mind numbingly bad house music to draw in young professionals. Throw in some chintzy modern plastic furniture and a few crystal chandeliers and you've got Room Service. It's somewhat difficult to fault the restaurant for catering to this class of clientele since it ends up being the only Thai restaurant in Hell's Kitchen that requires a wait for tables. Oh, and no reservations for smaller parties and you've all got to be there to be seated. On the other hand, the atmosphere is just terrible and the staff is unhelpful and entitled, just as you'd find it a real night club. Only you're there to eat (and perhaps drink) while hanging out with friends. Two stars because the food is passable, though tarted up like the staff.
