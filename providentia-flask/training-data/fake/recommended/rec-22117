Island's... How I crave you This place is easy to miss, situated right next to Key Food Supermarket. It's a Small space, but their food is packed with flavor!! I have been a fan of these Sister's since they opened, they never disappoint. Seating: The space is very small. I never come here to sit and eat, but they have seating upstairs (just duck your head getting up there!) and they have one circle table for outdoor seating out front. Drinks: It is BYOB and there is a Liquor store right on the next corner of Lincoln Place for wine, and a store across the street for Beer. they have a Delicious lemonade there that your sure to enjoy on a hot day. Food: I always get their Curry Shrimp and ask them to make it spicy (crack a pepper in the sauce). They make it to order right in front of you! It has an amazing amount of flavor and the portion is great for a small or large. Sometimes my bf and I get their jerk chicken, reasonably priced and the best I have had in Brooklyn. It is very spicy, but still edible. Their Marconi and Cheese is done differently than the average and is a nice addition to the food as well. Staff: they are friendly and welcoming. The two sisters that cook the food always put love into it... my favorite way to eat. They are a staple in this neighborhood and their food and portions remained the same all these years (which is hard to find).
