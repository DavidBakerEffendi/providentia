Delicious food. Prepare for your taste buds to get clobbered with flavor. But between the heavily fried foods and the meats, expect to shave a day or two off your lifespan after eating here. And double up on the blood pressure meds since all dishes are salted by the dump truck full. I loved the miso cauliflower, a wonderful flavor combination that never occurred to me. The crispy brussels sprouts were drenched in a fish sauce vinaigrette and bacon and I ate every salty bite. Two of our party ordered the winter soup and that is one tasty bisque with a few chunks of poached lobster floating in a cauliflower pur√©e. My son ordered the vaunted country fried duck and waffles which didn't do much for me. The roasted porgy filet was a breaded fish that tasted like a fish fry and was forgettable. All in all, the word that comes to mind in describing the food is "garish". They're determined to wow your palate even if it kills you. Plan a good cleansing fast the next day.
