I'm not 1 for writing reviews but my bf & I went here on a whim & were absolutely positively happy we did, so I had to share... The food was amazing - the matador combo, the salmon entree, and the chicken empanadas. The drinks were amazing. I only wish I remember the name. Our server recommended em based on our tastes & he was spot on. Our server, Gavy (sp??), by the way, was also amazing. This was overall a great date night spot - decor, food, ambience, service... We would definitely recommend this place to anyone!
