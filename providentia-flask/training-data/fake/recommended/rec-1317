What an adorable little space!  Came here for brunch one day.  Service was excellent, though perhaps the decor was a bit dark for a brunch gathering -- this place would be lovely and romantic for dinner.  Did I mention they have a bar?  The prices were decent and the cocktail menu was intriguing, but I wasn't there for booze. I ordered the shrimp and grits.  The grits were a bit drier than I hoped they'd be, and there were only three shrimp on the plate.  A good number of tasty chunks of fried pork belly and a spicy cream sauce helped out, but I wasn't blown away.  One of my friends got the Monte Cristo, which was massive.  I was told it was good.  The huevos rancheros looked like a winner too. Probably deserves a three based on food for me, but service was great and it's a charming place, so 4 from me.  Maybe I'll come back for dinner some time.
