The best food princeton has! Its just incredible! Any person who walks into Â Hoagie Haven will come out with their mouth watering, ready to eat their delicious hoagie on the few benches out in front of the "college food shops". You can't just get half a sandwich, because that would only give you half a sandwich, and no one would want that! It is also not recommended that anyone whose watching their cholesterol should walk in (Heartstop is one of their best sandwiches) anybody who is anybody who happens to be in Princeton at lunch needs to stop by and try any of their incredible subs.
