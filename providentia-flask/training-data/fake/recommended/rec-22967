I have very mixed feelings about the Elbow Room.  First, I love the homemade macaroni & cheese and the children's portion at $3.95 is a great deal compared to the typical Kraft Mac & Cheese for which most places charge as much or more.  Burgers here are great.  Reubens are great.  Salads are great.  And I have loved almost every soup I have gotten.  However, on a recent visit last week, my catfish sandwich was surprisingly bland despite being served with a spicy mayo.  The cream of mushroom soup was very tasty, but a bit on the salty side.  (And this coming from someone that uses a ton of salt.) The service was very good, but the place was a dirty, sticky mess.  I was very grossed out by the bathroom and the other 3 adults at the table also noticed the general dirtiness of the place.  Makes you wonder what the kitchen where they prepare your food looks like.  We ate on the roof this particular day, but in meals past downstairs, I have also been a little concerned about the cleanliness.  I'll probably go back here, even if just for the mac & cheese and the goat cheese & beet salad, but I do hope they clean the place before then!
