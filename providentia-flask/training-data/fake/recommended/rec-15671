Absolutely love this place! It's a bit overwhelming at first because their menu is huge and too many good options, but it was also fun to decide which ones to get. We finally made up our minds and got some reallyyy good drinks. We went there Saturday afternoon (as our first date), and they had live music inside. It wasn't too loud or annoying, it was just so perfect. I also liked that it wasn't crowded like many cute cafes around. I have been to many coffee/cafe places, but this is one of the best including nyc coffee shops. They do table service and it was quick and very friendly. We had good time there. Highly recommended!
