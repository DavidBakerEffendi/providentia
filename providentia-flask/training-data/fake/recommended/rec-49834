Went here four times, three times the experience was fantastic but the fourth time was so mediocre that we haven't gone back since... Service is generally quite nice unless you're unlucky and get one of the apathetic waiters who'd rather spend time in the kitchen then come and refill your water glass... As for the food: the pastas are good, the kale salad is amazing, and the Branzino is great. We ordered the eggplant appetizer our last visit here, and after 30 minutes it came out half raw. Told the waitress about it who picked it up off our table without a word, and came back 20mins later with the same dish, slightly less raw but still way undercooked. Don't get the eggplant. Â  Overall, ambience is nice, waitstaff is usually courteous, and if you go on a slow day then you're in luck since they'll pay more attention to you than the larger parties who come.
