An abomination to New Haven Pizza. Mediocre food and disorganized service. Yorkside does have a history here at Yale/New Haven, but coming back from the culinary bastion of New York and eating here was like transitioning from living in a chateau on the swiss alps to dwelling in the sewer/subway junction on the 1 line in uptown Manhattan. I got some cheese bread that was topped with tomato and basil, which really was just plopped on without much thought. There was no amalgamation of flavors as it literally tasted like bread, tomato, cheese, and basil, all mutually exclusive from each other. I also ended up getting a lamb souvlaki, which wasn't too bad, only I found a bone/tendon in it. I think the worst feeling is the next morning after your meal. Not really the healthiest place to eat, so when you wake up in the morning, you definitely don't feel like P Diddy. You feel more like...Ozzy Osbourne after a crazy night of cocaine and wrinkly sex with his wife Sharon.
