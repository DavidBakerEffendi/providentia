Ok I've only gone here once, but I'm starting out with 5 stars because the buffet was all cooked by a chef, and when I got the check I thought they must have left of my Thai iced tea because it was so cheap, but it was on the bill. Not a ton of choices, but everything was really nice, with a lot attention to detail and good spices. The menu has Thai, but not Thai iced coffee, nor tom kha gai. My waiter was very nice, and attentive, I like the feel of the place.
