When every other Williamsburg brunch spot makes you wait for an hour to get a table, somehow the people at Pies 'N' Thighs manage to keep the turnover rate fast and you usually can get a table sunday morning within 10-20 minutes. They need to sell this concept to other eateries.....seriously. They serve the most perfect Southern comfort food. I always get the Rob Evans which is an egg served on a biscuit smothered in sausage and gravy. It is divine. Everyone knows this place is divine though!
