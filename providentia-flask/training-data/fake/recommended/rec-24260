I have been a couple of times now and I really do heart this place. First time was the veggie benedict and the second time was the veggie crepes and wow! Amazing. Loved every bite of it. The veggie benedict was poached egg over sauted spinach, mushroom, pepper on broiche with hollendaise sauce. Loved every but of it. The veggie crepe was the same vegetables wrapped in crepe with a tomato cream sauce over.. Added the rosemary potatoes and loved every bite. I was very happy on both visits and will certainly return for my veggielisious breakfast options!
