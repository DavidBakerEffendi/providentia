I'm a downtownist. I live downtown, I go out downtown and I begrudgingly go to Times Square every morning so I can make money to do the aforementioned things. I will, however, also make an exception for this magical platter of chicken and rice. Sure it's $6 for the food and $10 for the cab ride home but it's totally worth it. Once I was able to get a driver to take me there and back for the promise of getting him a gyro plate. And that's the power of this food cart.
