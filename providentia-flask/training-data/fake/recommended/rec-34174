The bf and I had a rare date night and decided to give this place a try as we were new to the area. The food was ok. We ordered 4 things: The trio of dips, the Hangar Steak, The Dumplings, and the Cheesy fries. The tastiest thing was the trio of dips. The other items were somewhat meh. Not great. The Hangar steak was over- cooked and so were the dumplings (aka potstickers). Don't bother with the cheesy fries. We also both ordered the Basil Smash Cocktail, which is made with Bourbon and basil and sounded delicious, however it was super sweet and not to my taste. Someone who prefers sweeter drinks may love it however. Our service was great and the atmosphere was cute and good for a date spot. However, for the price and the quality of food I would pass and go somewhere else.
