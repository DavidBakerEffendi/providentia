Penelope I was encouraged to visit this midtown brunch staple from a friend of mine.  @Penelope welcomed me with a  25 minute wait at 215p on this Super Bowl Sunday - ouch.  I was seated swiftly though (under wait time) and the host took care of some linger gals who wanted to stand behind me at the bar, whew!   Crowd is midtown yuppies and you've invited them over to your grandmothers kitchen for an intimate brunch.  Great old cabinets and antique coat/ hat hooks I appreciated.  Enjoyed the coffee station while you waited for a table, great touch.   Bloody Mary - served in a white wine glass and made with sake.  Yes sake.  No condiments yet very spicey and tasty.  The one complaint I have about the cocktail - too much horseradish, kept getting caught in the straw. For brunch, went with recommendation of salmon wrapped fresh farm poached eggs with a side of chicken apple sausage.  Good presentation.  Chicken sausage was fairly bland - not a fan.  Mixed green salad served with eggs with these interesting raisins.  The forementioned fruit was not on the menu and for friends who know me, you know this is a major pet peeve of mine - identify the fruit!!   Salmon wrapped eggs very good...nothing super unique about them but well poached. The music playlist seemed to support the struggle the restaurant has -- one minute Fleet wood Mac/ Steve Miller Band (thank you), next two songs dance club mixes.  Fun quirky logo ( and good merchandise line) yet nothing "wow" about this menu. Penelope gets a 6 on the #brunchbelle scale - I'd come back., its a solid meal but nothing to write home about.
