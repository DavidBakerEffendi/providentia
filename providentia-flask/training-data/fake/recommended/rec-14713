review for the "crepes to go" window mmm. the taste of strawberries and nutella lingers on my tastebuds. a delicious combo of bananas, strawberries, and nutella on a huge crepe-how could that go wrong? it was ready in about 3 minutes, and the price tag was $6.75. although the crepe part was a bit chewier than i thought it ought to be, it was still very good and i will definitely be back for more. my crepe expectations were also skyrocketed by a stay in france, so im not sure anything in the US could actually be perfect.
