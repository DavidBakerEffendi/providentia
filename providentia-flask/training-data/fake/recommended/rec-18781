By far, the best cappuccino I have had in Manhattan; smooth, strong, and delicious. $5 seems somewhat excessive but when you compare it to the terrible $3 / $4 options all over the city, it puts things in perspective. The only complaint I have is I wish there were more locations. I've yet to try their coffee but if it's anywhere near the quality of their cappuccinos, it'll be a winner.
