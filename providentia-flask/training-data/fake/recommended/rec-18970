We used to take the subway up to the upper West side just to dine at Kefi even though we live in the East Village and we are a pretty lazy couple when it comes to traveling for our food. We did this because Kefi has never disappointed us. Almost every dish we have had at this restaurant has been exquisitely prepared. The atmosphere is very pleasant: warm and relaxed but also classy, and the waiters are amicable. We always ordered their assortment of hummus which never disappoints. My personal favorite entre was the sheep's milk dumplings, I was addicted to them. They are so soft... almost like doughy marshmallows.
