Offensively overpriced.  I feel like no one is seriously tasting their dishes with a critical palate.  Their combinations of flavors at times were simply foul.  Two good dishes out of the six we ordered.  The other four were horrid.  Almond snacks consisting of less than 12 almonds.  What?  Lentil dish was bland and boring.  The cauliflower dish is an offense to anyone who has every cooked, professional or amateur.  Those flavors do not belong together in that way.  And why is it served cold and covered with oil?  No one could honestly taste that and think that should be served to people for money.  Not anyone with ethics, pride, or good taste.  I don't mind spending over $100 at a small dish place but show pride in your work.  I cook better at home. Avoid this place at all cost.  Super disappointing.
