Place is great!! First ordered in from here and delivery could be a little quicker since they are pretty close to my house but the food is great. Ate in here today for the first time and the server was very sweet. Â Food is delicious. Must try the cornflake crusted French toast w banana and berry compote and egg quesadilla. You will not be disappointed. Portion sizes are pretty decent too. For lunch the burger is huge and the smoked chicken sandwich w avocado is delish!!! Prices aren't too bad and the place is cute and cozy. Add this to your brunch places.
