Been coming here for years and the quality never disappoints! Best fresh pasta around. Excellent "gravy". Marinated mozz is fantastic; as is the frozen asiago tortellini & raviolis.Nice selection of olives. Got some real nice stacked eggplant parm kinda thing at the counter. What's not to love about this place?
