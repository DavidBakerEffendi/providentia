Went here for dinner based off a recommendation from a co-worker, very ideal dating spot.  Sat outside and had a very attentive, no pressure waiter, gave us plenty of time to choose wine and meal and were very speedy with bringing our food and drinks.  One thing I really appreciated is the wait staff did not bring over the check until requested, providing plenty of time to run through conversation without being interrupted. Prices were very reasonable, given the quality of the food.  Ordered the Mahi Mahi and my date ordered the Blackened Sea Bass, both were very fantastic with complimentary sauces and side dishes (the Mahi Mahi came with a nice, slightly sweet orange sauce).  Fish prices where $25.00 each Wine choices are decent, by the glass expect to spend $9-10.   At the end of our meal, we were given complimentary Champaign, which tasted like Veuve, two glasses a piece at that!   Overall, solid place to go for a date, especially if your around Central Park or the Museum of Natural History.  Dress code was casual.
