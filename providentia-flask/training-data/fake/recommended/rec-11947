Probably my favorite restaurant in Park Slope, and the one I've been to most often for special meals. I love the seasonal, local/sustainable menu and the cozy atmosphere. I do feel like you have to order a bit carefully to get the best experience--it's easy to order a meal with too many rich components that will leave you feeling too full, and some of the desserts involve unorthodox ingredient combinations that don't work perfectly. ...This may sound silly, but they have a great, comfortable bathroom, too.
