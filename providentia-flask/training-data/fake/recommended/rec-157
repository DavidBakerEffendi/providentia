Hubby was nice enough to grab takeout and bring it to my workplace so we could have dinner together after he got out of work. He ordered a BBQ chicken pizza and a dozen of the Italian wings. Pizza was ok, not great--I think that the BBQ chicken pizza I make at home is better than this! It would have been nice if the chicken was coated in the BBQ sauce, instead of plain breaded chicken chunks.Wings were good, nice touch with the side of hot sauce and blue cheese. I was glad we had a coupon, otherwise I felt like it was overpriced. I guess we're just spoiled having great New Haven pizza nearby!
