The best breakfast ever. Just bring cash and come prepared to kill an hour and a half while you wait. Sugar cured bacon should be outlawed it is so good. Perfect pancakes. Indescribably delicious waffle and eggs benedict. Just be prepared for no credit cards and the LOOONG wait. We arrived at 11:30 on a Saturday morning. I'm told to come much earlier for less waiting time...
