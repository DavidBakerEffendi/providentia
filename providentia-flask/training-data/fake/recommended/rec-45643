Not what I typically think of when I hear Mexican--but, it's awesome regardless. The drinks are a little over priced but at the bottom of a pitcher of margaritas, you won't care. Fish Tacos were first I've ever had and were amazing and I love their guacamole. Decor is funky and fun...the photo booth is a cool addition. As someone who works in a restaurant, I'm more jealous than annoyed with the servers in jeans....but thats just me, I'll get over it.
