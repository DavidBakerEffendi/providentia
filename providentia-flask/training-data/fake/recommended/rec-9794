Great little date spot (shout out to Heather G. for the recommendation). Food was yummy and much better portioned than most tapas places I've been. Could have used a few slices of crusty bread to mop up some of the deliciousness. Drinks fell somewhat flat as well so I would stick to wine or forgo it all together and have a drink at one of the many bars in the area before heading over.
