My first NYC pizza experience and it did not disappoint.  We waited in line for less than 30 minutes and in addition to amazing pizza the service was also great.  Our waiters were hilarious and old man that I'm guessing is the owner (?) was really friendly and attentive.  It doesn't hurt that we're five girls but still the service was great. We had the traditional pizza and a pepperoni and mushroom pizza.  And we ate every last slice.  The other great thing is  the festive, homey and fun atmosphere in the restaurant.  It really makes the experience that much better.  We finished it off with a couple of cannoli's and they were literally the best cannolis any of us had ever had.  The filling was sweater and not creamier and the shell was light and crisp.  Everything was delicious. The only weird thing was the couple next to us with the crying guy.  You're at Grimaldi's eating pizza, what's there to cry about?
