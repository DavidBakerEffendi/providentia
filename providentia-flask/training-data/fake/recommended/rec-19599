Excellent. First time I've been here and was blown away. The atmosphere is simply fantastic, and it really sets the tone for the overall experience. All of the staff are very friendly, helpful, and everyone is good looking. The food is simply as good as it gets. All burgers come as either beef, bison, chicken, or veggie, and every single item on the menu (including beverages) are freshly made when you order. The burgers are, in one word, tremendous. Cooked to perfection, nice and juicy, as tasty as you would expect! Lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickles come on the side so you can add whatever toppings you want onto your burger. The fries are top notch too. I definitely enjoyed my experience here, and will certainly come back again, many times!
