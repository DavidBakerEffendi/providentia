BAR NONE, the best cheesesteak in all of the world (and it ain't even close). I have enjoyed many good cheesteaks in my life but nothing can compare to John's. I am not sure what is better the insane quality of the meat or the crispy chewy seeded roll it comes on! I swear their grill adds something (maybe crack) to the flavor of the sandwich that makes John's flavor so distinct and delicious! If you are into cheesesteaks you have got to get here ASAP!
