The food was good but the service was just Horrible. We had to wait for over 30 minute to even have our forder taken. They could have make up for the wait by taking our drinks orders quickly but not even.. (we probably waited 20 minutes to get our drinks). I do not know if it is always like that but I sure will not give it anoither shot as there is so many more choices in the city for sushis.
