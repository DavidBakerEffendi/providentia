What a great culinary experience! Came here with a group of people and two bottles of red. We started with the vegetarian sampler which was pretty good. The empanadas here were different than typical ones in a good way. The dough that wrapped the ingredients were more of a phyllo dough style. The fritters were decent but seemed to be a waste of space in your stomach. I'd compare them as slightly fancier hush puppies. The tostones were also good. The pickliz they gave us was so delicious and very spicy. It tasted like they use habaneros, which obviously adds a kick. For entrees we had, the tiliapia roule, shrimp etouffe spicy, saveur creole goat, creole okra, and the bayou salad. The goat, shrimp, and okra were excellent. The goat meat was cooked incredibly where it was falling off the bone. The shrimp was nice and spicy and quite amazing. The okra was nicely done and the flavor really came out with each bite. The tilapia was good but had a slightly fishier taste than some people might like. The bayou salad didn't come with the seasonal fruit like it said on the menu, so we told them to take it back. My main beef with this place is prices and the hibiscus tea. Despite a decent quantity of food, paying an average of around $25 per entree is a bit steep. Plus the desserts we ordered were $10 each, and we got two. I've never been to a place I can remember where desserts were $10. I have no idea why people love the hibiscus tea so much. To me it tasted like kool-aid and it's obvious it is a powder mix. I really was expecting a kind of iced tea made of herbal tea bags or something, not some sugary mix added to water. Staff were nice and BYOB makes for an added bonus. Give this place a shot, I'm sure you will enjoy it.
