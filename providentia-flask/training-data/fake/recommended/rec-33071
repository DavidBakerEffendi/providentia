At the risk of sounding redundant, I too, am in shock of the low ratings for this restaurant. My boyfriend and I dined here last night not fully knowing what to expect but hoping that the good reputation Marsilio's enjoyed in Chambersburg would carry the day. We were not disappointed. The ambiance is intimate and cozy, the kind in which patrons tend to linger. And linger we did. The owner was gracious enough to stop by our table near the end of our meal, and engaged us in warm conversation. He shared during our conversation that the restaurant has just received it's liquor license, but will retain the BYO option for its customers with a small corkage fee. Sounds perfect for those who wish to bring their own, and others who may feel like a martini or some other cocktail with dinner. All of the food was perfectly prepared and nicely portioned, from the mussels appetizer, the salad that came w/ our entrees, and our main dishes (I had the Can't Â Decide Seafood consisting of shrimp francais, crab cake and salmon; he had the Can't Decide Francais consisting of chicken, shrimp and veal francais). The made in house hazelnut cheesecake was delicious, and our server was non-invasive yet very attentive. With appetizer, entrees, dessert and coffee, dinner was still under $100. Job well done, Marsilio's. You're just earned two new fans.
