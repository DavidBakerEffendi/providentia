it's tough in the bbq biz b/c you pay a lot for a little meat; it takes them a long time to cook it, (labor, fuel) so the value falls off the bone. sides are always ramekin-sized, but you can drink as much of the bbq table sauces as you wish, just like at the int'l house of pancakes. cornbread was the size of 4 postage stamps and corn on the cob was more like cob on the corn. got the combo platter to test them out: ribs were nicely rubbed and well smoked but not exactly tender. Carolina chopped pork and brisket were good, sausage would've been better if it wasn't spiral-cut. (lose the juice that way). with crab cakes and pasta offerings also on the menu, you know they're trying to hold onto some mainstays for locals but really, a bbq joint should be all about the meat. not sure if enough groupons can save them. since there aren't many smokehouses around the area i give them credit, but something's needed here to go the extra mile. and it's not my dollar, either. Also Orange Habanero sauce is missing the Habanero, fyi.
