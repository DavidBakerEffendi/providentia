If you like being put on hold over and over again check out this sub-par pizza and anything goes spot in the Fairmount neighborhood. The saving grace is this is one of the few places in the area that you can get reasonable pizza by the slice, but tread lightly through the rest of the menu. Faster/better service and remarkably better food up the street at Luigi's.
