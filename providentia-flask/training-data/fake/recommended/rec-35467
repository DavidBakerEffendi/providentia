This place is literally in my back yard and I have had many of the sandwiches and pasta dishes.  Everything has always been made quickly and fresh.  I generally just stick with your basic pizza pie and it never disappoints.   The only thing that I don't like is that it's closed on Sunday when I want to grab something to watch NFL but I respect an old school restaurant that honors family tradition.  It seems like they have some fun music nights for local folks.
