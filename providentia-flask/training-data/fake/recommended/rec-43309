Totally Overrated!!! Its just cheap price and not many choices around... This business wont survive in bigger city, in NY? Forget about it!! Neva gonna happen. Dirty, workers are dirty, too much oil, only big breads thats about it. Even i saw the employees were harrassing their customers in front of many others, insulting them and speaking Spanish out loud and laugh.. Â  I guess the students who need affordable food keeps this place out of bankruptcy! After i saw workers were insulting the customers in Spanish, i left right away and stayed the restaurant right next door.
