We strolled in 11:30 on a Sunday morning, ready for brunch. After a short wait we were seated in a nicely full restaurant. We both had pancakes, as that's what we were in the mood for, and the reviews led us to believe they'd be pretty great. They were fine. The service was awful. Our water glasses quickly ran dry, and never saw another drop. Our waitress disappeared for quite a while, when we needed our check. Once we found her, a check appeared very quickly. But it wasn't ours. The food was fine, the service was poor. We won't be hurrying back.
