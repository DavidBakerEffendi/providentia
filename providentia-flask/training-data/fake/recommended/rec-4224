Our concierge at the Loew's sent us here when we asked for a bar downtown where we could get a nice martini before dinner.  It was a great call.  We didn't eat - just came for a drink.  The place was lively on a Friday night at cocktail hour.   The crowd was a mix of young and old, which is nice.  And the bartenders were REALLY nice.
