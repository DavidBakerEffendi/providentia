Stopped in on a recent Philly trip and enjoyed.  Started with Mexican salad which has lots of flavors.  Shrimp tacos were up next and were excellent. Short ribs were amazing - sauce was killer.  We tried the cheesesteak eggroll which was nice and then ordered three small deserts of which the cheesecake was the stand out.  Hip place with solid service and I'll be back.
