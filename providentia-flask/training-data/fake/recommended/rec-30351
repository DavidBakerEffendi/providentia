I love Penelope. I really think I may have moved to NYC 5 months ago just to be closer to Penelope. Just try the penny egg sandwich and you will be amazed. Absolutely DELICIOUS! Also tried the salmon poach egg weekend brunch special and was floored. For anyone who doesn't stray far from the usual, my bestest had the waffles and loved it.
