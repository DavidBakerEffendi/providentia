I know this sort of food.  Very well.  And Ssam Bar does it REALLY REALLY WELL. Pork bun & BLT bun - simply out of this world.  Steaming fresh buns, perfectly rich meat. Seasonal pickles - sounds so strange to say this about a plate of random Korean style pickled veg, but their produce is obviously superior.  Flavours really popped. Spicy pork sausage rice cakes - I could eat this till my stomach exploded. Service was efficient and very friendly.  You leave your name, go next door to their adjoining bar for a drink and receive a text when your table is ready.  Incredible - a super popular joint where the hipsters HAVEN'T let the fame go to their head, and actually have a great seating process in place. EAT HERE.  (then hit Milk Bar across the road for a cereal milk treat)
