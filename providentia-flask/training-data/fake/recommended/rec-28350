The decor is fun, service good and the food always delicious at Room Service.  Came here this past Saturday after a show.  There wasn't any seating immediately available around 9:30 p.m., but the wait was only going to be about 15 minutes long. However, we opted for seats at the bar since my bearded companion was ravenous (he didn't have any snacks tucked away in his beard, as he normally does).  We shared the curry puffs, the pineapple fried rice, beef massaman curry, chicken pad thai and a bottle of wine. The curry puffs were fluffy and absolutely delicious (I just can't get enough of the cucumber salad they serve with them). The beef massaman curry and the chicken pad thai were also great. I enjoyed the pineapple fried rice, but I have had better (it was still very tasty, just not the best I've had at a Thai restaurant). My friend and I both ate plenty, and there were a lot of leftovers, as the portions were generous. Not only that, but the food and wine were very decently priced. If you want a place with a fun ambiance, great service, and solid food, then Room Service is the place for you.
