If you're going to get comfort food, why not get Stephen Starr comfort food? I've lost track of his proliferation of establishments since I moved away, but, as a random restaurant choice, this was a good one. The four of us all got drinks, entrees and desserts, and left happy. Everyone got different cocktails, and we were each pleased with our choices. We went poultry-heavy: two orders of chicken pot pie, one of chicken and waffles, and one of fried chicken (mine). The pot pie was deemed wanting salt, but was otherwise well-received. My fried chicken was delicious: perfectly crispy on the outside, succulent on the inside. The accompanying fries were well-done, too. As for dessert, I can say only this: S'MORES. Get the s'mores, everyone; they are amazing and perfect, and I would eat them every day without complaint, I think. So, overall, a good meal, and won't break the bank. Keep it up, Mr. Starr.
