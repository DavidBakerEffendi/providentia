Awesome. Delicious fresh taco-y goodness, lovely service, cheap and super satisfying. Mmm... We both ordered a chicken and a chorizo taco. Both were great, especially the chorizo! I wanted to try the veggie but they'd run out, so they were popular!! Jicama and corn salsa delicious too. The sauce selection rocks. Try the devil.
