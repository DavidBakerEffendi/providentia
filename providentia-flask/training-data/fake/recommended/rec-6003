wow I am surprise i don't know this place in my own neighborhood. Â Friend of mine took me here on a slow Sunday, I believe we spent about 3 hours here. it's BYOB. AWESOME food, I believe the couple is the owner and husband is the chief and they are very friendly. the place is never too packed which is always good. feel very homely. I can't wait to come back here !
