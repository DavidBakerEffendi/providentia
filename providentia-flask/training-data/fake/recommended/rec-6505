I am pissed!  Why have I never been to Café Orlin?  Do I look like I don't like various types of eggs benny? Like I wouldn't be into perfect hollandaise sauce?  Do I seem like the type of person who wouldn't want everyone I eat with to also love their meal? Café Orlin is a fantastic place for brunch but my ego is upset that I had to have my sister introduce me to it.  We got there on the early side of the brunch rush so there was no wait.  The restaurant itself really brings an authentic Middle Eastern café to the heart of St. Marks.  It really reminded me of my days running around Israel taking pictures in sepia and eating schwarma with french fries in the middle of my pita.  The menu is pretty extensive with a ton of different Middle Eastern breakfast specialties but I opted for the Eggs Blackstone, an eggs benedict with bacon as the protein.  It was the best benedict I have had in a while as the eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise was delicious.  Everyone's meal looked great so I am going to have to come back to try something else. My cousin got the steak and eggs which came with a really nice piece of skirt steak that gave me orderer's remorse for a minute before I got to down to business on my own meal.  The huevos rancheros also looked incredible but unless I am eating cereal I need some meat in my breakfast.  By the time we got up to leave the place was full and bustling so I will keep my arrival time a secret thus ensuring no one else catches on to the proper brunching time.  I will definitely be back very very soon.
