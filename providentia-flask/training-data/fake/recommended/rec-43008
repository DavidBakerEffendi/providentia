EO is a fantastic spot. The people that work there are really what makes you feel at home. KC at the door is incredible he makes you feel at home and keeps out the people who are not nice and do not contribute to the atmosphere. The bar tenders and owners are awesome as well. Tip Dev and Stephen real well. If it slow think of a cocktail not on the menu and watch them deliberate the best way to make it!
