Came here with my sister for a special birthday dinner at the secret supper club. It may have been the best meal I've had in Philadelphia. We called ahead to let them know we are vegetarians and they were very accommodating about making substitutions. The meal started off with warm rolls followed by risotto croquettes and asparagus soup. Our main course, replacing the lamb, was goat cheese gnocchi and roasted potatoes. I am usually not a gnocchi fan because it is so heavy but this was light and delicious. Definitely my favorite of the night. But everything was great. I'm already recommending it to everyone I know that lives in the area.
