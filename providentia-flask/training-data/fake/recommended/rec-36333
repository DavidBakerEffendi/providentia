** Brunch Review ** Perfect Brooklyn brunch. Friends and I came for brunch on a Saturday a few weeks ago. We were lucky to be able to walk in and snag a table (usually there's a wait). Sat up in one of the elevated booths in the main room so we could watch the action at the bar. Beautifully decorated -- looks just like Sweetwater or some of the other places around town -- mix of restored and new items. Servers have very cute little uniforms (bowties and all) just adding to the charm. Service was usual brunch -- fast, efficient, friendly. The food was wonderful -- tasty and fresh. Easily could recommend this place as a "better than your average" place in Williamsburg.
