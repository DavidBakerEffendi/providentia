Came here for happy hour and snacks with a friend and was so surprised that I had never been in here or heard of it before. What an adorable little place. It has a great feel to it. The bartenders were very attentive and helpful and the food fantastic. Had I known about this place before I would have been many times. I can't wait to go back and try more of the delicious appetizers and dinner. Thanks for reading and enjoy.
