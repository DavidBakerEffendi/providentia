I'm in love with this place.   Great spot to grab app and drinks with friends.  Or have dinner and catch up. The decor is amazing and fun.  The food is probably some of the best Thai I have had in the area. I am super picky about my papaya salad because my mom makes it from scratch.  But this is some seriously good papaya salad with a spicy twist... trust me I have had some bad salad at some other "thai" palaces ones) and spicy basil noodles with imitation duck is fabulous!!! Tip: I tried their take out not as amazing.. go there
