Came here on a Saturday night after  Beso didn't have a table. We were seated right away. Service was very good. Our waitress was attentive without being intrusive. As we were hear close to closing, we had a chance to talk to some of the servers. They were very cool girls. As for the food. Had the crab cake. It was very good- but we were a little disappointed only one came in an order. I had the crawfish entoffe (sp?). It was amazing! I literally drank the sauce with a spoon when my boyfriend was in the bathroom. He had the seafood  jambalaya. Lots of seafood in it- no wimpy servings. It was also very very good. We split the bananas forester- by split I mean fought over the last bite. Again very very good! Overall we had a great meal and really enjoyed our night out.
