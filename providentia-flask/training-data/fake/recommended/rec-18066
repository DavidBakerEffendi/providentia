Five stars for the impressive beer selection and for the vegan seitan Reuben sandwich. Seriously though, get the sandwich whether you're vegan or not - it's worth the trip. We also got the buffalo seitan nuggets with vegan ranch - seriously on point! If you can ignore the sometimes snobby service, this place is a 5/5.
