Wow! Chavela's literally left me without speech. Venturing from the Bronx, I was hoping I wouldn't be disappointed. BOY, was I NOT disappointed. First off, it's not as big as I thought, but it's comfy. The crowd is mixed and the atmosphere is perfect for your crew. The sangria is draft, yes draft and it is probably the best I have ever had. It's sweet and has just the right amount of liquor. I settled for the flautas and fell in love. Wow! Chavela's....marry me...Please?
