It took a 30 minute train ride and a 1.3 mile walk to get to this. Place.  After eating there I would travel much farther. It is a very small place in an industrial area with only about 7 tables. The food was as good of Vietnamese or Thai flavors as I have ever had. We ordered an unbelievable amount of food but still ate it all. This place is worth any amount of hassle it may be to get there.  If it was open on the next day which was a Monday I would have gone back.
