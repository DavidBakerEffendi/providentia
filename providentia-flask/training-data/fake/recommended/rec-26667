I went on a Monday and ordered the Carnitas Tacos (the special that day) with a can of beer for only $10. The food is great and reasonably priced. The only downside was the service. The restaurant wasn't very crowded yet server was very slow to come over and introduce himself, slow to return with the drinks, and slow to take our orders. This is not a place to grab a "quick" bite.
