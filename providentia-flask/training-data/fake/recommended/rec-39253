This a review of their delivery and lunch specials. The Good: -Rather large portions -3 courses (Choice of soup, Choice of pork or veggie egg roll, choice  of rice (fried rice, steamed rice, or brown) and your meal. -The price is $6.00 The bad: -No utensils.  We have a cafeteria, but not everywhere does. -Feels like you get a lot more rice, than meal. -No fortune cookie.  I know that its american, but we're in America! It's still one of the best deals in the area, but its better  to eat at the restaurant. NOTE: We order from this place pretty close to once a week and no fortune cookies when it comes to take out.   It could be because one of my chinese co-works orders it, but it hasn't happened since we been ordering take out from there.
