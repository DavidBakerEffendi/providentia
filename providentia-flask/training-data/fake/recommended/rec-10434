My boyfriend and I decided to come to the city on a beautiful day and experience the New Amsterdam market.  As we walked around the market and tried all the yummy samples, our stomachs started rumbling for actual food.  So, we decided to go into Fishmarket and eat lunch.   We walked in and there was a room full of people having a bday party.  No problem-we decided to sit at the bar (the Yankee game was on anyway), so what better seat was there?!  We started out with clams on the half shell-they were definitely fresh, but the clams were small. We both agreed on the Fish and Chips.  I have to say that it was just "okay."  We've definitely had better.  Not sure if I'll be back, but if I do, I'll be trying something different.
