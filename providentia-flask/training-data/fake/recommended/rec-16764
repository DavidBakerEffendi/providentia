We had a nice brunch on Saturday at Algarve.  Don't believe their opening time; we got there at 10:30am and waited 15 min before they were ready to seat us.  Once we sat down, the service was quite good, the portions were huge, and food well prepared.  The salad was the only marginal food item, the lettuce was beginning to turn brown.  The BBQ and Portuguese dishes were wonderful, the rice and skewered vegetables good.  Very convenient if you have a flight out of EWR, they are about 5 minutes away!
