We popped in here on a snowy day after buying a bike down the road for a burger and a warm up - we were totally impressed, warm, happy and full when we left. We were seated right away, the atmosphere was great and our server even asked us where in the restaurant we would prefer to sit - thanks! Once seated we saw the awesome beer selection and each ordered a on tap beer - they were delicious, cold and well priced. We each then ordered the Spiced Angus Burger Medium my husband asked for fries and I opted for the salad we both got the grilled jalapeno, cheddar, tomato, pickle, onion on top.   The burgers were amazing well seasoned, big juicy, and cooked to the perfect temperature.  The buns were fresh, the toppings were fresh, the grilled jalapenos - so good!  Even the pickle was tasty! Whoever below said they are pre-made patties is totally wrong (we almost didn't come because of that review).  We saw handfuls of fresh meat being scooped out of a bowl (if she saw pre-made patties maybe they were formed in the back or something but these burgers were definitely fresh as fresh can be). My salad was awesome.  Fresh greens (not wilty lettuce), toppings and even little black olives to give it a salty zip.  The dressing was amazing the portion really big.  The fries were fresh, crispy and salty - my husband devoured them. The price - incredible.  The service was upbeat, always on top of refills of water and very helpful. We will be backx10 for sure.  If you want a burger in the neighborhood go here!
