Delicious. Two chicken kati rolls transported me back to my Bombay days. The cilantro chutney was ON POINT. Super spicy and super flavorful. The chicken breast was juicy and not dry. Vegetables were freshly chopped. The roti (paratha?) was flaky, warm, and not too heavy. I closed my eyes after my first bite and my toes curled a little. That should tell you something. Now to find a boy that has the same effect on me....
