My 2 teenage kids and I went to Atticus for breakfast before our tour at Yale.  Since my daughter loves the breakfast soufflé at Panera and there's one a few doors down, she decided to get her soufflé there then join us at Atticus.  While I accompanied her to Panera, my son sat down at Atticus and ordered an orange juice to start with.  After we've gotten the soufflé, we went back to Atticus to join my son.  As soon as the lady who takes orders saw her soufflé, she came over right away, without saying good morning or anything else, rudely said, "we do not allow outside food in the cafe".  There was NO ONE ELSE eating there at the time so it's not like my daughter was taking up their precious real estate, plus both my son and I were going to eat there (my son has already placed his order) so it's not like we were not spending money there.  That left us no choice but to buy their food to go.  My son ordered a "complete breakfast" and I a "baked strata".  Honestly, I did not think the food was good and this has nothing to do with their attitude.  My son asked for regular toast and he was given 2 pieces of over-toasted baguette, he asked for scrambled eggs but was given a flat sheet of eggs (shaped like a crepe) that I won't call "scrambled", and the breakfast potatoes weren't good either.  My strata was also disappointing; the top was totally burned and the rest did not have that chewy texture (it was kind of mushy) I expected from a strata.  Bad experience.
