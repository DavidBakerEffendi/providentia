Gritty neighborhood, tight quarters...all the makings of a fantastic Village experience...Mojitos were MONEY!!!  6 of us had dinner and everyone loved it...Empanadas were on point, everything was fresh and tasty.  Service was awesome despite being crowded...seated downstairs, would have preferred up but hey...then, a freshly rolled cigar was the perfect capper.
