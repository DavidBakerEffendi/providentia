I reserved my hunger, having only one slice of pizza while in Manhattan because I wanted to give this cheesesteak the attention it deserved. It was 1:30am when we pulled up and had just slammed two pints of Stella at some roadside chain in New Jersey, so my appetite was primed for this experience. There were some hookers hanging out and we chatted about my sunburn while I read the stupid ordering rules. I ordered slowly on purpose because there's no line and I hate rules. They put some crappy sweet peppers on my sandwich that I had to pick off after drunkenly realizing how crappy they were. The bread is good, I'll give it that - but take away all the boasting and built up shit and this sandwich isn't even as good as one in Albuquerque or San Francisco. I would normally give four stars but minus one due to complacency.
