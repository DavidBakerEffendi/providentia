I have eaten dinner at Sunshine Co several times this month and have tried most of the small plates and all 3 current desserts.  Some thoughts on the dishes: - Littleneck clams: they were cooked perfectly, although the broth was a little heavy on the butter. - Grilled squid: could have used a bit more char on them, but the sauce (ink puree) is delicious and nicely balanced by the lemon. - Roasted beets: the pickled mustard seeds were delicious with the beets. - Roasted bone marrow: I think this dish could have used more pickles on the side or some kind of salad with a punchy vinaigrette.  Also, the generous portion was too much for 2 people. - Popcorn panna cotta with salted caramel: more pudding than panna cotta, but still delicious.  Could have used less caramel. - Grass-fed beef burger: the meat practically melts in your mouth, but it made me miss red onion.  The fries were cooked through, but they were pale and not crispy on the outside.   I think the dishes at Sunshine Co really shine when they're cooked with bold flavors like mustard, pickles, and lemon.  The service and staff were friendly and attentive every time.  The delicious food and drinks are reasonably priced and generously portioned.  Highly recommended.
