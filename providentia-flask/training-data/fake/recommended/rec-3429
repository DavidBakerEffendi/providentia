After reading all the great reviews I went to check the place out and I think I must have went on an off night. The food was bland and just ehhh. The bartender was killing it but my drink just didn't do it for me. I wanted to experiment with something new so I blame myself not them for that. The atmosphere was fun and everyone was outgoing. It was filled with plenty of smiling faces. I'll try again another time and hopefully I'll get a better experience
