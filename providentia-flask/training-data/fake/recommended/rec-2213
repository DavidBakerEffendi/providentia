I ate here on a recent trip to Philly and I really enjoyed the food.  I grew up eating Tex-Mex food and found the food here very good.  The food is a bit over priced, but you do gain some delicious food for the price.  I enjoyed my tortilla soup.  It was very tasty and packed will flavor.  My steak tacos were also quite rich in flavor but on the small side.  I enjoyed the fresh corn tortillas of the steak tacos.  My dining partner had something off the brunch menu .... while he enjoyed the food, the flour tortillas were clearly not home made.  If the tortillas are not home made... whats the point of serving them?   I would eat here again, but avoid anything with flour tortillas... I can get those at home.
