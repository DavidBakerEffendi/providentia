I was shopping at A Dong when I saw this in the corner and was curious to try it despite already haven eaten.  I am basing this review, and even admittedly quite harshly, on one appetizer to go. This review is based on 红油抄手 (wontons in chili oil), a common staple in Szechuan restaurants.  When done right, it whets the appetite for the impending feast. This dish is comprised of two critical components, the oil and the wontons.  First, it is quite obvious that these are home wrapped, but with that being said they skimped on the filling.  It was like eating mostly wrapper and in essence eating a near noodle dish...which this should not be.  Therefore any flavors the filling could've imparted is lost.  I'm not saying that the filling should have a significant role, but in this instance it left me wanting more. Second the oil, usually a home infusion of chilies and Szechuan peppercorns that impart that ma la flavor.  A flavor component that is both spicy and, in the best descriptive way possible, anesthetic-like.  When chili oil is infused properly, it is a robust flavor profile that is paradoxically sublime.   This particular dish at this restaurant had a sugar, soy sauce, and garlic flavor profile which I felt clouded the experience.  I also felt that the "ma" in mala, or the anesthetic component was too subdued.  In the end, it was a flavored oil with unnecessary accessories in flavors, instead of being a truly robust infused oil. With that being said, this actually is an above average dish.  I have seen restaurants merely slap spicy soy sauce and call this dish 红油抄手.  I have had this dish many times over and it remains ahead of the majority of the pack.  However, it leaves me desiring more.
