I've been here a half-dozen times with my family and the food is always quite good. BUT, two of those visits were spoiled by very slow and inattentive service, including tonight. The previous time, we waited 10 minutes before one of the two regular waitresses came to our table. Tonight, we walked in, sat down and waited 20 minutes. There were two other tables occupied in the main dining room.  In fact, there were more staff in the restaurant than patrons. Despite the fact it was a slow night, we were never given menus, and in fact, neither of the two regular waitresses EVER came to our table.  I watched as one of them chatted behind the counter, while occasionally glancing at our table, but then continuing to chat and pick at her nails. She eventually came into the dining room, grabbed cleaning spray and a rag and cleaned some of the tables, again glancing in our direction, but NEVER offering help. The other regular waitress also saw us numerous times, including coming into the dining room, looking straight at us and then grabbing a container of utensils before going back to the kitchen. We eventually gave up and walked out. Needless to say, I will NEVER go to this place again.  The food is good, but just not distinct or great enough for me to put up with the horrible service. I can get routine Italian dishes at 50 other places nearby. Which is why it is so abhorrent that the staff at this place just do not seem to care. You'd think they would try harder - especially if they are not getting crowds through the door, which it seems they are not. I would urge all of you to steer away from this place. In my experience, poor service and generally apathetic staff is a sure sign that there is something much worse going on.
