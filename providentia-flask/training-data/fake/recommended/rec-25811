We loved Feast so much the first time around we had to come back for the Nose to Tail menu, which features lamb. This second visit did not disappoint! The chef showcases the versatility of lamb so well in his different preparations, so if you're afraid of lamb (the gamey, overcooked type from your Grandma's Easter dinner), fear not! We're so excited Feast is in the neighborhood and cannot wait to see how the menu evolves in the summer and fall. Run down of the night... We spent some time waiting at the bar since members our party was running a bit late, and chatted with the bartender & the owner (both awesome!). We really enjoyed the IPA on tap, very well balanced, and the stout (Mother's Milk) was very creamy. On the first part of the menu, we really loved the... Merguez Stew: the spice and the creaminess of the quail eggs blended together so well! Shepherd's Pie: the pie crust was awesome, and the sweet potato puree was delicious. And you cannot go wrong with pork belly! Of the second part, we loved... EVERYTHING! We really liked how the lamb chops were seasoned by an herb crust with a kick (wasabi?) and it was complemented by the amazing vegetables and the potato gratin. I was sad I had to share this second part with my friends, it was that good. Dessert was awesome, and our favorite part was the 'drunken' bourbon whipped cream! Nom nom nom!
