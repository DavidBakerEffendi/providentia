shit man. you don't need me to tell you how good or awesome this place is. if you don't like this spot, you GO TO HELL!  NOW!! but seriously this idefinitely the best street meat joint. and DON'T YOU DARE ASK FOR EXTRA SAUCE ON THE SIDE.  The dude ALREADY KNOWS you want some extra to take home so you can put it on top of whatever it is you will be cooking next 3 days.  i only say this cause he really got mad at me last time i asked for extras, but i still love that guy. god... i'm hungry just thinking about this place.... goodbye
