Killer Tandoori Fried Chicken... Not greasy... Maintained a great crispness through the delivery process (which will often times leave crispy food, soggy)... The greens and Mac n cheese (super cheesy), that accompanied the chicken, were excellent. Shrimp n grits were also quite good... The perfect amount of big jumbo shrimp throughout. Delivery was fast via bicycle. Â A local ole hed, named Chase, is a character and takes his job quite seriously!
