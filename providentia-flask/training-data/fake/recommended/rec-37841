This place was decent, but I think they need to decide if they are a restaurant or a cafe.  The waitstaff/servers (if you'd even call them that) seem to duo as counter, so it is hard to tell how to order/pay.  The food seemed really fresh and was prepared well.  They have a pretty extensive menu for such a small kitchen.  I liked the open feel of the kitchen, and the atmosphere is comfortable, albeit the loud music.  I'll definitely come here again, but as a server myself, I noticed quite the table etiquette faux pas.  There was a table of 3 in front of me, and the minute only one person was done eating, the "server", upon walking by, cleared his plate, while the other two people were still eating!  I just observed how uncomfortable this made the other two people feel.  In the restaurant industry, you never do this!!!  I lightly mentioned this to the "server", just as a friendly reminder, and she had no idea that there was a certain table etiquette involved with this!  Wow.  I understand that it is not fine dining there, but any server, in any style of establishment, should know this.
