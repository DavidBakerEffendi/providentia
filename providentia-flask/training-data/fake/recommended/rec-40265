Rudy's is definitely a college town, late night eats place but go there anytime and you'll find something interesting on the menu. But first, start with the Belgian frites.  That's the real reason you come here and they don't disappoint.   Now, are they as good as the famous Pommes Frites in NYC?  No, but that doesn't mean they aren't good.  I think Rudy's frites aren't as light inside as the other guys but they are still very good.  And I like the diverse selection of dipping sauces available. You get one choice with your meal, if you get one of their sandwiches, and the others are 75 cents apiece.  I tried four different flavors:  maple Sriacha, samurai, maytag blue cheese and mango mania.  I liked all except for mango which was a bit too sweet. Also beware that if you try multiple sauces you will fill up because most of the flavors are mixed with a Belgian mayo base.  It gets heavy quickly. My dining partner had a basic burger that was very good and I will go back to try one of their burger variations of my own but on this visit I was intrigued by the Brisket Banh Mi. If you like Banh Mi you'll probably like this sandwich.  It had tender cuts of brisket with just enough fat left on for good flavor along with pickled jalapeños, cucumber, carrot, sesame aioli spread and served on a soft baguette.  Outstanding and very tasty. Rudy's is a big winner in a big college town with a well deserved reputation earned over many years in New Haven.
