This place has homemade pastas to die for.     Order the gnocchi with the shortrib ragu or the black pepper fettucine. The latter came with roasted cippolini onions, arugula, mushrooms and bacon.  It was a killer combo of sweet, savory, bitter, crispy, salty and of course, peppery.   Glancing around the room, the cioppino appeared wildly popular--it looked and smelled awesome.  Same goes for the the whole artichoke appetizer and scallop entree.  There was a good selection of cheese and charcuterie as well, although it didn't seem to be something the waitstaff was trying to push. For wine---Bring a good bottle of pinot noir to cover your bases or go all out with a super tuscan.  I'm hoping to see the menu better reflect the season once spring kicks into high gear.
