I've been a customer here since they opened and I have to say they've never disappointed!! Malcolm and his staff are warm and inviting as well as professional. he's a truly talented chef! I've lived in the neighborhood for the past 3 and a half years and this place is truly a breath of fresh air! My favorite dishes are the rib eye steak with parmesan cauliflower, and the Cajun club with perfectly seasoned fries! Had brunch with my mom on mother's day and we had the lobster omelette which she was thoroughly impressed with. All around great service, food and atmosphere! I plan to be a regular for many years to come! Oh and definitely say YES to the NoBurger! you'll be glad you did :-)
