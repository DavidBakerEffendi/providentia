Five reasons why I felt I was on a bad California-based sitcom during my lunch at Umami:     1. The hostess reminded me of Screech from Saved by the Bell. Not her looks: she was model-type gorgeous, tall, and thin, but to me she seemed clueless. She must've forgotten about me because she sat two parties before she remembered that I needed a table too. I'd like to think I'm hardly forgettable, but that may not be true.           2. The bartender was an out of work actor/fitness model. I ended up sitting at the bar. It can be a great way to meet people or simply have a nice conversation but there I felt the bartender, as buffed and good looking as he was, and as nice as my sangria blanca tasted, annoyed me with his fake voice. It felt as though he was reading a script, and playing the part whenever he checked on me.      3. Although my five spice duck burger was delicious, it was pretty small in size and there wasn't enough crispy duck fat on my plate for my liking. The side of onion rings were good, but the portion was small as well.      4. I've never liked cardboard boxes. The décor here is not my thing. If it spoke to its theme with more creativity or originality, then perhaps I would've felt better eating here. I usually like to linger during my longer lunches, but I couldn't wait to get out of here. The décor was definitely a part of the reason why as well as some of the haters/patrons.      5. The general attitude of the service sucks here. Perhaps because I was sitting at the bar, I didn't get the full experience, but I noticed none of the servers were smiling and all of them seemed to care less about their customers and more about walking the catwalk and getting ready for their closeup.
