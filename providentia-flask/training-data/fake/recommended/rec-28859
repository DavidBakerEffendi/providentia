My friend and I decided we were going to meet up for brunch on a Sunday morning, and since I do not live too far from LIC, decided on LIC market. We got to the restaurant at 11 AM and were promptly seated. Within seconds, our waiter came to introduce himself and ask if we had any questions. I ordered a fritatta, which only cost about $9, and was definitely a steal for a NYC brunch. While we were eating, there was a nice young couple next to us with a baby, who kept apologizing for the noise the child was making, and even came up to us as they were leaving to apologize. If a restaurant attracts this type of people in NYC, it is truly a gem. We were done eating by about 12, and at this time there was a line out the door. I guess the trick is to come closer to 10:30 or 11, so you can be served just as quickly. I unfortunately have not had the opportunity to go back, but would definitely love to very, very soon.
