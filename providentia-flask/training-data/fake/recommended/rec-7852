Have to update my review- I come here ALL the time.  Definitely my go-to brunch spot when I have friends/family visit, or if I'm not feeling like making breakfast that day.  The Divorced Eggs special is phenom. Weird thing though, they always seem to run out of coffee cups. Maybe it's time to buy more?
