this place is pricey, no joke. pretty sure my husband's OJ was $8. BUT we were splurging, and the food was terrific enough to inspire price-amnesia. His Huevos Rancheros and my Cookshop scramble with bacon and a Platonic-ideal biscuit were both perfectly done, and we ate beyond our comfortably-full zone, loathe to leave anything behind. Worth the splurge!
