Was in town for the weekend and tried to get in for dinner.  For future reference, make a reservation.   Ended up going for lunch the next day and was pleasantly surprised to find it was fairly empty. First off, they nailed the decor.  Kitschy, fun and polished. The food:  we weren't terribly starving, so we opted to split the Bazooka Limon guac, which was incredible.  I thought $15 for guacamole was a little pricey at first glance, but it was so worth it.  We followed the guacamole with the pork tacos and an order of platanos con queso.  The pork tacos were delicious, though a little more asian-inspired than I'd thought they'd be (think Korean bbq).  However, the plantains were overkill.  The queso was entirely too rich and I would've much preferred some sriracha to the queso. The blood orange frozen margarita and the hibiscus El Otono were a perfect addition to the mix. Service was good, but nothing to write home about.
