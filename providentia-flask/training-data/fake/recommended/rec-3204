Stumbled upon this place when my friends and I were killing time before heading into next-door Nublu.  Their chicken is AMAZING.  The attitude is very laid-back, it's as if you're eating in the living room of extended family  (minus the awkwardness).  I've taken visiting friends to this place, and they still talk about the food long after they've left the city.
