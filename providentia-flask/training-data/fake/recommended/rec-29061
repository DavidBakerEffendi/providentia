I'm not really a sandwich type of girl. There are a million things I'd rather eat for lunch than meat and cheese between bread... but I can't even front that the Roast Pork, Broccoli Rabe, Sharp Provolone & Hot Pepper sandwich here isn't delicious. Every element is done very well-- roast pork is juicy and tender, broccoli rabe is garlicky, you can definitely taste the sharpness of the provolone, hot peppers give just the right amount of heat, and they drizzle the juices from the pork over the top, which the bread just soaks up! This is another Man vs. Food spot that lives up to the hype!
