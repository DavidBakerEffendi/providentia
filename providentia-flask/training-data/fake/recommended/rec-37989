This place is amazing.  My parents were  both in the Peace Corps and lived in Thailand for about 10 years.  I've had my share of Thai food.  Over all, Thai food in the east cost is not "real" Thai food.  (Mostly it caters to vegetarians and people who like over-sweatened food.) Sadly, this is the only authentic place I've ever eaten at in NY or NJ.  (I still haven't tried the place across the street, though.) Joey, the owner, was there every time.  He's Thai. And the kid working there was related to him. (I think it was his nephew.) He gave me a tip that his aunt is the better cook between the two of them! I had to negotiate with the owner to give me the "Thai spicy" Penang curry. He actually wouldn't give it to me without some pressing. The Penang curry was amazing.  I've come back a ton ever sense. This is my favorite Thai place. This really is a jewel in the middle of a bunch of mass-produced generic Thai food places.  I would give it five stars, but the rice is dry. And the decor is of the total-hole-in-the-wall variety.  It's lime green walls with a worn-down floor. If they fixed the rice and relocated this place would be top-of-the-charts!
