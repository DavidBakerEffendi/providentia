This is def the quintessential pork bun.  Wonderful flavors and textures; sweet, cool, and crunchy from the hoisin and the thinly sliced cucumbers. The pork belly was delicious and perfectly seasoned.   We also had the short rib sandwich and spicy pork sausage with rice cakes.  Both were pretty good but not great.   Excellent service.
