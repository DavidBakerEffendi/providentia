Wow. What a disappointing, inconsistent place. I really thought we had found a new neighborhood spot that wasn't overrated, overpriced, and overrun with hipsters, but apparently that hope was as worthless as when I thought music could make a comeback after the shitestorm of knives in my ears that happened in the early 2000s. Tonight was our second time at Pig and Khao and it just didn't cut it for the price or the cuisine. The dish we went crazy over the first time (the green mango chicken salad) had zero spice to it which, for me, defeats the purpose of going to a Southeast Asian restaurant. And the pork belly with pumpkin puree special was just bad. Too sweet, not spicy, and poorly selected cuts. Â  My guy, who is ordinarily unforgiving of these types of flaws in certain cuisines, was not nearly as turned off as I and was willing to give another dish a chance, but before we had an opportunity to do so the smell of cleaning products poured over the restaurant. At first I thought that maybe the kitchen realized they were kind of blowing it tonight and attempted to spare all of us from tasting any more of what they were serving up, but the truth is that the bar, which is right at the front of the restaurant and in close proximity to plenty of tables, decided to wipe down every bottle of liquor with windex. In the middle of service. And when it was brought to his attention a big grin came across his face and he continued! I'm always surprised to see that kind of attitude from a position that doesn't rely on a salary, but tips from the people that you're disturbing. Maybe he hasn't been working in restaurants long enough to know that vodka should be used to clean down his bar, but, for me, attitude and inconsistent food are two strikes too big to keep me coming back.
