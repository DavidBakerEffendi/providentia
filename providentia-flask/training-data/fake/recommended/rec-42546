This place is flawless. Get the duck. Or the sirloin! I was told that the chef could make any of the dishes (besides the pastas) gluten free for me so that was super exciting. The portions were perfect. Not tiny like some upscale restaurants, but we still had room for dessert. The space is beautiful. High ceilings, spread out tables so you don't feel like you're eating on top of the table next to you. A nice break from most other NYC restaurants. Although there were a lot of other people there the restaurant never got too noisy. It was a really lovely atmosphere. Our waitress, Aime (I think?) was awesome. Very bubbly and personable and made the whole experience that much more enjoyable. I'd recommend this place to everyone.
