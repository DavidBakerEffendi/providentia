I came here with a friend a while back maybe half a year ago.  It's quite delightful.  It has a homey, cozy feel to it. Pastel yellow wallpaper covered in Parisian knick-knacks with random signs and adorable signs.  It makes you feel like you are at a pastoral Upstate eatery with a farm in the backyard.  It is a quiet and dim lit ambience.  Very refined.  Not big on talking, but great for first dates and noted for its romantic setting.  It has about a dozen different renditions of crepes.  The one I chose was the crepe with bechamel sauce, sauteed onions and potatoes.  It was delicious, but I'm not sure what the name was.  I was full after eating 2/3rds of it, yet I still forged on.  I said food like this could not ever go to waste.  Plus, have you ever ate something so good that you couldn't let it sit as a leftover in your fridge, since it might not taste as awesome as you first tried it?  Well, then those are my sentiments exactly.  I'm glad that I came here.  It is a bit of a way from the L train, so give yourself some time to walk on over.  It's well worth it!  I would come back again.
