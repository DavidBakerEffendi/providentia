I had dinner here with my family last night for a birthday celebration. The food was acceptable, but the service was so awful I had to share it here. We waited forever to be served. The meals when served came at different times, and mistakes were made with our orders. At one point, 8 out of 10 of us had finished out meals, and my niece had not even got her order and it was the simplest dish, it would seem to me at an Italian restaurant no less- Pasta w tomato sauce!! What the !!!#+**}!!xx....????
