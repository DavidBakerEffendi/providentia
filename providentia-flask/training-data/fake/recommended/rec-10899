It looks like Brooklyn Crab must have changed their payment policy. Contrary to previous reviewers complaining on the 'cash only' policy, I was able to pay by credit card during my visit today.  The service was swift and friendly. Our waitress was alert at all times and tended to everything to make my first experience here a positive one. A senior manager even approached me to ask if everything was alright when she noticed I was searching for a utensil.  Service was a little too friendly even, another floor staff came to greet us while we were eagerly peeling the shells off of our crab and shrimp to consume. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a staff who offered to seat us on the upper level where you can find spectacular views. We arrived on a late Friday afternoon so there was no wait at all for a seat. The raw little neck clams and oysters were very fresh. I could taste salt / seawater in the juice and sweetness in the finish. The snow crab leg in the cool platter could have been meatier but it was still fresh and I could taste the natural flavor in the crab. It took a little effort to push the meat out of the crab. Fried calamari was slightly dry but it was an enjoyable snack and pairs well with the Smutty Nose draft beer. The shuttle service is thoughtful and cute. It adds to the fun and anticipation of making a trip out here. Overall, I had a fun experience here this afternoon with quality food and great view. I left with a suntan too. A great place for the summer (open year round) with friends and family. I like and will be returning.
