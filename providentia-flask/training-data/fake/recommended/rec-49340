I used to eat here up to three times a week when I lived in New Haven. The food is just tasty. It's not super amazing quality-- in fact, I'm sure they just buy all their stuff at J-Mart and assemble it in the restaurant. Packaged noodles, broth, etc. But the portions are huge, the seasoning is right on, the veggies fresh, etc. For cheap noodles-- the food is fresher and less greasy than other options in the city. Crispy noodle is my sinful indulgence. I like it with tofu. The noodles are oily, toothy-- the sauce salty good. Most of the soups are great-- chicken wonton noodle is a favorite. Any of the tom yum are good too. None of this is authentic (whatever the hell that means) by the way. That is, they don't make the broth in house. The Vietnamese soups are not authentic pho. But who cares-- it is what it is; cheap, filling, tasty.
