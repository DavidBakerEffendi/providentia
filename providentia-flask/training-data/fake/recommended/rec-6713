No-frills but yummy sushi in Princeton at a reasonable price.  My boyfriend and I always split the sushi for two at dinner, which is delicious and a good deal.  They also have lunch specials.  In my opinion, Tomo is better than Ajihei because it's similar quality sushi for a much lower price, and also has a much friendlier environment.
