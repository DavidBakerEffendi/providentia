Went on a quiet Thursday lunch on my day off from work. I've been curious about this place ever since they opened in a sketchy area of Jersey City. I used to pass the area during high school in the 1990s and it would be one of the last places I would think to open a food business that doesn't require bullet proof glass and high definition CCTV system. But here they are, hopefully flourishing and staying open for a long time as the McGinley area starts to develop and gentrify, pricing out the riffraff that has been plaguing the neighborhood for a long time.   I ordered the spicy lamb sandwich with peppers, onions and mushrooms. It was good, not spectacular. Ingredients were fresh and just enough spices for a kick. Ordered a coffee and pastry for dessert, both good as well. There are outdoor and indoor seating. Very small cooking and prep areas but it seems to all work together creating a  friendly vibe, contradicting the outside world it resides, like an oasis. I commend the owners, they are friendly and obliging. I wish them luck and will get support from this customer as long as they are open.
