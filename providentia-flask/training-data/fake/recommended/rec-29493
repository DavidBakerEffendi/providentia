The food is pretty good for a fast food place. I always get the tacos because the burritos are huge! There is usually a long line at this location but it goes pretty fast. I was there today and the ladies room water didn't work, all the tables were dirty, and they were out of ice and napkins! Yuck!!! Maybe management needs to hire more employees to keep the place clean. That's why I give it only 3 stars. The food is good and consistent though so I'll go back.
