The only thing stopping this place from being an authentic speakeasy was the lack of a password for entry -- although the barman at the door ensured I belonged there and wasn't just wandering in, so close enough. The group punch with the giant ice block -- to the meatballs -- to the sausage rolls -- to the mixed drinks -- to the book menu -- this place is all kinds of awesome. To say we'll be back is like saying a bear shits in the woods -- it's a fact. The question is how often. I don't know how frequently a bear shits in the woods but I know I'll be returning extremely frequently to the Dead Rabbit before everyone knows how great this place really is. Keep up the good work, lads, you've created and got yourself a winner!
