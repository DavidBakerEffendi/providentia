5 stars for the waiter Mario, who was really helpful throughout the night and didn't get overwhelmed with our large group (13). It did take a while to get our orders started but after that the service was better. The place felt very homey. You can tell this is a place that a lot of regulars visit with their families. My friend made reservations for her birthday last minute and they were able to take us. We had a table set up in the back of the restaurant. I got up to use the bathroom and I really didn't like how close it was to the prep room. The food: I ended up sticking to something familiar so I had the Chicken Gyro- comes with a Greek Salad, Pita, Tzatziki & Choice of Lemon Potato, Fries or Rice. The platter was huge and the price tag-only $13. The rice tasted like it had been cooked the day before and just reheated. Everything else was okay. It's also a BYOB spot and a liquor store is right next door incase you forget!
