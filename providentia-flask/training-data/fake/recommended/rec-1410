Recently visited Philadelphia and was starving when I landed. I asked the shuttle driver at the airport for a recommendation for a good Philly cheesesteak in the city. He immediately suggested Pat's or Geno's. I tried both during my time in the city and Pat's definitely takes my vote for the best. The meat was better and I liked that it was sliced into smaller pieces. Also, the bread was softer. YUM! Maybe it was because I hadn't eaten all day, or maybe it was truly that darn good. If you're visiting Philadephia, stop by Pat's for a cheesesteak wit relish, mustard, and onions. MMMMmmm.
