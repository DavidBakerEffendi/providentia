Olea was one of the best dining experiences ever! The drinks were amazing, the food was to die for and the people were so friendly! We loved everything and would recommend to everyone we know. A bonus is that we accidentally dined during happy hour so almost everything was half off!! The almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates are heavenly and the orrechiette with sausage is delicious- the dinner size is quite large so we split it. Love this place!
