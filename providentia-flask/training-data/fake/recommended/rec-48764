The food was great. I am not a fan of pasta but the food was seasoned great. I had the ribeye and for the price the size was great. I couldn't finish it. The service was spectacular and if you order the fish from the godfather you are in for a treat. Worth it. Price was less than expected. Well worth every penny.
