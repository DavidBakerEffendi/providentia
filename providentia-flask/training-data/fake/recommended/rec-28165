This place needed no introduction the first time I went for brunch. No one shuts up about Vesta. Had the Hangover Pizza and ate the whole thing myself. I was thinking about it for days... Still am. It hit just about every spot you could hit. Â  The girlfriend got the Warm Bankie. Rich and savory. I want fried eggs on all my pizza from now on ;)
