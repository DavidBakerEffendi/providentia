I used to LOVE this place and would bring many friends here. I started noticing that the cooks were using fish as a filler for the meat stews, or any dish where it could be hidden. It's hidden underneath really well. If you hate fish, you'll notice. Plus you can see the fibers are different. Also, they can't make rice to save their life. A true embarrassment to Cubans. Don't care for the 50 tons of salt in my food either. Last issue that is keeping me from ever going back- the part of the restaurant that is not attached. The area that you have to walk back outside to get to. Wonderful in the summer, horrible in colder weather when the servers want to seat you there and leave the doors open. Yes, they're scooting around. However, the patrons are there seated to enjoy a meal that they're paying for. I'd say my/our comfort is more of a priority. Boycotted. That is all.
