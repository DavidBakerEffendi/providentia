Ah brunch, my favorite meal. Ventured here last week on a lazy Sunday morning, after reading many reviews for cafe's in the area. I expected a long wait, as there seemed to be a lot of people standing around outside, but they may have been waiting for the rest of their party as the two of us were seated right away. As we were leaving I did notice there was a wait- so it seems like the earlier you get there, the better. (11:30am, in our case). Service was great. Two glasses of water were plunked down on our table the second we sat down, and were never left empty. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. Other workers were all quick to help each other out, i.e. drop off checks or run credit cards; since the place was packed by the time we were ready to head out. I had a cappuccino to start and it was delish. The bf had a coffee which he said was better than most cafe's and diners we had been to. A+ for that. The food was also very good. I had the goat cheese, avocado and tomato omlet, which came with some greens, potato salad and toast. I had to ask for jam for my toast but it was well worth it. Raspberry (my fav) and seemed to be freshly made. The only complaint was that the potato salad, though good, was a bit too onion-y. The bf had some omlet with sauteed peppers and a pita that had to have been good as it was gone in 3 minutes. So all in all it was a good brunch, and a good place to come with a group. I'll definitely be back, and not just because I can see it from my front steps.
