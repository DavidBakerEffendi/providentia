Came here on my first trip to NYC for dinner on the first night, and again on my second trip to the big apple. It's literally a hole in the wall restaurant in the middle of Chinatown with enough room to sit maybe 15ish people. There's a layer of grease/oil on pretty much everything and it's pretty dirty. You'll be drinking out of styrofoam cups if you want tea/water. It is by far my favorite noodle joint and restaurant in the city, and probably anywhere. There's quite a number of Chinese dishes, but I've only tried the noodles and that's all I need and all I want. The knife peeled noodles are probably my favorite, followed by the normal hand-pulled noodles. Always get the combo. The noodles are perfectly chewy and yet have a little bit of crispness to them. I actually have had dreams about eating at this place... The soup is really good and the combo has pretty much everything you could want in a noodle soup, bok choy, eggs, meat, etc. Plus, it's all super cheap, especially for NYC. Will definitely be back here as much as I can (which heart-crushingly is not often since I live, go to school, and work in California D= ). Definitely definitely hit up this spot. You'll be in for a treat. And oh yeah, I think they only take cash. Side Note: The door to the kitchen is usually cracked open and you can watch the noodle master go to work spinning and pooling giant slabs of noodle dough. He's my hero.
