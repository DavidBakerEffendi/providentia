Perhaps I should have read other people's reviews first on what to order - I ordered the plain old big breakfast (fried eggs, toast, cappuccino, OJ, homefries) and it was just okay.  The homefries were DELICIOUS but the rest of the big breakfast was just okay - I was so excited for my FIRST meal in New York, and I was let down. If I'm back there I'll definitely try the Tunisian eggs or the Eggs Benedict, but in the meantime Cafe Orlins was nothing special.  On top of that, the service was a little slow and the waitress was kind of cold and aloof, but she was French so I'm going to let that slide and say it was all part of their French ambience.
