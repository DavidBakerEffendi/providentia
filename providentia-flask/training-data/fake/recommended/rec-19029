Tonsoku. It's pig's feet. Motsu. That's pig intestines. There. Those are the most important things you need to know before you go. Lots of people love pig's feet. Especially after they are stewed for a long time, it's tender and so flavorful. Some people will cringe or even spit it out the moment they try it, it is essentially just fat but "good" fat. The fat around the feet is mostly collagen and many people swear by its benefits of making your skin better. Get fat but with better skin! I haven't had one bad item from their menu. Everything is prepared beautifully and with care for fresh ingredients and flavorful condiments. The salmon carpaccio are refreshing and tasty. The grilled tonsoku is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It might not satisfy everyone's palate if they are not used to Japanese food (some dishes are slightly spicy without stating so), but hopefully the multiple dimensions of the cuisine shines through. The hot pot is what everyone gets and for good reason. It's so good, especially after stepping in to the cozy restaurant from the winter cold. They pile on loads of ingredients and just let it simmer in front of you. All the flavors combine and the resulting stew is super yummy. Even though it's a bit spicy (Hakata Tonton hot pot), my boyfriend, who is a weak sauce with spice, still devoured the whole thing. Besides food, they also have a great drink menu, esp. the sakes. The waitresses are all super friendly and sweet, and when you leave, they stand by the door to hand you a piece of Pez candy as a "thank you for coming" treat. Nice touch. It's a small place so reserve in advance. Be adventurous and try everything you can.
