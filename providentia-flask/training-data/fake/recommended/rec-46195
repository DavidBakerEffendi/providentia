Oh, that unfortunate name... Despite the initial misgivings one might have about Goodfellas based on the name, it provides a fairly classy eating experience. The service is great and the atmosphere is nice. The servers seemed to try to get to know the patrons and were very helpful and attentive. The menu isn't very extensive, but has enough variety that most people can find something. Some of the dishes are of the tragically overpriced Italian-American variety, but they have some delicious, inventive options also. The prices are a bit steep and, unfortunately, not always worth it. The portions are large as one would expect from a place that is constantly playing Marlon Brando movies in the background. Goodfellas is a decent place, but not worth going out of your way for.
