Closest to Spain/Donostia I've been in NYC, which is saying a lot from someone married to a Spanish husband from Galicia (we go there yearly). Came here for the first World Cup game for Spain vs Holland 2014, it was packed but the energy was awesome. People clearly love this place. Dry Basque cider (on tap!!!), exceptional and authentic pintxos, beautiful decor and especially love the open widow table looking over the park. Lovved the tortilla with pimentos de padron, tortilla boquerones, navajas and chiperones pintxos. Highly recommend!
