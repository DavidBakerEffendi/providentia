So I have had friends that ranted and raved about this place and I finally got here. There really is not a lot to say that has not been said about 500 times already. Just get the soup dumplings. Just do yourself a favor and get them, stop thinking, stop reading the reviews, just go already! Oh yea, just to top it all off, this place is super cheap too!
