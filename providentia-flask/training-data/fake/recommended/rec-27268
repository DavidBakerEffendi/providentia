Il Bambino is one of my favorite spots in all of Astoria. The amazing food, friendly service, and outdoor back garden earned my five stars! To start, I always order the chickpea panzanella. In fact, I often want to stop in and just get this salad to go because I love it so much! The portion is perfect to share as an appetizer with two or three people. The salad has a lemon-taste and is loaded with arugula, tomatoes, and crunchy pieces of bread. The fingerling potato salad is also a delicious appetizer option. The portion size is slightly smaller than the panzanella salad, but the rich truffle oil aioli taste packs a big punch! Il Bambino is known for their paninis and I completely understand why- they are all awesome! I have been satisfied with every sandwich I have tried. The smoked bacon is my favorite of the ones I have sampled thus far. The fried eggplant with hot sweet peppers, the sweet sausage with rosemary aioli, and the porchetta are also all quite tasty. I have not eaten any of the brunch paninis yet (served Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), but they are all very tempting! Il Bambino, thanks for being such an amazing dining destination in Astoria!
