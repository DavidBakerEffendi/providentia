We had the clam pizza, which had pretty sizable clams all over. The crust was the best part - thin, doughy, and crispy all at the same time. For a Chicagoan, I felt like this pizza could have used more cheese. That was my only qualm. Next time though, I think I'll opt for something more standard like a Margherita pizza to really satisfy that pizza craving.
