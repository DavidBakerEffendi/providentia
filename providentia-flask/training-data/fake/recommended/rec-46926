Man I wish more cities had places like this. Anything you can think of is in this place. From restaurants to grocery stands. I ate at Tommy Dinic's. I had the roast pork, sharp provolone and broccoli de rabe. Damn good sandwich. I need to go back again. Either way, if you're in Philly, make sure you stop here. Give yourself some time too. Make sure you have the munchies...
