This place rocks, had my wifes birthday dinner there on 3/30, a table for 8 with the awesome turista menu option. The selections are abundant. Everything served was fresh, rich, tasty and perfectly proportioned. The service was friendly, helpful and top notch from the time i made the reservation up until we were served complimentary buca shots with desert and wished a good evening. Our server Marie was extremely patient, attentive and helpful. We managed to work our way through 6 bottles of excellen wine purchase at the premier selection store which is 100 feet away. Modo Mio thank you for making my wifes birthday an exceptional night to remember!!!!!
