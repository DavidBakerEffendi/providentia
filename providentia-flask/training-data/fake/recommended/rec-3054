As I believe I've mentioned before, being a lover of encased processed meat byproducts means that I can spot a hot dog sign from quite a distance. Which is why, while the BF & I were wandering down State Street waiting for our pizza from Modern, I spied the "Hot Dog" sign across the street (from about a block away). We went in and chatted up the lovely couple working there. They're a husband & wife team and very personable. I learned that they serve both Hummel Bros brand and Georgia Red Hots. Since I was technically on a pizza taste test tour, I had to limit myself. Having never had a Georgia Red Hot, I figured I'd try that. They had run out of mac & cheese so that wasn't an option. The red hot was good, pretty large and quite spicy. Prices range from $3.50 for a basic all beef to $7.80 for a mac dog supreme (mac & cheese, bacon, jalapenos on a potato bread bun). They serve Foxon Park beverages which seems common in that area. I can't wait to go back and try a Hummel Bros.!
