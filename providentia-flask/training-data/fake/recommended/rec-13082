I actually stumbled upon this place on the way to another restaurant....  The other restaurant ended up not looking so good, so this is where I ended up eating. This place is pretty small.  It only holds about 20 people.  The tables have all the condiments and cups and water, so it's pretty much self service in that aspect.  When you sit down, they do bring you a fresh, hot pot of tea though.   Soup bowls are less than $7 and are a pretty decent size.  I got the #1 House Special, which was noodles in soup with beef tendons, ox tail, tripe, beef, and pork.  It was really, really good.  You can tell the noodles are handmade.  They had the perfect texture and a fresh taste.  The noodles also came with spinach and bok choy.  I wish they added more vegetables though.   If they had a place to watch people make the noodles, that would make this place perfect!
