I order from here for lunch pretty often so I can't speak to the sit down service, but judging from the hospitality that I get on the phone when I order and from when I walk into and out of the door for my pickup, it has to be great. Everyone is super friendly and accommodating. I always feel like they're super excited to see me, and it's nice. I normally order the chicken shish for lunch. They give so much food that I only eat half and save the rest for dinner later. They give a generous portion of the chicken (which is so juicy and very well seasoned) some sort of red grain that's also good, but i'm not sure what it is, and either rice potatoes AND grilled veggies. What! But wait, there's more. They also serve it with a sizable lunch salad and fresh bread that's the size of the takeout platter. I also always ask for extra tzatziki sauce on the side. I haven't tried anything else on the menu because I really love what I've had so far, but I will probably try them out for dinner sometime soon.
