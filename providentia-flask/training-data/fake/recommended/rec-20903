I had two of the more popular Arepas, one was shredded beef and one was shredded pork. They were both delicious, but kinda greasy and didnt leave me feeling too great. They have great happy hour specials for (I beleive) Sangria and house wine for $3/glass. I was kind of annoyed at the atmosphere. Seems like it would be a good date place, but there were kids bouncing all over the place that were quite disruprtive. I will most likely give them another chance sometime soon but Im not in a hurry to.
