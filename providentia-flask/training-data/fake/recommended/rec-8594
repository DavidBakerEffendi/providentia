Don't totally get the Tiger's Tale.  Food is very average and ordinary...burgers and fries are what you might get at a TGIFriday's.  Atmosphere is run-down road house.  But the place gets absolutely packed on weekends, and full almost every night of the week.  It IS one of the very few drinking holes in the area, and you can bring your kids.  I guess that's the attraction for most, but neither are what I'm looking for.
