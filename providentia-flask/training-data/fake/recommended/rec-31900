This quaint little French place is so cute and romantic, but I do have to admit that we spent way too much money than we had anticipated! The portions are quite small, but the food is delicious. Yes it's a bit cramped and it's an intimate setting so you will hear awkward first date conversations or been-married-for-years conversation, but it only adds to the whole new yawk experience. If you're in the west village and in the mood for a mellow and expensive night and wanna get cozy with your neighbors, go here. I truly did love the atmosphere. Also, they make great sidecars! Note: the tiny menus are a part of its charm.
