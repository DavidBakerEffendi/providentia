I opened a yelp account for this purpose only.  U want people to know about the horrible service provided by the manager in duty, Jill. I arrived there at 11 am. I was told the waiting time was, "30 minutes but probably less". These were the exact words used by the hostess. At 11:45, I was not sitted yet so I asked Jill when we would be sitted and instead of politely apologizing for lying to us about the waiting time,  she raised her voice at me and said that they were trying their best.  4 other parties were complaining as well. We were all told it would be less than 30 minutes. After an hour we finally sit down and Jill still didnt apologize.  However the wonderful waiter we had did even though it was not his fault. The only good thing about the experience was him, Rob. Thank you for showing your manager Jill some manners. She should learn from you. I dont care how good the food is at a location..if good customer service is not provided it is not worth going there.
