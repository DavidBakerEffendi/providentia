2 words: Dutch Baby! It was perhaps the single best thing I have ever eaten. I ordered it with the strawberries and bananas with strawberry syrup. I will dream about this! We also ordered the Apple pancake. This was only alright. If I hadn't eaten the Dutch Baby I would have said it was great, but it Â is only mediocre in comparison. Bacon is thick and tasty although you may want to order it well done as it was a little chewy. Skip the hash, it's homemade but nothing you need to have. Make sure you get the fresh squeezed juice though. Overall, your best bet is the Dutch Baby with fruit, a side of bacon, and a fresh squeezed juice. You will not be disappointed....I promise:)
