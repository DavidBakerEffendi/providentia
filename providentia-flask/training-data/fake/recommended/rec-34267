My hubby and I love stopping at Uncle Willie's!  The BBQ Pulled Chicken is delish and my hubby enjoys the ribs.  They have yummy corn bread and honey butter that I LOVE LOVE LOVE.  The one thing that does disappoint me here are the mashed potatoes.  I would give them five stars if it wasn't for the bland mashed potatoes.  I agree with another poster who said they were not seasoned well and they do seem kind of watery and bland.  I've had them a couple of times so I know it wasn't just a bad batch.  Give Uncle Willie's a shot....you won't be disappointed with the BBQ!  They do a pretty great job overall.
