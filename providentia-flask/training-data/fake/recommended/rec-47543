This place comes in second after Sam I Am bagels, which is located Berkeley Heights and I believe there is another Sam I Am Bagels on RT 46, different owners.... Maidenhead, offers a variety of fresh bagels and they give you the Baker's Dozen Deal, don't see that too often anymore. In addition, although, I have never had a sandwich bagel, they seem to be be very popular too.  Appears not only to get a morning rush but does a nice lunch business too. Service is friendly and quick if you're in a rush.... Looks like the locals like to kick back and relax with a cup of Joe at one of the checkered cloth tables.... No table service, you order from the counter and they call you up when your order is ready, which is fine with me.   Whenever, I am traveling thru the area I make a point of stopping in... I just can't seem to ride past without stopping.  :)
