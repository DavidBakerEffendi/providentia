I really wanted to like, even love this place. I really miss good Mexican food. Let's start with the good things. The house margarita is pretty good. The chips are really good and the salsa has a lot of onions (which I like) and the taste is better than bland. The service is not great. Everyone employee we talked to was very nice. The service itself was slow and forgetful. I ordered the salmon fajitas (fishy and boring) and my husband ordered the chicken fajitas (tasteless and boring). Our kids ordered a side of shredded chicken, a side of cheese and corn tortillas. The shredded chicken tasted funky, at best (some type of bb-q sauce that went wrong) and the corn tortillas were very greasy and hard to use as they were so big. This was our second visit and the first wasn't any better.
