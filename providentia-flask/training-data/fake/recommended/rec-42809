Happy to note that Empire Diner still maintains the ambiance of a greasy spoon, while being decidedly cleaner and more up-to-date. On a Thursday night, the wait wasn't too long; we had to wait under twenty minutes to get a table. The menu is small, but promising. A modern (in some cases, luxe) twist is given to traditional diner fare. For example, there's the matzo ball soup with bone marrow. Decadence ladled in a bowl. Between my husband and I we split the turnips in butter, the lemon chicken, and the patty melt. For dessert, we went with the rice pudding parfait. Turnips were succulent and silky, with just the right crunchiness. The lemon chicken was served with ricotta, charred lemon, and roasted baby carrots. The textures and flavors were heavenly; the portions just right. A nice addition was the garnish of crispy chicken skin. The patty melt was juicy and delightful, and came with some excellent house-made chips (taro, potato, and beet). The rice pudding parfait was light and creamy. All in all, an excellent dining experience that makes me quite forgiving of the slow service. After all, they're still a fledgling restaurant and haven't been open for long; but with Chef Freitag's capable hands steering this ship, it's bound to be smooth-sailing.
