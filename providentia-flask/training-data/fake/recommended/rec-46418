I've never left a sushi restaurant with a fishy taste in my mouth and the worse part was that my husband also felt the same way.   The food itself wasn't bad. We had the spicy appetizer and the Monkey Roll along with the Three Style sushi with spicy tuna roll.  Aside from the spicy tuna roll which was definitely fishy, the rest was tasty.  Far cry from the best I've ever hard or even delicious, but sufficient to satisfy our sushi craving if not for the fact that we should NEVER EVER EVER leave a sushi restaurant with a fishy taste in my mouth.  We were both so horrified that we feared that we had to run across the street to buy a pack of gum to get rid of the flavor and it took a while! I genuinely feared that I would get sick when I get home. I will NEVER return to Iron Chef.  Don't be mistaken by the packed house, there are better places nearby, namely the one across the street which is DEAD, but SUSHI is unbelievably fresh.
