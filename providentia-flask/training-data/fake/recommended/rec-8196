As I was in charge of selecting our Easter Brunch restaurant, I figured we could walk 2 blocks from my folks' sublet and dine at HAROLD DIETERLE'S new restaurant, Perilla. I am a Top Chef whore and I love Harold. I ordered the duck burger, which was actually ground up duck. I was worried it'd be strips of fatty duck breast. Mais non. It really was a duck burger with fries. We also had Bloody Marys, which were crazy spicy and fabulous. Then I started looking for Harold. And suddenly, there he was. I love my parents deeply. but they subtlety is not an art they possess. "Now, which one?" "Chef's pants. 4 feet away." I hissed. "Shut the fuck up." "Where!?!?!" My father screamed. "What's Top Chef!?!?!?" This restaurant seets like, 30 people. And on their website, Harold makes nary a mention of why 27 of us are there. I guess he doesn't want to be known for Top Chef, but uh, Harold...don't bite the hand that feeds you.
