I'm from DC and stopping by The Meatball Shop after a night out with my friends is a MUST every time! I love their spicy pork meatball with spicy sauce (obsessed) and I also enjoyed their buffalo style meatballs! The first time i went, I had to wait in line for about 30 minutes and the last time I went it was very packed but as soon as we walked up someone was leaving!
