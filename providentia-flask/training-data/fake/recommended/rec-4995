I have never been disappointed at Applewood. I'm pretty sure I've had everything on the menu. My favorite brunch is definitely the steak and eggs with grits and biscuit. You must try the biscuit with their whipped butter and strawberry jam. YOU MUST! I have been gluten free for many years and still am unable to resist this one "cheat." It's worth it. Their drinks are the perfect balance between mixer & alcohol and their service is always on point. Highly recommended!!
