I brought my parents here for their anniversary and they loved it. I ordered the same thing I had previously at a similar Portuguese Restaurant, and it was not as good. I ordered the Fish fillet stuffed with crab. It came without much of a sauce on it and I pulled several bones out myself. My dad thinks he's as international as Pitbull so he ordered incorrectly in Portugese...he's Italian. When they brought out what he ordered(correct to them/incorrect to him) they actually had no problem replacing the meal once he told them what he meant to say. Everyone loved the food including myself. Although the meal was not what I expected the fish was cooked (not prepared) well. My vegetarian girlfriend got penne vodka that was actually excellent. Since it typically comes with some sort of protein on the menu they actually charged her less for getting it vegetarian. Although you may think ...that makes sense....in all the years most places just charge me the same price and I lose out. It was a random Tuesday and we arrived around 5. Got seated quick, but it did not stay that way for long. Over the next hour we were there the place became packed. A coworker of mine told me 7 days a week they get full for dinner. I will return.
