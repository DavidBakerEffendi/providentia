Two weeks later and I'm still thinking about that suckling pig. And that wild boar ragu. Oh, and that homemade bread. And the charcuterie. Chef Chris painter knows what he's doing. The staff is attentive and knowledgable. We stayed there for three hours and never felt rushed out of the place. It wasn't very crowded, which makes me think that the neighborhood and price point may be doing this gem an injustice. This truly is one of the best restaurants in Philly. A must try for any foodie.
