Pork in a fresh baked roll.  It is as good as it gets.  I would compare it to an Chicago beef or Italian beef sandwich.  The pork is tender and is best when ordered with the roasted green pepper on top with sharp provolone.  I also had the "Italian Style" which apparently is just pulled pork versus roast pork.  At the end of the day I'd take the traditional roast.  Next time I am in Philly, I will be trying one of these with the broccoli rabe greens on top.  Bottom line.  If you are in Center City, you should swing by the market and wait 15 minutes (or more) to get an amazing sandwich.
