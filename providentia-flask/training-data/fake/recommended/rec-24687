After a long day, Corner Bistro's red-lighted sign was calling me to enjoy a beer and a burger.  There was a seat at the bar, and I was able to quickly order the bistro burger and a blue moon.  It was fantastic.  On the TV, Arsenal was playing Everton so I was able to enjoy my eats, watch a game and lazily follow those conversations nearby. Perfect ending to a long winter day.  Go here with no expectations except to unwind, be fed and enjoy a beer.
