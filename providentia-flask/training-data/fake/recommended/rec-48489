This was by far the best restaurant I ate at while on my east coast road trip. Make no mistakes about it, if you are trying to watch what you eat for health reasons, then don't eat here. The food was rich and flavorful, obvious amounts of care and love went into creating it. Lots of the dishes include in house fresh made pasta and all the desserts are home made. This is the kind of spot you eat at to get away from the hustle and bustle of our life or you would take a date. When you look at movies and see all those intimate date restaurant keep this in mind, this place blows them away. Know this in advance, if you eat outside on the patio, then do it before sunset. As the sun was setting the bugs seemed to enjoy my flesh. But while the sun was shining, I did not have any problems. Also, this is a BYOB establishment so if you do BYOB, make an effort to bring something better than domestic beer.
