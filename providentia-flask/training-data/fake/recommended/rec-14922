This place has the best hot sandwiches! I work right down the street and on days when I didn't have enough time to put together a lunch for myself, I take a one minute stroll down the street and always order the same thing. Because it's oh so delicious. I always order the 'Smoked Brisket Panino'...it's amazing. The people who work here are always very friendly to me. The atmosphere is rustic and creatively designed. I like it. And so far, have not been let down.
