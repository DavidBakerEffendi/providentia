Spent 2 mornings here for breakfast with family. a great place to start your day before walking around soho. had reservations for both days and were seated immediately after we arrived. the decor is nice and simple and we liked the atmosphere. the place was packed when we arrived. im not very much a breakfast person but enjoys it every once in awhile. first morning we spent here, the waiter was attentive and recommended good dishes, but on the next day, not so much. started things of with hot chocolate and orange juice then we ordered full english breakfast, scrambled eggs in puff pastry, eggs norwegian, brioche french toast, and smoked salmon. for the most part they were good. i never had a breakfast quite like this that's for sure. also tried their pastries the next day and it was just as good. definitely try coconut cake. will give this place another try when i stop by soho.
