This restaurant lives up to all the hype. Went their for lunch and had the $55 tasting menu which I believe had 7 courses--all of which were absolutely delicious.  The portions were perfect and well-seasoned.  The dining service is also impeccable with very attentive waiters.  Can't wait to go back!
