I really wouldn't if I were you. A friend and I went here 2 weeks ago. We ordered drinks in the bar while we waited for a table and the bartender asked if I wanted to open a tab with my credit card. When it came time to pay for the drinks she told us it was cash only. Um...maybe you should tell people that when you ask for their credit card? Just a thought. There were lots of empty tables and yet it took almost 2 hours for us to be seated. When our name was finally called we were taken upstairs where there were even more empty seats. We ordered our overpriced food, they didn't bring us the potatoes, we ate, and it was meh. After we finished we asked what was for dessert and they told us that the kitchen was now closed. Seriously. That was it. Thanks for the money. No more food for you. Get out. This place is in serious need of a management overhaul. If it keeps going at this rate I give it a year tops.
