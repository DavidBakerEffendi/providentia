I just joined yelp JUST to review my favorite dosa cart. I'm not very tolerant when it comes to spices, but for some miraculous reason this food NEVER bothers my stomach.  If you're also not a spicy person, you can ask for your dosa to be lightly spicy or not spicy at all to be on the safe side. I'm a big fan of the Pondicherry dosa, and the Jaffna lunch is delicious too (although too spicy for me--I usually just share this).  The mango chutney that comes with the meal is to die for... I literally lick the last remains off my plate, it's so good.  The sambar soup that comes with the meal is also out of this world!  It's so spicy that I usually have to have a tissue on me when I eat it-- it really clears the sinuses! And Thiru, the cart chef/owner, puts a smile on my face.  What a sweet heart!
