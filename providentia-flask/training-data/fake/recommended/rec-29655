I'd come here again for the excellent service, especially for a birthday outing with a group of friends. Â The chef came out to chat with us, which is always nice. The wait staff was also very friendly and accommodating, and didn't mind a big group. They even surprised my friend with a chocolate birthday cake (with a candle!) and choice of coffee/tea to go along with it. The place has a homey feel, cozy but not cramped, and not touristy. For dinner, I decided to go with the chef's recommendation: Bow Tie with Broccoli Rabe and Sausage. Solid choice if you are looking for something simple and light (think more olive oil and garlic rather than heavy alfredo sauce), though not super flavorful. Add a bit of parmesan and pepper, and you're good to go!
