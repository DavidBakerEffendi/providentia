LOVE this place! A bar/tapas place that screams hipster yet does not put me off. The beer selection was ample and thorough, with descriptions of each beer on tap and the amount they have left of it. I opted for a local brew--a Victory ale. My bf, also known as my non-drinking, permanent DD for life had a root beer, and our friends had a variety of beers. I ordered the po'boy appetizer, which was absolutely delicious, but a shame that only 3 pieces came out and there were 4 of us. Although the tapas were expensive the drinks were a deal! For the four of us, we barely broke $30. My bfs root beer was only $3 and they gave him a free refill. My beer was a meager $5, the po' boy appetizer was around $9 and our friends'a beers brought us up to around $30. We even got to stay as long as we wanted way past last call. Sweet service and great beers, both local and international! Â A winner for me.
