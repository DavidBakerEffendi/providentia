Even decent mexican food can be hard to find in Philly... but Dos Segundos nails it. I've had brunch, lunch and dinner here (many times) and am ALWAYS happy. I highly recommend a pitcher of frozen passion fruit or blood orange margaritas and anything that includes chorizo. This place is worth heading out to if you're anywhere else in the city and want mexican.
