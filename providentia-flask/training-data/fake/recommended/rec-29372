The service was miserable and it took 10 minutes to get us seated, irrespective of our reservation for seven. The food was good and different than anything I've had before, but the wait staff were useless and hardly knew English, which made inquiring about menu items nearly impossible. The DanDan noodles are rated a 7/10 on the spicy scale and were barely mild; the hot sauce style chicken was rated an 8 and was insanely spicy. We sat in the basement which smelled of cigarette smoke and had a cold draft, next to a table of anti-discipline parents with misbehaving young children. It was like communist China: we were not allowed to have a second teapot since one was not enough for seven of us, and we had to beg for wooden chopsticks since plastic ones are slippery and harder to eat with. It was authentic and as close to the real deal as Chinese food gets, but other than the food, the place was miserable.
