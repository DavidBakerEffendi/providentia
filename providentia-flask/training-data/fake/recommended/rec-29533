This place has an interesting menu, which was a nice surprise. The infusion of Korean and Mexican cuisine was really delicious in the dishes I've sampled (Spicy Pork or Korean Rib Tacos...delicious)! Additionally, their margaritas are some of the best I've had. Guava Margarita Pitchers...all I have to say!
