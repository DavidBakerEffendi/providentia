Rarely do you find a place that has the essence of a Manhattan cafe/eatery that is located in the middle of a quiet Brooklyn neighborhood. I finally brought my wife here for lunch, having passed by it multiple times as we live only two blocks away. All the tables were taken inside but we opted for the outside seats as it was a nice day. We ordered the mixed plate antipasti to start off with and two paninis as our main dish. Let me just say, that the food was delicious, our experience was delightful and that we will definitely be coming back again.
