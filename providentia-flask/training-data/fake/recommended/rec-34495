Well luckily we came at a good time and the line was only to the door. It went pretty quickly. There was a giant menu on the wall to help decide while we waited. When I got to the counter ready to spit out my order in a hurry, I was caught off guard when the cashier asked how I was doing today. I think it was the first place after 5 days in New York that anyone asked how I was doing. He took our order and the transaction was pleasant and easy. We only waited about 10 minutes despite it being their lunch rush. It was also nice to be able to see them making the food. Always a sense of comfort in that. Anyhoo, we ordered a chicken tikka roll, mixed-veggie roll, and unda shami roll. The meat rolls were both exceptional and I'd highly recommend them. The chicken was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. It had just enough spice for a wimp like me. The veggie roll was good but I would have preferred a more homogenous blend of veggies since it was a bit heavy on mashed beets. Though very tasty, just not my favorite. Â  They give you wipes for after your meal, which is a nice touch. Plus they are located very near Bryant Park and it makes for a lovely lunch spot in Manhattan.
