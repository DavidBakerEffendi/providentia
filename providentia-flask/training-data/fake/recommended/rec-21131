I would give this 3.5 stars.  Front of the house service needs to be more responsive to customers. Please don't be stingy with napkins and utensils. I'm sure they are working out the kinks since this opened a few weeks ago.  I saw this restaurant on my way to Saigon Pho in the same neighborhood. I went in and ordered: -Pho Dac Biet - standard #1 beef pho.  Broth was tasty and flavorful compared to Saigon Pho.  I'm not saying it is better but it has a stronger beef flavor.  MIL found it too game-y for her taste.  It reminded me of the pho soup at Binh Duong. -Ha Noi Chicken Noodle - clean simpler broth that is not bad. - Beef Bo Kho - good taste bit on the sweeter side.  Wished the beef would be a bit more tender -Banh Xeo - Crepe special appetizer - do not order.  It is cooked soggy and oily. The taste is bland. -Preserved Lemon and soda drink is done right - sweet and savory I would return for the pho and preserved lemon drink.
