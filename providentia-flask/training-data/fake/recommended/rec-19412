It is a great place, and the staff is extremely patient despite the locals that were extremely rude while we were there.  They are "servers", not "servants", you know what I mean?  As an artist myself, I was a little ashamed of the self important jerks as they talked about how important they were loud enough that all could hear and all but knocked two patrons out of their seat to take up more room in the restaurant.  That being said, the food was great, my drink was fine, and the server was attentive despite the snaps in the air beside us to get her attention.  Grace under pressure is an underrated talent, and the full staff there should be commended for that talent.
