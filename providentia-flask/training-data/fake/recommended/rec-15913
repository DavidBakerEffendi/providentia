I love it here, plain and simple. It's just a cool, laid-back, great place to go with friends or on a date. The menu is pretty extensive, and the food is great. As everyone else mentioned, the mac and cheese is delicious. Also, the crowd here is so fun and diverse. Every time I come here, I either spot a celebrity or meet/make friends with the people sitting next to me. Its a pretty fun place to come and hangout. Plus its open 24 hours. The only downside is that the wait time can be pretty long, being that they accept walk-ins and they do not let you make reservations the day of (has to be at least 24 hours in advance). But they have a bar where you can wait and have a couple of nice, strong drinks.
