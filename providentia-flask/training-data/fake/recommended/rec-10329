Went there today for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised. This place is clean and has decent prices for the area ( considering the other local bagel shop's sandwiches are $8 a piece). The staff was extremely welcoming and friendly. My order was completed quickly and correctly. I ordered a Greek Salad which was DELICIOUS! I was so happy that I was able to find a tasty salad for lunch for an affordable price. I will definitely return :)
