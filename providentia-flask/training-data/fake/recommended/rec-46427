Amuse Bouche:  Everything bagel with cream cheese and carrot something - very good.  Bread w. chive butter:  served warm and awesome.  Appetizers:  Kampachi tartare was the 2nd best tartare I've ever had (after Volt in MD).  Morel Agnolotti was really good mushroom pasta.Main:  Chicken under a brick was I think the best chicken I've ever had.  Porchetta was OK, too heavy for me.  Dessert:  Banana pudding was too thick and heavy.  Service was not good, had to wait almost half hour between appetizer and main, but it was probably a fluke.  Definitely will go back.
