I stopped by after smelling the food that employees ordered at a neighboring store.  I ordered two empanadas (one cheese and one beef), and a breaded chicken cutlet topped with cooked onions with a side of rice and beans, and a mango shake.  All of this for less than $13!  The food was very delicious and large portions so I had to ask for a box to take the leftovers home.  The staff was very friendly and welcoming.  I will definitely be returning!!!
