The prices can't be beat. $1 for 5 pan fried dumplings. $2 (?) for sesame pancake with chicken. Tastes good too. I would skip the soup dumplings. It is kind of dirty in there.....the man who handles the money will also cut the sesame pancake on the counter where he handles the money without putting gloves on.
