A breath of fresh air in the McGolrick Park area of Greenpoint. The interior is charming and intimate and staff very friendly and accommodating. I wasn't familiar with Balinese food prior to visiting but was up for the experience and was not disappointed. I ordered the bluefish which had lots of unique flavors and just enough heat to keep it interesting without being overwhelming. For dessert my wife and I had a trio of Van Leeuwen ice cream and both swooned over the Black Rice flavor which I had never seen before. Our server told us they make the ice cream on the premises so there were quite a few odd varieties on display. We'll definitely be back again to try the other entrees and ice cream flavors.
