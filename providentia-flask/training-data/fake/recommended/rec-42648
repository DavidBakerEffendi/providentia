After having read some great reviews on yelp we decided to try black bamboo. We ordered delivery and it took about an hour longer than they originally mentioned. But this was fine with me. We got shrimp fried rice and chicken and cashew. The chicken and cashew was pretty good but the fried rice was sub par with just onions and a few strips of green onions. But what really ruined it for me was the shrimp, they tasted like mush and I have never eaten mushy shrimp. It just felt gross in my mouth, I guess I am just not used to this overcooked shrimp. :( I wish I liked them better. Maybe we will give it another shot before giving up.
