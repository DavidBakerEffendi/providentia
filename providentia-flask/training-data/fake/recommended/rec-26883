This is a real gem. I discovered this place by chance, and been hooked ever since. Prices are reasonable, service is friendly and very good, and the food is excellent. You should sit at the bar, and see the cooks do their magic in this very tiny kitchen. Going there without tasting their Rioja wine would be a crime :-) The only downside is that they don't accept credit card.
