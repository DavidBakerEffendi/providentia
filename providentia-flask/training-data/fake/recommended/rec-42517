This place was great...probably helps that I was taking a cheat day from a diet.  Service was prompt, friendly, and unobtrusive.  The food was very satisfying - although taking one star off for the relatively small portions.  Definitely get the seafood / clam pasta - amazing!  Love the little crunchy bits on top.  The duck confit pasta with duck egg was also splendid.  And the porchetta quite delicious.  The brisket tots were solid - but not quite as awesome as I expected (probably due to high expectations from the other reviews).  Overall - a very solid 4.
