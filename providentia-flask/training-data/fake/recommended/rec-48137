I recently attended an event where we were served exceptionally good bread.  When I asked where it was from, I was told the Main Street Bakery.  So though I had passed this place many times, I finally made a point of stopping there. Yum!  The bakery selection is amazing and everything I tried was delicious.  Cookies, a raspberry almond bar, mini chocolate bunt cakes, salads.  There is also a nice selection of sandwiches, soups and kids entrees, with some items ready-to-go in the case. Best of all, the prices are very reasonable and service is friendly.  In nice weather, there are a few tables outside.  This is a place I will be returning to for breakfasts, lunches and baked goods.
