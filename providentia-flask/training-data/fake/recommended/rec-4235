I've been here twice.  Both times I got the same thing, chicken over yellow rice and pernil over white rice with beans.  They're both delicious although the pernil could use a little salt but I guess it's good that they leave the saltiness up to the customers. A "small" to-go plate of food is $5.  The "small" is enough for dinner and lunch.  If they were closer to me, I would go every day.... I'd also be obese. I've also had their chicken empanadas and beef empanadas.  They were good, kind of tasted like they had maybe been made the day before but whatever, I still ate and enjoyed them.  I really want to try their checharones (idk if that's what Domincans call them, that's what they're called where I'm from).  They're friggin' huge (like the size of my forearm) and if I didn't care about my figure, I'd be all over those bad mamajamas.
