After going on about wanting to check out Blue Point Grill for the last 2 years (I'm really not a procrastinator, just too many restaurant options and so little time), I finally had dinner there last night with a couple of friends. The restaurant is owned by the same group that owns my favorite Princeton restaurant, Witherspoon Grill. The menu is all seafood with lots of options, actually way too many. The cute young waitress, very bubbly helped me choose and she made excellent choices. The jalapeno and andouille sausage calamari appetizer was unbelievably good. I also tried the bacon wrapped scallops - perfect. Everything we ordered was really good, except the dessert. Chocolate creme brulee, not a good choice. The restaurant is BYO. Overall, excellent resturant. I may have to change my view that Princeton restaurants don't cut it. We'll see.
