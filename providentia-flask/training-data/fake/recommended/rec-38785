This is a great place that offers much more than your average coffee shop. Their smoothies are fresh, and delicious, and they have a ton of great brunch/lunch options. Its quick, delicious, and usually a great atmosphere to hang out, study, or catch up with friends. Plenty of veggie/vegan options as well!
