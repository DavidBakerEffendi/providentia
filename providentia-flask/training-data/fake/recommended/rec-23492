GREAT food! Wasn't sure what to expect because a few "authentic" Mexican restaurants in the area aren't so authentic. This is the real deal!! The food is made fresh and you can taste it. We had the tamals and sopes and everything was so delicious!  The owners are also very nice. I am very upset it took me this long to eat here!! Trust me If you want Mexican food in the Bloomfield area go here,  don't waste your time at the other restaurants. We will definitely be back soon!
