The food is always amazing and after a long week all I wanted was a panini to go with my wine on a Friday night. Well, after a few calls, busy tone, being hung up on, and a back and forth with Delivery.com for a half hour, I found out they actually ran out of paninis. Kind of annoyed because I was really in the mood but they still got 4 stars because the food is always good and so is the service...but don't answer and then hang up, just make up some excuse like the kitchen is closed or tell the truth that you ran out of paninis, believe me, I'm sure most of your customers have worked in restaurants and have had their share of moments like this, we will understand that rather than being hung up on. Hopefully I can get my favorite panini at some point next week.
