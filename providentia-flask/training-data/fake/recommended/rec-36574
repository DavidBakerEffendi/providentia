I guess its time for me to finally finish my NYC reviews, here goes: Ippudo is very inviting, it has the smaller feel of a Japanese restraunt, but its actually pretty decent in size. Everything has an ultra modern japanese feel. Something about the L shaped chairs left me puzzled but happy. Also, everytime someone comes in they should something I can't repeat in Japanese (hello how are you perhaps?Welcome?). Foodwise, the Ramen is pretty good, I had the special which happened to be a spicy mix of pork and beef. The Pork belly was delicious, perfectly braised so it melts in your mouth, without too much of the hard fatty texture(don't get me wrong its fatty). Pork buns, on point, never thought I'd get anything better than my Cha-Sew baked bun in Chinatown, I was wrong. Anyhow, highly recommended.
