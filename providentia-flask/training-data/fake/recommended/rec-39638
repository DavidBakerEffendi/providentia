ok so we came here with high expectations given all the awesome yelp reviews especially about the french toast and for me it was a disaster..the french toast was completely drenched in a sauce making it very very... extremely .. soggy!! & I hate soggy bread! yuckyyy!! ..But if your into sogginess then this is your go to brunch french toast!?!?! =/ Â  ummm so why three stars?? because our waitress was soo nice!! & my husband really enjoyed his eggs benedict =D ...sooo I haven't banned this place forever..i'll just stay away from the french toast =(
