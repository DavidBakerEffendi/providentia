Went for a romantic belated christmas/newyears dinner with the girlfriend, based on its high rating here.  We were not disappointed.  I only wish we had been able to sample all the appetizers, because there's so much we did not get to try. The 'dolmathes avgolemono' stuffed grape leaves were the best we'd ever had.  Tender and flavorful, the spices, sauce, and veal really meshed perfectly.   We got the lamb chops and the pecan-crusted bass.  Both entrees were a real treat.  Chops were juicy with just the right amount of char, the fish was equally well prepared.  The vegetable sides with both dishes were especially savory.   The dessert may have stolen the show, though.  We ordered the "napoleon me mousse apo vissino kai yiaourti"  which seems to translate to "Incredibly delicious yogurt-based cherry mousse layered between phyllo crust."  The tartness of the yogurt and cherry really perfectly balanced out the honey and sugar, avoiding entirely the cloying sweetness I usually associate with greek deserts. On top of the great food, the waitstaff was exceedingly polite and attentive.   The atmosphere of the place was relaxed and cozy, very well communicating the whole "rustic greek home cooking meets modern NYC" thing they're going for.  As mentioned, the pot-covered ceiling is a really nice touch and makes the aesthetic pretty unforgettable. Overall, a dining experience I'd definitely repeat, and a place that would be equally appropriate for an intimate date or a special occasion for a group of friends.
