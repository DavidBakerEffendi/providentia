My two friends and I split a 15" pizza with pepperoni, spinach, mushrooms. Total came to be $24, which is pretty ridiculous for a pizza in my opinion. But at least it was good! Sure it was a bit greasy and we had to wait 25 minutes for the custom order, but it seriously hit the spot. Not to mention the fact that each of the six slices are huge. You could easily get away with splitting this pizza between more people to bring the cost down. Or just get one that's pre-made. The location is killer--close enough to theatres that you can grab a slice (yeah, they do slices!) after the curtain calls and far enough away from Times Square that you won't be climbing over people to get there. I will warn you that the restaurant itself has incredibly limited seating so expect to eat outside or get lucky with the bar stools inside.
