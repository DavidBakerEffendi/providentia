I really enjoyed this place. I was very impressed with this place, the service was very good and the server was attentive and friendly. I loved the lobster ravioli I had, I thought it was amazing. The only downside was that it is far too small, I felt like a sardine crammed in a can. I would definitely return but perhaps when it's less busy.
