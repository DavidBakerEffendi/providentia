Lovely room with old world charm. Vienna style coffee and menu offerings are a pleasant break from the average coffee house. Pleasant and attentive staff works hard to keep things humming along. Very popular with young families with very well behaved children. We even picked up the check for a young mom since we were so impressed with the manners of her 2 sons. It can get very noisy when the baristas are banging things around and the kiddies are clambering about, but it's a happy racket and it settles down pretty fast. Bonus points for being such a great jumping off point for a visit to the Gallery. A previous reviewer mentioned a ventilation problem near the windows. We had no issues so it may have been fixed. Â The windows are great for people watching.
