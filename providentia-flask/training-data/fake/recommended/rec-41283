My girlfriend took me out to ilili for dinner this weekend to celebrate my birthday. I've always seen ilili appear on bloggers' lists of go to places for restaurant week but I never did get around to trying it each year. Although we're actually right in the middle of winter restaurant week, we went on Saturday the one day that restaurant week isn't offered and thus ordered off the regular menu like some kind of beautiful, young, rich couple. I've never had Lebanese food before and Mediterranean isn't my specialty either so we ended up simply ordering random things we saw on Yelp reviews and tips. We ordered the Labne and the Moussaka. The Labne, a dip made from strained yougurt, wasn't that great in my opinion. It just tasted like sour cream to me. The Moussaka, an eggplant based spread, was more to my liking with its strong garlicky flavor. My girlfriend preferred the Labne but she never liked vegetables anyway so her opinion is irrelevant =P For our main course we ordered Â the Duck Shawarma and the Lamb Chops. The duck came as a tasty wrap. However the lamb was the clear winner of the night. It was so luscious and perfectly fatty. The only down side of it was that there were only three to the plate and I almost felt bad taking the last one for myself.
