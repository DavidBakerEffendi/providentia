The atmosphere is nice. The service wasn't so great. Apeitizers came out with the main dishes and I had to ask 5 differnt times to get a new drink. I got the chicken lettuce wraps which were pretty good.I also got the french fries which were smothered in horseradish... that was a waste of money and near vomit. On a brighter note, Â they do have good cocktails.
