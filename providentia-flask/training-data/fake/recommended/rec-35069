Two words for you my hungry people - FROZEN CHICKEN. I ordered the Massamun curry and after 1 HOUR of salivating and stomach grumbling my entree came. I took a bite out of the seemingly warm chicken and was shocked to feel ice crystals in my mouth. Yes-  the chicken was indeed frozen. I couldn't believe it. I called the server over and she tried giving me some bull**** excuse saying  "it's because we have to stew the chicken." WTF? She made no sense. When you cook food it should be hot not frozen in the middle. OBVIOUSLY they make and freeze their food the night before then when you sit to order it they warm it up. Why would anyone pay for that? Also, the servers there were inattentive and were selective to whom they gave their service too. When I asked to speak to the owner one server said she wasn't here and another said that the manager is busy and would not speak to you. I complained to the server again about the unacceptable nature of the restaurant and she said "Well then don't come back here." How's that for a 4 star establishment yelpers?
