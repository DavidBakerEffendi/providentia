Super expensive.  We were so excited to come here.  We walked in and it was dark and empty.  Lighting fixtures need to be updated or at least put in a few more lightbulbs in.  It looked organized the chairs and tables but we sat down and it was sticky.  Seems like no one really eats in there but rather take out.  I don't blame them. So here goes the food:  We ordered the ribs and the brisket with sides of candided yams and macaroni and cheese and baked beans.  I'm not dissing the food.  Just how it was prepared.  They must make a whole batch and use it up until it's finished.  It's so disappointing that our brisket and beans were MICROWAVED.  Damn. At least put it on the stove top on a fire.  That was such A TURNOFF.  Not coming back.
