There are very few places in the city where to get good quality food. Though it's a chain restaurant, it offers a vast array of healthy options. I visited this place for brunch today and I truly enjoyed my omlet. I even went nuts on the bread (excluded from my diet for the most part) and the hazelnut spread. Service was not the greatest but it's okay. I'd come back again for brunch.
