This place does not live up to the hype. My double stack burger was tasty, but way too small - I finished it within three minutes of sitting down. The fries were average but nothing special. I had a concrete with cookie dough and banana, which was the best part of the meal. If you want a fast food-style burger, I recommend saving your money and going to Five Guys.
