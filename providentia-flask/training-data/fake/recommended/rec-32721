Excellent all around! Being from the West Coast in LA, I am always searching for good Mexican food from other parts of the US; this place has a flair for the different in all the best ways! From the moment I stumbled upon this place, I was drawn in by the decor of deep blue and stark white walls. The ambiance has a great "local surf side" flavor and the menu is an excellent spin on a Mexican Taqueria. The tacos are fantastic and I highly recommend adding a rice bowl (the curry grilled shrimp is fantastic!) plus the grilled corn side dish, which is teamed with lime, cayenne and cotija cheese. The staff was upbeat and cheerful, the lighting and vibe is perfect and a big thanks to Kevin, the manager, who made it a point to stop by every table and meet & greet his guests! This is a well run establishment!! *last recommendation: the duck taco & sesame ribeye taco!
