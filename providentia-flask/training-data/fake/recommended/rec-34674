One of the most beautiful places for a first date. We had the arepa appetizer to start, delicioso! The churrasco steak is seriously an amazing entree. Get it! To finish off the meal, we had the tasty coconut flan. My god, the service was impeccable too. Our waitress, Charlene was so sweet. Gave us many recommendations. Carlos, one of the managers even stopped by and said hello. He came by later and gave us a lychee martini on the house too. Now that's customer service!! We made it just in time for happy hour and the sangrias were perfecto as well. I'm really getting into going out to more Latin infused restaurants and this place is definitely on the top!! The views baby, the NYC views!! Romantic and sexy! Take note guys, take your girl here! I was truly impressed and I will definitely go back out on a date with this guy!
