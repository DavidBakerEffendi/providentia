If you're in New Haven, you have to go to Pepe's right? At least that's what I was told!!!  I stopped in one night while traveling on business. Waited for a short while for a table, but not too long. Once seated it took a while before I got a server. She was friendly as a New England'er can be and helpful for the new guy as well. I got me some beer on draught and a pie on the way! I got a small pie wit mozz. Half  Pepperoni, half bacon, onions, and peppers. The Pepp have was great!!!!  The other half.. not so much. Bacon was raw. Like... Really raw. I think it might be my doing though by ordering a half/half pie. The pepp half was cooked perfectly and I couldn't ask for anything better. My beer ran dry twice and it always took along time to get another. That and the raw bacon is what knocks Pepe down a bit. I'm looking forward to trying out the other pizza joints in New Haven!!!
