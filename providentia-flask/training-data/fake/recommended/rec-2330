This was the first stop in my cheese steak tour of Philly (Pat's-Geno's-Jim's in one night).  I made the mistake of fumbling my order and got called out by the cashier.  Maybe I over-prepared for the moment.  But the ribbing was in good fun - just part of the experience.   The cheese steak with wiz was delicious.  It's easy to see why this place spawned so many imitators.  As good as it was though, I'd have to rank it 2nd on the list to Jim's that night.  But if you're actually on Passyunk deciding between Pat's and Geno's - go to Pat's.  Geno's comes a distant 3rd - not even close.
