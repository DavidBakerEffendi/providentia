More like 0 stars UGH SCARRED FOR LIFE. This place is probably cool, at least it looked cool when we walked in on Saturday night. BUT THEN we walked further in and saw a girl giving a guy a lap dance on the right and a bunch of girls strip dancing for a group of guys in the back... Ain't even writing more details. IT WAS SO WEIRD WHY WAS THIS HAPPENING AT A BAR. Bye, Felicia.
