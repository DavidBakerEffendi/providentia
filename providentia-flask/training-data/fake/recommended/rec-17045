I was introduced to Ethiopian food about 15 years ago and I had it both here and in Ethiopia. Now, I am NOT saying that I am A expert on Ethiopian food, but I believe I've had my fair share of both home cooked and restaurant prepared dishes. So that being said I know what I like. Now, after several visits to Walia I can say that the food is consistently good and the service is always great. If you want to try something new and never had it give Walia a shot. Yes, I know this is the moment you been waiting for, I give Walia five and a half bow ties out of 7.
