If zero stars were an option, I'd be there. Dry, tasteless meat - 3 little pieces with rude service to top it off. I was prepared and almost relished the idea of the typical Philly experience, until they gave me five sandwiches for my group, when I ordered four, which totaled $42.50 USD. Keep in mind this doesn't include your drinks or fries...that's another line! We didn't even realize that they had charged and given us five sandwiches because the staff were screaming at one another. Was a sad experience and I would NEVER recommend going here. DRY Cardboard is the best way I could describe this sandwich. Save you money and time. There was a 30 minute wait. We had wanted to try Pat's but his line was more like an hour. Either way, I'd save yourself the trouble and just graze through Reading Terminal. South Street has some wonderful choices as well. The Italian market area near Pats/Genos was the best and that's certainly worth a visit but forget about the worst Cheesesteak ever...just forget about it.
