Now, I can not say this is one of the best slices in New York because it is in a separate category. Being a pizza purist I believe the best slice is reserved for plain cheese pizza. That being said, the artichoke and spinach is the best "pizza specialty" slice in NYC. At the first bite it tastes like an angel came in my mouth. You may think the $4.50 is a little pricey but one slice will fill you up for hours. Being a fat glutinous slob, its hard to stay awaty from this place when I'm cruising 14th St. for tranny prostitutes....J.K. wink wink ;) Oh, and did I mention they have giant seport/jeremys cups of beer for $5.50!! Go during off hours to avoid lines.
