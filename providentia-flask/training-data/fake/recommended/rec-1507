I dig Max's all the way! My first real Philly cheese steak and i was not disappointed! The place has a real humble and welcoming vibe to it. You walk in you make your order and you wait a couple minutes if the crowd is thick! The best parts of Max's to me was the fact you could get a 40 oz Malt Liquor with your order and the attached full bar attached to it! A true one stop shop! If you're into that sort of thing! Â If its cold out this is a great place to go as well where they have indoor seating! P.S. This place is waaaaaaayyyyyy better and cheaper than the tourist trap that is Geno's. However I preferred Pat's over Max's, but Max's is still a great choice!
