Everything here was perfect.  My fiance and I are never in this neighborhood but we were driving back from Jacob Riis Beach and thought we should take advantage of being out in Brooklyn so voila, we found this place on Yelp and we were so so happy.  We feel very accomplished when we eat a good meal-- does anyone else? We started off with a cocktail and a beer.  The cocktail was great-- fresh with mint, not sugary at all and a good amount of alcohol. We ordered the roasted peppers with burrata cheese. YUM!  The peppers were so sweet and I loved the grilled taste of them.  Just a slight suggestion: take off the skin! Otherwise, an excellent start to our meal. We got two pizzas: one with artichoke and prosciutto and a margherita pizza with fresh basil.  Both were delicious.  This pizza is a doughier type of pizza.  It's like how Roberta makes theirs, and although I like Roberta's pizza better, this is very comparable.  The vegetables and the toppings on the pizza were so fresh and full of flavor.  Pizza is a 4 or 4.5 but the review gets a 5 because of the whole experience and the appetizer! The server was sweet and calming.  Again, the whole experience here was perfect.  We also sat outside in the back, which was really nice at the end of a day at the beach.  I'd go back again if I didn't live so far. Wish I lived closer!
