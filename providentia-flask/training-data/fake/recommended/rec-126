Ive known nick for many years, and now that he owns his own sub shop he did not dissapoint! Besides being very easy on my eyes, he took extreme care of making my very picky order and making it perfect. Brought home subs for my brother and his girlfriend and all 3 of us were beyond pleased with our food. Nick is a great guy, smells unbelivable, and will continue to recieve my business. Thanks hoagie nick!
