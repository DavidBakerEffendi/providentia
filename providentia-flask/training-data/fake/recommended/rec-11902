It was our first experience at Northern Spy, and probably the last and only one. Food is good, but service and management is one of the poorest I've ever seen. Besides, consider prices - not cheap at all. We started with flatbread with caramelized onions and a Maine crab cake. We paired the starters with 2 glasses of cabernet. At that moment, everything seem to be perfect. Then, the entrees. My girlfriend asked for meatballs and I asked for braised lamb. Dishes arrived and meatballs weren't hot enough. We returned them. If this has happened to you, it is one of the worst things that may ever happen in a restaurant. Fortunatelly, I'm used to share food with my girlfriend and we started to eat the lamb- imagine if you're on a romantic date or just on an ordinary dinner, but without the confort to share. Definitely, it could have been worse than it was for me. After 15 minutes we received the meatballs back and ate them. They were decent. Finally, we decided to ask for the check. No desert - but maybe we were waiting for a compensation that did not arrive. We paid and I approached the woman that seemed to be over waiters and defined herself as "the manager." I told her that we were disappointed and that when things like the one with meatballs happen, customers in New York are waiting for something else than an apology. She answered me in a very arrogant way that the fact that a dish was not warm enough is not that strange, and that if we had asked for a desert they would have discounted it. I told her that Â when I go to a restaurant I usually expect to dine at least as good as at home, and that such a philosophy towards their clients would ruin their business - the owner should be very worried to have a manager like her.
