I don't have much experience with Malaysian food, but I found the food here to be good, but not great. The service was not so great. We came in on a Friday night around 8:45.  We were seated quite quickly. The various waiters kept stopping by pretty much every minute expecting us to be ready to order-- we kept having to tell them we needed more time.  It really felt like they were trying to rush us out throughout the meal.  Also, when we were paying one of the waitresses knocked over a glass of water on to me (and partly on my friend) and rather than getting me napkins or a towel to wipe up, she was like, oh go dry yourself under the hand dryer in the bathroom (not so useful for drying jeans). I tried the Roti Canai (vegetarian), Mango Tofu, and Thai Basil Noodles.  The Roti Canai was good, though I wished the bread had been cooked a bit more-- it was juuuust undercooked in spots.  Mango Tofu was quite nice, with underripe mango providing a nice tangy contrast to the sweet sauce it was in.  The Tofu was cooked well but could have been more flavorful.  The Thai Basil Noodles were only OK- this was the waitress's recommendation for the best vegetarian noodle dish, she said it would be spicy.  I found it rather bland, unfortunately-- I was expecting something like Drunken Noodles, which is basically what it was, but just less good than your average Drunken Noodles.  One of my friends had a noodle dish with chicken at the waitress's recommendation (don't remember the name), which came out looking basically like Pad Thai with thinner rice noodles.  She said it was good. It's BYO, so don't forget to bring drinks with you, as we did!  The nearby liquor store closes at 9 PM.
