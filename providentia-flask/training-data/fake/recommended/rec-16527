So I was in LA a few months ago where my friend introduced me to Umami Burger. I thought, "This would be a great a idea in NYC!" Lo & behold, 3 months later, I read an Umami Burger is opening up in West Village! I went on a Saturday night around 8PM and the wait was over an hour, not that surprising. We opted to sit at the bar where the wait was only 15 minutes, woo! Each Umami had a signature burger and the one in NYC is the duck burger. We opted not to try it this time and went for classic truffle burgers. They were just as awesome as the ones I had in LA! I'm guilty of slathering most of my burgers with ketchup and mustard - with these burgers it would honestly be a disgrace to put anything else on them! We also had the truffle fries and potato hush puppies. The fries were okay - could have done without the potato hush puppies though. They also have a great beer selection! Highly recommend this place and really hope they open up some more locations soon!
