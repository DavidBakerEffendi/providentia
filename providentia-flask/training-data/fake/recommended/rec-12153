I went for a birthday dinner and enjoyed my experience, yet wasn't completely satisified. As the waiter explained: the plates at JG are meant for sharing, they aren't small plates, like tapas, but they aren't overly portioned either. What he meant to say is: We do small plates, bring them out in pairs or one by one, whenever the kitchen finishes, so you're forced to share. We don't do family style portions so be prepared to pay a lot for enough food for hungry bellies. I can see how that concept may be cool for someone with a big wallet but it was slightly uncomfortable when we had ordered seperate things but when each plate came out one by one, very slowly, we didn't want to to wait until everyone had their food so ended up splitting everything. Food was good - but not GREAT. I'd pick Garces Trading Co. over JG any day.
