Yay Brooklyn Proper! This place is super adorable and charming with delicious cocktails! It's amaZing for a girls night out or a sweet date night. :) The staff are so nice and obviously seem really invested in the neighborhood and the food. Everything is sourced locally and is really fresh and tasty. :) Definitely recommend.
