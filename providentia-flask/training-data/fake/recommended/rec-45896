Byblos offers delicious, authentic Lebanese food at an incredibly affordable price.  Their falafel is actually the best falafel I have ever tasted.   For $7, the falafel platter comes with enough food for dinner and lunch the following day.  I almost always eat it all at once though, even when I am full halfway through, simply because it tastes THAT good.  Dishes that I eat all the time taste surprisingly unique at Byblos.  This is a testament to how much thought goes into the cuisine at Byblos.  Even hummus, a staple in my vegan diet, tastes special there.  Though I have not tried any of their meat dishes, my friends have all raved about them. I live just a few blocks away from Byblos, and I now frequent the restaurant multiple times each week.  It is a family owned spot, and so the atmosphere is very cozy.  No, the decor is not fancy.  But the place is spacious and comfortable.  It is also BYOB. Throughout the week I usually order takeout from Byblos, but I also love coming by some nights with friends and a bottle of wine.  Sometimes the owner gives us complimentary baklava at the end of the meal.   In sum, Byblos is a much-needed breath of fresh air in  the Ironbound.  The food is DELICIOUS, the prices are affordable, and the atmosphere is very comfortable.  The place has helped to make the Ironbound feel like home to me.  I strongly recommend Byblos to anyone looking for affordable, authentic food, either for takeout or dine-in.
