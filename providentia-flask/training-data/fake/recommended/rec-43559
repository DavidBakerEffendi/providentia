I love boqueria. The waiter recommend a cheese that was to die for and we also got the tabla de embutidos. All so amazing which came with olives and bread. The garlicky shrimp was also quite spectacular and comes in a sizzling plate with a side of bread. My least favorite was the tortilla espanola but everything else was so great that it was easily forgotten.
