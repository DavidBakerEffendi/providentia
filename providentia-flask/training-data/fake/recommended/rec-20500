I pass a number of Caribbean restaurants on my way to Munchie's. In my opinion, none of them can even compare despite their convenience. Munchies is the real thing! I've tried their jerk chicken, stew chicken, and curry goat - Â all were amazing. I am now a weekly patron of this establishment. Munchie is a doll :) I look forward to trying more menu options. Actually, I think I may have Munchie's for dinner!!!
