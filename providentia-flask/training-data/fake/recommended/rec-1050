If I wanted shoe-leather steak, casual racism and the threat of violence, I would just go to my grandmother's house. This place is mediocre, at best. The best cheesesteak in Philly is at the Subway restaurant at Spring Garden and Broad. This is the original. Get it with American cheese and extra mustard (NICK CANNON STYLE, BAYBAY). Tell the sandwich artist he is a "buttlicker" and cry in your Honda Civic for three hours. That's the type of authenticity that someone like old Geno could never understand. That being said, I steal all of my cheese whiz from here which is why I am giving it a five star rating. I must have 9 or 10 gallon jugs of the stuff in the back of the Civ' right now. I put it on everything: eggs, toast, more cheese whiz, a court order for arrest, filet mignon, cronuts, you name it. This is the reason to come to Geno's: petty theft and the worst sushi platter you have ever had in your life.
