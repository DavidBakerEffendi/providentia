Not the best place in the area for a good pizza. The food is mediocre and the service can be painfully slow depending on the night. Unfortunately, there aren't many choices in the area for a pizza with a liquor license so we go there from time to time. If Star Tavern was in Cedar Grove, Lombardi's would have a tough time surviving.
