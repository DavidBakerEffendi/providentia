How many 5 star reviews does this place need! I don't care where I am, if I'm in the mood for Gyro, I'm coming here or not eating Gyro. With the exception of being at the Jersey Shore, there's a decent place on 37. I go to this cart waaaay too many times in a year. I don't check in all the time either or it would b ridiculous.
