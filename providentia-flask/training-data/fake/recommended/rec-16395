I came here a couple of months ago with the BF and a couple of friends. We decided to check it out after reading good reviews about it on Yelp and also since the menu looked pretty good. Since it was still summer time when we had gone, we chose to sit in the backyard. It was nicely decorated and felt very rustic and cozy. Several Yelpers had mentioned this before, and I'll have to mention it as well: the bread is phenomenal. It comes in a little terra cotta flower pot and is served in quarters. We all enjoyed our meals, though I did wish the portions were slightly bigger considering their price. I would like to check this place out for brunch one day and I would love to check it out perhaps during the winter as the menu seems to change seasonly. Cute restaurant, good service, and very tasty food.
