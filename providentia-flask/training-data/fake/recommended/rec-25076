I stopped in last weekend on my way to book club because I wanted some macaroons... And also I definitely didn't want to show up empty handed because I didn't finish the book. (Hey! Who are you calling a slacker?! I've been bussssyyyy) The macaroons are 1.50 each. They were almost out of stock when I got there in the afternoon.  So, i did it up and awkwardly scurried away when the guy behind me asked for macaroons. Sooorrrryyyy. There were a number of other tasty looking baked good though, so it's all good. I'm totes wanting to go back for crepes. I also really like that La Petite  France had an unhurried vibe that seems elusive these days in WeHa where people drive through the Whole Foods parking lot like it's the Indy 500.
