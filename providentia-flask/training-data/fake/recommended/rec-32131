I came here for lunch a few months ago, and the staff had clearly just arrived... the restaurant was freezing (this was January). Since they were just setting up everything took quite a while, and my sushi was incredibly bad-- the fish was dry, limp, discolored, and old tasting and the rice was definitely from the day before.
