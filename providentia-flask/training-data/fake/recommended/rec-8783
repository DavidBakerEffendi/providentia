Only great food can make me forgive a 1hr wait to be seated It was meant to be for me to end up here and I'm glad I did. The kitchen at SOB's was closed and the other restaurant we just couldn't find. After walking past the red awning with no writing 3 times we figured this had to be the place and it was. It place was packed! Small intimate location but still very friendly and nice. I noticed the manager walking around and touched every table to make sure everyone was ok. Half an hr came and it looked like no one wanted to face the rain outside. 4glasses of wine later we finally were able to get a seat. We had the sautéed calamari for starters and it was pleasantly delightful. I thought The Shrimp Provençal was delicious. I actually ordered the Sweet and Spicy Catfish but I switched plates because my date didn't like the spinach. The ravioli really tasted great. But I agree a little less spinach would have been perfect. The Catfish was a perfect 10. Mash potatoes were creamy and rich the flavor of the catfish and the seasonings all blended perfectly together. This is absolutely something I recommend. I do think they need a few more $$$ though the cocktails for $15 bucks were only required 3 sips!   Overall great first trip I actually want to give this place 4 1/2 stars. Good all around
