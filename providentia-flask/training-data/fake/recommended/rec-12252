Quintessential Chinatown stop. Why I like this place.. well first the Chinese guys don't like to smile which ads to the vibe. The main guy is a sexy older dark haired guy with attitude.. and his main assistant coming back and forth from inside the place has cool hair. This group could easily be extras in a Bruce Lee movie. Inside its older, dingy, tables, etc. Ducks hanging upside down in the windows. Preparing food right in the window, and ringing up at the counter right in the front. Dining past the front part. Plain tables etc. What I ordered:  Wonton soup, egg rolls and duck. I have to say I tore into that duck with my good friend in the car. It was soooo good.. and really fun eating.  Wonton soup chopped diced shrimp and pork.. light and full of flavor but lots of them. They don't have fresh duck sauce for the egg rolls. I like when its homemade and sweeter.. The packaged stuff is not the same. But they had a dark salty brown sauce for the duck that was perfect. This is really 4 1/2 stars... but 5 would be pushing it for the ambiance / etc. Worth returning to despite all the choices.
