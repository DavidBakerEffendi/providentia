We went to Burlington for vacation, after walking up and down the church street we settle on Sweetwaters cause it seems to be a place where we all can agree to sit down and eat. I got the edamame salad with grilled chicken. I was pleasantly surprise. Grilled chicken was a little bland but the soba noodle and greens, really a good healthy combination.(protein, carb and fat). Dressing is yummy. I asked them to put it on the side and don't use much of them since the salad itself already yummy
