Well I mentioned this one in my review of Somerset so I had to review it... to say that it reminds me of a casino... with the loosest sluts/slots in town. A stupid joke I've been making for years. YEARS. Can't give up the ghost, apparently. ;) This was (and may still be) the cleanest diner I've ever been in. Â I seem to recall it serving alcohol, but it's been ages since I've been. Good pancakes, though.
