Went last night for my wife's 30th Bday. The place aesthetically is nice however, the service was extremely slow. Â They didn't have any steak left.. Their bread was the best part of my meal. My wife and family members was disappointed with their meals and the long wait we had to endure between appetizers, salad and entree.. Overall, totally disappointed and I probably won't try it again.
