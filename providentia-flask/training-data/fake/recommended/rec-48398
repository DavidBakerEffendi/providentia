I'd first heard of The Double Windsor because of their "no babies after 5:30pm" rule.  Yes, they had me there.  I live 7 avenue blocks from The Double Windsor and I already felt this could be a bar for me.   Secondly, they fried Robicelli's Car Bomb cupcakes on St. Patrick's day.   Come on now, you want to go right now don't you.  When you get there, make sure you look good and hard at their amazing selection of beers.  Helpfully, they are all labeled as to their alcohol percentage.  Their happy hour is $3 wells and $2 off taps. With big open windows, the people watching is pretty superlative, not to mention that their roasted veggie sandwich is out of control good.  I've been dreaming of eating only that since I was last there.  My husband had the burger and fries and said it was a masterpiece as well.   I did not notice the aloofness of the bartenders as some other people noted, but I guess after having hit some of the other bars in Pk Slope if the bartender acknowledges me and doesn't spit in my drink, I'm totally cool with them.  Also, we talked a bit with one of the owners, who was very friendly and seemed genuinely glad that we want to share our experience at The Double Windsor with him.   I think that if you like great beer, a nice atmosphere and some better than average pub-grub you should certainly give this bar a shot.
