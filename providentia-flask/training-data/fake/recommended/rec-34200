French, African? Sounds amazing. This place has been on my 'to try' list for the longest time.  We were looking for brunch spots in the area and Ponty Bistro was an option, so I steered the girls over to try it out. The menu looked pretty standard for a brunch menu. I immediately started with a bloody mary and was served an anemic cousin that was naked and undrinkable, even after my sinusitis has depreciated my sense of taste. I ordered the bruchetta [sic]  with eggs, goat cheese and pesto and was served scrambled eggs on top of a buttered baguette with a drizzle of pesto sauce. The home fries were soggy. A friend with high cholesterol unsuccessfully tried to order her salmon benedict without yolk, but the got frustrated and just ordered it sans egg. I hear the lobster benedict was good, though.   The kicker was, as soon as we were finishing up, the table next to us got a beautiful, healthy looking bloody mary... The 2 stars are for the service, though. Aside from the egg yolk fiasco, the servers were so attentive and quick, but I don't think I'd ever go back for the brunch.
