I came by Reading Terminal Market for breakfast the other day and could not help but gawk at the preparation of all the pork shoulders that would later become a pork sandwich. Had the chopped pork sandwich with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe. Incredible. I hope that I was not drooling excessively as I waited for my sandwich but I fear that it may have happened. The bread was perfect and the mix of pork, cheese, and rabe was delicious. I look forward to trying DiNic's again the next time I visit Philadelphia.
