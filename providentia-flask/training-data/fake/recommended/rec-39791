yay! fries make me happy! the dips are genius concoctions..pesto mayo, pomegranate teriyaki, mango chutney, etc...my only complaint is that I can never muster the courage to order more than 3 dips at a time...I'm afraid someone will jump out from behind the counter and call me a heffer...just saying. Definitely a good place to go to satisfy the late night beer infused hunger.
