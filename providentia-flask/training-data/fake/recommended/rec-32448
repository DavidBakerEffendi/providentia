Feng has a trendy, upscale look and feel.I got the sushi (nigiri) and sashimi combo and found it excellent. Feng has the best cuts of sashimi anywhere in CT. These types of combos typically come with a salad and miso soup at other sushi places, Feng's exclusion of these peices is offset by the inclusion of a delicious spicy tuna roll. Including tip and without getting a drink this meal will run you close to $40, but if you're looking for fresh, flavorful, quality sushi, I'm not sure what I could recommend over Feng.
