Grape and Grain is a cute space located in the heart of Alphabet City. The restaurant is super small, and there are only a few tables and seats at the bar, so great for a date or dining with a friend or two but not for a large party. Extensive wine list and staff is knowledgeable about wine without being insufferable/ Plenty of sandwiches, homemade pizzas and small plates. White bean dip is a must, meatballs were so so. Service is hit or miss - sometimes it is very enthusiastic but on occasion Ive had to go to the bar to flag server down.
