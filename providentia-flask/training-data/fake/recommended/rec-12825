I've been here twice and both times did not disappoint!  Although I honestly had no idea what I was actually ordering (I'm not much of a foodie so didn't understand most of the menu), the food was delicious and had the most unique combinations.  I also liked the portions as I managed to clean my plate and feel satisfied rather than competely stuffed.
