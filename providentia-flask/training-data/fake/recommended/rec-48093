Traveled to the smith from Brooklyn because usually it's delicious. I took a seat at the bar. And sat. And sat. And sat. Now, I'm a bartender so I understand being busy, however there was no one besides me at the bar. Sitting. After over 10 minutes without acknowledgement I left. On my way out I inquired about the service to which the manager replied "oh yeah we usually have a bartender but she's out sick". It would have been nice to know before I wasted my time not only traveling to, but sitting at the smith waiting.
