Decided to try this place out for brunch since they had good reviews and was not disappointed. The scramble was delicious - so many nice veggies in it. Â The potatoes were nicely seasoned and the cornbread just right. Service was great. Attentive servers who asked before refilling our coffees and the food came out pretty quick despite the restaurant being busy. I will definitely come back again!
