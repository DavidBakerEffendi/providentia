Love this place. Been visiting here at least twice a week for the last 6 months and was never disappointed - great food, excellent service, better prices in comparison to the competition in downtown. Can work great for the kids- the food is served super fast... Other small joys of life- huge free parking, getting a table is never a problem, long working hours...
