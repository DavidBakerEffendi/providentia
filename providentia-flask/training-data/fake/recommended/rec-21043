Pork buns! Pork buns! Pork buns! One of the best I've ever had and definitely a must-try! Ani Ramen is a cool, Â fun spot for some great ramen. We tried a bunch of the appetizers and all were delicious. The space is fun and relaxed, and the waiters are helpful and very nice. Will definitely be back in the upcoming winter months!
