Sunday funday dinner review. Let's roll. We checked in a minute to 8 and were informed of a 15 minute wait time for a party of 3. They were on the dot with their estimation and seated us snugly near the rear of the shop. Food prices were fair and the group wasn't in a voracious mood for the evening so we stuck to 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 bowls of rice (white and chicken broth). Opting for that good ol' family style. The roti canai as everyone and their ancestors before me have raved of was delicious. Crispy fried roti with a smooth chicken curry dip. Capital A for amazing. Tough act to follow but the two entrees held their own. The Chow Kueh Teow (first dish of the fried noodle menu) was advertised spicy but I experienced no kick. Or at least it was minute enough that it went over my head. The Hainanese chicken must've been Aladdin in disguise though, cause it showed me a whole new world. Finger-snappin, lip-smackin, delicious. Best of 3 Malaysian restaurants I've tried within the past 2 months. A must-try if you're in the neighborhood (or even if you're not). As a tip, if you want to avoid the dinner rush, the wait time nearing 9pm is practically none. I'll definitely be back for more!
