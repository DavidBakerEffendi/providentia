First of all - the food was delicious.  Everything I ordered was wonderful.  I am vegetarian and there was an entire separate menu available.  But be sure to ask for it - it was not presented with the cocktail and regular dinner menu.  Second of all - the service was excellent as well.  Friendly, not snobby.  They did not rush us nor were they overly present.  Yet our water glasses were always full.  Nice ambiance too.  We went on a Monday night at 7:30 and didn't have to wait for a table.
