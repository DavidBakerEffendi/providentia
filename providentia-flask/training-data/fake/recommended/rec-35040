Hit up Pat Thai during my lunch break.  Called in and ordered, got there in 10 minutes and it was ready to go.  Place was empty, it's hidden from the road back behind the grocery store.  Not too shabby inside, looks like it's been there a long time.  $15 minimum on cards, keep that in mind. I order the Pat Phuk (got some wild looks from my cube-mates when I placed the order).  I was looking for something to Pad See Ew, but this wasn't it.  It was a good portion, chicken w/ veggies served over rice.  Came with a veggie soup and I added a spring roll.  Damn good stuff.  All under 11 bucks I'd go back, but just for lunch break
