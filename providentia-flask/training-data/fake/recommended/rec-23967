A great new bar restaurant right across from Independence Hall,  our Founding Fathers would have been proud.  The food was excellent.  Service and decor also very nice.  Craft beer selection seems decent enough, however I always believe more beers should be available on tap.  A bit pricy, but it is center city.  Overall a great place that I would def return to,  cheers!
