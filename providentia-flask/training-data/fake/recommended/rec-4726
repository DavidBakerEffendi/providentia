Brooklyn pie is mighty fine.... probably better fresh then reheated.  Plain has a nice crunch to the crust which I like though my daughter did not like me trying it :D  For the sake of  yelp, I had to!   Hey folks, it's pizza not miracles.  The pizza was really good and worth it in the need of a few quick slices
