This is kind of our go to place when we don't know where else to go.  They always have a good selection of wines to go with their cheeses and paninis.  The service is very friendly and is able to make good recommendations upon request.  The decor is fun and kind of funky, it's really great in warm weather because the back patio is really nice.  Head here if you're in the mood for cheese and bread.
