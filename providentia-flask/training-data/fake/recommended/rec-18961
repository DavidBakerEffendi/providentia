Honestly, I can't believe we didn't know about this place before. Really. La Tarte Flambee has downright mouth-wateringly delicious "tartes" (Alsatian "pizza-type" specialities with light crunchy crusts and the most creamy flavorful "creme fraiche" (or what passes for it in the United States) in New York City). They also have killer brunch fare, including Parisian-brioche-esque French toast and eggs benedict creations served with, for example, yummy leeks, potato pancakes, and a "maison" hollandaise sauce that makes your taste buds smile. They also offer an expansive French beer and wine selection, that enamored my inner Francophile. Lastly, they feature impishly provocative poster artwork on the wall along with Asterix comic books for general reading delight. French foodie heaven. This has become our new haunt!
