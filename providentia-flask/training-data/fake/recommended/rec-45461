Been going for years, it's a safe place to get a good sandwich, breakfast or lunch.  Nice people, reliable food.  Best egg sandwich around, for sure, especially if you're talking value for $$.  This is a sandwich shop, not necessarily where you're going to buy your cold cuts by the pound, although I think they do that too.
