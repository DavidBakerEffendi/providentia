I don't get it. I don't mind the noise level, or the lighting, and quite frankly I think the space is among the most beautiful in the city.   The sangrias are consistently tasty, and I like the bar. But the lines/wait are always long, and the staff is always kind of snooty in that false warmth sort of way.  I've eaten there twice now, and frankly, I've been super underwhelmed by the food both times, especially at that price point.  On my first visit in the summer of '06, a friend and I ordered the chef's tasting menu, which was a deluge of salty after salty - I honestly started laughing when they brought out a dish of olives because I just couldn't take any more; it was almost a relief when they served the incredibly bland tortilla because at least it was a different flavor.   This visit was enough to deter me from tapas as a concept for a while (sad, I know). My second visit, this summer a friend and I sat at the bar and ordered a few small plates.  I tried to wipe the slate clean - I hadn't been there in a few years - but I still found the food to be a curious balance between overly salty and bland.  Yes, even the famous shortrib flatbread... am I the only one who finds it too salty?? Sadly the only mind-blowing experience I've ever had at a Garces restaurant was at Village Whiskey.  Now THAT's a nice little hang-out!
