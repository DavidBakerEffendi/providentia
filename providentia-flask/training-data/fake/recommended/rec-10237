Corner Bistro is often mentioned as one of the places offering NYC's best burger. After hearing its accolades time after time, I had to make a visit, of course - and with a good friend in tow, we dropped by after work one evening to see what this West Village bar could offer. Corner Bistro is your traditional dive bar, sporting a tiny entrance on the corner of West 4th Street. It's not particularly large, and both the bar and the scattered tables and seats across the room show plenty of years of history. The two of us grabbed seats at the bar, and were greeted by the bartender, who was friendly enough to go over some of the menu items. The food options are displayed on a small sign next to the kitchen, and the two of us decided to split an order of fries as well as our own hamburgers. The fries came first, a small pile of them on a white plastic plate. To say that they weren't particularly impressive might be too generous, as they pretty much resembled and tasted like McDonald's fries; at $3 for a small handful, they weren't worth the order. They were, at least, steaming hot and still enjoyable with a generous serving of ketchup. The burgers at Corner Bistro are made with a mixture of chuck, sirloin, and top round and are broiled in a modified salamander. We were served a thick patty, accompanied by onions, lettuce, pickles, and a tomato slice. The height of this burger made it rather challenging to bite into, but as per Allison, "Just flatten it down and eat it". Initial impressions aside, the patty was definitely a disappointment; the meat was dry and underseasoned and paired with a too-flimsy bum that wasn't able to offer much support, it was a burger that left us puzzled at the many praises it had received. I suppose that for the nights when all you need is some bar food and a drink, Corner Bistro will do. But for the time being, I can say that there are plenty of better burgers to be found in NYC.
