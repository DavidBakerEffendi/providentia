Outstanding. THE BEST pork chops I have ever eaten! Sides are all excellent. Dirty Rice....COME ON!....the best dirty rice anywhere north of the Mason-Dixon line. Bourbon pecan cake was awesome! One minor complaint....sweet tea was way too sweet and I'm a sweet tea drinker from way back....I did get it at the end of the night and maybe got the bottom of the jug. I'll try it again next time! The couple that own the place are great. I wish them the best with their fantastic restaurant. Can't wait to go back.
