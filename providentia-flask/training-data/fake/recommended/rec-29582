Came in here over the weekend since I saw a few good yelps. Ordered the Fettuccine Bolognese and was not impressed. For starters, the service is less than mediocre. It's okay to not be Italian if you are serving, but seriously, at least learn your menu, and accommodate your customer. We asked for a large soup, so that we could share, the very dismissive Ecuadorian server quickly told us no, it cannot be shared, and that the soups are only served in one large bowl. Little does he know that pasta faccioli soup can indeed be shared, and it's best served in a smaller bowl. While we waited for our food, after 50 minutes it arrives, only to see that fettuccine alla bolognese, was served in a medium dark brown sauce and not the traditional red. The meat was undercooked and the taste of this plate was simply gross. It was almost like seeing one of those most unrepresentable beef stroganoff that you can buy in a box at your nearest super market. I was really disappointed, server not once came by to the table to offer anything further. The customer service was not there, however, the owner was, yet not checking on his customers as he should. I give it 1 start for the location, needs lots of work, perhaps it works for those who do not know Italian.
