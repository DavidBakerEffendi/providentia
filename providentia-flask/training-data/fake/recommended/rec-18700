Stopping in to sample some of the appetizers they were all quite good and the place was more enjoyable than expected.   The Macaroni and Cheese was very rich without being overly cheesy, thank the truffle oil.   The wings were good and the pineapple sauce is an interesting little enhancement.   The sangria was also quite savory and conspiciously they had led zeppelin on the entire time and it never seemed off.  Wouldn't mind trying their entrees one day.
