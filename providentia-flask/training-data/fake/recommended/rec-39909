I went to brunch at the pig for the first time last weekend.  I know everyone is ultra-focused on the burgers there, and with good reason, since they're so good, but a lot of people don't realize that their brunch menu is outstanding too.  The blueberry pancakes with creme fraiche are absolutely amazing, and the frittata is delicious.  I think I'll have dreams about the chicken liver toast.   Also, it was no problem getting a table there on a Sunday morning, not like it is in the evenings.
