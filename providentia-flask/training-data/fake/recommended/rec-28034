Stopped in for a team-lunch. Very nice restaurant located in Hell's Kitchen area a couple blocks up from Javitts center. I tried the cheese pizza and also the linguine with clams. It was delicious! Service was very fast and attentive. The portions are big for lunch. I'd recommend sharing. We even got a nice personal greeting from the owner. Food is average price for what you get in Manhattan.
