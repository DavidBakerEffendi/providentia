We were seated even without our full party of four being there (I absolutely hate places that don't seat me...I have a reservation for pete's sake, I'm going to order a drink right away... I've never understood this practice other than it saves the hostess/host from making more than one trip...it inconveniences the customer, clogs up the restaurant's front door, and it loses a customer for life...me!). Our waiter was fine, a little distracted maybe, but answered all of our questions. The Fried Hominy Snack...well let's face it, anything fried is good...they're marble sized crispy balls, and if they had given me a bowl of a million of them, I would have eaten them all. The Pheasant Taquito was good too. I split the Shaved Salad (which they split in the kitchen and brought us each our own plate, which I liked both the salad which tasted like it was made with very fresh ingredients, and the servIng of it). As for the main dish, I should have ordered the fish special, which one of my friends did and I tasted, very very good. I ordered the Pork T-Bone which was totally taste free. However, do get the Cookshop Candy Bars for dessert....it's what a Good Humor Eclair bar dreams to be...
