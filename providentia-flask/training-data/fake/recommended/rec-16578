Whenever my dad is in town, we go to the Meatball Shop. I prefer the Smash sandwiches to the sliders. They have a great veggie meatball, which I appreciate, and I like their spicy tomato sauce which is actually spicy. However, my favorite item on the menu is the ice cream sandwich you can build for dessert. I always save room for one (they are ginormous). I like the Caramel ice cream sandwiched by two Snickerdoodle cookies. Yummy!
