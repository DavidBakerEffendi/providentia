This place is either my first or my last stop in Philly.  So far, I have tried their 1) Tendon 2) Oxtail 3) Beef Brisket - all in shaved noodle soup.  While "hand drawn noodle" is in its name, I have yet to try it.  I simply ordered the shaved noodle the first time and can't fall out of love with it.  The shaved noodle is fresh, with a good balance between dough-y and chew-y.  All noodle soup comes with pickled vegetable and cilantro.  Broth is aromatic, noodle is delicious, and there's always plenty of meat.  I only wish they do combo - I get a little bored eating the same meat in one bowl.  Next time, I will try their hand drawn noodle - and maybe an appetizer or two.  I am usually too full from their noodle soup.
