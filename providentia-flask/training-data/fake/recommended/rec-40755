I guess my silly lil friend Dwayne was already missing his Nawlins soul food, as he only been living here a week and wanted some chicken and waffles. I agreed as we were right across the street and I'm super lazy. Â  Thank goodness we got a seat as soon as we walked in, as I started to get dizzy from the walk across the street. I love all the non alcoholic drinks they have!!! I'm super excited to go back and see what other fizzy sugar water I can sip on while gazing into the fake fish tank they have on the tiny tables :) I also order carrot soup, I know sounds horrid, but it was the most amazing soup i ever had.
