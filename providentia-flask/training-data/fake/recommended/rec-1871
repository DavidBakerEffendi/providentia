My friend and his roommate [ny locals] Â kept raving about this chicken and rice place. So after hitting up our first and only NYC club, we ventured over to this cart that was so well known. Judging by the line, drunk me thought this must be worth the wait since it was basically 2 or 3 am and there was a long ass line!! I think we waited 30 min up to an hour; I'm not sure- time goes relatively slow when you're drunk and hungry. To add to that, we started talking to the guys behind us in line and they traveled across the Hudson from New Jersey just to get some chicken. I guess this place is good enough to expand it's popularity radius to another freaking state. For $6, you get chicken meat, rice, and pita bread in this foil to-go plate container. We grabbed extra white sauce and spicy sauce. It was superrrr good and I actually ended up adding more sauce to it all, making it too spicy for me to eat. =( My friend had to go stand in line again [in the rain] just to buy me a water bottle. I shared mine with my friend and we both got full. So portions were goooood. I speak of this place very highly and will mention/recommend it to anyone that is taking a trip to New York.
