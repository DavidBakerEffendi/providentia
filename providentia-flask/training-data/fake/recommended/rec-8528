My girlfriend and I were debating on giving this place 3 or 4 starts, but I went with 4 because I appreciate the inclusion of seitan and creative vegetarian options on the menu. My review is based solely on the food, as neither of us had drinks that night, although it seems most people were there to drink first, eat second. We went on a tuesday night and it was pretty packed but had only a 4 min wait to be seated outside. The outdoor seating was lovely as long as you don't mind being around lots of dogs, which we didn't mind one bit. The problem was that it was very dark outside by the time we were eating, and there is no outdoor lighting at all. There is a lot of space for them to add some kind of lighting, which would have been helpful as I couldn't really see my food in front of me clearly enough. The service was okay, I would describe it as nice but not friendly, and also just a little bit slow. They definitely needed more servers out there. The chips and salsa were above average, whatever the green salsa was was excellent and so were the chips. My girlfriend had the special- a vegan burrito, and I had the seitan skewers with sesame seeds and quinoa with some kind of delicious cream sauce. Both were very tasty and well made, but we both felt that the portion was pretty small. Luckily we ate plenty of the wonderful chips and salsa to make up for it.
