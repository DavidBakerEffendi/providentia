I chose this place for the get-together lunch with my high school classmates because it was inexpensive, the lay-out was ideal for big groups and of course, I heard raving reviews about their chicken.  I had high hopes! They had the $9.99 lunch special which consisted of a quarter chicken served with salad and your choice of 1 side dish.  All 8 of us had the specials.  We also shared the appetizers namely Calamari, Octopus Ceviche and Salmon Ceviche.  All the appetizers were really good but the one that stood out the most was the salmon ceviche.  I was a little disappointed with the chicken.  It was a bit dry.  If not for the green sauce, the chicken is no different from the ones that they sell at Safeway (the green sauce is the killer!).  The plantains were really good too - perfectly cooked to my taste.  The sangria complemented everything so be sure to order a pitcher!  We ordered 3 desserts including the Peruvian Chocolate Cake and Tres Leches.  After a bite of each one, I didn't care for any of it.  We didn't finish it either. The restaurant overall is spectacular - the decor, ambiance, lighting, etc.  It was like a lounge and very classy.  The service was a bit slow.  For some reason, we had difficulty communicating with the waiter - probably  a case of English as our "2nd language:))  In fairness, I liked the fact that they didn't complain about how noisy we were - imagine 8 wailing girls who never stopped talking in the 3 hours that we were there;)
