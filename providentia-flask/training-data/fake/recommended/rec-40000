What a great little gem amongst the numerous dining options in Old City! I knew right when I walked through the door that I would love it. It just has a good feel to it. We were seated immediately and greeted by our waitress, who, as a side note, was amazing. One of the best I've ever had (her name is Jen). It adds a lot to the experience when the service is great! They have a modest but thorough drink selection. Plenty to choose from whether you like ales, porters or IPAs. The food menu is also modest but that's good because it's not overwhelming. I got the crab cake meal with rice and saut√©ed veggies and my wife got the veggie burger with a side of lobster and corn chowder. Both were excellent! Everything had a unique and robust flavor to it. I highly recommend this restaurant if you like american food with a little twist. Oh and the atmosphere is awesome! Very well decorated and not overdone. And the fact that it's in a bank from the 1800's only adds to the charm. Can't wait to go back!
