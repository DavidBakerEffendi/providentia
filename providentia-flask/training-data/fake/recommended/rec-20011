The French/ Mexican combo turned out to be very tasty.  Everything we tried was unique and delicious.  The lamb tacos were very good.  The octopus cerviche was excellent.  Great to see the old waiters from Jolie on Atlantic.  The service and atmosphere was friendly and comfortable.  The decor was welcoming.  And while you're there, keep the sangria( red or white) coming.
