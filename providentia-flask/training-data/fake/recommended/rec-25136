this is officially one of my favorite brunch places! with $4 mimosas and $5 huge bloody marys that come in mason jars, this place wont disappoint. I came in a group of 4 after Halloween night so we were ready to get re-charged with some good food. I ordered the buttermilk pancakes which were perfect and my husband got a juicy burger with fries. The fries were ok but the burger did not disappoint! Further, the seating was amazing for a day like this - the seats were the most comfiest ever and the wait even sat with us to discuss our day and Halloween in general. Overall a cute spot and perfect for a group of friends on a Saturday afternoon
