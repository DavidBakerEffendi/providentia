Dumpling and rice cake soup has been my comfort food ever since I was a little kid.  Ichiban's dumpling and rice cake soup is pretty good. I think the dumplings are your average frozen ones (by the way the wrapping disintegrates) but the flavor is great. I always judge by the banchan (side dishes) because that's the first thing that comes out. Kimchi is tangy and aged enough, a good sign. The rest are pretty tasty- hazelnut jelly, wakame salad, spicy pickles, and thankfully, NO potato salad. Their bibimbap is also great- fresh greens and all the fixings. The version with sashimi is also fresh. I recommend splitting bibimbap and dumpling soup if you're not looking to be rolled out of the place.  These dishes are also great if you are wary of spicy dishes and kimchi (like my half Polish/Korean sister). The atmosphere is fun for Sunday lunch, lots of newcomers and their families trying out new food and flavors! Be open to people peering at what your table's munching on.
