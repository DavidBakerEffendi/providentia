Do it right and well and your business will take care of you. This is the epitome of The Bosphorus' success. Nora and her son are prime examples of compassionate, dedicated business owners. From the warm "good to see you" at the door to the hug and kiss farewell. I am envious of the Essex community for having this hidden gem (literally tucked in the Nutley diner municipal parking lot). Ambiance: Beautiful moulded ceiling as you walk in and clean, elegant decor fill this Turkish abode. Food: Presentation is art on a plate! Their branzino comes in fresh from Turkey which they pick up at JFK airport. I loved their mixed cold dip appetizer. All the bowls were licked clean with our warm, crusty bread. Bosphorus salad is scrumptious! Service: Some of the best hospitality I have ever seen. Everything is done to perfection! I came for early Sat dinner (5:30pm) so I did not experience the slow service people talk of. There's a $3-5 upgrade in price compared to the Turkish restaurants in Cliffside Park but the freshness and presentation make up for it. Definitely make reservations for Fri and Sat night because Yelpers have let the secret out on this place :)
