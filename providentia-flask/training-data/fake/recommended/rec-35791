Went here last night with a friend as part of a Mastercard promotion so everything was free, which was definitely a big perk. The hiramasa tartare was in a sauce that was way too tangy for the fish and avocado that accompanied it. For my entree I had the duck, which was to die for!! It was a generous portion and the sauce that it came in was amazing. I could have probably eaten another portion. For dessert, I ordered a chocolate sundae which doesn't seem to be on the regular menu. It was good but Â a bit overpowering. We sampled 2 of their vodka drinks (something with almond and another with pomegranate).. both were very good. Our waiter was great and the place was very rustic, with exposed brink and lots of candles. Marc also came out to see how we were enjoying our dinner, which was nice of him. I will most likely be back.. but this time I will have to pay..
