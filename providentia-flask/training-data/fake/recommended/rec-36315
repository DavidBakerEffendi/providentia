Never had a bad taste from this place....always good....always satisfying.....and you bet there's always a line.......Usually orders the lamb with rice.. and just found out yesterday that the chicken is actually pretty good too....definitely gotta get this when you're in the city...cheap..simple....tasty....goes better with alcohol......what more can you ask for? seriously, tell me....what?
