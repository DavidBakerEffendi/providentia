This is the perfect late night food spot. I tried the spicy pork, and "special" (lamb) meat balls.  Both were amazing.   The bread was great.  The atmosphere was great.  With so many combinations of meat balls/sauce/starch to try, this would definitely be my go-to late night place if I lived in New York.
