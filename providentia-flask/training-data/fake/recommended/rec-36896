"Best late night drunk cuisine in the Village" Soak up those Jameson shots and pitchers of beer here at Mamoun's Falafel in Greenwich Village. The shawarma at this place is ridiculously good, especially when you load it up with hot sauce. Service is lightning fast, and it's a real hoot to watch the drunken late night crowd get hot sauce and tzatziki all over their faces. Stumbling out of here at 4AM on a Wednesday night means one thing: Mission Accomplished.
