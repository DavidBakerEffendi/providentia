For a place that boasts $16 quesadillas, BarBacon's service is unacceptably terrible. Our waitress took 15 minutes to bring us PBRs (which were 4 bucks a piece)- the kicker being they were still in the can. The manager was incredibly rude and unfriendly; it seemed more like a European restaurant not working on a tip system than a customer service driven New York establishment.
