Reasonably priced Greek food in a new, fantastic location on the Upper West Side. The restaurant seems average sized until you realize that there's a basement room roughly the same size as the first floor and I recommend you sit there if at all possible to avoid the hussle and bussle of the main level. I give credit to management for avoiding the Republic-like cafeteria feel, which is possible with a space of this size. There are many fantastic appetizers on the menu. The pitas are always fresh and Â the mixed spreads, grilled octopus and cypriot sausage are fantastic for appetizers. For my main course, somehow I always come back to the tubular pasta, which can sometimes be a little disappointingly small in portion size, but is fantastic mix of greek and italian tastes otherwize. The service here is pretty good and the food comes almost Ollie's fast. Not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but they'll have you in and out of here in an hour on a Saturday night. Pretty good business strategy and helpful for those in a rush.
