My husband and I have been going here since we moved into the city 4 years ago.  Great place, comfortable - great food and great service. The pulled pork is probably my favorite - and my husband well he eats everything on the menu - and especially loves their wings. But, I give it 5 star rating because of the people who work there.  Mike, Alex, Marcus all make the customer feel welcomed.  They greet you when you walk in, chat, and always make sure your food and service are great. I highly recommend a visit to this great little pub on the corner of Front and Christian Streets.
