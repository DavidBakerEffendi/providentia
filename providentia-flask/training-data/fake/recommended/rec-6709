I have never had better bagels and I am a harsh reviewer. Friend or foe you are getting the truth but this place was great. It was staffed by every polite staff and they were nice to everyone. Its a very busy place plus the service is fast and when the bagel came to our table it was still hot, excellent! My daughter, wife and son had the french toast bagel, I am not a huge fan of french toast so I decided to get the super cinnamon with its sugar crust and it was the best damn bagel I've ever had. The coffee was pretty good too. Why did I give this so many stars? 1. It smelled great in there. 2. Super Clean, I watched staff making sure tables were clean and ready for the next customer. 3. Bathrooms were super clean too. I have a girl and boy and had to visit both for washing hands before we started again on our road trip. 4. I wish this was a chain but jewels like this are hard to find. 5. Best damn bagels on the planet!
