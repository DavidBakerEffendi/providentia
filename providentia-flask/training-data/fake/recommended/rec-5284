Their lunch menu sucks which isn't their fault, I just should have checked before going. However, I did order the lobster mac and cheese and it came out cold. I prefer the Old City location. Also weird that there are two way mirrors letting anyone who passes by look into the bathrooms. Very strange and creepy.
