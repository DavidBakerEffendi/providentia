Was in town for a conference last week and had no idea where to eat.  Stopped by Monk's Cafe to grab a beer and ask about where to eat.  A few locals told us about Continental Midtown, however nobody used the Midtown when they said it.  Super glad they turned us on to this.  Cool interior that's kind like a 1960's cruise ship.  The one-way mirrors in the bathroom are a very cool addition and something I'd never seen before.  My green tea martini was amazing.  French onion soup dumplings were even better.  The pretzels and Guinness ice cream was a happy ending for sure.  Wish we had a place like this in San Diego.
