I admit that I haven't really given the majority of the menu much of a chance...but if you're a fan of peanuts, then I highly recommend ordering their noodles in peanut sauce. It's affordable and very filling, and I can't get enough of the flavor. For me, that noodle dish is an entire meal (or two) for nearly $3.50.
