The Cons: you have to order a whole pie (they don't do slices), it's touristy, the atmosphere is pretty underwhelming, I'm pretty sure they only take cash, and it freaks me out how much the current owner (who happened to be there having a drink) must love himself (there are photos of him splattered all over the place - and not little ones, either!). The Pros: THE PIZZA IS YUMMY! And the prices aren't exactly cheap but they won't force you to break the bank, either. Just somewhere in the middle. Overall, I'd say go for it and check it out!
