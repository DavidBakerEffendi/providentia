I saw Home Sweet Harlem while walking the neighborhood early one Saturday and decided it was worth a visit.  I am so glad I came back while they were open - my friends and I had a great dinner, it was a combination of good food and feeling like we were in somebody's home.  We will definitely be back. Highlights - homemade guacamole, freshly roasted chicken on the chicken Ceasar salad which was so good  you wouldn't even notice how fresh the lettuce was, black beans that were so nicely seasoned they almost outshined the shrimp!
