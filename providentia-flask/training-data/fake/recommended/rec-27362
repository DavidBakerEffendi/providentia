I have struggled to find good mexian in this city outside of small mexican grocers (Zaragoza in the EV is amazing) and will continue the search as last night was the first and most likely last time i try Carino. I ordered two grilled fish tacos and one fried fish taco on the reco from our waitress. My dinner date had the quesadilla and we ordered a pair of margaritas and some guac and chips. Pretty easy and standard fare to judge a mexican restaurant on. Besides being relatively un-impressed, I have very little recollection of what any of Â our food tasted like except for the fact that we had to put water in our margs due to them being way too heavy on margarita mix. Still searching in NYC for good mexican.
