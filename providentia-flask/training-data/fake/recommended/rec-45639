I had this crazy a**hole of an ex-boyfriend who came to Philly and took me here once. Trust me, this guy was such a nut job that if I say his name, even a couple years later, my friends still threaten to kill him. Well, as you might imagine, going to any place I had been with him makes me want to vomit... EXCEPT HERE. A month after we broke up, I flew to Philly to hang with Monica and this was the first place I wanted to go. It's just that good. The long line is worth it to get into this tiny breakfast place. You can watch your skillet of yummy being cooked merely a few feet from you and my picky taste buds even dig their home made ketchup. Eat here... you won't regret it!
