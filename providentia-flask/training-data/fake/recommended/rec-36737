OK... so i have lived in the Hell of Hell's Kitchen for over ten years and wasn't thrilled we had to endure yet another Thai place (hello what about a rock'in good coffee place?)...but the decor made this place stand out..so i dropped by to get some chicken pad thai take out...HUGE $10 mistake...i swear they took rice noodles and  cleaned the greasy stove top and then threw some over cooked chicken  add  a wedge of lime and some stale peanuts..and wha-la! Pad Krap...I mean come on.. how hard is this dish to make? (I know cause i went to a cooking school in BKK, its not difficult) don't serve pad slop for this price...this place is most likley good for drinks at the bar nothing else, not willing to spend more money to see if they can actually cook something..ugh!
