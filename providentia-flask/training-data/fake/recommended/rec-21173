Stumbled upon this while shopping and I loved it!! Restaurant is clean, staff is very friendly and helpful and the food was delicious. Had the rice balls and sliders as our appetizers. Rice balls were very good and the meatballs were amazing (although the bun is a little bigger so you have bread leftover) Shrimp salad is very fresh and a decent size . Shrimp come w/o their tails which avoids any messiness. Fusilli with Bolognese sauce was cooked perfectly. Pasta was a little softer than al dente, but I personally prefer that. Sauce is hearty and not watery. THE TIRAMISU WAS DELICIOUS!! Seemed very authentic and not "americanized" They were out of their mint lemonade and then forgot to bring me my chamomile tea but the waiter was so nice that I didn't let it bother me. Prices are super reasonable. Whole meal was $75.
