I met a friend here for breakfast and liked the decor and ambiance but the food was too salty and the coffee bitter and subpar.  I had the baked eggs in spicy tomato sauce without the guanciale but it was still very salty and not as good as the baked eggs I've had at other NY eateries. The restaurant was not crowded at all with only a few other tables taken but it took over 15 minutes for me to get my coffee.  Was not happy with the food or service but might go back to try lunch or dinner.  I usually give the restaurant two chances if I like the decor and ambience.
