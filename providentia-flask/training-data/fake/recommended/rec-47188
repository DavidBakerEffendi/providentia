I don't understand how this place got 4 stars. When we walked in, my friend and I were excited as we saw quite a few tourists there, but also a lot of locals. So we thought we couldn't go wrong. I don't know if the kitchen was having a bad day, but the smothered chicken was flavorless, and actually had a terrible after-taste, the fried okra was basically pieces of okra covered in semi-fried thick dough... the salmon croquettes were actually pretty good. But we felt so sick afterwards---for hours. It was heavy, and sat really terribly in our stomachs. I didn't eat anything after that for a good 8 hours. All my friends told me I should have just gone to the Red Rooster and not mess around... Live and learn.
