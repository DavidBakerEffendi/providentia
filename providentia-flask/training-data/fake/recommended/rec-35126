Might be the best fried chicken in NYC next to Pies N Thighs in Brooklyn. But I'll say best fried chicken in Manhattan hands down. Crisp awesome skin, juicy and dripping with flavor inside. Literally dripping. And comes with jalepeno buttered biscuit so good. The soft pretzels for an appetizer were quite the nod to NYC also - and the vendors should come here to learn what a pretzel should taste like. So good, it was crazy how good they were. Buttery crispy outside and soft as a feather inside. Lastly the fried green tomatoes, mmmmmmmmmmmmm. PERFECT! Seasoning was to die for, just barely firm on inside like a fried green should be. Good stuff.
