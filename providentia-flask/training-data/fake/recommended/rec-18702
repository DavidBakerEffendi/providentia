Ivy Noodle hits the spot for me. It's classic Chinese food at prices that would make any pocketbook happy. The location is super convenient to Yale's campus and downtown New Haven. Servers are friendly and good arrives fast. When I went recently, I started out my meal with the Shanghai spring rolls. I usually think of spring rolls as being fresh and egg rolls as being deep fried, but these were fried. No matter, they were tasty enough that I ate them anyway. Next I ordered the wonton soup, no extra noodles (too filling). It was great! Savory broth with yummy pork-filled wontons floating between the small rings of green onions that had been chopped in. As the saying goes, my eyes were bigger than my stomach, but somehow I managed to eat the whole thing. Just a word to the wise on the fast service and timing, my spring rolls came out at almost the exact same time as my soup. It didn't bother me, I was in a pretty laid back mood the night that I went, but just know that food is served when it's not and ready. I was very full, but very happy, as I read my fortune that night, and planned to return to Ivy Noodle sometime in the not so distant future.
