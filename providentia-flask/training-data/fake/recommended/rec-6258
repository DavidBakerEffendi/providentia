Ardesia is a hidden GEM! It is off the beaten path of 9th ave madness in Hell's Kitchen. I went there on a nice night with my fiance and sat outside on their generously sized patio. They also had happy hour deal, $2 off any glass of wine or draft beer! I am always down for a great happy hour special. The server gave my fiance and I knowledgeable wine recommendations. We both were pleased with our wine selection and Â paired it with a delicious cheese plate! My two favorite combo's in life is wine and cheese! I live in Murray Hill so this wine bar is a trek for me, but I worth it.
