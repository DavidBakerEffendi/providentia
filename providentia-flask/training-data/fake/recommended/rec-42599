Had dinner for two on a Friday night and had no trouble getting a table.  No one sat next to us so we didn't feel cramped though the tables are too close together. Only  one vegetarian entree (pasta with tomatoes and leeks) that sounded uninspired.  The small plates, cod cakes and grilled endive, were good, as were the duck and gnocchi entrees. Dessert options were not great: tahini doughnuts? We had the tres leches cake which was disappointing. If they had a more creative approach to vegetarian options and got a pastry chef I'd eat here again, but for now I would only return for cocktails at the bar, not a meal.
