I love this place! Yes we waited for 1 hr and 15 minutes but to be fair, they said the wait would be 1 hr and 15 minutes long.  True to their word! Adorable... from the chalkboard door to the mis-matching mugs, I love the ambiance of the place!  I got the nutella french toast and it was so good, but only 3 small pieces. However, that was fine by me because I think overeating is bad for you anyway! The price was right and the food was great...!
