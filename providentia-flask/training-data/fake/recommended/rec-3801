The wait will be long but it's part of the experience so come with great company! The pizza is worth it. Perfect crust. Ask for pepperoni (it's thick and perfectly salty "real" pepperoni). Add garlic and you've got a kick. You'll think you can't finish it, it's so huge but after such a wait you can, trust me. It's popular but the prices are still cheap and the usual you see in any pizza place!
