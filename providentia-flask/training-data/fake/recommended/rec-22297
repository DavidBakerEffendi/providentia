I should have known when every decent restaurant downtown was booked until 9pm, and this place had about three tables filled at 7pm.  The service was slow and cold.  It took a long time to get a couple of glasses of wine.  My husband ordered the tomato pie - I'm sorry, but $18 for a small slice of something that's been pre-made and thrown in the microwave to warm up?  No thanks. When ordering, my husband asked for extra mozzarella, assuming that the food here was actually made to order.  He got a shot glass of cold shredded mozz on the side.  I ordered the rigatoni bolognese - the shredded meat was an odd choice.  I like creative dishes, but this went wrong somewhere. There was also a puddle of water near the restrooms, which I heard the hostess ask someone else to clean up when we first sat down, and which was still there when I went to use the restroom on our way out. We were looking for a nice meal out, but with the service and the barely mediocre food, it was not worth the price (which really wasn't that steep, and still not worth it).
