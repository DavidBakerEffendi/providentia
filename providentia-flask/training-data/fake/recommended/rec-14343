This place is fantastic.  I love the cocktails.  Never thought I'd like a bourbon bloody mary but it totally works.  And if you like the bourbon/ginger fad, the Nor'easter is delicious.  I haven't eaten here extensively, but everything I've had I really enjoyed.  Love those pork nuggets.  And the brisket hash is also a real winner. The vibe is very comfortable and relaxed.  Great for people watching if you grab a window seat.  Just a nice quality Brooklyn joint.
