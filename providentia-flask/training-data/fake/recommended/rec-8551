Cheesesteaks... not a fan of them in general. I'd love to live in a city whose signature food is something a little more enticing than stringy meat and processed cheese. But! Cosmi's is just the answer for "I'm drunk and wish to devour greasy food immediately." More importantly, they make awesome Italian subs. I always stick with the "South Philly" sub 'cause, well, I'm not native to the area and I'm hoping the angry Italian dudes won't notice this if I order the signature sandwich. Actually, it's just really tasty. And huge. Seven bucks for about a foot of oily (and I mean dripping all over your lap) meat-and-veggie-stuffed perfection.
