Atmosphere: 1.5 Service: 4 Food: 2 Went for Dining Days and tried the prix fixe menu.  First off, this place has a slight hint of public restroom smell - like the weird sweet smell of blue toilet bowl tablets.  Not a great start.  The interior looks old and tired.  Frayed carpet (who has a carpeted dining room?), lacey window treatments, not impressed. The first two courses were good.  Gazpacho was very tasty with a hint of spice.  The carpaccio was good, although the lemon oil, capers, goat cheese, etc completely overwhelmed any beef flavor.   The salads were fine, although microscopic.  The peach salad had 2 peach wedges, 4 blueberries, 1 cherry, and 3 small arugula leafs.  The watermelon salad was better, but about 3-4 small bites of food as well. The main courses were WAY below what I would expect from a restaurant of this price.  The 'berkshire pork'  that was served was not at all what was described on the menu.  Now, as I am writing this review and looking back at the menu, I wished I had asked to look at the menu again because I did not receive the dish that I ordered, but assumed it was my mistake and am not one to make a scene.  My dish included 2-3 ounces of pork with no sauce, glaze, anything and a salad of only frisee and 2 green beans sliced lengthwise with lemon vinaigrette.  It was 5 bites of food.  My partner's spicy bolognese was better, but still noting special.  The pasta was from a box. The deserts were an assortment of three small bites (noticing a theme?).  One was a wedding type cookie with jelly on top, one was a graham cracker type cookie with blueberry, I didn't try the third. Overall I can say we will NOT be returning to White Dog and it will not be recommended to others.  For $125 for two with 3 beers I was totally underwhelmed, left hungry and feeling ripped off.
