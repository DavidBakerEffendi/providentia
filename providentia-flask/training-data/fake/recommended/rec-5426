Went to Big Fish for some drinks after work. The happy hour prices for food & drink are pretty good. Everything was between $3-$5 on the happy hour menu. Â I ordered the pomegranate martini and white pizza. Both were delicious & the pizza was a pretty good size. You hope a place won't screw up cheese & garlic, & they did not. The people I went with ordered the calamari & shrimp rolls and said they were tasty, which I will have to go by what they say since I'm allergic to seafood and have no plans on reviewing the local hospitals. I know, going to a restaurant named Big Fish when you cannot eat it. However, I did say I went for the drinks. The place was clean & not very crowded but that could be due to the construction that is going on in the MarketFair Mall. Also, a plus for the ladies, the bar has purse hooks. Overall, it wasn't bad for a few drinks after a long day at work.
