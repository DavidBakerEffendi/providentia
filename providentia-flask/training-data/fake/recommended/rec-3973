Why does everyone love this place? It's not even that cute...just cluttered and dusty, which I guess people think is charming.  I mean, I love the old soda fountain, and if you're just going to get an old-timey soda and a slice of pie, it's great.  But nostalgia only goes so far...you also have to eat the food. The spinach omelette is made with limp frozen spinach, the waffles are dry, and the "fancy butters" are dull.  The potatoes are remarkably bland, and the cherry-lime rickey is just ok.   They also claim to be the Tom's Diner from the Suzanne Vega song, which they are not.
