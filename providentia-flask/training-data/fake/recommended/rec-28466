My friends and I have been regulars here since the place opened about a year and a half ago.  Joe, the owner, is awesome, really friendly, as is the rest of the staff.  They're good about faces, and they always give a "Good to see you again" and stop by the table when we're in.  They make you feel right at home. And the FOOD!  For brunch, its one of my favorite places in the city.  The Warm Bankie (polenta, crimini mushrooms, asparagus, and two fried eggs) is just about the best experience on a chilly Sunday.  And the butternut squash soup with truffle oil could be a meal in itself!  They have a nice little selection of brunch cocktails, and they do a pretty good cappuccino as well.  Dinner is always good, they have a few nice standbys (their pizzas, the Parmesan brussel sprouts), and dessert is always good.  I recommend it to anyone in the neighborhood.
