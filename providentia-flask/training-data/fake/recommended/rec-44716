Decent but overpriced spot.  Ambiance is very cool - modern - nice change of pace from the stodgier places in mid town.  Food was good but the portions were tiny.   Service was a B-.  Out waiter was extremely pushy with the apps and drinks.  He basically wouldn't leave until we ordered a second round and apps, which was a little awkward. Not a bad spot if someone else is footing the bill - but there are too many good restaurants in NYC to go here twice.
