Great, local little diner type restaurant. Right by the train station so I'm sure it's great for commuters to grab some coffee/breakfast before heading to work. Never a bad experience here. I wouldn't say the food is amazing but I always enjoy myself.  The owner was always around when it first opened and would greet patrons and check them out at the register after their meal. Really nice guy! Whenever it's packed I just grab a seat at the bar so I usually don't have to wait long. It gets packed on weekends. I love that they offer vegan and gluten free options and their specials are always awesome. They have seasonal pancakes and a list of specials on the chalk board in the front so make sure to check that out! Also,  the coffee is really good here!
