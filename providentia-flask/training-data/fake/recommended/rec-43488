Do NOT be fooled! This place has consistently gone down hill and the service is non existent. What started out as bottomless turned in to $2 bloody Mary's or mimosas, then to $3 and now within a few months it has skyrocketed to $5 for a not so full 75% orange juice mimosa. They had just added a bellini to the menu which sold out as well as the salmon Benedict and the potato cake. The food was never the best, but the cheap drinks used to make up for it ... Not anymore! Consider yourself warned!!
