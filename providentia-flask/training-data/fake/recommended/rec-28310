Walked in last night (Tuesday)and it was very dark with only candles lighting the place. The decor is minimal, but this is to its credit. The place is sexy without pretension. I ordered a lemon basil gin martini and it was poured to perfection. The bartenders were attentive, the music is chill, and it is the kind of place you can talk. The only reason I give this place 4 stars is because it is difficult to get a seat at the bar after 10pm when the garden closes.
