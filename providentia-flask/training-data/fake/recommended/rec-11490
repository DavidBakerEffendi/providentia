We've gone to Massimo's for years, both for take out and dine in. For the most part, it's been pretty reliable. Not amazing, but decent and mostly consistent. But the last time we got take out it was horrible. Buffalo wings we ordered we actually mozzarella sticks, which they realized before I left. They replaced them with "buffalo wings" which I didn't realize until I got home were not buffalo wings, just breaded wings without buffalo sauce on them. They also had a rather strong fishy taste. Even the kids wanted nothing to do with them. Pizza was poor, we got half sausage half plain, sausage was almost non-existent, pizza was overcooked and just seemed "flimsy". Again, even the kids wanted nothing to do with it. Service for take out was also poor and surly. The curly haired guy who is always there needs to not curse so much with his co-workers when customers are there. Maybe a bad night for them but I am not in a hurry to go back, especially with so many other options.
