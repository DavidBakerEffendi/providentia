the look: the energy of this place is upbeat, bordering on frenetic. great design (the Barcelona owners know how to put an attractive, modern, well-designed restaurant together.) the booze: drinks were expensive for the size, but tasty. you might consider a traditional cocktail order to get a better value. the food: the grilled corn with cotija cheese is great, and the grilled romaine wedge salad is delish. some of the tacos are very tasty, especially the portabello and red snapper. not sure i was taken with the cactus pad taco. the nice thing is at $2.50-3.00 a pop, the price is low enough for return trips to try a variety from their small bites type menu. one question though... what's up with the major chunks of white onion on EVERY taco?? ... it can be tasty, but seems like overkill to me. also makes me wonder if they are compensating somehow for lack of size, flavor, # of ingredients or something else with the onion decoy. the same strong note on each taco (that I've had) is palette numbing.
