Really a darling place and a terrific find! We were driving through Brooklyn looking for early dinner and yelp search revealed to us this place. Upon walking inside I knew it was the right place for me. Absolutely adorable ambiance - dimly lit, romantic, solid wood tables in the bar area and in the back of the restaurant. We weren't too hungry so we just ate: - biscuits and butter - mac and cheese with bacon (comes without it too for the vegetarians) - fried pig tails Everything was truly scrumptious. To be honest, after eating that first biscuit with butter, I knew this place was special. Biscuit lovers will understand: these biscuits were the warmest, softest most delicious biscuits i've ever tasted in my life. The butter was creamy and perfect and the two together were just delightful. The mac and cheese was really tasty, creamy but not too creamy, and the bacon was a perfect touch. I personally didn't love the pig tails but I know other meat eaters will enjoy them - fried crispy and pretty good with hot sauce. LOVE this place and can't wait to go back to try other entrees!!!
