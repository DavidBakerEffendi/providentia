I always get the vegetarian combo. It is very good and filling. I like this place because it is quick and cozy. Also, they have some non-ethiopian things, so you can please the picky people in your party. The fruit smoothies are really good, too. It is small, so perhaps you should call ahead if you are more than 4 people.
