Stephen Starr has done it again! Starting off with the shag carpet and delicious mac and cheese, and finishing with the warm atmosphere and savory comfort food, Jones again pleases the taste-buds with every bite! Sat down in the restaurant for the first time a couple weeks back after an event over at the new Union Trust and high expectations after reading reviews and knowing the concepts Stephen is capable of creating.  I was nothing short of pleased and definitely will return. 1. Try the mac and cheese - you will not be disappointed - just don't touch the plate! 2. it seems as if most everything is great, so don't be afraid to try new things. 3.  Look around - And for gosh shakes, don't spill on the shag!
