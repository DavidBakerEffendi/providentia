Seriously, the best place ever. My wife and I met our friends here and we ordered up a storm. I could list it all out, but it's not necessary. There are just two things to say - 1. Whatever you get, it will be good. 2. The super hot option for the fried chicken is no joke. It's ridiculously spicy AND delicious. ENJOY.
