Rude, horrible and pathetic were a few of the words uttered by our large group during our visit to describe the service we had received. Of the ten or so adults, all of them said they would never be back. I would highly discourage anyone from visiting this place. There are too many restaurants to give your money to.  They clearly don't want to do anything to get you to come back. This was not an individual bad server, but extended to all three waitresses that are regularly there as well as the old man (owner).  It is family run and they are just plain poor business people. How in the world they have stayed in business is a mystery. Their homemade ice cream must be the savior. There isn't a zero star option, so I give it one. Keep in mind that my profession for the last seven years has me eating at restaurants almost every day and this is the only time that I have made it a point to write a bad review. Worst service I have ever received.
