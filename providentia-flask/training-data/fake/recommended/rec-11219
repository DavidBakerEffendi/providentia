This is my go to place for Indian fare. I must admit, I typically call for delivery... And I should offer a little advice if you are interested in doing the same. The wait time for it is an excess of an hour, so planning ahead is very helpful if one is looking to eat at a specific time. My go to choices are samosa chaat, garlic naan, mango chicken, saag aurr paneer... I'd like to try different things, but these are always so good!
