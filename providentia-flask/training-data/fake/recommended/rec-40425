We go here for lunch on a semi-regular basis.  It has sushi dishes as well as Chinese and Thai dishes.  It has daily lunch box specials, which are relatively inexpensive. There is a sushi bar as well.  Most significantly, this place has the best General Tso's Chicken I have ever had.  White meat, crispy, with little red peppers and broccoli.  Very tasty! It can get busy (at least during lunch) so I would consider getting a reservation.
