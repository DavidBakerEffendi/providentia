People complaining about paper plates and the burger not being the best in town are missing the point. This is a great place for a super cheap burger and beer. The burger is not the best ever but it is damn good and comes up fast since it's basically the only thing on the menu. The beers are under $3 and the burgers are not much more. I was pretty broke and craving burgers with my boyfriend and I think we spent $25 for dinner and left happy. Good bang for your buck and a nice neighborhood to walk it off afterward.
