Who in their RIGHT mind doesn't like bacon?! As soon as you walk in the smell of delicious oily smoked bacon permeates through out the bar. YES. We ordered brussels sprouts with bacon & LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE WITH BACON. OMG. The mac & cheese - to die for. Topped with a coating of breadcrumbs and what seemed to be like 3 types of cheeses with chunks of lobster and chunks of hickory smoked bacon. WOW. I ordered the lobster roll with bacon. Comes with a side of chips and cole slaw and I ordered a side of bacon salted tater tots. Had I known the main dish came with chips I wouldn't have ordered the tater tots - they also didn't have a bacon salt on them? tasted like regular tater tots - nonetheless, still good. I'm not a fan of pineapple which was in the cole slaw - so I didn't finish it all. Lobster roll was amazing though. I knew from the start I was already getting the chocolate covered bacon with strawberries with a side of whip cream. Again, amazing. The chocolate covered bacon tasted a bit like beef jerky - which I love. Overall, definitely will be back. Bacon doesn't taste like your typical oily/salty bacon you get with your egg & cheese sandwhich. The smoked flavor gives it a rich taste to it.
