I recently met a friend here for lunch.  It's great for a casual meal.  I ordered the grilled chicken breast--which was really superb.  Especially with the green sauce that is on every table.  I ordered sides of rice and peas and plantains.  I was really impressed with just about everything--although some plantains were undercooked. My dining companion ordered the pork chops.  He said they were amazing.  So, i tasted them, and i agree.  He ordered a "double salad" as his two sides--and the salad had real greens--not just iceberg lettuce. It was really a great--and surprising--meal.  The restaurant is so unassuming.  If you stand in the line to order food to go, you may not even notice the seated area in the back.  If you are hungry and want a hearty, delicious meal, this place will do the trick.
