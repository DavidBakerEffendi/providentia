Fabulous little hole in the wall with a great selection of roti rolls. The wait was brief, and this was obviously a bustling lunch hot spot. I overordered because my eyes were bigger than my stomach but both my rolls were delish. The roti was soft and had just the right texture. The spiced potatoes and chicken that came inside were very flavorful and tasty. Not too dry as is common with potato-things.
