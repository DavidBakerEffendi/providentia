What a treat for a locavore/foodie/gardener/homosexual into Brooklyn boys!  I totally dig this place. The ambiance wreaks of slightly smelly, unbathed, hairy men, masked by a throbbing layer of freshly made brick-oven pizzas slewn from the large oven noticeable as soon as you walk in.  The greenhouse out back serves them good purpose, as this restaraunt is one of few that grows some of their own food!  They source their meats from grass-fed farms in Upstate NY (suppporting the local, non-assembly line farmers).  The milks, cheeses, and even wines/beers are all local!  The service can suck at times, and the place is packed on weekends with young hipsters.  Sometimes I feel like the hostess' aren't paying too much attention to the customers, and that can be a drag.  I've waited here for a table for 5 for an hour one night, and the hostess (45min) into our patience, seated her 3 good friends she obviously knew, before us...they showed up,and got seated immediately.  Other than mediocre service, and too-cool-for-school attitude, I love it!  xoxo
