I was having a lazy Sunday afternoon, so I decided to order delivery from this place after reading through all the raving reviews. I was going to order from where I always do, but they were closed so I decided to try out Erawan. I should have just chosen somewhere else, because I was pretty disappointed. I ordered a pad thai (2 spice) and a tom yum soup with chicken (3 spice). I placed my order at 4pm, but it came at 6pm. Seriously, 2 hours for a quick stir fry and a soup? Not to mention that my delivery address was 3 minutes away by car. I was extremely hungry by then so I was expecting a meal that was worth the ridiculous wait. The tom yum soup was pleasantly spicy, and had the right amount of sourness to it. The chicken, however, was stone-hard when I rescued it from the bottom of the soup container. It was WAY overdone, and had no flavor whatsoever. Next time the cook should season the meat before he/she dumps it into the soup. I was much more disappointed by the pad thai. The noodles were just overcooked and soggy. It felt like I was eating senior food because it was so soft. The sauce was also terribly bland, and I had to grab some soy sauce and chili sauce from my cupboard to give it some flavor. Also, there was absolutely no spice whatsoever, despite my specifying for a 2-level spice. I don't know why people have been raving about their pad thai. And I know what real pad thai is like - I lived in Thailand for two years.
