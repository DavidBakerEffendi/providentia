Well, it's finally oyster season, and Halcyon delivers with an oyster menu 12 deep (something I'm not accustomed to in NJ). Overall dress was stylish, but everyone was enjoying themselves and not being stuffy. I had the Swordfish and parmesan frites. It was quite good, and the portions were perfect. You don't feel slovenly as you're signing the bill. Overall, I enjoyed the place, and will definitely pay them another visit.
