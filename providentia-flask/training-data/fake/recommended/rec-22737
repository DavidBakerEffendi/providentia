I put on a white Express pique polo, DKNY jeans and Aldo suede shoes, gelled up my hair, walked through a heavy mist of Eau De Douche and rolled out to Rooftop 120 with my boys looking to crush some...nice ladies. In all seriousness, this place was far less "jersey shore" than I was anticipating.  I had avoided coming here for the longest time because I'm just not that in to the whole club scene.  Wub Wub Wub music just doesn't do it for me. It was me and two friends who went here for drinks on a Friday night after dinner.  We arrived around 7:30 and there was still a pretty steady dinner crowd.  The setup is symmetrical with the long bar in the center of the roof with access to bar tenders on either side.  Flanking the bar on both sides, is the open rooftop.  It was March when we went, unseasonably warm, but still chilly once the sun set.  The electric heaters in the outdoor areas did a reasonably good job at keeping us warm.  Around 10 a DJ came on, and the tables in the inside dining area were moved to create space for a dance floor.  (Can't remember much after that.) I did not eat when I was here so I can't make any remarks on the food.  I can say, however, that the drinks, although generously portioned, are bit on the pricey side.  I think it was around 8 or 9 dollars for a gin and tonic.  But it's Glastonbury so I'm thinking you're not going to do much better than that anywhere else.   This place has a lot potential as both a restaurant, and a night life hot spot.  I can't wait to try the food.  I'm sure if it's good I'll be doing my fair share of Al Fresco dining here during the summer.
