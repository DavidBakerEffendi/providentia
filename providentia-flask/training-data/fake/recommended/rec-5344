Perhaps one of the best places in Philadelphia for Szechuan food. The spice level and taste is on point. All items on the menu are ranked from 1-10, 10 being the highest, level of spiciness. I highly recommend the DanDan Noodles as a starter for new diners and then try other items on their menu, it's all very very good. One of the items on their menu that is not spicy but amazing (we order it every time) is the Salt and Pepper Shrimp. The service is really relative to what waiter you get but the waiters are all trained very well and the ones that we've had have all been very enthusiastic about the food served at Han Dynasty, so if you're unsure of what to order ask your waiter for a recommendation.
