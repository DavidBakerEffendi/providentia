Needed some comfort for the soul after a hectic day, so I decided to dive in to the highly recommended Forgione. An impressive experience from the greeting of the hostess to the last attentive spoiling by my waiter, Justin. Service from the wait staff was impeccable, unpretentious and warm. Restaurant was packed, but in spite of the energy from so many other diners, I was left feeling as if the staff was there for me alone. Impressive achievement for NYC. Â Amuse-bouche offerings were an interactive and fun experience for the palate. Amazing start. The Chili Lobster with grilled bread left me (practically) licking the bowl. Again, amazing. I took the "hamburger test." (You know the one which states that every restaurant can be judged by the humble burger offering) I was a goner on the first bite. It was clean, yet complex in flavor, cooked to a gorgeous medium rare (as ordered) and the bacon relish...well, what else can be said...it's bacon relish. The bun was fresh, buttery, with perfect texture and proportion to the huge burger. This meal was the warm blanket of my day. Oh...the warm pecan pie bread pudding should be a part of every day. Bottom line? This is a restaurant that challenges the senses in a fun, playful, yet sophisticated, way. Expect to "experience" the offerings Chef Forgione presents in this restaurant. Like the Chef himself, bluntly stated...one class act. Cannot wait to return.
