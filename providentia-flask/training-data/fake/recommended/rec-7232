I mean is it just me? How did this chick even make it to Top Chef? Honestly, I'm not here to burn and and will get to the point in a second but I used to know a bunch of Asian chicks from San Fran that loved this place and used to invite me there for happy hour. Never went because it seemed out of the way. Then, my girlfriend saw Leah Cohen on TV, said she wanted to go and when we happened to walk by it, by chance, a few nights later we decided to give it a try. So.....here's the deal: Service-perfectly fine. We walked in on a Saturday night without reservations and they sat us Menu-server indicated it was a family style and that all plates were meant to be shared. Menu divided into two categories: small and large, with the emphasis being on small. Irrespective of category, the main missing component was flavor. The red curry wings had zero heat and a taste more reminiscent of grocery store bottled curry than anything else. The crispy pata won points for the texture of the skin but was as flavorless as the two boring sauces that were served as accompaniments. Better off going to a $10 Puerto Rican spot if you want pork like this. The saving grace was the dessert but then again you could find something remarkably similar to this for less money in Chinatown or fort lee. Super disappointing Booze-do I expect to find in a place like this an offer for serve yourself unlimited pbr draft for $15? If this is to do compensate for the poorly conceived menu, then at least offer something more tolerable than cheap college swill. On the other hand, the pigroni was a nice drink....if only they could offer it to go. I just don't get the hype surrounding this place. I worked in the restaurant business for years and inherently want to see small restaurants do well but the food here was just a tremendous letdown. Do yourself a favor and don't go.
