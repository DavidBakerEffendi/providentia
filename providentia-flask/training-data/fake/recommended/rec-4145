I eat here at least six times a month and always find myself with more than I can eat for lunch, my typical meal here. Their whole wheat baguette is a great meal vehicle and their meats, veggies and deli-cious sides are a sure-fire, super-duper value. I love how they hussle the sometimes long lines through ordering process. They are good people who make an honest living making guys like me happy :) Dinner Note: their rottersserie chickens are a great deal for afterwork meals.
