Located on a street where a car accident seemed imminent, my clairvoyance was confirmed in the half an hour I spent there trying to get a cheesesteak. Reality entertainment aside, when I first walked in to order I was a bit nonplussed by the lady working the counter as she barked at me for my order, and seemed irritated that I was unprepared. Granted it was my first time there and I hadn't seen a menu yet, but this seems to be the standard level of customer service of Philadelphian cheesesteak shops. I finally managed to order, while dodging people trying to pick up their order at the same counter, in a space about two people wide. Twenty minutes later, after the car accident and the crowd clearing out a bit, the lady behind the counter seemed to turn a corner and was much friendlier while handing me my cheesesteak. I almost felt obliged to look for a tip jar. I didn't find it. I got the special steak with provolone and it was evident after the first bite why they coat it in a tomato and mushroom sauce reminiscent of marinara. The meat was pretty dry, though once I got to the middle where all the cheese had conveniently decided to congregate, the taste improved dramatically. The meat is sliced and diced fairly finely, so it's less like the cheesesteak that you may be accustomed to, but the sandwich itself is huge and they load it down with meat. Admittedly I wolfed down this sandwich while waiting in the security line at the Philadelphia International Airport, while fielding friendly secondhand remarks that were obviously directed towards me from the TSA staff about not needing to finish food in line since food is allowed through the security checkpoint. So I was enjoying this particular sandwich approximately half an hour after purchasing. The copious amount of sauce had made it soggy, and it definitely would have been better hot.
