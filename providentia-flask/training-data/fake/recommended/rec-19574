Two stars might be bit of a generous rating.  Are the people who gave 5 stars smoking some of that philadelphia crack I hear about?  Now I've only dined there once, and definitely will not be going back, but the food was a complete turn off.  I ordered the black cod, usually a fairly easier fish to prepare but not your typical italian dish I admit, and it was completely over cooked and prepared in a sauce rich in oil and not complimenting the fish at all.  I barely ate half.  Our waiter was another bad spot.  Completely unprofessional and emotional.  Keep your shit at home broooooooooooooooooo!  Salad was good but not too adventurous.
