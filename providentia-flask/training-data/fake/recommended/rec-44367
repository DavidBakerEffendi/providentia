This place is a Gem. First off the dining room is small, but comfy so I don't see that as a bad sign.  Once it gets busier I'm sure it will be more of an issue so do yourself a favor and head there now before everyone else figures it out. The pasta dishes were excellent.  I was pleasantly surprised at the cost.  Given the location I was worried it was going to be over priced but not the case at all!   What I really like was the downstairs bar area.  Totally separate from the restaurant, it has low lighting with little nooks to grab a more intimate drink.  Would definitely be a place to bring a date.  The bartender, can't remember his name, was very friendly and chatty.   The kind of bar tender I wanted to grab a barstool and find out more about their drinks.   Needless to say it's a great place.  Will definitely go back, and will try to go before everyone else figures it out
