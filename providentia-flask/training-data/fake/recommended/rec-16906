I was on a tour of New York City with a friend of mine from out of town.  We had a show to go to at 2 pm.  We did not have a lot of time, but we were right there in the theater district.  I had been to Carmine's before and had only appetizers.  This is a restaurant that serves family style, so the meal itself divided by 2 people was plenty!!!!  In fact, we ordered Veal Cutlet with tomato sauce without any extra pasta which had an additional charge.  Not only were we full coming out of there, but I have to say that that was the best veal cutlet with the most tasty tomato sauce that I have ever eaten, and I order veal or chicken cutlet frequently.  WOW!!!  There were no tables, so we sat at the bar in order to get in and out real fast.  I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who comes to New York City.
