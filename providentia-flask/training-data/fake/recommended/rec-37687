AVOID.  Ultimate EuroTrash, which should tell you enough.  Gross.  Rudest "service" I've seen in a long time. The bartenders ignore you; can't really believe that they have to be bothered serving.  Drinks are weak; food is gross (the "lamb lollipops" look like tampons, and taste accordingly).  But bad as it is, the foul service and the trash clientele is what makes this creepy place an AVOID.  Be forewarned.
