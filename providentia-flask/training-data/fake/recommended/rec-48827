Stopped here for a easy lunch after serving jury duty next door at Manhattan Court. The size of the restaurant is small, which could be challenging for groups over 3-4 people. There aren't any sitting tables, only bar type stools around the counter. We quickly ordered at the front counter and sat ourselves down by the window. A nice selection of spicy sauces was presented on the countertop. What we ordered: 1. Original Burger (+1$ for Bacon) The cheese and the patty were melted into one another, and made this burger enjoyable. Not the best burger I've ever had, but I did indeed devour this! 2. Break Room Fries The 'fries' included both regular strip potato fries and tater tots. These were pretty good. 3. Taco Platter (any 3 of their taco selection) -Skirt Steak -Chicken -Pork Belly Each of these were fantastic. My reason for 5 stars, along with the generous staff. And received 2 complimentary teas with lemon from the workers :) I would definitely come back if I am in the neighborhood. This place is cute, cozy and culinarily-unique. The blends of traditional American/Mexican cuisine with a touch of Asian Fusion make this restaurant one of a kind in Chinatown. See my photos below for a picture of the menu and the items ordered.
