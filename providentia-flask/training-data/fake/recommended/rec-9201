never been to the one on the west side so i can't compare, but bxl east was quite tasty.  i do usually avoid eating seafood on sundays and mondays (thank you anthony bourdain) but i decided to brave it and try it out anyway for their "all you can eat" mussels special. the fries were great and i enjoyed that they came with mayo, and my moules marnieres weren't bad.  i really want to give this place more stars, but even when my friends and i had clearly finished, they didn't ask if we wanted more (you know, for the "all you can eat" special).  soo... we were kind of confused.  maybe we were there too late?  no idea.  plus, a lot of the mussels in my bowl weren't cooked all the way (i.e. hadn't opened) which kind of skeeved me out (re: seafood wariness in first paragraph). i'll go back for the fries and a beer, and maybe to try the mussels again on a non-sunday/monday but just maybe.
