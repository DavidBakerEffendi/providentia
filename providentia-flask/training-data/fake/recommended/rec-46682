What was up with yesterday? Is Philadelphia closed on Mondays? Was it some Holiday that I don't know about? My friends and I were planning on eating Mexican food for dinner, restaurant was closed. But, we were within walking distance of another, also closed. In fact, it was like a ghost town. It was a little eerie, basically no one on the streets, hardly any cars, the trolley was basically empty. But then, we see lights, and stumble towards them, like a moth toward a flame. Johnny Brenda's, how awesome you are. The cheeseburger I had was really good, the cheddar was the perfect amount of sharpness. Their fries are really good, not soggy at all. My friends got the octopus and the shrimp& avocado , and both loved them, though those are both considered appetizers, so an hour later they were hungry again. I am giving it a 4star because the first waitress we had was great, but we moved to a booth and some other girl waited on us(which I thought was rude, she stole us, when clearly the other girl was waiting on us). The 2nd waitress was fine, but I just thought it was weird. Also, I need to see a show here, for sure.
