5 STARS! I've been coming here for years and there are no problems that I can point out off the top of my head. Bloomfield is so lucky to have this gem right in the center of town. In high school, my friends and I used to come here for lunch during early dismissals or to celebrate an occasion. I come here probably twice a month, since I don't live in town anymore, and occasionally order, as well. Over the years, the presentation of the sushi has improved exponentially. Whenever they bring my plate over, my eyes light up - they make my food look so pretty to the point where sometimes I don't even want to touch it... but once my chopsticks are in hand, it's game over. Their lunch bento boxes come with a lot of food for a low price. I always go with either the beef negimaki box or the chicken katsu box. Never ever fails me.They also let you switch out the California roll for another roll for a low additional charge. The chicken katsu is on point every time I get it. I seriously cannot take how big the dinner portion is. I could barely finish half of it. I haven't tried anything here that I didn't enjoy. Their sushi rolls have a great fish to rice ratio unlike other sushi spots that may put much more rice than fish to rip you off. The Godzilla roll is one of my top choices whenever I choose to get a specialty roll. As for he service, it is always amazing. My glass of water is never empty and the waitresses do a good job of checking up on you with your meal. Even their delivery boys are really friendly. They don't just drop your food off and take their tip; they engage in small talk with you, which is what you need sometimes after a long day at work. All in all, you should, without a doubt, take the time out of your day and have a meal here. You won't regret it! Oh and how could I forget? BYOB!
