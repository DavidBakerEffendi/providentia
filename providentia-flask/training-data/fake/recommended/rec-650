Tourist: What is this line for? Me: Halal food Tourist: Is it THAT good? *snaps a picture* Me: *Nods* Yes I've waited in the notorious line in the cold, rain, hot weather, drunk, and even by myself while my boyfriend drove around the block to avoid getting a ticket. This is proof that people do stupid things when they're in love. I have to admit; sometimes the chicken is a little plain and the lamb is chopped too much but nothing is perfect right? Actually scratch that, the salty lamb and the bland chicken is a match made in heaven. Something about the street meat, rice, strips of pita bread, and lettuce mixed together with the sauce (white & hot sauce) makes it worthwhile. Here are some tips that I've learned over the years: 1. Assuming that you're taking it to go: Mix the hot sauce from its container (2-3 medium drips) into the white sauce container. Mix it WELL to avoid any unpleasant burns that may occur in the middle of the night. 2. Give the halal man a dollar for some extra pita bread strips. 3. Do yourself a favor and get an extra dish to go. 4. Stir up any leftovers the next morning (including the lettuce) in a skillet... forget the microwave! No need for oil. Toast the pita bread strips, its highly recommended. Now, I'm pretty sure this isn't the healthiest dish ... something about 2000 calories? I'll pretend that I didn't hear that. FYI - Their cardboard falafel is awful. Hopefully they changed their recipe.
