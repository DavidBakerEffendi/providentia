My family and I have been supporting this business since it opened up under the "Get Fresh" name.  We have been to dozens of brunches here and always enjoyed them, as well as a rapport with Juventino.  We even made a point to come to dinner web it was just starting to be offered. So, imagine my disappointment and surprise when we were treated like absolute crap here a few weeks ago.   We have moved out of the city and I was super excited to return after being home with a newborn for weeks.  My sister was here from out of town and we drove in for brunch on a Sunday morning with my 8 week old daughter.  Upon arriving, we were happy to see a few tables open that could seat my sister and I, with enough room to put my infant Daughter's car seat discreetly beside us.  We were met by Juventino and told there would be a 90 minute wait.  We politely asked if we could sit outside and were told there was also a 90 minute wait.  Very disappointed, we decided to go elsewhere but hung around for a minute so that my sister could use the restroom. I proceeded to watch Juventino seat three groups of walk-ins, right in front of me, in groups of two, three, and four.  When I started to ask, he cut me off, saying "90 minutes." I'm not entitled, but I don't deserve to be lied to..if you have a no baby policy, just be honest about it or post something on your website.  You might be all written up in NY Mag, but you bit a hand that fed you.  I won't be returning.
