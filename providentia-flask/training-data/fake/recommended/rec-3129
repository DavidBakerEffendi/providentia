I visited Fonda this evening and had a very good meal. We started with the guacamole for 2.  I generally do NOT like guacamole, but I'm always willing to try and on occasion I do find a restaurant that prepares it to my liking.  This is one such place.  The portion was huge (could easily feed more than 2, in my opinion) and it came with both chips and mini tortillas. For my entree I got Pollos Norteno and it was flavorful, cheesy, and again a large portion.  It came with rice and beans.  I was unable to eat the whole thing and now have lunch for tomorrow!  The chicken was combined with cheese (I forget if it was Chihuahua or Oaxaca, ?????) and pickled onions of some sort.  It was really good. Service was standard, not intrusive (always a plus), and polite. All in all a good meal and I'd recommend it!
