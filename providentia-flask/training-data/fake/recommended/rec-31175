Three of us ate dinner there, and we were all blown away by the variety and quality of the food. The Saveur Creole sampler may have had the most delicious variety of appetizers I have ever encountered. The soups were a vegetable soup and a seafood soup - both fantastic. I believe the vinaigrette du jour for us was passion fruit - whatever it was, it was lovely - subtle but perfect. For main dishes we had the Conch Creole, a shrimp and salmon special, and the Haitiana (with shrimp). They all represented different Creole seasonings, and were jaw-droppingly delicious. I don't think any of the three of us had a bite of food that wasn't amazing. The service was exceedingly attentive and informative. Ron, the owner, spent a lot of time explaining the food and gave very specific recommendations as to which rice dishes would work best with which main dishes. I will go back again and again!
