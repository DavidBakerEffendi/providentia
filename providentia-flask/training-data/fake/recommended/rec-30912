3.5 Stars. (Yelp really need to allow 1/2 stars.) The pizza at Barboncino is a neapolitan style of pizza.  It's softer and more bread like rather than the thin and crispy  "NY" style of pizza.  I'm more of a fan of the thin and crispy style but don't mind mixing it up with a good neapolitan pie every once in a while.   Barboncino's pizza is good. Barboncino's pizza is right up there with the other neapolitan pizza place I've tried. (Paulie Gee's, Roberta's, etc.)  The space is really large and airy and bright - and when we, my girlfriend and I, went, a Tuesday around 7pm, we were able to get a seat right away. The CherryStone Clam pizza was good - it's no Frank Pepe's - but it'll do in a pinch.  They served whole clams rather than minced clams which was nice - i just wish there were more of them.  They were just too many clamless bites.  The bites with clams were great, the ones without were a little bit flat.  Adding some red pepper flakes helped add some depth to the pizza overall. The Margherita was very good with a nice, fresh tomato tasting sauce.  One of the better Margheritas I've had actually.   My only issues were some service errors.  We ordered the Caprese Salad Special with Burrata, a milky mozzerella, and our silverware was coated in the stuff.  We piled our appetizer plates on top of each other, then our silverware on top of that - thinking the waiter would take the whole thing away and replace our silverware.  Nope.  He actually removed the dirty silverware, placed them back on the the table, and took the plates away.  Ummm... Not a huge deal but kind of ruined the moment. I was intrigued by several other pizza combinations so we'll be back. (Especially since the kitchen is open late.)  If they work on the service a little bit more it would increase the overall pleasant dining experience and make it more of a "go to" place for me.
