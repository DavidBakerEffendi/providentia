We came down from upper Harlem to have brunch here and it was just okay. Â The staff is extremely friendly, but the food was so so. I had the biggie breakfast which came with a free drink (the big lini---champagne and grape juice). The steak was cooked well but wasn't a huge fan of the egg with a slice of cheese. The potatoes were just okay too. Bae had the chicken and waffles. The waffle was cold and nothing too exciting. The chicken was just okay, not really seasoned. Overall, I would only recommend this place for brunch if you're in the neighborhood.
