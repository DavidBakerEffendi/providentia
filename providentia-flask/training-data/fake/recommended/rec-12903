Right on queens blvd, Venturo offers a very cozy atmosphere. We didn't have reservations but were promptly seated when we arrived. We split a fantastically thin crust pizza and a chunky tomatoey Â ragu. Both were incredibly delicious!!! Our waitress was happy, attentive and helped us navigate their impressive wine list! Two very enthusiastic thumbs up for Venturo!!!
