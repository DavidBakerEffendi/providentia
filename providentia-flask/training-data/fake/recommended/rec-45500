We ate at Witherspoon Grill at least once a week for the 6 months or so we were in town. They have the absolute best bread (and creamy butter) in town. It goes great with a Hanger One Vodka Martini and Roasted Beet Salad. I am a vegetarian and so I usually have the beet salad or the apple salad. Their veggies are great and sometimes i get a side of 1/2 string beans and 1/2 asparagus. The people I go with there loved the meat dishes. They have risotto but it is chicken broth based. Parking is easy in the garage behind. I also enjoyed having dinner at the bar and listening to the live music on music nights.
