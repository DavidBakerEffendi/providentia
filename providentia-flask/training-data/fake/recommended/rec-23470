I've only eaten here once as every other time I have attempted, the wait has been too long! This is a bit annoying but testament to the fact that the experience is excellent. If only they were larger and could seat more people. On the one occasion that I did manage to get in, I was extremely hungover and the food was a perfect cure. My boyfriend and I shared the ricotta pancakes and the Moroccan scramble. Hell yes. Great for people watching and a cute date spot. The cocktails also look very appealing so I will have to put up with the queue next time and get smashed...then go back the next morning for some tasty TLC.
