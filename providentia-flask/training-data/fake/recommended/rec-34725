Near NYU and want some excellent Pho or Vermicelli? This place is definitely the spot to hit up. Though the seating is a bit lacking, I've never had to wait more than 5 to 10 minutes to get a table. I generally order the Pork Chop Pho and it has always been quite excellent here. It comes out fast and is piping hot and very flavorful. The Vietnamese Coffee here is pretty good as well. The only frustration I've had coming here is remembering that they're cash only.
