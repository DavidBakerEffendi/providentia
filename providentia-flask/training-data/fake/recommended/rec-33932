I love this place. And the original in WIlliamsburg. Food is executed perfectly. Cocktails are amazing. (And full of pellet ice!!! It is a weird obsession I have.) Â Steak is amazeballs, but the French Dip is my go to. It makes me think of meals my parents ordered in the 80s while my mom wore shoulder pants and my dad wore spirited golf pants. I love that restos are bringing the french dip back, and this one is one to relish. Oh, and the key lime pie rocks.
