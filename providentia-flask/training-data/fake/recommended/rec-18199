Ok, so maybe it's just me...but Jose P.'s seems to be experiencing a major identity crisis. Seriously, what is up with this place? The menu is mostly Mexican, but the beers are Belgian...the upstairs is filled with sportos and flat-screens, but the prices are gastro-pub-esque...I've only been to Jose P's twice, but both times, I've left feeling very confused. The food is not bad -- a little on the pricey side perhaps, especially considering other cheaper and more delicious Mexican joints (Pico de Gallo!) nearby. There's a fine beer selection, as others have noted, but who wants to eat a burrito with a framboise? Â Certainly not me. Also, the bathrooms...eek. I've had nightmares about Hell and this is what it looks like: a dark, dusty staircase in an abandoned fire tower, up ..1...2...3 flights, down an even dingier hallway, in a tiny room. I restrict my drinking at Jose P's just so I don't have to experience this monstrosity.
