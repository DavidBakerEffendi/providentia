This is for the Frank SInatra/Dean Marin dinner show not the restaurant. Show was really fun! Frank SInatra looked and sounded like the real deal! Dean was okay. Food was good...stuffed chicken breast, mixed beans, baked potato, salad. Delicious cheese cake for dessert! Waitress was a bit forgetful.
