Not sure I wanted to give it 5 stars because...well...who's perfect? This place is. My date and I sat at the bar initially. Fantastic barmen there. Good conversation, great information about the menu, so we decided to have dinner there, at the bar. Food was fantastic, drinks were great, conversation, atmosphere left me smiling as I walked out the door. 5 stars for a great Manhattan memory.
