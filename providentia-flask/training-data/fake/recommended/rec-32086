Wow!  I mean, holy crap, WOW! I have been meaning to write about this place for a couple of months, but fortunately, Nick's Roast Beef's success isn't hinged on my amateur opinion. They do just fine on their own... We came to visit my buddy who lives in South Philly.  He picks us up from the airport, and proceeds to show us how fearless a person can be behind the wheel.  He asked if we were hungry, and we answered with a resounding, "Sh!t yeah!" This is when I quietly thanked Fate for introducing me to my buddy 15 years ago.   Because if I wasn't his friend, then I would NEVER had eaten at Nick's! My wife and I each got ourselves the Roast Beef Combo with Gravy Fries.  But not the kind of creamy gravy that the Midwest has forced on us....NO!  This gravy is the juice that the roast beef had been lounging in all day.  Full of flavor, love, and bits of beef. The sandwich was messy, and the fries were messier.  Didn't care.  I mean, who can really care when their eyes are rolled back in their head while chewing on God's interpretation of a sandwich? So, just go.  If you're from out of town, grab a cab.  If you're from out of town and want the full experience, risk driving around the city and then reward yourself with a beautiful roast beef sandwich. Either way, just go.
