One of my first meals there was the chicken and biscuits.  Now, I'm not sure if it was the stoner in me or what, but that was one awesome plate of deliciousness, even having me licking the plate wanting some more. Had I written this review a few months ago based on that experience, I would have given this place at least a 4-starrer.  However, they NEVER change their menu other than changing a side with an entree.  If you're apart of a "farm fresh network", how can you not have seasonal entrees?   Simply b/c their lack of dinner imagination, I can't give them any higher rating than this.  If i got back there in the winter time and see their menu still hasn't really changed, I'm downgrading them even more.   Their beer selection is excellent, serving some of the best beers in burlington.  If this were a bar only, I would have given that 5-stars.
