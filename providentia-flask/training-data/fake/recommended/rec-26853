It's difficult to find chinese FRESH hand made noodles outside Asia. But the name itself caught my attention. Inside the restaurant you can see how they swing, pull and make the noodles all by hand. The traditional way. And the noodle soups are definitely worth coming, because it's not only the meat and the soup which makes this place worth coming, the highlight is obviously the noodles itself. Besides we got fried dumplings which was a great side dish. I think we paid $10 each. It's cheap and it's CASH ONLY.
