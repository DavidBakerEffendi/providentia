They finally opened.  Yippee.  Just went there with the family.  It was awesome.  The service was great, the place was clean, and the food delicious.  The best thing is they will make a burger (100% beef) without any toppings or bun -- I need this for my daughter who has allergies.  AND they don't charge you full price for just this one part of the burger.  Thanks, Smashburger.
