I dont know what the other people are talking about, this place is as good as or maybe even better than Sagami (plus no tolls). I went with three other people and two bottles of wine (Its BYOB). We ordered about 20 pieces of sushi and sashimi, plus miso, seaweed salad, a few appetizers and an entree, I believe. The Sashimi Sampler was so fabulous! The lime tofu sauce with the tuna and the octopus (or squid, cant remember) was so delicious. Miso was a hit. Salad was ok. Beef Negamaki and its accompanying side was yummy. The Live Scallop app was superb. After two bottles and the first round of food, we wanted more. We ran out for two more bottles of wine and reordered the sashimi sampler and few other favorites and added on the Paridisio Roll, and it was spectacular!! All in all, in was wonderful and our faux-Japanese server was adorable. Too expensive to go every week, but we will definitely be back, within the month
