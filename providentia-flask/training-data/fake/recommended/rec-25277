Closest thing to a California burrito I've found in NYC. Well seasoned meat, tasty ingredients, and a free Horchata with burrito purchase. Nice. So far I've tried the al pastor and pollo burritos, pollo quesadilla, carnitas tacos, and the delicious but dangerous nachos. I can't decide what's my favorite! (Ok, maybe the al pastor burrito, it was so tender and delicious) I haven't been let down yet. Glad some Mexican of this caliber has reached the east village!
