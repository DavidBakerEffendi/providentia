This place was fantastic! Went here for a birthday dinner last night with about ten people and the food and service were great!  Highly recommend the Mezzo Royale for a group of ten (about 12 small plates) then supplement with an entree for every two or three people. Trust me, with a bunch of guys who eat healthy portions and we were all stuffed!   The ambiance was great too!  Very NYC feel. Will definitely go back soon!
