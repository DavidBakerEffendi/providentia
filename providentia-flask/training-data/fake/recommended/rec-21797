I hosted a bridal shower here a few weeks ago. Easily the best event I have ever hosted/been to, and that is because of this restaurant. The food is INCREDIBLE. The staff were inviting, welcoming, helpful, and generous. Â The owner was amazing. He even took pictures for us and clapped along while the bride-to-be was opening presents. I have been to events before when there is a fixed price and the waitstaff has taken the attitude of, "You'll get what you get and I'm not going to try very hard." That was not the case here at all. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone because the food is incredible and next tie you are hosting an event, keep this place in mind because they will take care of you.
