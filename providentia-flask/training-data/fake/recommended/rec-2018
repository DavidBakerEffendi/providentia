Maybe they invented the Philly Steak, but they don't make the best one's. I've had much better. The line was long even when it was freezing outside & the rude guy taking orders was entertaining for his "South Philly" attitude. That's part of the game though; you go there to see if you can follow the rules & get your order right the first time without being sent to the back of the line. The cheese fries were pretty nasty & I like just about anything. The steak was ok.
