Let's see...how do I say this?....this place is awful. The waitress was rude, and I'm not sure why because my boyfriend and I were the only customers there on a Saturday night. Not a good sign. We decided against our better judgement and went in because we were starving. The mac and cheese was mac and soup, and the meatloaf sandwich gave us heartburn. We felt nothing but regret when we left. This place manages to barely get two stars because brunch here is halfway palatable, and at the time the waitress was a gem. You'll pay too much for dinner, but for brunch it's reasonable. It's really too bad because Willamsburg/Greenpoint is truly hurting for some good spots.
