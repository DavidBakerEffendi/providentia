Dear T.H.P.N, TASTY LISTEN TO ME! listen. listen....listen...listen...listen! [1] ** YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE ALL OF YOUR CURRENT FOLLOWING**  ** IF YOU DO NOT TURN YOUR ACT AROUND AND FAST.** I have been coming here for a cheap, decent meal for going on 2 years now.  Sadly, it has gotten worse and worse each time I have come. Meat quality is my major issue.   It's Chinatown, I get it.  It was never great to begin with, but has gotten WAY worse in the last 6 months.  About 14 months ago they started to receive a surge in business due to Zagat, Serious Eats, and Hot on Yelp.   What have they done?  They've gotten greedy.  Slid their once $4.50 & $5.50 meat noodle bowl prices up a tad... and skimped a tiny bit of meat out of each bowl. What the WHAT!  Im sorry choose one or the other but doing both of these does not cut it, jerk faces. HERE'S YOUR NEW YEARS RESOLUTION: - You will stop trying to scam people out of their money by putting increasingly  lesser quality meat in your soups. (Sometimes no meat at all only fat.) - You will not put 4 pieces of beef gristle in a bowl and call that beef meat. - You will not say seafood and give two mussels in the soup. - You will not say 'house mix such as oxtail etc.' and put in all crappy stuff and no oxtail... - You will have at least one employee who speaks english on at all times. - You will not consistently forget drink and app orders. ---- I took my brother here for dinner on a Friday night late night (9PM) and there was no one in the place.  We were the only people there but our order took forever. Our drink orders were forgotten.  When my brother and boyfriends Beef Noodle Soups  came out they proceeded to discreetly at first bite a piece of meat, deem it inedible and place it on the napkin beside the bowl.   I ordered the Shanghainese wontons in beef broth with Knife Pulled Noodles, which was BOMB [2] , and was happily eating when I started to become aware of what was happening.   They both looked so dismayed.  They each had a mountain of brown clear beef gristle hunks on their napkins.  It was so absurd I called the woman over to show her and they told her they so far had had ZERO pieces of real meat.  She shrugged.  I said THEY ARE STARVING please give them some real beef. She seemed highly reluctant but went into the kitchen and re-emerged a few moments later with two hunks of semi fatty / semi edible beef, each.  They put them in their soup and reported to me that it was refrigerator cold in the centers of each bite.   I encouraged them to eat more of my wontons and we were forced to order a side of dumplings to fill them up.  We all left a little hungry. The time before this I came and ordered the sweet/salty/spicy cucumber appetizer that I usually love at other asian stores.  When it came out it had an excess of chili oil and a dried pepper on it that numbed the tongues of everyone at the table that ate it.
