Oh-em-gee!   $5 drinks during happy hour????!!!! YES!   Oh, and the fried chicken, the cornbread and the mac and cheese are also good too! Cute place, nice people watching, and most importantly, GREAT food and drank. Go there now.   And ask for  a glass of milk to cool your mouth when you order the hot fried chicken.
