I pass this place all the time. At first, I thought it looked tacky. I wasn't really interested, even though there's always a lot of people dining there. When someone recommended it to me, I took a friend there. We didn't make a reservation and there was an hour wait but they had a table for two open and seated us immediately. That was lucky. Service was fast and amazing. We ordered tacos for two with shrimp and portobello mushrooms. It arrived pretty quickly and was delicious. I'd be willing to go back again to try the guacamole and margaritas that they're known for.
