Fabulous food! fun, cozy, loud, charming, LARGE portions, good NYC value. This wonderful restaurant has the BEST Italian food I have ever had!  Started with the artichoke salad then had the butternut squash ravioli.  Sampled everyone's meal at our table, all were delightful.  The tiramisu was so scrumptious. The table wine was smooth.  Make a reservation and enjoy!
