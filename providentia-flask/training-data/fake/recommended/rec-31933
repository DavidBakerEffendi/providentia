I really wanted to like Banh mi Zon, but the truth is that they can't hold a candle to their competition. The fact that they're located in the EV makes matters worse, as I'd walk a few extra blocks to eat at Nicky's, or Baoguette. The mango salad was vibrant and well-portioned, but lacked flavor. The owner said it was comparable to a papaya salad (which I wanted, but which they were out of), but I didn't detect any salty or sour. The lemonade was room temperature and tasted like water with a drop of day-old lemon juice in it. The banh mi bread was crispy on the outside, but there just wasn't enough inside of it, and what little there was lacked flavor. In my opinion, the owner is Banh mi Zon's one saving grace. He was one kool kat, with his drawn-out speech and straw fedora. He likes to talk about food, music and Vietnam, and the space is decorated with photos he shot throughout SEA. If he can bring up the quality of his food, Banh mi Zon will be one hopping joint. Until then, back to Banh Mi Saigon for their #1, which is still my #1.
