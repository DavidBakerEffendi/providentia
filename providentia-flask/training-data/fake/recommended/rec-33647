Alta is a fantastic restaurant. I went here recently on a date, and was extremely pleased with the atmosphere. The upstairs provided an intimate table and a great view of the larger parties below. The service left a little to be desired, but wasn't poor by any means. The food at Alta was good; some dishes were really really tasty. The presentation is nice, but the portions are small. 3-4 dishes per person are needed, and the bill can get up there fast! My favorite dishes I tried were the brussel sprouts, pan-roasted striped bass, and the house made pizza. I tried the fried goat cheese on the recommendation of the Yelp community and was slightly disappointed. They were very good, but I didn't see what all the fuss was about. The seared sea scallops were tasty, and an absolute MUST try was the braised short rib. It was possibly one of the most delicious things I have ever tasted. We didn't try dessert (Probably wouldn't have gotten it anyway, but since we were a little late for our reservation we weren't given the option. The check was dropped diner-style after our last plate was cleared - slight turn-off.) To summarize: Atmosphere - 5+ Service - 3 Food - 4
