Came here for breakfast. Parking was a bit a pain. Now for the food, I had the breakfast fritata which was decent. Mushrooms were delicious and not over cooked. The home fries were okay but not very tasty. The bread basket and chocolate croissant that accompanied breakfast was delicious! I may just come back for the bread basket.
