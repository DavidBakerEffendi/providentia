Pat Thai (and yes, it's "Pat", not "Pad", named after the charming lady-in-charge) opened recently in Lake Hiawatha after some years in Bloomfield.  (We were told they'd lost their lease.)  A little while back, they were shut down for a week due to a small fire, but are open again. The present location is at the south end of the Foodtown building, and isn't that easy to see from the street.  For those who are familiar with the area, it's where "Valentino's" used to be - they moved across Beverwyck Road.  Just look for the Foodtown sign.  There's plenty of off-street parking. Enough geography - on to the food.  Simply put, it's excellent, and if I had other superlatives beyond that, I'd use them.  Everything is prepared to order, even soups, so allow some extra time - it's worth it.   Prices at dinner are about par for suburban Thai restaurants, maybe a dollar or two lower.  Lunch prices are quite reasonable, and the portions are just right.  Service is attentive and friendly.  And it's BYO. One important point - READ the "Spice Levels" note on the menu.  To quote:  "We... give you spicy when you ask for spicy".  They won't take back food that you order too hot.  I asked for my Pad Thai at level 5, and Pat herself came to the table to be sure that I wanted it that hot.  And she took some convincing!  BTW, I'm used to spicy food, and that "5" was just right for me.
