Adorable Caribbean place in Prospect Heights near the Botanic Garden and Brooklyn museum. The boy had tripe soup that was tasty and had a good kick to it, but I thought the best part was the side of fresh avocado with olive oil- yum! I had the house specialty mofongo (green plantains mashed with your choice of meat and accompanying gravy). I went with shrimp- yummy! Just a warning, though, the hot sauce is HOT!! Adds a good kick but leaves the mouth tingling. Worth the hike if you're going to be in the area.
