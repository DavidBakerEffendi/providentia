When we first walked in, we didn't know where to sit because there was no staff available to help.  We then waited for someone to come.  They sat us in the back, right next to the loud speaker.  The music was so loud, we could barely hear each other talk.  Because Elbow Room and Morgans shared a kitchen, we thought that we could also order from that menu, but we couldn't.  I was hoping to order the pulled pork from the menu, but they were out.  We ended up ordering a sweet potato, collard greens, ribs, and briscuit.  The waitress said that this would be enough food for the right three of us.  Once we got the food and tried the collard greens, our mouths were on fire.  There wasn't much meat and all the food was put together on one tray, without any plates.  The meat had too much fat and it almost wasn't enough food.  I would not recommend going here.
