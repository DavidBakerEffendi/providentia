What can I say about this cart that hasn't already been said? Copious amounts of yellow rice and perfectly seasoned sauteed chicken. It wasn't until *after* I started frequenting halal carts in Brooklyn that I realized the quality of this place. Their white sauce is AMAZING, unlike the Bay Ridge halal cart on 86th St. whose white sauce tastes like ranch dressing!). Their hot sauce is as hot as it gets (think Mamoun's - not crap like Frank's hot sauce, aka heatless red salt). The line flows quickly, and there's a bench right around the corner to devour it all. So perfect. So serene in the afterhours. So delicious. So halal. You will be seeing my face again, and you know it, you saucy minx!
