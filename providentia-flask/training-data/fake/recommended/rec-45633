After eating here this morning and several other times over the past year it's time to write a review. I'll get right to the point. After this mornings experience I'll be all set if I never go back to this restaurant. The bad experience started with the wait to be seated. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind waiting. But I do mind when the host seats two couples before you that signed in after you. That's piss-poor. And when we politely addressed the host about this after being seated he brushed us off. So blonde-haired thirty-something in the white shirt on Sunday morning, you're a real douche. How hard is it to follow a sign-up list man? Really? So after we get our food, which was delivered by the host, he bolted without asking if we needed anything else or giving us enough time to even ask. Well guess what... We did. There wasn't any of their "special" ketchup on the table and ketchup is essential to home fries. So I had to flag down the busgirl in order to get some. Which speaking of the ketchup ain't so special. As a matter of fact it isn't good. It's just passable as something to dress up the potatoes. Â  Speaking of the food, it's really nothing to get excited about. It's kind of limited and honestly Sabrina's just around the corner is way better. So over the last year I've not been terribly impressed by Morning Glory but not enough for me to write the place off. But after this morning I'm done with the place. I'll give my business to Sabrina's where the staff are way more friendly, the menu has better choices, and the food is far better.
