We came in to place a place a take out order and have a few drinks at the bar which I saw they had on line. It was bizarre, but they would not let us sit at the bar, review the menu and then place the order. We had to stand by the cash register and then place a order before we could be seated. The cash register attendant who took our order was fairly familiar with the menu but did make factual errors. Once the order was taken, we were led to the bar which only had seating for 4-5 people. They had a cocktail menu, but regardless of what you ordered, the bartender (who by the way was the same cash register attendant) did not know any drinks and had to look things up or ask for help. They had no garnishes for drinks including lime wedges or cherries. The drink prices were not discounted despite the lack of knowledge, drink making abilities or even ingredients of ordered drinks. The food we took home. The serving portions were ok as was the food. Nan was a bit dry. Food did not leave you hungry. Not memorable either. It got the job done. I did forget to mention that the one item I would go back for was the hot n sour soup. It's an indo-Chinese take on a simple soup that was simply packed with flavor.
