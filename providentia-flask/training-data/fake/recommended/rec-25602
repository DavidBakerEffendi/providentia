One of my favorite pizza and Italian eateries hands down. I've been going to gencarellis for several years now. They are not expensive and you will get HUGE portions. If you are a big guy like me, you'll leave stuffed. If you aren't as big as me, you'll have lunch and dinner for the next day! Â Their chicken Sorintno and chicken parm dinners rock. Their meat lovers pizza is awesome. And Sylvia the waitress is outstanding. Great family place for pizza and Italian that won't break the bank.
