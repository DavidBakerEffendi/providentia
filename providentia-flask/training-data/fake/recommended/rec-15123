Osteria is a huge restaurant where we felt lucky to have gotten last minute 9pm reservations on a Saturday. The restaurant was busy and we waited at the bar for our table. The bartender actually came from behind the bar with a menu and took our drink order which was a nice touch. I had the "baba jah" (no idea if that's right!) but it was makers with art of the age rhuby and lots of lemon. It was delicious. We were seated behind the bar at a high top and started by attempting to order wine. Twice we ordered wine and twice we were informed they were out of it. Ended up with a bottle we liked but the process was painful. During the botched wine ordering process I tried to order us some apps to which the server responded "you have to order together or there will be a huge gap between the two- I know my kitchen." What? Moving on. We ordered the octopus and duck pate to start. The duck pate was under a thick layer of oil which was odd. Delicious but unnecessarily oily in an item already over the top. The octopus was amazing. So so tender. Finally the entrees. I had the brisket. Boyfriend had the rabbit. Rabbit was ok- would have been nice to have a veg to break up the rich meat and polenta. The brisket though. Ugh. It arrived swimming in grease. Swimming. Like I couldn't believe that the plate had been set down in front of me. Our weird service experience ended with the server running after us outside asking for our copy of the receipt so "he wouldn't have to pay for our meal." What? I am 1000% positive we left a copy with our cash tip. And then he came and took the other. It was just weird.
