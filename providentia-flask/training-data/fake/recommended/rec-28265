There's always a long wait for brunch, and in my opinion it's not worth it.  I had a crescent sandwich and the crescent was very hard.  Another time I had a chicken sausage sandwich which wasn't anything to rave about.  Service is alright, although the waitress kept reaching over us from the bench behind us.
