Great place to come and catch up with friends. Made a reservation online and actually requested to be seated away from the door. When I came in that offered me two options and I was able to choose were I wanted to be seated (sweet). Great wine choices. Great service. Why 4 starts? Because they need more food options. Thank you to all the staff, I will come back!
