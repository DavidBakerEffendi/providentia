Absolutely the best deli in town. The food is super cheap and very good considering the prices. I'm not kidding when I say you can order a sandwich and it will be ready by the time you grab a bag of chips and walk back to the counter. I've never seen sandwiches and food made so fast. The staff is very friendly and their breakfast is super good. Just your average deli/convenience store but a Greta one.
