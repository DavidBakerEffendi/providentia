The new location is not as good a the previous or the one in Fort Lee.   We never had a problem at BCD previously and ate at the old NYC and Fort Lee location numerous times.  This was our first time coming to their new location and we will not be coming again. My girlfriend and I ordered our normal.  A seafood regular (her), a beef regular (me), and a gal bi to share. Our order came with the usual fish, kimbi, and other free appetizers; however, when the entrees came out you can tell something changed.  When my fiance tried to eat the clams and oysters, they were not washed and were full of SAND.  The gal bi, which is normally full of flavor and tender, was undercooked, rubbery and full of fat.  For a $45 bill, the quality of the food is not worth it and you are better off finding another tofu spot in K-Town.
