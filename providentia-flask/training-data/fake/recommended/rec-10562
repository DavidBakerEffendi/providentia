I was in Plum two weeks ago after being away for over a year.....Unfortunately it still very unfriendly. ...when it first opened there was a warmth about it.  Now I am met with snotty servers who chat and gossip.  And the food....is definitely not the same as it was when it first opened.  I won't be going back.
