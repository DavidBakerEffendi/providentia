How terribly tourist of me. I only went because someone who lives in the city told me it was his favorite Italian joint. I can kind of understand, why, though. They do serve really good food here. It's not the best or the most authentic Italian cuisine I have ever had in my life, but it's quality ingredients prepared with style. Chicken parmigiana, the massive family style size salads, rigatoni with broccoli, manicotti.... (really good arabiatta sauce, very important) and plenty of vegetarian options as well as satisfying and meaty Italian classics. Enough to go around the table four or five times per plate. Also - the desserts are really good. The tiramisu, especially, is to die for (don't order unless there are six people or more at the tale, or someone who wants to take it home). And the first time I went a very very hot Brazillian man served us. I died.
