the regular dinner i had here off the menu was good, not great.  very interesting drinks, tasty bites but not mind blowing.   i came back for the pork butt dinner.  holy crap! I will dream of that meal for weeks.  if you have 5 friends, do it.  if you dont, get 5 strangers off the street and do it.  amazing pork, oysters, korean sides, aahhhhhhhh, i cant take it.  i have to stop writing, its making me too hungary
