Driving into town with hunger rumbling in our bellies, we were looking for a place to eat on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Â Since we'd been disappointed by our last VT diner, we thought we would give Dan's a try. The dining car showed years of use but is in fairly good shape. A fine example of a Worcester car, with lots of chrome. It was fairly quiet, so we got a lot of attention form the staff. I ordered a chicken club with fries. The fries were greasey, but house made. The club was done perfectly. My partner had a grilled cheese sandwich, a perennial winner to his palate. He very much enjoyed Dan's version. We both liked their cole slaw..fresh, house made, and not sweet or creamy. The best part of the meal...ample bread pudding! The custard was rich and eggy and the sweet taste of maple was prominent throughout the dish. YUMMMY! We enjoyed the staff and meal...sorry you had such a lousy expereince there, Matthew! Try it for a meal other than breakfast and see what you think.
