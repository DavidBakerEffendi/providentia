Came here based on all of the reviews. It was 2:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday, and we were getting some work done to the car at a pep boys near by, and had some time to kill. THE BAD 1. No lunch menu 2. Other reviewers said it was so inexpensive? Not true. 3. As others have mentioned, service isn't very good. Took forever to get the bill. It took so long I went up and paid it at the counter like we ordered takeout. 4. Our server didn't speak English very well. 5. They don't have lemons? Who doesn't have lemons for water? Odd THE GOOD 1. Nice place 2. Steak was good We won't be back
