Wow! I had high expectations from an Iron Chef but this place truly blew my mind. The Kampachi was phenomenal! The octopus and Gnudi were mouthwatering deliciousness. I would eat here every night if I could! The chicken under a brick is huge, def enough for two to share on a date or even three girlfriends enjoying a night out. Everything I tried was seasoned perfectly, had great flavor and made me want to come back for more! So glad I was introduced to this downtown gem!
