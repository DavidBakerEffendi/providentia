I went to Modo Mio for the first time a few weeks ago, and absolutely loved it! We were able to get a last minute reservation the day before, which was great, and the restaurant was packed when we got there. We both did the prix fixe menu, and the price was pretty inexpensive, especially given that the place is BYOB. My first course was a seared scallop, and the scallop was cooked perfectly. I also had the pasta special with Tiger Shrimp, and the sauce was delicious. It came with about 4 pieces of shrimp too, which I thought was decent. The star of my meal was the fried steak. It was cooked to the perfect temperature, fried, and sitting in butter, and I ate every single piece. Also, the dishes seem small at first, but I was completely full by the end of the meal, so very deceiving. The only thing I did not love was that the restaurant was extremely small and loud, so it was more difficult to carry on a conversation. However, I would go back in a minute!
