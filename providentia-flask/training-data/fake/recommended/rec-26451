I ate here back in July when they still had 1 Michelin Star (they had received this after being open for only 2 years!), and knew after my meal they would easily attain a 2nd star in the next Michelin guide. Unsurprisingly, they did. At the time, the restaurant was still fairly new, and almost empty when I went (only one other table was being attended to). This is one of my top 3 favorite restaurants in the world, accomplishing what I had always been skeptical of -- refined, world class, fine dining-style Asian cuisine. Put simply, Jungsik has managed to perfect Korean classics. The meal was still true to its roots but brought a level of detail, freshness, and finesse unmatched in the Asian food scene. They're new and quickly making a name for themselves in New York City. Go eat there now before it becomes near impossible to make a reservation in the future.
