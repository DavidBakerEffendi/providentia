So, I must write an update to my previous 5-star review. After going back a second time with my family, we all enjoyed a big, communal lunch followed by some dessert-like smoothies. Everything was delicious; however, 3 out of the 4 of us had some unpleasant gastrointestinal issues not too long afterward. I don't know the exact cause was, but when 3 out of 4 people (who live in different houses and don't share any other food) have tummy trouble after a meal, I get suspicious. I haven't completely crossing this one off of my list, but I'm not ready to go back for a while.
