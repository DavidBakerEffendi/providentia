By Far the BEST breakfast place I've ever eaten in, their sugar coated bacon is to die for. and their tasty delicious french toasts and pancakes are absolutely unforgettable!. Better arrive there early, There's ALWAYS a line, (even on weekdays). To: Lori Y. If you think this place isn't so good, show me the places that you prefer. either these restaurants are Hidden Jewels or your an Anton Ego.
