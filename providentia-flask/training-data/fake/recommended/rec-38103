My friends and I came here the morning after a bachelor party and it was just what the doctor ordered. Nice big portions of delicious, hearty food that wasn't overly greasy like you find in some diners. The service was also excellent - it's a family run business in its third generation, and Earl was a lot of fun to talk to. I definitely plan to come back next time I come through Burlington.
