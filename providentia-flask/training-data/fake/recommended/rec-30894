Great addition to the neighborhood, local entertainment while in line. I love the idea of this place. Went on a Saturday afternoon. Bought two scones, pizza bread and a chai bun, and coffee. Looked great, but everything was burnt on the bottom, even the caramel on the bun was way hard and stuck to your teeth. Rather disappointed, especially since all of the reviews here are so good. Must have caught them on a bad day? I want it to be good.. I'll give it another try. Keep ya posted.
