Ola is a hidden gem!  Located in a very odd strip mall with a confusing entrance and parking situation - once you are inside, you forget where you are!  The staff is lovely - every time!  I never had poor service.  The drinks are spot on and reasonably priced.   And the food...the food is always spot on.  The guacamole is wonderful - but ask for extra chips.  I have had almost everything on the entree menu and i have never been disappointed.  The flavors are great and the meat and fish is always cooked perfectly.  I highly recommend!
