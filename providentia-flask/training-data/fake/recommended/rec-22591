The ambiance is comfortable, like ones living room/den, where one eats, talks, writes, watches TV.  That was the feeling I got from this place.  The food menu is sparse, but most the meals appear home cooked and thus explains the minimal food list  But, the food was good, and nutritious.   It is a nice place for brunch, with good service. It is hard to park around Union, so best you walk .... if you can.  Or bike!!!!
