No stars. The place was packed when we went most likely because of the playoffs during baseball season. All we ordered was a turkey hoagie and two slices of BBQ chicken pizza. 30 minutes later our order is called!?! We go to pay but the cashier discovers the slices are not there. She hollers for the missing slices and tells us sorry it will be a few minutes more. We wait at the counter were the pizza oven is directly in front of us. We watch the guy on the pizza detail toss out slices and pies none of which belong to us. We stare at the cashier like "seriously?" She hollers at the pizza guy again. We watch in disbelief as he continues to carry on with his own agenda. I'm about to freak out but before I can tear into them my diplomatic husband is asking for a refund which we promptly received. Cityview has been just as crowded on an ordinary weekend and still can manage to whip out your order not only a timely fashion but also with out harassing them. And their food is good. We will never ever return to Fairmount Pizza and Grill
