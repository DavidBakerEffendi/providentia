This place gets such a bad rap from food snobs because it's a "chain." I'll take a chain like this any day as long as the food is fresh and tasty and the service is prompt and professional. They have amazing steaks and they cook them to specification (steaks should only be rare, but to each...). great apps, sides, and the bartenders are more than capable. A bit pricey for a chain, but hey, this ain't Houlihan's.
