This place is in the middle of nowhere but it is soooo good.  BF's boss highly recommended it & he was right on!  Our favorite dishes were the duck shwarma & the brussels sprouts.  Although everything else was fantastic, I can't stop thinking about the duck & the brussels sprouts.  Soooo good. We met some regulars at the next table who helped us with our order.  Unfortunately our room was soon filled by a large, obnoxious group that I'm convinced were either young investment bankers or other corporate types.  Either way they were completely oblivious to the couples around them trying to enjoy a romantic meal.  Despite this intrusion I still have fond memories of ilili & I look forward to returning when we're next in town.
