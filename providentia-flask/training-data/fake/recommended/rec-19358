OMG the portions are huge!  Humongous.  I came with 10 people and not one of them could finish their meal.    Brunch is not something you should have leftovers from.  This place is like a diabetic's worst nightmare.  The french toast was gigantic, stuffed with various cheeses and covered in syrup.  I was slightly sick watching people eating it.   I started with the Hot Chocolate which was made from scratch and covered in whipped cream.  Excellent! Next I shared the chicken soup, which was also made from scratch but only so-so. Then came the fish tacos.  The tacos themselves were good and came with a huge side of your choice of potatoes.  The fries were a total disappointment, but I couldn't have eaten them because the plate had 3 tacos on it!  The fish was fresh, the tacos delicious and I left stuffed, but slightly disgusted by the amount of food we were served.  Although they say Baja style, they are not breaded and deep fried.  Instead the fish is sautéed and quite light for Philly. If you don't want to leave with metabolic disorder, try the fish tacos.  They are the best I've had outside California and Mexico.
