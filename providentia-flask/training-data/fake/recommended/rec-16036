Chef park, you are the man! Thoroughly enjoyed your company, watching you and your boys prepare some excellent dishes for us, and the food... Yes, the food is excellent. Anyone who says its not, really needs to have their taste buds checked. Everything is clearly fresh, and mostly hand made. As a darn good cook myself, I found the best part was being able to sit "ring side" and watch all the food come together for you. Yeah, its cash only. Big deal. Find an ATM. Grow up. So they have no rest room, ok, its tiny so come prepared. Oh, and its BYOB? You will pay around $10 for your own bottle of wine instead of $30+ consider yourself lucky! Spend it on the excellent food Chef Park has put together. Enjoy! Oh and one more thing, I will be back with more friends.
