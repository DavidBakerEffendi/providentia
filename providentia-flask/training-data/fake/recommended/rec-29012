The kids loved it, I guess that's all that really matters. I was not impressed with the food but it was my daughter's 12th birthday and she felt like she had the golden ticket to Willy Wonka's castle. Max Brenner's is perfect for special occasions but not some place that I would consider being a regular as the food left much to be desired. Since I am not a chocolate fan, I was not overly impressed by the desserts either.
