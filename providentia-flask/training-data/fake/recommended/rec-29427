Stumbled onto this place while looking for a gas station near the Newark airport.  Think it's a local haunt, and maybe a "best kept secret" kind of place.   Lots of neighborhood patrons; felt a little like we were interlopers - but not because of bad service or any "what are you people doing here?" vibe.  Service was good - as was the food.   Inexpensive. Good quality.  Nice flavor.  Kind of surprised nobody's reviewed it yet.  I'd give it a solid 3.5 stars.
