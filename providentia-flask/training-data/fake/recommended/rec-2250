Classic Italian comfort foods done right.  The pizza was thin and crispy with great prosciutto and cheese.  We slip a special lobster paste that was perfectly done with just a little heat to the dish.  I ended with the rabbit over a nice creamy polenta.  The only poor execution was that the side of polenta my wife order had a very strong wood smoke flavor that was not appealing at all.  They finished it in the wood burning oven which just takes over the polenta.  The waiter quickly took care of us though with another choice but we were full already so they took it off the bill without question.   Great service from this nice but loud location.
