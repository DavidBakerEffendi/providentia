Stopped in after seeing a show with my sister and they were happy to serve us even though the kitchen was set to close soon. We each had tom yum soup, edamame, salt and pepper shrimp and shrimp rolls (can you tell we like shrimp?). Besides the soup, the food was not crazy flavorful but that was one of the best bowls of tom yum I've ever had. The prices were very fair, the servers were kind and attentive, the decor was awesome and I liked the music. All in all a great atmosphere, perfect spot for a date.
