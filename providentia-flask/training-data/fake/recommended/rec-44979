The red white and blue is the way to go if you're a fan of raw oysters. With 6 pieces of oyster and a drink for $8, that's a decent price for NY standards. Oysters were fresh, which made us ravenous for more. We ended trying every type they had, all if which were if decent quality. If you're in the mood for seafood, don't forget to check this place out.
