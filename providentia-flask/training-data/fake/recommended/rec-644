I went there last night and the food was phenomenal. So full of flavor. Our waiter was so attentive and gave us great suggestions about what to order. We did the tapas size of the calimari, shrimp in green sauce and the crabmeat crepes. We also got the cheese platter because I love cheese - even though the cheese was a little on the pricey side. Great red sangria as well. It was a very enjoyable experience overall. I felt like I was back in Spain .
