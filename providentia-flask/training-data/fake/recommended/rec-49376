This quaint vegan sushi joint is the ultimate healthy treat. Whether you are preparing to do battle at nearby Trader Joes or coming down post-yoga, Beyond Sushi is a great choice. I am really intrigued to try their house-made almond butter. Apparently if you buy a jar, your next refill will come at half price. My only complaint is that this place is pretty small.
