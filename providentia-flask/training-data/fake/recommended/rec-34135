I love this place. They know since I go multiple times a week. So, it's in a "cursed location" which is one of those storefronts which seems to go out of business every year. However, this place has, hands down, the best tomato sauce you're going to taste. They make it from scratch so it's ridiculously delicious. I either get the spinach & mushroom stromboli which comes with the sauce or I get the caprese salad which is deliciousness in its own right (although devoid of tomato sauce). The best thing about this place is the price. Freaking delicious stromboli for $6? yes please!
