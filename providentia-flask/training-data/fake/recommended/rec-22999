Church and Main was a big disappointment. First, we had a reservation for three people. We were inexplicably seated at a table for six, which felt awkward. After asking for another minute to make out drinks decision (we had just been seated) we were left for 10 minutes before our waiter returned. Drinks and first course took about another 10 and 25 minutes to arrive respectively. A $13 glass of wine had a really stingy pour. At one point the waiter knocked one of my forks onto the seat and picked it up off the seat and put it back on my setting without offering a replacement (!). The lasagna was served on an awkward long wooden board that the server oddly jerked onto my wife's setting ramming everything else out of its way as if the bread plate was a bumper car. Lastly, when refilling water glasses he picked up each glass with his fingers by the rim of the glass. Gross. Basically for the price you can do much better in Burlington. Please improve waiter training.
