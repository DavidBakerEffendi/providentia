Was eager to try this...really for a first time it's 3.5 stars...pizza Â good...they won't let you spoil it with a topping...which is a shame because pepperoni or cappacolla with a little crisp around the edges would have been great,,,the calamari antipasta was very good...I would have that again...I have to say the server to diner ration was perhaps the best I've ever seen so service is an a+. We will be back
