Another fantastic surprise delivered by a hole in the wall restaurant. My friends and were taken in by the bright orange awning and were delighted to discover their menu - it's a series of point-to-order graphics taped to the counter. A chicken, an egg, a pepper - fantastic. The girl taking our order did speak english though and we ordered two chicken wraps with pesto each. ( i can't remember exactly what they were called but they were about the size of an enchilada and two was a meal for me...i could go for three on a hungry day maybe) What I had was slightly spicy, but i'm sensitive to things like that. I would say maybe a 3 out of 10 on spice. Definitely a good lunch spot though.
