A friend had told me about Umami burger, and he isn't typically a "foodie", the way he emphatically described it I knew I had to try it. I now understand what he was talking about! I normally eat as if I'm in prison, but once I had the first bite of my truffle burger, I knew I didn't want it to end! It was cooked perfectly medium rare and the flavor was explosive. I truly had a moment of Umami! The skinny fries were the perfect addition to the burger. If the fries had been too thick it would have offset the awesomeness of the burger, but they were just perfect. I cannot wait to go back to Umami the next time I'm in NYC!!
