I have ordered from here several times since they opened this location. Their other location is in the Lawrence shopping center.   I have only ordered pizza and cheese steaks from here so far. I would like a little more cheese on the cheese steak, but I have been spoiled by Sandykes/kelvys/submarias over the past 30 years. Their specialty pizzas are good and better than most in the area. Try their buffalo chicken pizza you will not be disappointed.  I would not recommend ever buying a regular pizza and adding toppings as their price for added toppings is extremely high to the point of absurdity. Delivery is quick and my order has always been correct. I order through eat24 as they give me a $2 coupon an delivery is only $1.
