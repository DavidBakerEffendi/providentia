So you are wondering around the Highline area, taking pictures-or trying to and the rumble in the your stomach starts to kung fu you from the inside out....look no further! Flutter-yeah I said it- your way down to Cookshop. I have now been there twice, once for dinner and now for brunch. It was amazingly fantastical.  The wait staff is super helpful-or at least mine was. I ordered fried egg sandwich-only order this if you love pork.  The sausage is homemade and the flavor is amazing-but overpowers the rest of the sandwich! Another person had the pancakes with caramelized bananas-and get this, they put cinnamon in their butter-GENIUS.  That in combo with the super fluffy melt-in-your- mouth batter that Aunt Jemima herself would be jealous of- is enough to make anyone try and concoct (haha I love saying that word) this recipe at home....for uhm, er, a variety of reasons. ;) Definitely try this place out! It is super busy so you have to go to open table and make a reservation (we were last but the host was gracious enough to let us slip in past the flood of karate-chopping kung fu bellies waiting to devour their brunch menu. Two thumbs and a big toe up from me!
