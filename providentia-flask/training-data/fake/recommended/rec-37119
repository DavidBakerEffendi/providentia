What a cute spot. Went here with co-workers and loved being able to order tons of tapas to share and try them all! We were able to get a reservation, but we also went on a Monday. Started off with their red sangria pitcher - which became our drink of the night and kept ordering it. Tastes great! We had a party of 4 and were seated in this intimate booth which worked out nicely for conversation and minimal distraction. Tapas tapas tapas...we ordered so many and I unfortunately am bad at remembering the names of them but luckily our server was really knowledgeable. We ended up getting the specials, some from the menu - make sure to get a mix of hot and cold ones, some meats and some veggies. Make sure to save some room for dessert and get the Torta de Santiago!
