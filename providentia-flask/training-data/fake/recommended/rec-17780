My family and I went to Fernandes for the Chrisfmas Buffet.  I was very disappointed.  The buffet was 1-5..,,and I arrived at 2:30.  They did not replenish any of the food.  And what was left was dried out and cold.  And at 46.95 (plus tax and tip) I was hoping to get my money's worth.  Needless to say I didn't have much to eat.  The only good thing was when Santa came.
