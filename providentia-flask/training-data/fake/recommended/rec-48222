Great cheesesteaks..thank goodness they don't chop it to death because I hate that.  Sides were good...Not as expensive as Geno's and Pat's and less crowded.  My husband will usually stop around the dinner hour if I know he's working in Philly that day.  We lived near the Italian market and remember when Pat's and Genos was super cheap and not a tourist trap.  I always get extra cheese on mine with onion because I love the drip.  Yummy....  :)
