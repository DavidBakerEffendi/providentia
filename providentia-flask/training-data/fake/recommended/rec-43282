Been here a couple of times, once for dinner and once for a private company happy hour. The dinner was solid, what I've expected from dining at other Ruth's Chris locations (Austin, Atlantic City). The side dishes are all a la carte and not included with your entree. I'm a little torn about this, because I would like a small portion of potatoes, but the side dish is so huge and I don't like wasting food or overeating. I ordered the chicken and it was great! Very well seasoned and moist. My date had the filet mignon, although there was a bit too much butter on it for my taste. The private happy hour was great! We had an array of cold and hot appetizers (cheese, fruit, bruschetta, chicken skewers, sliders, crab cakes, bacon-wrapped scallops). The wait staff was very attentive/frequent in coming to get drink orders, but without interrupting the flow of conversation between colleagues. Great service!
