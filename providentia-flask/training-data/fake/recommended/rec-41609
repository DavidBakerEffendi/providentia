This place was highly recommended to us as the best Italian place in South Philly.  What a disappointment it was though!  My girlfriends and I came to dine early Saturday evening with a prior reservation - we were seated right away. The atmosphere was nice but borderline pretentious, but did not go well with plastic glasses and outdated/plain dishware.   Live performance was a cute touch - however it looked as the performers were only signing for the regulars.  We never got approached to request a song, whereas older people at the next table did.  The food was mediocre to say the least  - canned mushrooms in the pasta sauce, overcooked gnocchi, octopus dish that tasted like it came from a can as well. White Pizza I ordered was dry and plain. Although the waiter was nice and polite,  I had to ask for a manager to inquire about ginger ale that was charged 4 times.  Apparently, no free refills for soft drinks.  Be sure to ask the waiter, as it's not written anywhere. The manager was EXTREMELY rude about this matter - he talked to me like I was his friend:-0    "hey, listen...."   - that's not how you address your customers! Overall, my upset stomach, $10 gingerale and offensive manager left an unpleasant first impression of a "pizzeria LaScala wanna-be".  I would not recommend this place to anyone - if you want to have a real Italian food and a great experience go to Le Virtu.
