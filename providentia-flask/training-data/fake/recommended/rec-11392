4.5 stars...but I'll round up to 5, because everything at this restaurant was so on point.  Izumi is what dining out is *supposed* to be - quality ingredients that you wouldn't necessarily throw together at home, moderately priced for the quality/quantity of food, comfortable and classy, friendly service, outdoor seating, BYOB. We went for an omakase on a Tuesday night.  4 courses for $35.  Let me start off by saying that the portions were HUGE.  After the two appetizers I could barely finish my entree.  So yes, $35 was well worth it.   The sashimi was so(ooooooooo) good.  Yellowtail, tuna, salmon, fluke and mackerel (which was marinated in a special house sauce) - each piece was better than the next.  I can't wait to go back and order some of my favorite rolls a la carte. Also of note was the dessert: a rasberry white chocolate bread pudding with a scoop of white chocolate gelato on top.  The gelato stopped me in my tracks - I was not expecting it to be that good.   The chefs have a wonderfully diverse repetoire, from italian-style fluke carpacio in ginger oil to seared tuna over a bed of good ol' American corn.  I will be back asap to try their other offerings.
