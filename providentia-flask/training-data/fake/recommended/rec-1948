Carmine's is best enjoyed with a large group.  We went after a show and the service was great, but the portions are huge.  Normally it's not an issue, but when you're taking the leftovers back to a hotel - you're screwed.   The food was fantastic - we ordered calamari and spaghetti and meatballs (tried and true), and both were really delicious.
