I was headed up to Penn for a wedding and we decided to stop at Geno's and Pats. Pats had a shorter line so I went here first. The cheese steak was real good, The only problem was the bread got so soggy after a couple of bites I liked the peppers they had to put on the sub. I just didn't like the flies!
