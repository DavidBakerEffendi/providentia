Good late dinner at Print after a shaky start at the empty bar (involving mis-attributed orders and a bartender with a poor, accusatory attitude - unwarranted and unpleasant, especially with $17 cocktails). Things improved after we were seated following a 15 minute wait, and a squealing bachelorette party at an adjoining table mercifully decamped shortly thereafter. Nice vibe, sleek decor and tolerable noise level. Service was unobtrusive and cordial. I started with the prosciutto-arugula salad with shaved parmesan, plums and lemon vinaigrette. This was good, but would've been better with the prosciutto more integrated into the salad instead of plastered to the plate under the greens. My entree of grilled red snapper with littleneck clams, chorizo, potatoes, fennel, roasted peppers and yellow wax beans in a lobster broth was delicious: perfectly cooked and fresh fish, harmonious composition of other ingredients, and appealing presentation. Quality of ingredients was high. For dessert I had a mix of sorbet and ice cream. This was oddly bungled -- a round scoop of vibrant plum sorbet, but the two other selections (good rosemary and chocolate-mint ice creams) were inexplicably served as flat, melting blobs placed atop one another. With wine and drinks, tab came to $110/head including tip. While not a destination restaurant, I'd go back to Print for dining in this neighborhood.
