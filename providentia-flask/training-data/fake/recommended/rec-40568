Meh. The atmosphere is nice. And the food was okay (not bad, but not fantastic for a $20 chicken pot pie). But we waited 45 minutes outside because of how crowded the waiting area was. There were 6 of us and when we were finally seated we were brought to a 4 person booth. Very cramped. And part of the booth was broken. I couldn't even finish my meal because I had no space to cut anything. I gave up. It was an okay experience, but I'd never bring a party of more than 4 people. Ideally two.
