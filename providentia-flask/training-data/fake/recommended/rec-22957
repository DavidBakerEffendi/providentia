Just had sushi here, the octopus was still frozen and crunchy and the rice was squished and sticky. The worst sushi imaginable, Asiana or San Sai have far better sushi and service. The waitress was very polite but the chef was half asleep when we came in and she had to wake him up in order to have him hastily throw that sushi together. I hope I don't get sick.
