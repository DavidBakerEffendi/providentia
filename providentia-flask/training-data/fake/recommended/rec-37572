Move over Han. This is the REAL real thing. My wife and I have been fans of Szechuan since we came back from a trip to that province and were happy to find Han Dynasty on our return (shortly after it opened at its initial location). We found this by accident recently while hungrily strolling through Chinatown and tried it. We've since returned and recommended it to family and friends. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the extensive menu. I prefer it to the wilder flavors at Han Dynasty, and the prices are better. Seems really authentic, and I should know.
