After reading the great reviews on Yelp I came here on a raining day for lunch. The place is on the corner and its super cute. They have postcards and nicknacks all over which give the place a cozy feeling. I decided to go with the croquet madame which is one of my favorites when it comes to French cuisine and my lunch buddy had a crepe. Mine dish was delicious and it was paired with a nice, light, mix green salad. Since it was cold out I went with the mulled wine, it was good but not the best I ever had but hey it was only $6 a cup. For dessert I went with the banana flamb√© crepe, it was delicious and had plenty of rum :) I will be back to try some other dishes.
