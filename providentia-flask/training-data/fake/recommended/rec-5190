my brother-in-law took my wife and I here for breakfast because it is one of his favorite places in town.  We went here on a Sunday morning and at first I was pretty skeptical because of the wait that we had in front of us.  We were told 20 minutes but it was more like an hour.  Even though we were starving we decided to wait it out because he promised that the food was that good.... He was dead on!  The food here is amazing!  It is very fresh and unique.  Our group had a cheese steak omelet, cannoli stuffed French toast, Ruben with onion rings, and the loaded potato hash.  Everything was perfect.  The wait staff was also very friendly and you could tell that it was an enjoyable place to be.  We WILL be back to this place again.
