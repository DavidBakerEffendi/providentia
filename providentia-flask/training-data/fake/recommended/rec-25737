I've been craving thai food for awhile now, and was very happy to have found this place.  Had tom yum soup, spring rolls and dumplings for appetizers, and the pad thai and red curry as entrees.  Overall, it was pretty good.  My only gripe was the lemon for the pai thai - that lost me on the authenticity right there.  It would have been so much better with a slice of lime - so the pai thai came out a little sweeter and not as tangy as I'm used to.
