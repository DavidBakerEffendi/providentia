Artichoke appetizer was delicious -- perfectly seasoned and very flavorful. Spinach-ricotta gluten-free ravioli with spicy red sauce was so so so incredibly good.  You can't even tell the raviolis are GF at all, and the sauce paired perfectly with.  Neatly plated, and they even split into 2 plates because we were sharing. Service was attentive and efficient.  Nice that the first thing the ask is whether you have any food allergies.  Loved this place.
