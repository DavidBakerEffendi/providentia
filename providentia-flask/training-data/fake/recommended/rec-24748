I thought this place was great, but somehow just not all that memorable. We both ordered the Matador, which was a margarita made with Cabo Wabo Tequila and passion fruit purée. Simply best drink I have ever had in my life. Huge props to the bartender. For appetizer we had oysters, which typically I love, but these tasted very fishy to me. We also had the foie gras with lemon ricotta appetizer. The foie gras was seared perfectly with the most amazing flavor as one can only expect from foie gras. I thought the accompanied peaches and peanut nuts were a bit odd, but overall it actually came together nicely. One thing I didn't like about the dish was the lemon ricotta. It was light and creamy but the addition of an overwhelming amount of fresh rosemary was just very strange. It was so overpowering indeed that it's all I tasted. I had pieces in my teeth. Luckily, I had a nice amuse-bouch still left to wash it down with. It was a shot of the most scrumptiously delicious mushroom soup. Just perfection. Wish they had that on the menu! For entrées we had a skate wing with gnocchi and a seared sirloin with farro and beets. Skate was good and had a nice sear to it. The gnocchi were incredibly light and yummy. My husband did complain that there were only about 5 of them in the entire portion. My steak was cooked to perfection. The side very good but nothing spectacular. For dessert we had the coconut cream cake which was good but not memorable. The place overall was a little odd. I guess because it's tiny. I though the bathroom location right next to the coffee prep station was a little weird. I also thought it was odd for such a small and highly rated restaurant to be practically empty at 8:30 on a Saturday night. Our waitress was a little dry and not very enthusiastic. Overall it was a good experience but missing some zing.
