Yelp Friends please dont shoot me for rating this place 3 stars.I know its tremendously popular.This review is only for take out and I promise I will update my review once I have dined in. After reading some of the last reviews on Empanada Mama, I was determined to at least try their take out atleast.We tried twice the same week and their service is very efficient.They even offered to bring our order to the car. Somehow the empanadas failed to hit the spot.They were pretty inexpensive at $2.80 each but somehow the flavor was not something that will stay with you long enough to come back for it again.We tried the chicken, mushroom, spinach Â all whole wheat and baked.And we also tried the fig and cheese for dessert.They were all good..Just lacked a flavor profile. There are tons of other things that I would like to try which I would leave for when we dine in.They are open 24 HOURS which is a such a plus for midnight snack and I know Ill be picking up food from here often.
