It's so easy to miss this nondescript hole in the wall. With no outstanding signboards, eye-catching neon lights or anything, you might not even realize it exists! But Yakitori Totto is THE bomb. There are some scary sounding items on the menu (who could've thought you could eat chicken bone?) But after trying the soft chicken bone on a skewer, I am a total convert. The yakitori is not oily and gently seasoned with just salt or mild sauces so as not to take away from the natural flavor of the food. And man is the food awesome. I especially recommend the chicken meatball on a stick. It is delish. The seaweed salad is also really great if you're into stuff that's slightly tangy. It's vinegary, so it makes for a great appetizer! I also really, really liked the Japanese riceballs here. I highly recommend both the miso and soy sauce flavored ones. Just thinking about them makes me hungry. If you're a veggie fan, try the asparagus and mushrooms. They are done ever so perfectly -- and, more importantly, the vegetables are FRESH! Finish off your meal with the green tea pudding (served with azuki beans) and you'll be satisfied and happy for the night. The service staff are really polite and nice. I was served a regular coke instead of a diet coke by mistake and they gave me a fresh drink on the house. The yakitori chefs (three young Japanese guys) are also MAJOR EYE CANDY if you sit by the grill. Not too pricey either, so you'll love this gem of a restaurant. =)
