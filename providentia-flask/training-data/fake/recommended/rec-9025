Saneel R. brought me here as one of his city favourites....and the wait was worth every second.  Aside from a small, but excellent scotch selection, the bone marrow was the absolute highlight of the evening.  Like Avec's bacon-wrapped chorizo-stuffed dates, this is a must-order and will rank in your Top Five Dishes In The World list.  I also ordered the fried chicken - the portion was ample and delicious: crunchy on the outside, juicy and flavorful on the inside (it is admittedly hard for me to rate any fried chicken as off-the-charts after having Eat Green Foods & Sunday Dinner's Double Batter Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Honey Butter).   The wine list is fantastic, and the ambiance is small enough to be intimate without being claustrophobic - perfect for 2-4.
