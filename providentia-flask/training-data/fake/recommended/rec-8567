On Saturday we went to Ilili. It was very silili. The food is hit or miss, and expensive for what it is. To be fair, the brussel sprouts and dandelion greens were incredible. But 3 small scallops for $30? is that supposed to fill us up? Anyway, the cauliflower was not good, my lamb and beef kebabs were ok, and while the risotto and gnocchi seemed to be the largest dishes, they were not much to speak off and would make more sense in a smaller, cosier restaurant at half the price. The waitress started by telling us that it was an alternative eating experience where we just order lots of small plates and larger plates and food keeps on flowing. But then she asked what we wanted for appetizers and a main course, so not that alternative after all. She also mixed up our order, looked angry when we pointed out politely that we had ordered different food, and then disappeared for over half an hour. There seem to be WAY too many people who work there. Most of them have no idea what to do and wander around looking a little confused and a little sheepish. Â  The architecture is actually very pretty, wood and glass panels everywhere. It feels a little like Inception, like you could turn the whole thing upside down and it would feel the same. I guess if you want to blow money on feeling 'cool' in an 'alternative' Lebanese restaurant, this is a great spot. Just order the brussel sprouts and dandelion greens and accept the silliness of it all.
