I walked in and the place had a ton of energy. I've never been to a thai restaurant with so much energy and such a good vibe. The place was very inviting and the hosts/manager were friendly. I couldnt believe how reasonably priced everything was (probably because it's cash only). I had a curry which was delicious and not too heavy. The mango salad was delicious and they put a good amount of items in the salad.
