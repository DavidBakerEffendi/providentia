I came for the brunch today. Ordered the Cuban Eggs Benedict with a sangria. I asked for tostones instead as my side. The dish as a whole was pretty good. Good combination of flavors. I thought the hollandaise had a touch too much nutmeg in it. One of my poached eggs was popped already when I received the dish, did not like that at all. The tostones were great. The garlic sauce that accompanied the tostones was good but it is very garlicky. The sangria was ok, only had apples inside and a bit too strong for what I think a sangria should be. All and all, it's a nice little restaurant. I may probably return to try other menu items or dinner.
