I got a reservation for brunch on Sunday. And it was not very crowded, so I think without reservation you can still get a table shortly. The brunch menu is concise, so it's easy to decide what you want. We got egg Benedict, which was cooked perfectly. The lamb slider is fine, not as good as I expected. Salad is fresh. Decor and ambiance are great. Just wish the service could be faster. Overall , I still recommend this place for hang-out with friends.
