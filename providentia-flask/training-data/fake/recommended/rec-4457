Came here for a friend's birthday; due to the number of our party, we had a prix fixe meal.  Here is what I ordered: -hen soup -tobacco/beer rub pork -key lime pie (which unfortunately, I did not have) The hen soup was delicious, it was very hearty and flavorful.  A bit heavy but definitely worth trying.   The main course was also pretty good.  I think the veggies were a little too bitter but the pork was incredibly tender and falls apart when you stick a fork in it. Also, you can't go wrong with quinoa. From what I hear, the key lime pie was pretty decent, not too sweet and not too sour...but I didn't personally taste it. Also, I would get the white sangria there.  It's great for a hot summer day! I only give this three stars because our food took a really really long time (it took about 3 hours overall).  Also, the waitress had a bit of an attitude.
