This place is pretty good.  We had actually had it recommended to us as well as the place across the street, Genos Steaks.  We went to Genos first and was so disappointed that we ate again at Pat's.  While Pat's was pretty good, I was still a little disappointed as the cheese steak was not as good as my usual place in Fountain Valley, California, called "Philly's Best". I think you can probably find better here in the home of the cheese steak.
