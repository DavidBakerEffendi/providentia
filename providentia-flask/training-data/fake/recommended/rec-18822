I'll admit, I didn't believe the hype. How could a place that looks like that when you walk in have the tastiest burger around? Well.. I'm a believer now! Â The bun of this burger is toasted and perfection and the meat is juicy and cooked to perfection. They lose one star for the cramped atmosphere and the fact that the long line of people waiting for a table are basically lurking over your shoulder and staring down your burger while you try to eat it.
