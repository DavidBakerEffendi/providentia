My crew and I were looking for a bite to eat that was within walking distance to our hotel. Pietro's in Rittenhouse was where we ended up. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, the service.....not so much. Our waitress wasn't very talkative and didn't offer any suggestions when we asked what she enjoyed on the menu. A fresh, warm basket of rolls made it to our table but I was a little disappointed that there was no balsamic on the table or offered to us by our server or food runner. The menu offered a nice variety of Italian food but Margherita pizza, an Italian staple, was nowhere on the menu :( We decided on 2 large pizzas; a Margherita (we had to explain to the waitress what it was and then order it by topping) and a spinach & cheese. The food arrived quickly and I was pleasantly surprised by the presentation. They brought the 2 pizzas on a tiered rack which gave us the space we needed on our small, 4 top table. The pizzas were delicious, thank goodness! The crust was the perfect thickness was a nice balance of crunchy outside and soft dough inside. The sauce was simple and the ingredients were fresh. This place could be a perfect gem if they would just work on their customer service skills.
