Nine of us arrived on an evening when rain was forecast. We were seated inside, with apologies, but all was fine. The noise was reasonable (none of that bathroom tile), and the dishes we ordered were uniformly superb! Â Appetizers were shared, and the lamb ragu over tagliatelle was rich, with some spiciness. Fig sorbet was a perfect finish. Will be returning.
