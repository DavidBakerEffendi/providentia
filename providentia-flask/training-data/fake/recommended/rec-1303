one of, if not my absolute, favorite places in the entire city of Philadelphia.  they carry the finest of beer selections, they know how to handle their beer to maintain and ensure its quality, and the food they make is always astounding, every time.  Laid back atmosphere, busy enough to be enthralling, but intimate and upscale enough to be a date spot.
