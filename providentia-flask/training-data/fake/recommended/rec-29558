I now adore this place. It is spacious with terrific food and attentive staff. There are plenty of mezze if you just sort of want to pick through a meal over a bottle of wine or entrees if you're a bit hungrier and it is all delicious. My husband and I went on a Friday night. We got there a bit in the early side and had a drink in the bar area, which was spacious and well tended, then adjourned to a more romantic table in the dining area where we picked through a series of mezze. All in all, a perfect evening. We will be back.
