Unfortunately, the prices have increased a little bit as of May 1st. I'm a little reluctant to go overboard on ordering now and need to really be careful and strategic with my selections. I've been liking anything with cheese - turkey & cheese, beef & cheese, etc, as well as the corn flour empanadas over the white flour ones. The guava & cheese was yummy too.
