Recently had a reunion with my friends from my study abroad in Madrid here.  Got there around 8:30pm on a Wednesday and it was really packed, but it was expected and so, we got the sangria flowing.  Everything was amazing.  As soon as I took a bite from the patatas bravas, I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't in Spain - we ended up devouring one order and getting a second helping!  We didn't order any meat dishes, but they have enough veg options to keep a lacto-ovo quite satisfied.  So good and so worth the wait.
