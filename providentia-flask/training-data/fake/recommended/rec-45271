I like this place very much. The food was good. If do not consider budget, you can hv BBQ ribs pork steak or something on today's special. If you want to find some thing cheap, the phili cheese steak and burger is your good choice. I hv been there several times and it often full of people. My boyfried love the free bread they serve. He saids the hot bread let him feel very comfortable to begin with other dishes which always make me confusing. If you go there after 9pm for dinner, you usually need to wait for a table to eat. The service was good. But don't go there on weekday noon. At that time, usually very old waitress work there, and their service was just so so.
