I came here after a tour of the Hasidic neighborhood nearby and god oh lord am I glad I did. This is hands down the best pastrami/corned beef in this star cluster of the universe. I've had'em all and I was most impressed here. The only other sandwich I could even say occupies the same stratum is Langer's in LA. Katz's is a toursit trap and Carnegie Deli is even worse (though their cheesecake is still respectable), Schwartz's in Montreal is good but a little dry. Super mad props for them letting me get half-pastrami and half-corned beef. I shocked them when I asked for cole slaw on the sandwich (which is how they do it at Langer's). They had no idea though, they thought I was some kind of mad genius.
