My two business partners and myself went to The Pond House last night , 4/11/13 . We had a very satisfying experience . It is located in the renowned Elizabeth Park designed by Olmstead . The ambience is soothing , friendly and staff welcoming . Their menu is cooly digitized on a e tablet .Selections also have pictures so can scroll through the entire menu . They also now serve wine and liquor . The menu is interesting and innovative and the the choice of an item is made difficult as they all are quite tempting . thje only salve is to know we can come back for items not chosen . We shared a pear , greens and blue cheese salad - delicious , fresh and they divided it for us ! Special that evening was swordfish with wild mushroom risotto and varicots greens . The swordfish was generous , moreso than most restaurants . It was an 8oz. cut and was just right in thicknes - like the little bear not too thick , not too thin but just right . however the real treat was in the tasting , savory spicing aroma and perfect texture . this was probab;ly the best restaurant served swordfish I`ve ever had ! Two of us had the swordfish and the other dish was salmon that was moist , ample and very tasty . Don`t miss a cance to dine at this hidden gem . In a town that abounds with good restaurants , The Pond House deserves it rightful place among the best. P.S. Our waiter was attentive , helpful and and warm and right on the spot
