I grew up in West Chester, just outside Philly. Whenever we made the journey into the city, it was no question that a stop to Geno's and Italiano's (if in the appropriate season) were on the day's agenda. We'd pull up to the parking spaces in front, always decorated with American flags. This is the type of family shop where the owners know you by name and order. My dad? Brian, large pineapple. My brother? Patrick, large vanilla. As for me? Well, I would always stare in awe of the huge list of available flavors, but in the end I was usually Kathryn, small watermelon. As a child, I was always so amazed that mine had real chunks of watermelon. After mining through his Italian ice my Dad would give me some his chunks of golden pineapple, too. Returning here always reignites that childish excitement inside me. Even now I take a while to browse the long list of offered flavors, but usually wind up as Kat, medium mint chocolate chip and chocolate ice gelati. If you want water ice, go to Rita's. If you want Italian Ice and the original Gelati, come to Italiano's. You won't regret it.
