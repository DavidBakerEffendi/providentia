Me and my fiancee' went to the grand opening because its down the street from our house.  We didnt do the BBQ because we were shy.  lol but we saw other people doing it and thought it was so cool!  The appetizers are amazing and they are "refillable" so you can keep getting more and more.  Dont ask me what kind of meat they are but they are sooo tasty!! I ordered Teriaky chicken and rice...delicious.   My fiance ordered squid and octupus.  It was very spicy but delicious. The only thing was that they didnt have their liquor license so we couldnt order any drinks but that was ok.  Im taking my mother here for Valentine's day.  I hope she enjoys it too!!
