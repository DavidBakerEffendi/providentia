I love this place! I end up in New Haven very rarely and for odd reasons but this is the restaurant I end up and it makes the whole trip worth it. Please try the baklava, it is the best! It is moist on the inside but perfectly flaky on the outside and they put delightful pistachio shaving over it. They have GREAT pizza and I am a fan of their vegetarian hummus wrap which is very light and hits the spot. The turkish tea is always so perfect. By the way, I am vegetarian and even though the menu mostly caters lamp/chicken, they are always accomodating and the few options they have are still great. I think the thing that I really love about this place is the dining environment and decor. I feel like I am a princess in a palace when I eat here. The service is good, quite fast and personable. It is a decent sized cafe and you can always get the waiter over the bar counter. I'm bummed they don't have falafel but i think that they tried to keep their menu with more authentic. dishes to detract the commoner looking for a falafel sandwich that you more often find right off the street.. Very classy cafe!
