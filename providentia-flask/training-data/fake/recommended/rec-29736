Ok....I support Black owned businesses whenever possible, so when I read the review for Shawnee's, and they were pretty close to me, I decided to give them a try. I called in an order for delivery and waited...and waited...and waited...lol. My food arrived an hour and a half after I ordered it. I am saying that now because it is literally the only dark spot in this food experience. THE FOOD WAS AMAZING.....fa real. I ordered the First Lady Fries... Skin on french fries with cheddar cheese, bacon, and ranch dressing drizzled over the top. These are definitely not as health conscious as our real First Lady is....lol, but they were delicious. The fries tasted homemade, real cheddar cheese. My only gripe was the bacon was not crisp, but I am sure that was because the order took a while coming. Next was the Deep Fried Wangs...yes...Wangs. So good. Nice, simple, well made fried chicken wings. Perfectly seasoned and went nice with the fries. I also ordered the curry chicken wings and jasmine rice. I expected the traditional curry with a sauce, but these were baked and the wings had a nice, spicy curry crust on them. They were definitely spicy, but I love spice so I didn't mind. The rice was cooked perfectly. I also had homemade strawberry lemonade. Not too sweet, delightful bits of lemon pulp floating in it with two plump, juicy, whole strawberries. A nice refreshing drink after the spice from the curry wings. All in all, a great experience. The woman who took my order, who I think was Miss Shawnee, was very pleasant and apologetic for the lateness in delivery and it was explained to me there was a miscommunication with her delivery men about my exact location. That is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. I will definitely try this place again.
