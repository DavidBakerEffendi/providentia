Took the fam here for their 1st NYC visit. They requested some good NYC pizza. Of course they loved it and were not disappointed! We got a pie to go and ate it on the bench outside. For two brother, myself and my father it was a great snack ;). Being a local now I wouldn't go here unless I have guests... aka tourists... but that is bc I am impatient. :P Â I
