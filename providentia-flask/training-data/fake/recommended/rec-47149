First time here, and planning to go back. My friend and I came here around 6 on a Saturday and got in just before the rush. We were seated outside, which was comfortable and nicely lit, however definitely a tad congested between the other tables and people waiting on the sidewalk. For an appetizer, my friend and I split the gorgonzola fries which disappeared in about..7 minuets max, SO GOOD! The fries themselves are thinly cut and perfectly crisp. The gorgonzola dipping sauce is perfect, creamy and enough kick so that you don't even need too much on one fry. For the main course I ordered the mushroom-pumpkin risotto. I'm not generally a risotto fan however this was hands down, the best (pumpkin) risotto (most likely seasonal) I have ever had. Creamy, cheesy and seasoned to delight! Aside from the taste, the aesthetic of the dish was stunning. Served in a mini pumpkin; it was just as fun to tear the dish apart as it was to Instagram it in the beginning! Overall a highly enjoyable experience.
