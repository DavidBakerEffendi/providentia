Blue Point Grill is an excellent choice for fresh seafood in the Princeton area.  It is very popular so you will definitely want a reservation; people were coming and going the entire time. We had a wonderful server, Fernando.  He was funny and attentive.  All of the fish choices are similarly prepared.  Most are either grilled and topped with olive oil and lemon or pan seared in a butter and caper sauce.  You really can't go wrong there. I had the grilled calamari appetizer which was cooked perfectly and full of flavor.  I followed that up with the lemon sole and garlic smashed potatoes.  Everything was fantastic and I'd happily go again. Don't forget it's BYOB.
