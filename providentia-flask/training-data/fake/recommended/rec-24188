yes.  yes.  and...well....YES. i hit up shake shack around 5:30 p.m. on the day of its grand-opening.  i'm familiar with  the D.C. location in DuPont Circle.  when i heard it was coming to Philly....i cried tears of joy. yessssssss! after debating for 10 minutes whether or not we should stand in line, we were sucked in by an uber-friendly hostess who provided us with a laminated menu.   we ordered the shackburger with bacon (his was a double), cheese fries, and two fountain sodas.  a bit on the expensive side....but well worth it for a good burger, great fries, and really great service. perfect crinkle cut fries...golden and fried to perfection.  my fiancee siad the salt was fried into the potatoes...whatever that lmeans... we took our food, sat in Rittenhouse Square, enjoyed the scenery, and were pleasantly suprised by how GREAT everything was. i've been to PYT....the burgers are for show.  dress them up with fancy names and things that don't belong on burgers....i just want meat, a good bun, some fresh toppings, and a decent sauce. if i could give more than five stars, i would.   i WILL be going again....really soon.
