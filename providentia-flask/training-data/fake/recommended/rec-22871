One word... AMAZING! Came here on a busy Saturday night and this place really exceeded my expectations. We came in with a groupon, there was a 20 minute wait the place was packed but the wait went by pretty quickly. We were seated (very small space and tables are close together) and our waitress Lauren came over to introduce herself. She took our groupon with no problems, and in addition to the groupon which included any 2 entrees, drinks and desert we got the Tuna tartare... The Tuna Tartare was one of the best I've ever had! It was covered in guacamole and had a base of beets... This combination was perfect and seasoned to perfection. For our entrees we I got the grilled tuna steak and my boyfriend got the lamb shank. The meal was exceptional and his lamb shank was so tender I didn't even have to try to put my fork in it, it just fell apart. For desert I had a warm brownie and my boyfriend got the tiramisu. The brownie was ok and the tiramisu was very good! Over all service and the food were A+ the server was so attentive and the cooks here really put passion into the food! I will definitely be back! Check this place out guys!
