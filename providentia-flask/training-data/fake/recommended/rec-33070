The food here was very good, but it was hard to pay $15 for a bowl of bebimbop.  Maybe that's normal for this area, but I'm used to paying closer to $6 or $7 for this Korean staple.  That being said, Soonja's does feature a broad menu for both Korean dishes and sushi selections.  The place is cute and date-worthy, with attentive service and BYOB.  I went there because I had a hankering for bulgogi, and my tummy thanked me, but Soonja's could garner a 5-star rating if it halved all of its prices.
