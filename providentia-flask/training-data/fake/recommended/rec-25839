Family run cozy Italian restaurant with a delightful atmosphere and fresh pasta dishes made with great care!  Mom and I went without a reservation, but Mario was accommodating and squeezed us into a table after a short wait.  The house red wine hit the spot and the price was right.  We split the lobster cannelloni and pumpkin ravioli - wow, hands down the best Italian I've ever had.  Rounded out our meal with moist Tiramisu and again, they hit it out of the park!
