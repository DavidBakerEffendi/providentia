Oysters, Meatloaf and Whiskey, oh my... Rye has certainly caught my eye. The prices are reasonable, the fare delectable and the drinks quenching. My friends and I shared a plate of local oysters, and washed it down with one of the best mint juleps I've had in my life. Afterward we noshed on the meatloaf sandwich, baked ravioli, short rib sandwich and beet salad, and left full and happy. Our waitress was attentive, and our glasses were never empty. Rye is a true Brooklyn gem.
