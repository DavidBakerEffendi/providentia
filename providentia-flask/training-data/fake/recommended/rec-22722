Came here a few weeks ago for Sunday brunch when I was visiting some friends and was immediately baffled by the lack of brunch hangover insanity that takes over New York.  I made a reservation for 12:30pm for two and we were seated within a few minutes, and during our two hour lounge-y meal, the place never got packed.  It was busy at times, but never too crowded, never saw anyone wait too long, and it was great.  Crowd seemed a little bit older, which I liked a lot, none of that hipster taint going on here! I think there are four seats at the tiny bar in front of the open kitchen, and I was kind of hoping to sit there but all the seats were taken when we first got in.  Best weeknight seating, I'm sure. We were seated along the window in the comfy couches.  Overall the set up of this restaurant is really beautiful and gets so much light from all the windows. My friend and I shared the fluke crudo, a hundred mimosas, fritatta and braised pork shoulder - which was perfection.  My fritatta was good, and the accompanying spinach salad well dressed, but his pork shoulder was RIDICULOUS.  Seriously.  It looks like their brunch menu maintains the same items but changes up the some of the ingredients, which I love, so always get the braised pork shoulder. I'm sure it will always be ridiculous. Pricing is fine, although the $10 mimosa sort of blows, because you know you have to have at least two or three (You win this round, Fitler) and you're gonna have to pay up come bill time.
