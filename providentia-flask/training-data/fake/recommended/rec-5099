I went to Public on the recommendation of my Foodie daughter who is in the restaurant business. Giving all the good reviews  I was inclined to go especially since we had a VIP guest. I also like to try a new place every once in awhile. For the oldsters like me, (over 50) this is not the place. Noise level was intolerable. I was pushed aside at the bar for a stool that was empty until a young man said it was reserved for HIM!! hmmphhh. (I didn't see his name on it) . Didn't have to wait long for our reservation, even though the dining room was practically empty, but when I asked for a different table in the corner, I was told that it was reserved for another party.  By the way, that other party, didnt arrive until our dinner was over. I was not impressed with the food and thought it was overpriced. A bowl of pasta with carrot bolognese and a few shreds of lobster for $31? Desserts were not impressive either. Ricotta pumpkin cheesecake did not impress. And a tiny piece for $11. I think an entire cheesecake at Juniiors is only $18.  I had better at my local bake shop. We did share the roasted Brussels sprouts that were cooked to a tasty delight and we all would have been delighted with 4 bowls of the little cabbages and saved ourselves some money. My other guests were pleased with their fish dish and venison. But not overwhelmed. ONly 4 oz of fish too. Our waitress was delightful and friendly and we didn't feel rushed even though the place filled up quickly. I think I will stick with my favorites, Gramercy Tavern, Blue Ribbon Sushi, Five Points, Jean George for a better quality meal and one where I can have a decent conversation with my guests without the regular "Wha??" every sentence. I dont think PUBliC will miss the over 50 crowd since they definately cater to the younger crowd. If you want a place to impress a date, with a limited menue choice, a nice atmosphere and loud music, this is a must-go and destination spot.
