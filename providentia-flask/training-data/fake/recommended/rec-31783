Wandering around Philly on a vacation day. Looked up burgers on Yelp and this place was close. Great choice!!  My fiancé got a burger and I had the special - shrimp po boy.  OMG. it was great!  My po boy had a crab spread with cornmeal encrusted shrimp. Yummy sauce and the bread was great! . So good! Will be back when we're in Philly.   Great atmosphere. Laid back and chill. Really liked it.
