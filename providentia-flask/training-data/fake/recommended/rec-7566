Ok, so BF convinced me to come back and try something else, and I'm glad I did. Went for a combo of enchiladas - two sauteed veggie, one cheese. The cheese was perfect, the veggie unconventional (filled with broccoli, cauliflower and carrots, previously frozen but well prepared), and the refried beans are really some of the best I've had. So, I'm bumping up a star because the enchiladas were seriously decent, but I still can't get fully behind a restaurant where I have to avoid whole sections of the menu.
