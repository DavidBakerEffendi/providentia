I came here with a group of friends a few weeks back and it is probably one of my favorites (plus this is two blocks away from my office so double win!!). The ambience is definately an izakaya den style and anticipate a wait for being seated. This little secret spot in the City is definately out. We had deep fried tofu and oysters, grilled yellowtail collar , pork belly and atka mackerel. And of course large Sake and a bottle of KanNoKo Shochu. Such a delight. When I have friends visiting town, this is definately a spot I will be taking them!
