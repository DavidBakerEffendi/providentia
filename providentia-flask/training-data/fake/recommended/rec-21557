45 minute wait for a table of 4 at Barbuto- but not bad for a Saturday evening with no reservations in the Chelsea area at 8pm. The place was very crowded. However, it had very good energy and I loved the old garage doors this place kept in tact. It gives the place great character and stands out from the more pretentious eateries in the Meat Packing District. I also had no idea this was a Jonathan Waxman eatery, who was on "Top Chef Masters".  He came out and made sure everyone was happy with their food, which was nice to see from a somewhat celebrity Chef. We had the following dishes and everything tasted amazing and was wonderfully prepared: Linguettine ai gamberi: gulf shrimp, scallions, jalapeno& white wine. Gnocchi con fungi: potato dumplings,mushrooms & walnuts. Stinco di maiale:  braised pork shank & beluga lentils. Side dishes, also exceptional: Verdure: wilted greens, garlic & chilies. Patate:  crispy potatoes, pecorino & rosemary. 2 bottles of Brunello Di Montalcino 2006 that complimented every dish wonderfully. The restaurant also had a great bar scene that kept the scene very lively. Absolutely recommend Barbuto and hope to be back.
