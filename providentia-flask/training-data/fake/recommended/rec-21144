Having left Los Angeles a year ago for adventure in New York, one of the things I missed was a good banh mi sandwich. While the ones here are twice the price of any banh mi I could find in my old neighborhood, the flavor and quality of Xe May's sandwiches go a long way to make up for that. The interior is tiny, and has a counter with maybe 4-5 stools. The only other seating is a bench for people waiting on to-go orders. I'm a purist, so I ordered the Superclub Classic and shared The Hog with my husband. They were delicious, but we both favored the Classic, which features pate and headcheese (yum!). The baguette is great, crusty on the outside, soft and dense on the inside. If a banh mi baguette doesn't scratch the roof of your mouth, they're doing it wrong. Be sure to ask for extra spicy - for the perfect trifecta of Sriracha, jalapenos, and chili oil!
