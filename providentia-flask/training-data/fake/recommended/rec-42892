Wish I could give it 3.5 stars. Food was a solid 4. My vegan califlower steak was delish. The tuna tartar was amazing too. My BF didn't love the lamb and the signature drinks were disappointing. The restaurant was modern and appealing but also felt kind of corporate being part of a chain hotel (Kimpton product). Service was good. Solid but not blown away for the cost.
