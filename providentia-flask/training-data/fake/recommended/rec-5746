Truffle fries good.  Burger done medium rare as ordered (heard they overcook so figured it would come out med), but no it was med rare.  Points for that.  I was there early, nobody there, so that's probably why.  Counter guy was a kind bicked headed gentleman.  I got the 500 w/ aoli per friend & siblings instruction, tho I'd get the carmelized onions next time.  Kinda pricy for a burger fry drink $13 (but you can split it so not so bad).
