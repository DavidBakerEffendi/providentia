The service was so bad I began to think we were unwitting pawns in a psychology experiment about how long people will wait around for a sandwich. Seriously, it was that long of a wait. We were the only people in the place and had ordered about four sandwiches. Despite this, it is still worth it. I had an absolutely mouthwatering Rueben here. Don't over think it. Get a classic deli favorite to go and be happy.
