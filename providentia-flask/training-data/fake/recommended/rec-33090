This place was absolutely fantastic! I would go back right now if I wasn't so stuffed! I went with a friend who had never been either and when we first looked at the menu we were both a little hesitant. There were a few things there that we'd never tried or even heard of. But thanks to the wonder server we had, we persevered. Per our server's suggestion, we tried the oxtail and OMG it was to die for! It was flavorful and delicious, over a bed of mushrooms. Yum! For someone going here, this is a must try. I was lucky, my friend was pretty full by the time this came out, so I got to enjoy most of it! Next time I get this, no way am I sharing! We also had the fried chicken. This plate is larger than most with 4 pieces of chicken. And it was great. The meat was tender and delicious. We enjoyed the Korean bbq hanger steak wraps and our pork belly. Both were good but not must haves like the above. Last, but not least, we had the ice cream and gelato. YUM! The watermelon, I think gelato, was great. My friend loved the apple miso ice cream! And the one with green tea was fantastic. As for decor, it's a pretty little restaurant. It was pack the whole time we were there. We were just lucky to get in when we did cause we got the last available table. The service was great; they checked in all the time to see if we were ok. I can't wait to go back!!!!
