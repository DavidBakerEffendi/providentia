Really excellent ambiance (sports bar with huge TVs above the bar), big two-level dining space with plenty of bar stools/tables and booths, and packed just enough to make you enjoy good beer, good food, and good crowd of 20-40-somethings. We went for happy hour and really enjoyed the drink specials. I ordered the dark and stormy, which was served in a mason jar. Although there is no food specials for their happy hour, the appetizers were affordable at regular price, and they came piping hot and tasty. What did we get? Onion rings and avocado fries--highly recommended! The onion rings were small fat curls fried to perfection and the avocado fries were a great finger food to accompany the drinks---all for such reasonable prices ($7.50 and $5, respectively). The server was really attentive and friendly, offering to replenish drinks and checking in on us often but not necessarily annoyingly often! Random aside: They even have several individual unisex bathrooms, which is unusual but cool. Misconduct Tavern is close to everything, has great food and service, and is definitely worth the visit.
