This was an amazing place to eat dinner alone while I was traveling in Philadelphia. Village Whiskey is a small, cozy bar with limited seats. None of the tables would comfortably sit more than four people, and even that would stretch it. But for a party of one, it was perfect. I got a seat at the bar and enjoyed a whiskey cocktail, followed by a delicious craft beer. No fool, I selected the special burger for my dinner. The burger of the month was the "French burger," featuring Gruyere cheese, onions cooked in wine, dijon mustard, and I'm sure some other deliciousness. The burger was perfectly cooked at medium rare. I also had a side of duck fat fries, which were thick cut, piping hot, and a great accompaniment to the burger. One note: I thought about coming here on Saturday, but there was a huge line queued up outside. I went elsewhere and tried Sunday instead, and was able to get a seat at the bar almost immediately.
