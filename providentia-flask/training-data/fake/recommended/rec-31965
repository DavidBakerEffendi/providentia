Still don't get the hype. Gave it one last try and it still just doesn't cut it. I'll stick with Nunzio's, Lee's Tavern and Joe and Pat's. I like my cheese and sauce to be robust and flavorful, Denino's tastes a step above Pizza Hut to me. The 2 stars is for the fried calamari which is a 5, the pizza gets a zero.
