You'd think they would've listened to Willie Degel from Restaurant Stakeout when they were there! We've gone here a lot over the last few years. I've always noticed the 2 Managers up front at the counter instead of being in the restaurant making sure things run well. One of the managers NEVER smiles or says Welcome or hello. I was picking up a meatball pizza this past Friday night which I ordered 45 minutes before I got there. I was waiting and the other mgr kept telling me 10 more minutes. Well he did give me a coupon and they were very busy. BUT when I got home and we looked at the pizza, it had ground beef sprinkled and pizza was not thoroughly cooked! We were very disappointed. The owner was there and saw how long I was waiting and didn't say a word. We're done w/ Nauna's! They obviously don't understand customer service. There's plenty other Italian Restaurants that we'll go to instead of this place. They don't care.
