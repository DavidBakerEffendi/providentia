This is my go to spot for dinner if I'm not really craving anything special (and this is no offense to Beyoglu).  I have never had a bad experience here.  Beyoglu has tasty dishes with outside seating and beautiful indoor decor.  The prices are very reasonable and the service is wonderful. I always start with the hummus and greek salad.  Then lamb kabobs or Chicken Kabobs for main dish.... haven't been disappointed yet.  I'll agree with Cara A.'s assessment of the wine by the glass - "it sucks" you'll find me at the bar waiting for take-out
