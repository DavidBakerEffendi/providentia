This place is pretty unique in that the balcony is very stylish and perches you almost right on top of the band.  The stage is a little small but seems antique and full of character.  The beer is moderately priced and the staff is pretty cool.   I can't really speak of the downstairs too much.  The food was alright but nothing mind-blowing.  It is a revolving menu, though, so maybe I just had bad luck with the food.
