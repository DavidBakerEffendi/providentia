The food is decent. Definitely not extraordinary but ok. However, not worth it at all, at least when you order for delivery. Order arrives in 1.5 hr. When you call them to ask where it is at a 50 min mark, they reassure you it's on its way. Then at an hour mark they inform you it just left. They express no apology but a perfectly coined arrogant attitude that so many of Williamsburg places are so well versed in. So, do yourself a favor and order from elsewhere.
