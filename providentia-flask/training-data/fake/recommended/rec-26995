Awesome food. Great dishes, so fresh. The service is also awesome. They were super friendly and when they had no seating, 4 of us sat in the bar area and made our own space and they were accommodating and friendly. Â And the food was well worth it. I would definitely go again if I ever get back to Vermont.
