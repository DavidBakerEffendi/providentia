A true diner burger like I remember as a youngster growing up in NYC/NJ.  Really good burger.  My wife and I eat here about once or twice a month and the food is quite consistent.  We were referred here by a friend who grew up in Princeton after hearing us complaining about the "de-diner-ization" of our area of NJ (near route 130).  My wife orders food beyond the normal diner fare and her food is always quite tasty.
