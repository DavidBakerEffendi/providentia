When you hear about Philly, one of the main things you hear about is the rivalry between Pat's and Geno's. I ordered my cheesesteak with onions and Cheez Whiz.  It came out in a flash as the line moved fast.  The guy in the window was very impersonal and businesslike as he kept saying "Next!" as the line proceeded. The cheesesteak itself was attractive and good, but I can't say it had a real "wow" factor.  It's one of those tourist things you just feel you need to experience.  Two locals had warned me that Pat's and Geno's are overpriced and nothing special.  Both shared another place to go for better cheesesteaks. When in Philly, visit both places, but be forewarned that you probably won't be blown away by either place.
