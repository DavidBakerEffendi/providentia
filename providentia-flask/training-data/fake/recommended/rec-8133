Ate at the White Dog Cafe on Sansom Street in Philadelphia back in April, where they specialize in local foods (delicious.) and taking it slow. But maybe that was just our waiter taking the whole slow food movement far too literally. We could have done better with a *little* more attention from the waitstaff. Regardless: All good. And highly recommended. p.s. The structure itself is also a delight: the restaurant spans two old homes and the tables are set in alcoves and cosy corners to lend intimacy without being small.
