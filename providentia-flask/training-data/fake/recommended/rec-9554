There is always along wait for bunch here so you know the service and food are excellent. If you want to get seated quickly then go as a party of two.  We walked right in. I had the pulled  pork with rice and black beans and under two eggs. It was a good portion of food that my taste buds love. The mimosa was strong but nicely done. A small sample of pastries accompanied the brunch which included two small pumpkin breads, pumpernickels, and a chocolate croissant.
