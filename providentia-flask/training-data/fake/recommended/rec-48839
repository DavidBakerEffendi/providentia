Waited 2 hours in freezing cold weather but it was worth it.  Spicy veggie ramen was great. Of course their spicy is not too hot compared to Korean food.  The people who work there are super nice.  They are very organized and keep turing tables as fatt as possible.  There are only 20 total seats so you can do the wait time math.  Fyi, they say 1 hr to everyone but usally takes longer.
