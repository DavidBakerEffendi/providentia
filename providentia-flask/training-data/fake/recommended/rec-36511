I came here to order food for my husband's birthday party since he is Brazilian and LOVES Brazilian BBQ and  I had high expectations seeing as there were so many people coming in and out during the time I came in to place my order with the manager, Marcelo (also, I saw some overall good reviews on Yelp). I was very specific with my order, especially that I wanted all the meat medium-rare. Sadly, after getting the food and spending over $160, I found ALL OF THE MEAT (about 80 pieces) except for 3 pieces, to be well done. It was dry, tough and overall a HUGE disappointment.  I already had all my guests over at my home and very well couldn't take the food back to the restaurant. I can't overstate how much I wanted to like the food but just couldn't bring myself to eat it. The party was filled with carnivorous men and they barely ate half of the huge tray.  I was so embarrassed and disappointed. I called Marcelo to tell him and sadly he did nothing about it except to say "I'll talk to my meat guy." Thumbs down.
