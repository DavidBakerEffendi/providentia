Came here and got a Maine-style roll (cold with mayonnaise as opposed to the warm with butter style, which doesn't sound too appetizing but i didn't try it).  It was amazing!  Every bite was FULL of lobster meat (mostly claw), and they used just the right amount of mayo (not too much at all).  Even the grilled, buttery bread was awesome!  For $15, it doesn't look like a whole lot, but it's so dense and filling seeing as how it's all lobster and no BS, that it's definitely more filling and bang-for-your-buck-licious than it looks.  It even comes with a pickle (yuck! but apparently some people like pickles) and a bag of cape cod chips (eh whatevs).   Only things that would have made this more perfect would have been a better drink selection (only had bottled water and varieties of root beer...a grown-up beer would have gone so well with this!) and a different side other than potato chips (fries?  some kind of veggies?).
