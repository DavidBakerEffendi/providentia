Stop by on a Monday around 3ish, were the only customers in there. Split a 50/50 and a Charlie Brown with an order of fries and some birch beer to wash it down. 50/50 was perfect combo of pork and bacon with a delish siracha spread. Charlie Brown cheesesteak was meh, nothing great but not terrible. I enjoyed the fries, perfect crunch and some good sauces to dip in. Would check this place out again if I'm in the area to try some of the other sammies on the menu.
