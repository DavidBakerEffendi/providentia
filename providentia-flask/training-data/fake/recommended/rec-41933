Best sushi in the Philadelphia area by far. I have been wanting to find a good sushi restaurant in the area at least something comparable to those in new york or the west coast. Isumi is definetly a hit. We had Otoro as a special delicate fatty tuna, then a big plate of sushi and sashimi. Their fish is very fresh, well prepared and delicate not like these sushi you find in the typical Korean or Chinese run japanese restaurants. The fish pieces were prime cuts. We also had white tuna and extra white tuna sashimi. They also have homemade green tea ice cream. Definetly one of the best if not the best Japanese restaurant in Philly, and a byob so it cuts the cost down.
