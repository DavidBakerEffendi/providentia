Well i am back people and i have been stuffin my face for over a year now... Do you know whats better than hot pot???? More fuckin Hot Pots! Stopped by a couple of weeks ago. Damn for 3 of us ..... Shrimp Razor Clams Fatty Pork Belly Fatty Beef etc....etc....etc...mmmmmm Well you get the idea, food food and more food. The spicy and mild rolling boil was very good enhancement to my flavored soy sauce. Quite a steal 56 dollars for a lot of food to serve 3 people... The downsize was no dessert. But when i asked for dessert the lady came back with 3 sticks of wrigley gum....I laughed my ass off. Only on New York ...only in New York.
