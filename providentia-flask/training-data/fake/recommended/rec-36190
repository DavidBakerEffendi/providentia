The food is great. The ambience is great. $25.00 fixed brunch unlimited drinks but only one entree, small portion. Eat something before. What tipped the scale to poor impression, a very listless waitress asked us to move to another table due to next party. Fine. Then they started to rush us from there too. Even that I get the whole turn over to reservation time limitations, but as a customer i shouldnt have to care why the final product is poor. Some places manage and some just don't.
