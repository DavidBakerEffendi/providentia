Atmosphere and decor was decent. Our waiter, John, was very slow and not very personable; but maybe he was new. We each had a pasta entree, they were 'ok', nothing to write home about.  Then we had the Creme Brulee and Homemade Gelato.  The Creme Brulee was 'ok', but the sugar on top was too crunchy/hard.  The Homemade Gelato was terrible, completely full of ice and frostbitten.
