I went to Cheryl's Global Soul last week in the midst of New York's 3-week rain-fest. Perhaps it was the dismal weather or my hunger's indecision, but i was not blown away by the restaurant. The two young men who were our servers were very sweet, but they were bullied away by our "real waitress" who literally scolded them in front of us. Our food was not amazing, but not bad either. Maybe the soul should stay more local
