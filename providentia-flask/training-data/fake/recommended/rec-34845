Wow! What a find!! Thanks, Yelp. Good Thai food, cool decor, great prices, friendly service. The inside has random free-standing hotel doors, which give the place a cool vibe. And the prices are so much better than most Thai places in the city! the neighborhood is ok...we had to walk around for a while to find a decent bar. But go to this place!! It's good all around.
