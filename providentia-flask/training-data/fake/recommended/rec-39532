Came here for Sunday brunch. There are some tables available outside, but we were seated inside. The restaurant is relatively cozy, and by cozy I mean small... It was hard for the waiter to serve the dishes because the seats between the tables were touching. (FOOD) We were served a glass of orange juice each as we were seated. We settled on ordering the very well reviewed Croque Monsieur and Eggs Norvegienne. Both were excellent: The croque monsieur--basically a grilled ham and cheese sandwich browned with generous amounts of butter was amazing. It oozed with swiss cheesy goodness when biting into it; this was my favorite of the two dishes. The eggs Norwegian--poached egg (like an eggs benedict) with smoked salmon was pretty good, but nothing about it was special enough to separate it from all other eggs Norwegian's offered at brunch places like Cafe Orlin. Each dish was $15.50 which came with roasted potatoes, a salad side and OJ/coffee/tea. The potatoes filled us up pretty quick, but the salad balanced out all the heavy flavors from the egg, cheese and potatoes. (SERVICE) The service was nothing exceptional. The waitress we had was friendly, but did have a lot of difficulty serving food because someone always had to shift their chair in to make way. I read reviews that the place is most popular because of its BYOB no corkage fee. Didn't really matter to me. Also, I heard the lines can get pretty long for weekend brunch with nice weather. We went on a good weather Sunday for (late 3pm) brunch and we managed to snag a table without any wait.
