I grew up in Montclair and used to go to The Cheese Shop (now renamed Sandwich Theory) multiple times a week for lunch. It was absolutely delicious. I have been living away from NJ for over ten years now, but went back this past weekend and was quickly reminded why I love this sandwich shop. The #10 (blackened chicken salad on peasant bread) is to die for. When I took my first bite I literally couldn't talk to my friend until my sandwich was gone because I wanted to focus on every bite. I wish I didn't live a plane ride away from this sandwich shop, because I would still be a regular if I lived closer!
