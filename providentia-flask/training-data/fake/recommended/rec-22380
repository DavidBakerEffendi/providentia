Mezcal is an excellent Mexican restaurant with super friendly staff. I've eaten here many, many times and have not been disappointed. The service is excellent- they are very attentive and super friendly. The chips and salsa are always a treat, you never know what kind of salsa they will have that day. The entrees are filling and very well done. I often get the Tostadas de Tinga or Shrimp Enchiladas. I crave both dishes fairly often. They also make a mean margarita- my favorite is the classic, with fresh squeezed lime juice. As a former Californian, I've had my share of excellent Mexican, and while nothing on the east coast (save taco trucks) manage the balance of price and food, Mezcal is as close as it gets. And you don't have to stand by a roadway to enjoy it.
