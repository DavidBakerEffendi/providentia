My husband took one look at this place and immediately decided that he wasn't looking forward to eating anything from here.  It is a typical set-up for a Chinatown place - you know, with the produce still packed up in cardboard boxes, stacked high above our heads, and apparently, the Department of Health still hasn't graded this place (do they know that she's serving food from here?).  Regardless, the noodles were AMAZING and the non-Chinese husband was so impressed that he ordered a second.  I only wish the bits of beef were larger chunks.  The lady is very nice!  I'd definitely come back!
