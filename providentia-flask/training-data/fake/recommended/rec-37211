This place was amazing! I had some sort of eggplant sandwich...sorry I can't remember the name of it, but it's the only eggplant one on the menu. I literally was in heaven when I took my first bite. I cannot wait to go back. Â I also loved that it came with a side of either their homeade salads such as the pasta salad that I had. I would say though not to bother with their deserts. The strawberry cake looked better than it tasted. Not very moist or airy. I've had better. Byob was certainly nice and added to my dining experience in this eclectic little place. There is a wine shop around the corner. When I missed the restaurant spicy green bean because it's tiny and hard to spot...I found the wine bar which added to our enjoyment once I found the delicious place. Enjoy! I did!
