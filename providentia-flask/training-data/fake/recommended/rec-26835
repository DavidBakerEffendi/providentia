Serves relatively poor excuse for dim sum. Barely okay when fresh but gets cold and hard after a couple rounds. Apparently they never heard of keeping food hot in those steam carts. If you get food by order then it's passable.. but nothing to brag about. But then you really can't expect quality Chinese food from Parsippany, NJ. Is there a saving grace? Unfortunately, no. Service is pretty crap. But considering that there really isn't a better Chinese restaurant in the area that serve proper authentic Chinese food, you are pretty much stuck with this one. My advice would be.. go eat at a less authentic Chinese restaurant if you can help it.
