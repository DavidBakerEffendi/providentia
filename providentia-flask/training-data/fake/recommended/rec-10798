The food is damn good. The views are nice. Â But, the terrible service will ruin it for you- especially if you've worked in service before. No team work at all when a larger party is sat. All the servers just hang out by the bar and shoot the shit. The only people on their A game are the friendly water boys and bussers. If you get Richard, or the pear shaped lady with a frizzy dark pony tail... Just leave. She's a wet blanket and Rich can't balance more than 2 tables at once. We waited 25 minutes before we had to ASK for our check. They forgot my fries, the coke was flat, you never asking how any of my food was- oh, and even the hostess was too busy smacking her gums to thank us for coming. I'd be embarrassed to be the manager of that place.
