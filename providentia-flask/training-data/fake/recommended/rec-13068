Bad service. Good drinks. The experience wasn't that amazing bc it was way too small inside to be comfortable. Anywhere you sit in the restaurant, you will get brushed by a passing customer/waiter/waitress/etc. Though, the decor is nice. I ordered the pineapple fried rice bc I wasn't too sure of the quality of food there, being that it was given a B rating. The rice was great! The drinks were good too, ranging from 10-14$. Sit at the bar to eat, or go on a day that's not too crowded for a better experience. Your lack of patience will thank you.
