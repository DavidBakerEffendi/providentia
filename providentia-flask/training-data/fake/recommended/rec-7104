Arguably one of the best most innovative sandwiches/wraps I've ever had. I've gone back 3 times since my initial visit and can't get enough. The Pho #1 is everything a man can hope for. Pho...in a roll. I can't take spice so every time I have it, there's no sriracha but it's still amazing. It's literally like eating pho in a roll. The hoisin sauce makes up for the dryness and the meat and cilantro might has well have been taken right out of a bowl of pho. The Pho #2 is like eating a chicken spring roll but bigger and better. The green chili sauce is deadly for those like myself that can't take spice, so I always get it without it. Nothing a can of arizona can't fix. A huge plus is that it's CHEAP and super quick!
