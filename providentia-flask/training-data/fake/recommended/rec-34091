Ineptitude stem to stern.   Easily the worst managed restaurant in New Haven.   The people in line behind us had reservations.  "Really" replied the manager with a laugh and a gaze that seemed to indicate these people with "reservations" were fools.   He then proceeded  to seat 5 tables of four around them.  Somehow, the group with reservations managed to resist the urge to burn the place to the ground or simply take their business elsewhere.  Kudos to them for having exceptional amounts of patience and excellent manners.   Apparently table cleaning technology in the form of a plastic bin (for dishes, etc.) has not yet arrived at this establishment.  The busboy must have been concerned about the safety of each dish, spoon, fork and cup as he seemed to only be able to clear one item at a time.  The lines grew longer and longer while tables sat empty and dirty. The bottomless mimosa.  What a great deal.  They left the glass empty for almost the entire meal.  Good for them not so much for the customer.  The food?  Ok.  The biscuits and gravy require three additional bowls of gravy to be edible.  Everything else is usually not available.  Customers are warned of the lengthy amount of time the waffles and fried chicken require.  Apparently the vibe is such that you should expect your fried chicken an hour or perhaps two after your companions have finished eating.  Really?  for fried freaking chicken? Fire the manager.  Re-train the staff, let busboys use plastic dish pails and learn to turn tables faster.  But, most of all, please fire the manager.
