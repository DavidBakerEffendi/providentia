I was really looking forward to trying these since I was born and raised in Los Angeles, and I must say these are authentic Mexican tacos. I had the pork adobada tacos which I believe is what this place is most famous for, although normally carnitas (shredded pork)/carne asada are my favourite sort of tacos. I was excited to see that they make their tortillas fresh here as I could actually see them being made right in front of me. I loved the storefront-- definitely giving out an authentic TJ style look. Pork was good, ingredients melded deliciously together, sauces were fresh and full of flavour, but the best thing to me was probably the guacamole. Delicious, delicious guacamole with house-made chips. Yum! I thought the pineapple garnish was interesting, not something you see on a taco everyday. Horchata was amazing, some of the best I have probably ever had. At about $3.75ish a taco, not cheap, but two tacos is definitely enough food for a small lady like me. :) These tacos are good and definitely pretty high on my list of the best tacos I've had. I will have to go back and try the carne asada (grilled steak) next!
