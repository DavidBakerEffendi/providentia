I don't know how we managed to roll in and score a table for seven with no reservations on a Saturday night, but the hosts were most accommodating.  I recognize that it's nothing short of miraculous, but let it never be said that they don't try. We split one of the fruits de mer platters to start.  A behemoth tower arrived - enough of a spectacle that other tables were stopping to take pictures.  Split seven ways, it was actually quite reasonable.  Give it some thought. My Berkshire pork rack was marvelously flavorful, if bordering on the slightly overdone.  The bar steaks were perfectly done, flavorful, and understandably popular.  The fries accompanying them were salty, crispy perfection.  The trout and salmon weren't disappointing, but perhaps not as inspired as the other entrees. Service was efficient, speedy, friendly, just unobtrusive enough, and just available enough.  It couldn't have been a more sublime experience, from entering the door to having to wave off dessert.
