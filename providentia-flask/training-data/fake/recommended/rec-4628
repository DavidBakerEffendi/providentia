I really want to like this place, and maybe I'll be back to try a burger. Or something. I went in to have a drink with a friend, and decided to try the French Onion Soup - my favorite thing ever to get at a restaurant, 'cause I'm not making that s**t at home... So I have a beer, and enjoy it - the bar is small, warm and cozy, and even tho the bartender is a bit.. aggressive.. (she is super-efficient, telling a guy who stood at the door for a few seconds, obviously on his phone, that he could 'come in and sit anywhere', which is a bit of a turn-off - just chill!), it was nice. Then my friend came and was served, with a style that felt more like an interrogation then bar service.... and then my soup came. French Onion soup should be a simple beef broth, some bread, onions, and cheese. This had that, sure.. and it had oregano and thyme and who knows what else.. it was super spiced, to the point of in-edibility. It was awful and I ate a little before pushing it aside. The bartender left it sitting there for a half-hour, never asked about it, and charged me for it. Disappointing. But, on the bright side, they take Discover!
