I really enjoy Frankford Hall for the most part. As most of the reviews have said the atmosphere is pretty cool, the ping pong and foosball tables are a nice touch. Beer selection isnt the most extensive but some good options jn Great Lakes, dogfish head, and franziskaner. Any bar where you can basically sit outside around a fire and roast smores I think is a good spot. I haven't tried the food besides the pretzels and cupcakes because of the prices, lines, and there is always a cheap food truck option around the corner on girard (last night vernalicious was hanging out) so cant really comment on that. Bartenders and the rest of the staff were cool but the manager last night at least was awful. Coming to our group and chastising us for just being demonstrative while talking then standing next to us to chaperone us until a semi fight broke out next to the food counter. We are all adults, its a bar give me a break. All in all if you haven't been give it a try its definitely worth a trip in.
