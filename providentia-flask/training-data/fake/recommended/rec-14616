There's no doubt about it. Lobster is delicious. This place is no exception to this universal rule; their lobster meat in the rolls are prime quality claw meat. However, the one gripe I have is WTF IT'S SO OVERPRICED! The entire lobster roll literally fits in the palm of my hand. I got one Connecticut style (warm with butter) and one Maine style (cold with mayo). For some reason, the Maine roll had about twice as much meat as the Connecticut, which is kind of a ripoff in itself. I knew going here that the portions are tiny, but I wanted to just try it to see what all the talk was about. Well I tried it, and I don't think I'll be coming back. I can find tastier and more filling options with my 15 dollars.
