This is my favorite bar in the city!!!!!!! By far the coolest atmosphere (if you like the art, ask the bartender about the artist!! tre cool).  If you like spicey, try the jalepeno margarita... it rocks my socks.  Pretty good selection of beer... my boyfriend is a huge fan of the black and tan-esque beer combos. If the drinks and atmosphere aren't enough, the entertainment will blow you away.  Side-shows, DJ's (they play some of the best mixes in the city), and open-mic nite (look out for The Technophobes. awesome).
