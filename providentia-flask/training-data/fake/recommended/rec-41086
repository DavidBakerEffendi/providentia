The cooks at The Redhead have an interesting knack for making food that is simultaneously overwrought and bland. There is nothing really wrong with it, but nothing particularly right, either. Vegetables are not included as sides in many of their dishes. The burger is served with potato chips--and this is at dinner. Tiny sprigs of hard-to-identify green herbs adorn most other dishes, and these are just as likely to get stuck in your windpipe as provide nourishment. Major points off for the atrocious stupid hipster beer list. I have not seen PBR *and* Yuengling on the same beer list in a while. What self-respecting bar/restaurant serves these to their customers? I felt nowhere near quirky enough for this place. My pants were just way too wide.
