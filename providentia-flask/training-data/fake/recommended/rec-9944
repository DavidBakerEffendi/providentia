Advice is to sleep in & skip or stay home & make a much bigger/better cheaper breakfast French toast is huge & dry, no amount of pure maple syrup or nutella is saving this from being the worst dollar for dollar french toast around ($15) Blindfold test would have that miniature Penny egg sandwich confused with one served at Dunkin Donuts, don't let that little pesto twist fool you, dosn't even come with a side of those small portioned $5 extra burnt looking home fries If someone is cruel enough to roll you out of bed for this place then definitely get the fresh squeezed grapefruit juice ($5.50), wish I ordered 3 instead of that french toast It's a cute setup, like a house Mary Engelbreit would live in but definitely overrated, adding to this mornings delight was somehow there was about a 15 minute wait
