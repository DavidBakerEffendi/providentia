New Wave Cafe was the first place I went to when I moved to Queen Village, and months later I'm still delighted that I live right across the street!! The people here are the kindest, most down to earth people -- I became friendly with several of them instantly. The food is good, a decent selection (even for veggies & gluten-free), and it comes out fast! The drinks are fast, too, and they have the best suggestions if you don't know what you're in the mood for! Definitely a neighborhood staple in my opinion, and a good place to check out if you're walking by! Lovely outdoor seating, too!
