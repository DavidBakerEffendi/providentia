Delectable. Service was spot on, food prep was timed well. Called ahead as we were going to be late by about 15 mins and we were seated as soon Â as we arrived. We took the recommendations of some previous reviewers and ordered the mini tacos for an app and the pear salad with Greek yogurt. Yum! Our mains were the Diver scallops and the Duck breast. Both dishes were delicious. No room for dessert, but the complimentary sweet treats were most welcome after a rich meal.
