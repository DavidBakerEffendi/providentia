Fun group spot! Everything is meant to be family style, so take this as an opportunity to try some new dishes. I was especially impressed with the vegetable offerings including grilled brussels, corn on the cob, and sweet potatoes.  Our server was kind and attentive, and we ate like Kings.  I'll be back.
