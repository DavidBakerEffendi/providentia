I love anything quirky so I loved that this place was in an alley and that it was decorated in a rustic cabin house style. My pork sandwich was pretty good but not something I'd write home about. Drinks weren't bad either but again, I'm not calling mom about it. Really just feel that it's more about the ambience here, nothing wrong with that.
