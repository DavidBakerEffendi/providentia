When we sat down, a Spanish scramble has just been delivered at the table next to us & a saliva-inducing scent wafted our way. Couldn't get past it even after checking out the amazing offerings on their menu. Ordered a cafe con leche and the scramble with a biscuit substituted for the sourdough. All I can say is it was everything I expected - delicious.
