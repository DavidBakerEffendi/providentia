The proliferation of wonderful restaurants in Williamsburg is overwhelming and Rye is setting the bar very high. I went a couple of times recently and had meatloaf that was out of this world, a crazy mac 'n cheese and a cassoulet that borders on addictive. The waiter was incredibly nice but the service was definitely a little on the slow side, which was fine as the atmosphere is dark and mellow, and a pleasure to hang out in. Great date place - I look forward to going back.
