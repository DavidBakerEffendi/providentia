This place is a small place with only a few tables and a few workers. You can see the cook hand pulling the noodles ($5.50 for a bowl...prices might vary slightly depending on what you order...see picture I uploaded of the menu). The pan-friend dumplings were not bad either, especially with their dumpling sauce. They also don't overcharge you for soda. Food: 6 Decor: 2 Service: 4 *ratings out of 10
