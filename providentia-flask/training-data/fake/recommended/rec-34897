It's safe to say, Kati roll is the new burrito, so Chipotle look out.  I had my first Kati roll tonight and I'm hooked.  Kati roll is essentially an Indian burrito with nan instead of a tortilla.  I went with the Chicken w/ egg roll and a Mango drink and didn't look back but the others looked delicious as well.  Service is quick and its the perfect late night food, just don't wear your Sunday best.  Ask for the extra hot sauce...
