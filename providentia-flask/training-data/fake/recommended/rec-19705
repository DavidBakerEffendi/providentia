Awesome atmosphere! They have such a great beer selection I didn't even know where to begin! Beers from all over the US! Very cool. The bartender was really nice and talkative. There are tons of TVs, yet there's a classy vibe from the modern, dark decor. I ordered the hummus to snack on and it was delicious! Great find in the middle of what seemed like a boring street!
