Food is great. Mexican food can be very bland (when it's inauthentic) but this place is anything but. While the food was delicious, it's the service that sets this place apart. The manager walked the restaurant the entire time we were there, greeting guests and taking a genuine interest in their dining experience. For example, we didn't make reservations and so we were sat close to the kitchen (really wasn't bad at all). However, the manager had two complimentary shots of tequila and a free (and mouthwatering) flan for dessert. Great experience from the same owners of Cuba.
