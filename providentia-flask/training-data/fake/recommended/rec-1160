I would love to say this Philly Icon is absolutely great, but it is just OK. Love the cheese steaks, love the fries, but they are over priced and under sized. Maybe because there are other much better cheese steak places not far away, but Geno's would benefit on living less on the hype and more on the really good steak they started up on.
