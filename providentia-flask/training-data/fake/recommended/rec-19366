Came here for lunch on Sunday. When we walked up they offered us a sample of the Gator Gumbo, my friend and I both liked it, so we each ordered a cup of it. I also ordered the Fried Shrimp Platter and he ordered the Blackened Chicken Platter. I chose red beans and rice as my side and he chose the Cajun Fries. We each ordered the root beer and we also got an order of beignets. All of this came up to about $40. The gumbo was ready right away but we had to wait for our platters. Neither one of us finished our food....it was sooo much food! The gumbo was good, but I didnt care for the fried shrimp and the red beans and rice were not that great either. I didnt taste his Blackened chicken, but he said it was okay. I tasted his cajun fries and they were more like potato wedges. They forgot to give us our beignets, so we had to go back to request them and luckily they remembered us. The Beignets were good as well, but we didnt finish them either. I would come back for the gator gumbo, but I would pass on the platters. Also, the line and ordering is a little disorganized, so that was a little frustrating in the crowded Reading Terminal Market.
