Finally tried this place after many visits to NYC! I arrived at my hotel around midnight and STARVING and this place was right around the corner--it was destiny! For $6 you can get a giant plate of rice, chicken/lamb, a little lettuce and yogurt/hot sauce. Honestly, you can't beat that deal. The rice was nice and fluffy and the lamb was so greasy and bad in a good way. I also tried the lamb sammie for $4 which was equally delish. I thought both dishes could have used some more veggies, maybe some tomatoes to add another element of tartness to break up the saltiness of the dishes but, for the money no one can really complain. If I were looking for a destination for late night, cheap dining--I would definitely choose Halal guys!
