I've had their take out on a few occasions and I've been pretty satisfied.  My fav is the Pineapple Fried Rice.  Heed their warning about spiciness levels.  It's pretty accurate.  I thought their "American Spicy" would be a joke for me so I decided to try "Spicy".  I think I'll go back a few notches next time.
