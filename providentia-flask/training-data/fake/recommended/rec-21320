I am easily pulled in by "secret" locations and this one lived up to the NYC hype. It was kinda hard to find but I don't know downtown very well. And walking through the butcher shop made me a little nervous that i was in the wrong place...but go past that "where am i?" feeling to the bottom of the ramp I went with 3 others - we all did the $55 tasting menu. They made a custom veggie version for me which was VERY unexpected (tasting menu only available if the whole table orders it) Everything was light, simple and delicious! Vegetarians get ready to judge me - I haven't eaten meat in 12 years and had never had beef in my life BUT i had a bite of the Kobe sliders (on tasting menu or can be ordered a la carte) because everyone at the table was swooning and moaning over how amazing these burgers were. I have to say it was worth it. It was like they were cooked sous vide in a garlic butter - but not greasy, just moist and flavorful and the bread was sweet and soft - soo amazing. If i ever give up vegetarianism - these Kobe sliders are my first trip! Service was perfect - attentive but not overbearing and they let us (we're a group of chefs) sneak into the kitchen on our way out. AND...this might be weird to mention...but they have the coolest toilet I've ever seen. It was like a recliner and had so many buttons and features was too nervous to press any of them, but still intrigued...
