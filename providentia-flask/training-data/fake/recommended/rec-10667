THANK YOU FELLOW YELPERS!!! Â The previous reviews are excellent, spot on, and I can add nothing except that if you go there's a good chance you'll see me. I have a new favorite restaurant. If you love great food at great prices, appreciate feeling that your business is valued, and care little about atmosphere, then Sazon Latino is as good as it gets. I cannot wait to return.
