My mother always says that you can tell a restaurant by its creme brûlée - easy to make but easy to do poorly. Amelie's is as good as I've had, the same goes for this restaurant! If you like wine you'll find knowledgeable wait staff with a generous pour. Been here 4 times and it's been excellent everytime.
