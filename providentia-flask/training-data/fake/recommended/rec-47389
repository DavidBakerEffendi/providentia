I'm not sure if I should review this at all, as I never had the chance to dine at this lauded establishment. However, I think it bears mentioning that this is not the best choice for a party. We had a reservation for six, but one dining companion was tied up in the Subway (not literally - that would have been a bigger problem). Understanding that a busy restaurant cannot hold a chair for a person who might not show, we offered to order and pay for our late friend's meal. The host was abrupt to the point of rudeness about this issue. I suppose a host can't break or bend the rules for one party. I'm just not sure why, if food and alcohol are ordered for the chair (and the group as a whole), that chair and table cannot be available. Also, the provided table was barely adequate for four and would have been a stretch for six plates of food. I've traveled a lot in Europe, so I understand cozy caf√© seating, but this would have been an awful stretch. Happily, we had an awesome meal next door at Sant Ambroeus. Go there if you have a group! (If you are a romantic couple, Extra Virgin's outdoor two seater section looks majorly charming. Everybody says the food is fantastic.)
