Decided to try a "new" spot in Chinatown that we haven't been to before. Yelp showed BWK to have 4 stars and 240 reviews so we decided to stop in for dinner. I commend the mister for being adventurous, but unfortunately, the food wasn't anything to shout off rooftops about. Here's what we ordered: Roast Duck - Greasy and not enough meat (in fact, there was a lot of bone). Plus, the sauce covered the white rice which didn't make the dish any tastier.   Chinese Spinach with Oyster sauce - This could have been good if it wasn't dowsed with sauce. Unfortunately it was, so not much of it was eaten.   Wonton Mein - The wonton, noodles and broth were good, but there wasn't much too it nor was it memorable.   All in all, the food was ok for the price (the whole meal cost less than $20 with tip) but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again when there are so many other options around. --K
