I AM CONFUSED!  I was so excited to try this place given the good reviews.  But I was sorely let down by the place.  The burger was ok-- but served on a cold bun? Really? To put a nicely cooked piece of beef on a mediocre piece of bread is really not very appetizing.  The attitude of the place was very stick up the a***.  I don't get it?
