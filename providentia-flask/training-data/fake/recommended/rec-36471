What is there to say? If you don't know this place or have been to it, you're missing out. Â Fantastic Bar and scrumptious food! The one missing star is for availability and waiting to get a table. The noise is expected and fine by me for its popularity. Fantastic location. Call ahead to check if they have a Private Venue going on and to book ahead. The Table and Bar Service is 5 - Star! Simply a must do and do often!
