This is an small restaurant in Little Italy and worth a visit.  My family of 3 arrived 30 minutes early for our reservation and they accommodated us by seating us right away and later moved us to the window location which was great.  My husband had the 4 course dinner which he really enjoyed and my son and I had pesto pasta.  The servings are a good size and the taste was good.  Our waiter was very attentive and brought everything on time, no complaints, if anything we were pleasantly surprised! After dinner you can walk down to a cute little dessert spot selling "World famous cannolis and gelato" about 1 block down.  We would come back here on our next visit to New York City.
