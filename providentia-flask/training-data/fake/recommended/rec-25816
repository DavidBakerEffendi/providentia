It took me quite some time to brave the lines and get past my preconceived notions of "street meat" in order to enjoy some lamb and rice from this classic NYC food cart...... and I've been back 3 times since. I would highly recommend the lamb instead of the chicken and I would also recommend splattering your dish with yogurt, bbq and a TOUCH of the hot sauce as it is quite spicy. Take some to go if you think you'll need more but don't get crazy with it from the get go. SUPER cheap and plenty of spots around to sit and eat it before it gets cold.
