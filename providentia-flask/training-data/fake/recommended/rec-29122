went here w/ my cousin last wk - the two of us ordered the brisket noodle soup and the sliced beef noodle soup - both w/ shaved noodles.  i'm not a huge fan of noodle soup but this was REALLY good.  we also ordered the spicy tendon and sliced pig ears, which came in surprisingly huge portions and were really good both in and out of the soup.  this is a good place for cheap eats and i highly recommend it
