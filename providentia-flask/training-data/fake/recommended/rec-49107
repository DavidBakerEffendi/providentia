Very happy that I no longer have to drive into the city for a good bowl of ramen. I've been there a few times already & the pork buns & gyoza never disappoints & is a must order. I usually order the Ani ramen which is the pork broth one, add egg, & some oils & u have perfection in a bowl. Staff is attentive & welcoming & it's great that it's BYOB. Also, another tip...either slurp sip repeat until u get to the bottom of the bowl or BYOC. (Bring your own container) Best ramen in NJ!
