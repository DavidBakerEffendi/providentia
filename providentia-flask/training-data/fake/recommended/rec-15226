Easily the best sushi experience I've ever had. Very small place, about 6-7 tables. Excellent service and incredibly fresh sushi. I had a couple maki rolls that were great. But you really need to try the sashimi. It's really an experience. Wonderful owner. Did I mention BYOB? There's a state store a block away so it's perfect. Great intimate experience, perfect place to try more than just maki rolls.
