I'm pretty sure the food here is amazing but the only times I've been here I was completely wasted. Judging by the reviews, I'd say yes! I don't know what time they open or close because I've only been here between 2-4am. The line is still long even at these obscure hours. That's the city for ya, I guess. The food is like crack, so addicting! And dat white sauce, m'mmm. You won't be sorry you came here!
