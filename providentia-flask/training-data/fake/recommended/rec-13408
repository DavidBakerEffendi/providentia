Their lobster rolls are delicious and worth venturing out to Brooklyn for. The price may be expensive, but if you are not planning to eat this every single day I think a little splurge is ok. I have a dilemma. I am still debating on which lobster roll I like more - Red Hook Lobster Pound or Luke's Lobster. I guess I will find out one day haha
