This is a favorite place of mine whenever I come to NYC. My friend who lives here introduced me to their Pistachio Crusted Goat Cheese salad, and it's phenomonal! One of my most favorite salads ever Â and the presentation is also good. I really want to come back and try their brunch sometime; so far I've only had their dinner items. They have a good spinach and ricotta ravioli dish and I've also had their fries with gorgonzola fondue..so yummy! nom nom This place is in a great West Village location, it has a nice atmosphere inside and tables outside as well. Be warned, there can be a wait for dinner, but they do have a bar where you can have a drink while you wait. Love this place and can't wait to go back.
