All I have to say is RACIST!!! My boyfriend and I (we are Hispanic) came here to give it a try. When we get there the lady in the front seemed nice with her Hi hunny welcome, but that soon changed to a face of panic when she started to look around to sit us. There was literally a table right there on the side and I asked her if we could sit there, I mean the table was free. Instead she goes one second I will sit you over there (in the dark corner where no one can see you, I mean I couldn't even see where it was). All of a sudden an older Caucasian couple comes right after us and to my disbelief she sat them at the table I just asked for. So instead of going all out on her because that was not only rude and disrespectful, it was RACIST! I left and will never come back, but post this to let everyone know to BEWARE! And also that there whole d√©cor is not even traditional Thai so they should renovate either way to at least make the atmosphere feel like your in Thailand.
