It seems that everytime I go to Red Lobster they offer less and less options. I realize that this is a seafood place first and foremost, but I miss the options that they used to offer. They useed to have a meal called Dockside Shrimp and Chicken. This would be two grilled seasoned chicken breasts, with a baked potato and a side of shrimp scampi. Along with the side salad and red lobster biscuits this was a very satisfying meal. They used to offer this for $10, but then it rose to $12, and then they removed it from the menu. I tried ordering this despite it not being on the menu, and depending on the place they charge you a different price. One place I got it for $15, another charged me $18. Now these days, their chicken breasts have gone down hill. They come to the table very dry and practically inedible. They do have one chicken dish that I'll sometimes order, Cajun Chick Alfredo. They used to cook this very good, but lately they seemed to forget how to make this. Their shrimp dishes are good, but not very filling. Their snow crab legs are also amazing, yet they are expensive and also not filling. While I do like most of the appetizers, but these appetizers are all made to share amongst the table. The appetizers I would love to get are tha nachos but no one eats them. This plate is huge and there's no way I can polish this off, I asked for a half order or a single order, but they don't accomodate. I believe they need to update their menu selection, and at the same time fix the service problem. Especially at the Woodbridge location, you can wait a good half hour before your order is taken and then another half hour for your check. Who has an extra hour to waste sitting in a restaurant, not me. While this used to be one of my favorites, it is a chain that I happily avoid now. Their prices a re too high, their menu is too unvaried, and the service at this location is the pits. I can see why Red Loberster went on the chopping block from Darden's chains.
