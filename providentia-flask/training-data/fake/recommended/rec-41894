Modo Mio was by far my worst restaurant experience thus far in the city of Philadelphia.  Chose to take my wife there for our wedding anniversary. Had a 9 pm reservation.  At 9:15 we were offered a seat outside where the temps were in the 50s. We give it a shot but my wife was not dressed to sit out in the cold so we quickly asked to wait for a table inside.  We waited for another half hour.  At about 9:40 a couple from the neighborhood who just "called ahead" who arrived around 9:30 was seated before us.  I brought this up to hostess who just apologized.  At about 9:45 a drunk man stumbled in to the 5 foot by 5 foot waiting area and started loudly announcing how handsome he was.  Needless to say we decided to just leave at this point.  Will never go back.  Will never go to their place out in media again.  Telling everyone I know what a disaster this place is.
