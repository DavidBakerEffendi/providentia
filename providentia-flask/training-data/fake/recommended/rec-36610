Umami Burger can only be sum up in one word and that is Umami. The pinnacle feeling of savory goodness makes me wanna scream UMAMI. After my first visit, I am a frequent customer at this establishment and have plans to go as many times as it takes for me to get my Umami Burger cravings. I had tried the truffle, umami, and duck burgers on various occasions. They all have their own good points but let me talk about the Truffle Burger as it was one of the first I tried and it left an everlasting impression on me. A bun which is soft and just right texture for the hands. The truffle cheese which gives off a nice smell along with an alluring taste when combined with a premium cut beef patty which is cooked to medium rare for that taste that can only be comprehend by saying UMAMI!!! I put some house made ketchup and some garlic aioli to add more depth. I would say only add the ketchup if you are looking for more taste as the garlic aioli would overpower the truffle cheese and burger itself. Overall, this place can get crowded and the waiting period varies from 15 mins to a hour or longer. There is a grace period right after lunch or before closing. If not and you are craving it, I would suggest sitting at the bar and ordering it. Umami Burger also has specials which are not on the menu which are the Duck Burger and French Dip Burger. Recommendations: Everything on the menu until they come up with a way to combine both the Truffle and Umami Burger into one. One can only dream how a Truffle Cheese with a Parmesan Crisp would taste like.
