A group of us met up with a coworker for a farewell drink (he got a new job & that was his last day).  It's set up as a cool three story bar, with each floor having it's own look & feel.  We sat on the third floor.  It got packed that night, perhaps because it was a Friday.  They're drinks were pretty good & priced for the neighborhood ($14/each).  They also offer a descent menu.  That night they set out a small table with some interchanging bar bits- French fries, chicken wings, etc.  We did order the mini lobster rolls & make no mistake although quite delicious they were devoured in two bites.  Or in other words $3.50/bite.  Sadly we all had to go eat for real after we left.  The service unfortunately was a hot mess!  There was one person helping to make drinks at the bar & waiting EVERYONE at the tables or standing around.  To her credit though she was doing way more than one person should be doing. However, it was because of this that having a pen & paper to write down orders would've been a good idea.  I would recommend this place, just probably not on a Friday night.
