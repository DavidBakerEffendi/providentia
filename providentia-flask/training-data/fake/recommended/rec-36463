These guys merit a serious bump in their ratings. First and foremost the food is really good. Just writing this is making me want to bite into one of their mushroom and asparagus samosas. They are consistently good, really friendly and they have made a real effort to become a part of the community. They hit the fairs and markets and recently participated in JC Fridays. More importantly Their dedication to the community compelled them to participate in feeding said community for Thanksgiving for free or by donation which went to benefit Sandy victims. Nice work,guys. And save me a Samosa...um, and a scone too.
