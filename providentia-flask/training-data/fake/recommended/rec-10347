In search of: Good Jamaican breakfast. GF never even mentioned this place as one of her faves until I told her I wanted a Jamaican-style breakfast. This place has the food prepared in a cafeteria-style display, but we had to yell through this thick bullet-proof-plastic looking barrier with tiny hamster cage holes. It was weird, but I'm noticing many food establishments in the area are like this. I thought I was in the hood, growing up in the Tenderloin of San Francisco, but I guess that hood wasn't shit compared to this. I don't know...folks seem cool out here so I can't judge the area based off a few bullet-proofish barriers. Back to the food. I had a small order of salt fish with potatoes and a beef patty. Good, good, and good. Didn't rock my tongue, but I have no complaints. It was just good...exactly what I was searching for.
