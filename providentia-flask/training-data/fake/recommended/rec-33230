Went here for dinner on my birthday with my boyfriend. We stumbled on it while walking to a different restaurant and decided to give it a try. Something about it looked perfect from the outside. And wow, perfect it was. We were greeted by a genuinely friendly hostess, seated right away, and had excellent service. We had the fried olives, lamb meatballs, a spanish style poutine (a special that evening), fried brussels sprout and a great bottle of Lambrusco. Everything was delicious but the fried olives were by far our favorite. There were so many things we wanted to try, definitely going back. The perfect place for a birthday dinner - low key but not too low key, sophisticated but not stuffy, and just all around very very pleasant. We were seated immediately, and it wasn't too crowded or loud, but this was a Monday night. I wonder how the ambiance differs later in the week or the weekend.
