Frankly, Battersby was crowded, hot and after all the wait, just "eh". Dover, however, is amazing. The hostess was so great and called me to confirm and move(!) my reservation when opentable didn't have the time slot I was looking for. The food was delicious and kept coming and coming in artfully presented ways. Complimentary delicious cheese straw things that look like broken glass? Check. Food quality and taste was top notch and the wait staff was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. Great drink menu, bonus points for having a tequila cocktail option. Dessert came in a pocket of something delicious that required unwrapping. Felt like Christmas.
