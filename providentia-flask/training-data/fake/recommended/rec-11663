Brooklyn Star was my first Brooklyn bookmark so it's fitting that I should eat here first on my first visit. The space is large, inviting, comfortable, and oh so loud. I gazed at the fried chicken and waffles as we walked passed it on the way to our seats but b-lined immediately to ordering the biscuits & gravy as soon as I saw them on the menu. Fried chicken next time for sure as the brûlée grapefruit they serve on the side made me swoon at sight. My dining companion wanted something light so he opted for the smoked trout salad. When our server asked if we'd like to start off with anything he replied with, "Mac & Cheese". I chuckled and responded with, "something light huh?" I'm thankful that he ordered this bc it was quite delicious. The breadcrumb crust was crispy, the Mac was cheesy and gooey, and the bacon chunks inside, decadent. My b&g's were great! Gravy, hot and flavorful. The biscuits were warm and flaky. Service, super casual but still welcoming and warm. I totally dug the space, reminded me of Napa ever so slightly. I'd come back, absolutely. Their dinner menu looks drool worthy and I've gotta get that brûlée grapefruit and fried chicken.
