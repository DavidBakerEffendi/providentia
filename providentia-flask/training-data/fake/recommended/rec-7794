Came here this afternoon for Kaffee & Kuchen having been to the Met. we'd spent a few days in Vienna earlier in the year and fancied a more European treat than the usual american fare to be had everywhere. The Sabarskytorte and the Rehr체cken were let-downs, but the coconut/almond/fruit cake was tasty. The Einsp채nner didn't have enough whipped cream (nor was the cream rich enough) and the espresso was more like strong coffee...it's more an american version of an Einsp채nner than something authentic. Verdict - not bad, but really a pale imitation of excellent Viennese pastries and coffee (I'd had an Einsp채nner and a piece of Sabarskytorte at Demel, Vienna).
