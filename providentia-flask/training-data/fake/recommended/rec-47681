I hate to wait.  Hate it, hate it, hate it.  But with a party of seven, we had to wait about a half-hour for a table.  Surprisingly, it was worth it.  The mashed potato-garlic-cheese and bacon pizza lived up to the rep.  A plain cheese for the less adventurous was a big hit.  And a plain red pie worked for the kids who don't like cheese.  House beers were good and the super-casual atmosphere (one page menu, paper plates, silverware in a glass in the center of the table) was nice and relaxing.  Highly recommended, especially for visitors.
