I came to this place because of their positive reviews on yelp. I got beef pho with vegetables of my choice. It is very cool to see them make the noodle at the spot and they are super fast too. The staffs were super friendly as well. I ended up eating my noodle at the upstairs sitting which is super clean and relaxing. I will def recommend this place for anyone who is in a rush and want to get something good to eat!
