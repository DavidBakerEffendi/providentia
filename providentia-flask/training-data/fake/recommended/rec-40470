I had the cheesesteak with friend onions for lunch today and it was absolutely delicious!  Best cheesesteak I've had in a long time.  Not only was the food terrific but the staff and owner were incredibly friendly.  I had such a great experience here, this is definitely going to be my top destination for lunch in the area!  Great food, great prices, very friendly staff and ownership.
