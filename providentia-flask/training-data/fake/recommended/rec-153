Overall one of the best in Hartford Atmosphere: B Service: A- Food: B+ The decor is a bit strange. I would have liked to see more stark colors against the concrete and steel interior, but the white linen really stopped Dish from making a huge visual statement. The food was pricey but very solid. I had the duck and she had a filet off the steakhouse menu with a side of yukon gold puree. She started with a crab cake that was full of jumbo lump and I ordered oysters from the raw bar that were delicious. We ordered the bread midway through our entrees because we just plain forgot and boy was I happy we did. It's a gooey, cheesey, garlicy piece of heaven. With a Stella for me and a glass of white for her, the bill came to about $130 w/  a generous tip -- again, pricey, but the quality matched the price.   I definitely thought that this place compared favorably to Firebox -- especially if you get stuck in the middle dining room at Firebox -- but I'm not sure that I'd be running back on a regular basis because it's pretty price prohibitive, even for an upscale diner.
