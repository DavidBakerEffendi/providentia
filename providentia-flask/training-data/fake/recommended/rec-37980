I feel like there's a lot of hype around this place, but it doesn't seem to live up. I've gone maybe 5 times in the last 15 months. I love the mango mojito. They have flights of mojitos as a happy hour special one day a week- that was probably my favorite experience here. I love mexican food but i felt like the chicken was usually kind of bland. The chicken fajitas have an ok flavor, but it seems like they grill a chicken breast and then cut it up instead of cutting it up and then cooking it. The chips are yummy. Rice and black beans are decent. Guacamole is good. But it's just lacking some sort of.....pizazz.
