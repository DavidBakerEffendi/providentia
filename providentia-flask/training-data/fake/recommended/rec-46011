ATTENTION!!! I can not give zero star and I'm upset about that. I have read majority of review and here's some thing people who are currently customer or would visit this place should read. 1) This place uses a lots of MSG and I can tell because I'm allergic to it. I told the waitress of the restaurant which is probably daughter or niece of the owner not to put any in and she already agreed on telling the chef not to do it yet they did it anyway. 2) There are bugs on my rice. My first bowl of rice had bugs on it so I was thinking of it as a minor mistake until my second bowl came out. there were still bugs on it. The man behind the counter offer me a 3 dollars discount which is the price of the rice bowl and throw me a dirty look. Are you kidding me? 3) I came here 3 times and same waitress serves me. Maybe the service is a little slow but i don't mind however, she asked me if I can leave the tips in CASH AND ON THE TABLE. When I asked her why, she told me the old man discreetly take the tips from his employees when they are not around. For that reason, I will never come back. For anyone that willing to eat in there despite the fact that their health is endanger, please leave the tips in cash to reduce the struggle those students who work there have to deal with beside their not very nice boss. Thank you.
