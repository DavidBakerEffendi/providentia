I didn't get the chance to eat inside in the main restaurant. So my review will be based on the outside patio area. First, if you're looking for more of a restaurant feel, you don't want to sit outside. Cash Only in the back area for all you plastic lovers. I don't mind if it helps keep the cost down. The german beer served in a nice tall mug had a nice taste to it. It was my first time drinking german beer. I had the turkey leg, cucumber salad & potato salad. Warning: The Turkey leg is the perfect size for even the hungriest cave man! Well seasoned and tasted wonderful. The cucumber salad was mixed with onion and I wanna say a sweet vinegar where it neutralized the onion completely. Normally, when you bite into an onion you get that over powering taste. Not this salad, perfect balance. The potato salad is not Vegetarian friendly, I say this laughing out loud, because I don't eat any other meats other then Chicken and Turkey. It was def loaded with something special. I wanna say bacon. But, I cant confirm unless I have it again. After I was done with my meal. $29 dollars is all I paid for me and one other person. Not bad at all! I will be back soon.
