I like this place.  I suppose if it was in the east village it wouldn't last very long, ie it's not the greatest food and a little inconsistent, but everyone is super friendly, the vibe is awesome, and the drinks are amazing, and there are a number of really good items on the menu.  Love the trout salad, the mac and cheese, the burger, the pork tenderloin and the halibut.  An overall solid go to place near our apartment.
