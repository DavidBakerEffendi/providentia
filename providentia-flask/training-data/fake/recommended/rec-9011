Key word: CONSISTENT. Hillstone, formerly Houston's of the famous Hillstone restaurant chain is a consistently GOOD place. Here you'll always, and I have to emphasize ALWAYS, Â encounter top-notch professional and excellent service. The menu has evolved from the original Houston's menu, and some of my favorites (the Waldorf salad and the smoked salmon appetizer) have unfortunately been eliminated. Thankfully they still have the mouthwatering French Dip and the famous Hawaiian Ribeye (which I think is under a different name now, but still the same). They also just added a sushi bar with a small selection of rolls, which I've yet to try, but will soon. If you're a New Yorker, and you've never tried this chain, it is definitely a MUST try. You're in for a delicious treat.
