I was skeptical at the thought of sushi with no fish in it. But i figured I need to try it out-- I got a roll comprised of avocado, sweet potato, black rice and alfalfa sprouts and it was out of this world! It came with conveniently packaged, delicious sauces to squeeze over the rolls. I can't wait to return and try the rest of the menu. And I felt so healthy afterwards!
