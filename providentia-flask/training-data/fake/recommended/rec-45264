Ok my brother and his family flew in last week on his military leave and stayed with family in NJ, and after us saying hello and talking about the flight and whatever else the first thing he said was " I dont care what we do or where we go we HAVE TO go to Nurnberger"!!!! And then we talked about the last time he was on leave and we drank about 12 wheat beers with the green syrup a piece for lunch!!!!!!! This place is amazing, it has the absolute best German food, beer and atmosphere in all of NYC and NJ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
