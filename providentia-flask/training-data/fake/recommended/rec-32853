This is hands down my favorite pizza on the island. My go-to pie was the Royal Pier UNTIL I came in recently with some out of town guests who wanted to try the arugula pie- something I never really would have ordered on my own, but am glad to have experienced! The arugula pie is perfectly balanced- salty with the shaved reggiano, sweet, topped with a healthy drizzle of reduced balsamic. A unique combination that makes perfect sense. I've told MANY people about this place and have made converts out of dozens of patrons- it's great pizza. The storefront is unassuming and the atmosphere comfortable. There is also a good selection of beers on tap.
