I live next to Â Maguillicuddy's and have eaten here several times. Also have sent family and friends to the restaurant. I have not had a bad meal nor have I heard a bad comment from anyone I recommended the restaurant. It has a nice pub atmosphere and the staff is friendly. There are plenty of TVs as well as a personal TV in each booth. The beer list is good and extensive.
