Too specialized for my taste. Expensive for what you get. Waitress was an idiot, wife had an issue with the food and she avoided us like the plague after that. Would have liked to have another beer. Ummm hello?? Kayla?? Where did you go?  Fries were good lol. Up charge "as they call it " if you want to change an item.  Don't see this place lasting long, maybe the selection beers they have will save it.
