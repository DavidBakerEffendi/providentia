Had brunch there and was wowed by the creative offering of local, organic foods as well as the pleasant service.  The "bread basket" had a lovely selection of not too sweet (which is GREAT) muffins chocolate and pumpkin, coffecake and a perfect savory biscuit.  We devoured it along with the perfectly cooked omelet with a well balanced filling of goat cheese, spinach, sun dried tomato and bacon.   The waitress kept our coffee cups filled (the coffee was as good, not great).   I thought it charming and will return when back in Philadelphia.
