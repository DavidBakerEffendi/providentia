Ive been here a few times and yes, the service is horrible, but the pasta is OK... My favorite is the Fusilli Tiberio (lamb, artichokes, onions...). But the service: Each time Ive been, we have to ask (more than once) for olive oil for our bread and then we get a little sigh when do we.  Also, when I went with my boyfriend, we were completely ignored when we asked for olive oil and when my boyfriend asked for a little more parm, he got a nasty look and a 1/4 spoonful.   I do like that they have a lot of options though...
