5 stars... delicious. Epic Win! I heard my friends rave about this place for ages but didnt finally eat it until my last visit to nyc. It went something like this Friends: Keon, you HAVE to try chicken and rice. It's soooo good!! Keon: yea, sure.. (in my mind thinking yea, yea, yea.. whatever) Friends: We are getting chicken and rice tonight after we come back from partying! Keon: Yea, sure.. (again thinking.. gosh why are these people so persistent about this chicken and rice) We get to the chicken and rice place and its like 3am in the morning. I look at the line and think OH GOD.. its long as hell. However, dont let looks fool you. This line moves very fast! As we get closer to the front of the line i notice it really does smell delicious. My friends informed me to get the lamb and chicken combo. 6 bucks later I have a delicious meal in my hand. You get a full meals worth for 6 bucks and its truly delicious. I'm sometimes wary of street food but you could see them cooking the chicken and the other food right in front of you. This did a lot to assuage any of my fears of this not being done cleanly. Everything was delicious and moist. You get a heaping portion of chicken and lamb, both are very juicy and rather flavorful. Included in your round container is some pita/naan like bread, and some lettuce. Make sure to put some white sauce on it. It adds to the yumminess! BEWARE of the red sauce. It is seriously the HOTTEST sauce I have ever eaten in life. And im not some wimp, im a foreigner and im used to hot sauce, ive even made my own hot sauce from habenero peppers. This stuff is INSANELY hot. Put a little bit in a corner, otherwise you'll start crying hahah. So overall this food is excellent. You dont even have to be drunk to enjoy it. 5 stars om nom nom!
