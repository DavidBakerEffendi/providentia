Definitely come during happy hour, the buns are only $7, normally $12 and the beers are also pretty cheap. It does seem to be pretty empty early on though. Buns: Decently good for Korean BBQ, although I'm not that experienced in this food. The sauce was good and the buns were tasty although not very filling. Unagi: Very good. I loved the sauce and it went very well with the rice. I would definitely recommend this. Bibimbap: This was the first time I ever had it, and it was pretty disappointing. Not very flavor and kinda light on the veggies. Not worth the price. Overall decently good, not overpriced, but not really a value either. Seems to have a cool bar area, but I was there pretty early and didn't Â really check it out.
