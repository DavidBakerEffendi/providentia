Crappy Service, Good Food We had a group of 13 people with reservations for a Friday night. We had to do a preset dinner which was explained when we made the reservation so that was perfectly fine. It added to the fun as it is served family style. We tried most of the appetizers and they were all good. The Lockhart dinner was also good.  The brisket was great but the chicken and ribs were just good. The desserts were mediocre so I would recommend skipping them. We tried them all and they are not worth it. The worst part was the service. Our waitress was clearly apathetic. She was extremely slow, never came over to check on us unless we flagged her down and took forever to bring the check. She clearly took advantage of the included 20% tip. Very disappointing to see that she could not bother to do the very basics of her job for her $95. I heard from the owners based on my review within a week of it's posting.  They apologized for the service and asked us to try Percy St again.  I thought it was terrific that they took the time to contact me and cared about the review.  I will go back and let you know how it goes.
