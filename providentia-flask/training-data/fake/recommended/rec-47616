I like this place a lot. The daily salads are really well dressed, fresh and delicious with interesting combinations. I also enjoy the specials. I had a chicken vegetable quesadilla that was delicious the other day. It's actually only recently that I have begun to really like it because I have realized what's good there. Years ago I went for brunch and was not impressed with the canned peaches on the pancakes or store bought granola. I also remember ordering a cake for a friend last minute and realizing that they keep frozen layer cakes in the freezer for that reason. I will say that even now I believe some of the desserts get frozen because I have noticed some freezer burned/nasty unclean fridge taste in some of their desserts. Stick to the salads and specials. I am impressed that they have so many gluten free dessert options though. Also gluten free bread but they should using nasty frozen microwavable eggs for their breakfast sandwiches.
