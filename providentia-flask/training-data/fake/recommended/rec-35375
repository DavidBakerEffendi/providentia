Really terrific spot in the middle of rustic Princeton. Started with the crab and avocado martini. If you like guacamole you will like this. Then went on to the mixed grill of Arctic Char and Baramundi, done without drying out the fish. Cod fish and chips was also delicious with a batter somewhere between New England style and English style. Even the kid's chicken tenders were excellent. The service was friendly and the vibe was youthful and casual, with just the right amount of conversational noise. It is BYOB, no liquor license. Can't go wrong with this spot.
