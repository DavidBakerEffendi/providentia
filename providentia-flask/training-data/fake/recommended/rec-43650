Few weeks ago I went to this restaurant to meet some friends and had some very good empanadas which I have not been able to find in Caracas Arepa Bar. They were very good, however, the service was somehow a disaster. Our waitress was very rude but since the place was a little full we tried to be understanding. Two weeks after we decided to call for delivery (from 4:30 PM) and the person that picked up told me that I had to call back because the computer showed that it was 4:26 PM and not 4:30 yet. We decided to be patient and give it another chance and called back after 5:00 PM without success. When they answered the phone they put us on hold for more that 10 minutes and hang up, so we decided too cool instead. Two bad service experiences can do more than some good and tasty empanadas. It is NYC so you can always find good food and service
