These guys kill it.  Its the perfect, "last minute and I don't want to cook but also don't want to spend $100 kind of meal" . Food is great, basic, italian and reasonably priced.  As for the stracciatella soup, even if its not on the menu...  they have a lobster pasta dish almost every night available for about 20 bucks.  And they always recognize us when we come in for dinner.  The food is not quite gormet, but very good, and to do any better, you'd pay 3x the price and get half the service and food.
