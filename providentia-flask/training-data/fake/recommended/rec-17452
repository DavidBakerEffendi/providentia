This will be our new go-to place for Vietnamese food. First off, the calamari was amazing, didn't realize it was Vietnamese, but I'm glad it was! We kept it simple for the meal and each got pho. Â My house special pho was excellent as well as my girlfriends p3. For dessert wet got the rainbow ice. Super interesting and refreshing. And to top it off, the staff was super friendly and helpful throughout the whole meal, explaining everything, and giving us suggestions. We usually go to the other local Vietnamese place Saigon pho and get treated coldly, we will not return there. From now on this place will cover all our pho needs.
