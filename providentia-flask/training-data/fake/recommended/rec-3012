I'm a huge fan of this place but I hardly go as much as a should.  It is more on the expensive side but it is very filling, so I'd say it's worth it.  I remember getting the tacos and thinking:  what?  Only 3 tacos?  But I was full by the end and it was pretty delicious.  I love the decor, it's very open and the circular bar in the front of the restaurant is pretty neat.  They have cool booth seating as well and comfortable chairs.  The food is top notch and they have great marg mix.
