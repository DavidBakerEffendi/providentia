Until looking for a lunch place on Yelp during a conference, I was unaware that there was such a thing as "Italian-style" pulled pork. And any time I see pulled pork on a menu, you know what I'm getting. With rave reviews on Yelp, I had to try one of these sandwiches. Unfortunately, it was slightly disappointing. I like my pulled pork tender and spicy. This version was neither. Eating it, I got the sense that I simply don't like my pork sandwiches made Italian style. The sauce was a bit runny, rather than cooked into the pork through hours of roasting. The meat itself wasn't stringy, it was simply not cooked as long and slow as the pulled pork I'm used to. Price was reasonable, food came out lightning fast, and the people were nice. If I'm in the area again I might try the brisket. The pork just didn't impress me all that much.
