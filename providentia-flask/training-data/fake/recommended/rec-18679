Came here on a Sunday at lunch time and had a great experience. The server was helpful and knowledgeable, and made excellent recommendations for wine and food. We had a salad (alla Romana), the cured meat platter, bucatini amatriciana, the pasta special (with heritage duck) and the grilled octopus (excellent), finished off with a tarfuto for dessert. We enjoyed everything and I think I prefer this to Babbo. It feels more casual which is exactly my vibe.
