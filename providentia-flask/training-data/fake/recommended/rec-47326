I'm happy this place exists. Before it, there was no decent, inviting casual place within a few blocks to go grab a casual meal with a beer in the immediate area. Service is always friendly. Beer selection is decent. Food is hit or miss (tip: the fancier the riskier..) Good atmosphere. People always seem to be chill and relaxed in here.
