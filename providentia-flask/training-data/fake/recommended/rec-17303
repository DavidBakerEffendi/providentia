I love this place.  Best sandwiches in the Tri-State I believe! The sandwiches are a very good size.  I always eat half and save the other half for later.  There corned beef is excellent but honestly I have never had a bad sandwich nor experience here. Staff is always friendly to me, food is always fresh and great.  The only thing that sucks in the parking but I will circle the block until I get a spot.
