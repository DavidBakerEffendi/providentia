I picked this place out of Reading Terminal Market by the line. I luckily showed up before I got too hungry, and I got in the longest line I saw. Directly behind me were some police officers who assured me that the roast pork with spinach sauteed in garlic and provolone was the way to go. Juicy, juicy roast pork. Full of flavor, and the spinach and provolone complemented everything perfectly. Had I not gotten an amazing Philly cheesesteak for lunch the next day, this would have been the best sandwich I had in Philly. I was happy as a clam. Not cheap, but boy was it worth it!
