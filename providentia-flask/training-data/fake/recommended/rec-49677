If your looking to watch a game [ANY GAME] this is the place!! They cater to the needs of ANY-EVERY FAN.. FOOTBALL; NFL & COLLEGE, BASKETBALL; NBA NCAA, HOCKEY, BASEBALL, SOCCER-FUTBALL, WRESTLING, BOXING, UFC - THAY HAVE ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHINg - not like other places that claim to be a sports bar, but dont even have the NHL package.. & whats even better is your not limited to ONLY watching one thing.. There has been times when I've been there that in the same room people were enjoying football, baseball, hockey & ufc.. There are 3 huge hd big screens & over 50 nice sized tvs as well all over the bar - including from what i hear - even the mens room.. Even if your not into sports thats not all the place has to offer - it is equipt to make EVERYONE happy with the events it holds, BEERPONG, COVER BANDS, BULL RIDING, KARAOKE, if there is something that a bar can have, MIAMI MIKE makes sure that he has it.. The food is exceptional for a sports bar, GIGANTIC everything, from salads you could almost swim in - too there TWO FOOT GODZILLA WRAP. Not just the normal wings & appetizers.. They have all sorts of good stuff.
