It's cheap. It's quick. It's good. Definitely a treasure in the middle of NYC's K-town. They have a buffet that serves fresh cold and hot food (to list some: pajun, japchae, chicken wings, spicy pork, bulgogi, ddeokbokgi, spicy noodles, kimchi pancakes, etc.). But definitely watch out because the cost is based on the weight and it is really easy to end up paying a lot. I used to do that a lot in the beginning before realizing I need to be careful on how much I get. But the food from the buffet are all tasty. They also have smaller pre-packaged hot food like rice+some kind of meat, kimbap, ddeokbokgi, fried rice, etc. I think these range from $5-$10. You can combine two smaller dishes and pay only like $10. Some of them even come with soup or kimchi. These dishes are pretty good too. They're not the best Korean food you can find, but for that price, it is a really good deal. And it's open very late (until like 3 or 4am) so if you ever wanted late-night Korean food, it's the perfect place to come. The bad side is, it's really hard to find seats. I've only been once or twice when it wasn't crowded. But, if you wanted takeout, this is the place!
