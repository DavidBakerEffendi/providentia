Amazing, delicious food... all done right and presented beautifully from the Magret de Canard to the Australian Lamb. It's hands down well worth any wait or price.. .the exceptional oyster selection is tough to find in the best oyster bars of the city so if you are a fan of oysters, go here!!! It was such a treat to have every oyster I've ever loved all on one menu and fresh and delicious. I just wish they were served colder. It was odd to have lukewarm oysters but they tasted clean and fresh so it didn't matter that much. We were a table of 6 celebrating a birthday party and by no means a difficult crowd yet I got the feeling that the staff was somehow put out by us rather than happy to have a big party there obviously spending money and appreciating their space. The service was great, it was fine, but for some reason not just myself, but my very laid-back friends also got a vibe of something weird from the staff. Their food requires a sophisticated palette so their staff should be prepared for the level of service expected with that kind of food. Or, if they want to be a down-to-earth Brooklyn "nabe" spot, then they should allow strollers and babies and keep it casual. In that sense there seems to be a little bit of an identity crisis going on but who cares! The space, the atmosphere, the back garden, the food, the pressed coffee...mmm...it's all wonderful and worth any slight "weird vibe" from the staff. Here's hoping they work that out and stay in the neighborhood forever. They have at least 6 new loyal repeat customers who love to spend their well-earned money on good food and wine.
