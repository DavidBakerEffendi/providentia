One of the best restaurants in Park Slope Food, service, ambiance all top notch. Â Had dinner here last week with my wife and another couple. We all enjoyed it. Three of us had the wagyu beef special and it was really good. Have the cheese selection for starters. Nice wine list as well. Another mention for the service because it was that nice.
