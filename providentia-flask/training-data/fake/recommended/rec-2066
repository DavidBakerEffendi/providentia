Yay! After having one of the most disgusting Philly Cheese Steaks I've ever had (From Genos nonetheless) I was happy to come here and have something worth eating. The guy that takes the orders is RUDE. I'm not from the East Coast so I was staring at him like, "Have you lost your mind!?!? Who do you think you're talking to!?" LOL. But apparently...its a trademark type deal to be an ahole. SO with that said; it's worth it! The sandwhiches are great!
