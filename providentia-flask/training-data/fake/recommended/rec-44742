Really not sure what the other people were eating, but when I checked out this restaurant based on the decent reviews, I wondered if I was missing out on something. Regardless of what my boyfriend or I ordered, the food was tasteless. Should've taken the pro-tip from the guy sitting across from us who poured a ridiculous amount of sriracha and cilantro into his broth before doing anything. My bowl of noodles also came with a fried egg, and the yolk was almost completely green. Tendons were also suspiciously stiff and hard to chew. On the bright side, they give you a lot of noodles and the dumplings are pretty good.
