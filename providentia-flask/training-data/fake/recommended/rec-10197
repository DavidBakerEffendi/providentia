I absolutely love Pio Pio and this location rocks! I've been to the locations in Jackson Heights, Murray Hill and the Upper West Side and the Hell's Kitchen one is by far the most fabulous looking. I went on a Friday night with a group of 9 and we had a lot of fun. Even with a packed dining room the wait staff was attentive and cheerful. There was a few people in my bunch that hadn't been to Pio Pio before and the staff was more than happy to answer any questions they had. The Pisco sours were yummy (though pretty small). I tried the sangria and it was just a bit too sweet for my liking. The food portions were as previously mentioned "family size" so everyone there was able to try a little of this & that. We all left there full to the gills and with a buzz. With Â drinks, an appetizer and a main course each, it came out to roughly $45 per person including tip. Awesome! Thank you Pio Pio!
