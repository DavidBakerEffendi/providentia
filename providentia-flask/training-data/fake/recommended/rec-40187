I am so happy to have Meritage in my neighborhood. They are so veggie friendly and we get ideas for recipes to try every time we eat here.  Omg, the pickled vegetables are so good, we have yet to figure them out.  The portions are small but this doesn't infuriate me for some reason, as it does at so many Center City establishments. They seem to make an effort to keep the vibe neighborhood-y. It's difficult to combat the pretentiousness around here but they do it well. A woman seated next to me in the crowded dining room (on New Year's Eve) complained loudly and repeatedly and dramatically that I was talking too loudly. "I can't take this!!! I need to get out of here!!!" dramatics and everything.  The staff quietly evaluated the situation and moved her poor dining partner and her to another table. The staff was so nice to me after this potentially embarrassing incident. My heroes! Also, they serve their regular menu (in addition to a special menu) on NYE, which is awesome.
