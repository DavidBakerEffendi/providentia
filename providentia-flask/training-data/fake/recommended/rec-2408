Final Decision: Philly's 2nd best steak sandwich In my road trip across the nation, I had to stop off here and try both Pat's and Gino's. I still have to say that Pat's when I was looking at the grill seemed to present a pretty nice looking Wit Whiz steak (translation steak with onions on cheez whiz).  However after taking down the sandwich that whiz flavor just did it in for me.  My mouth was having a party with all the onions and cheese whiz firing off all of my taste buds.  I do have to admit that the steak itself was a little dry and not as fatty, though the grill looked super greased up from all the steak they were cooking that day.  All in all I do like this spot but as you will see in my Gino's review, I prefer Gino's a little more.
