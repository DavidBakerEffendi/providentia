I can't say enough good things about this reatauant.  I went there on a Thursday evening and had a reservation at 6:30. Unfortunately my companion was not able to make it on time and they generously extended my reservation to a later point and when he failed to show up on time allowed me to sit at the bar and have a leisurely drink until he showed up. We were seated at a wonderful table of our choice in the back where we could talk. Unlike many restaurants in New York that have amazing food this restaurant is perfect for those that actually want to have a conversation and have a very pleasant setting. During the course of our meal we had several courses. I opted for the duck meatballs and the duck entrée and also had the soufflé for dessert. My companion had a fish entree and we also had the cucumber side dish. The presentation was superb and the tastes were well balanced. In addition the staff was phenomenal and has great recommendations for wine pairings. Additinally they had a vegetarian tasting menu that looked divine. I will be back with my vegan wife.
