Came here on a Sat night at 11pm, practically no wait (maybe 5 mins). Service was so fast, apparently I went to the bathroom and when I came back, manly fries were already on the table (apparently my group was hungry and needed it to hold them over). Had sufficient bites of 3 types of burgers since we all wanted a taste of each others stuff: the original, truffle burger, and 5 spice duck. The patties were SO TENDER and loosely packed. Glad i went with the recommended med-rare since I usually order medium. The buns - delish. Hard to say which was my favorite. Maybe the truffle burger because the patty was doused in saucy truffle-ly deliciousness. Fries were really good -crisp thin shoestring fries with cheese sauce and bacon (!) Onion rings - large, few to an order -dunno, nothing special, would have liked the batter to be more crispy maybe. Fried pickles - pretty good, served on a little bed of salad. I decided I like pickles only when they're cold. There's a large bar - the signature drinks sounded good, will try them next time. The meal was really filling and l left very happy that I had good food didn't have to wait long :)
