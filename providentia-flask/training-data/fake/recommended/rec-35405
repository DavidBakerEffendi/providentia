The prices are extremely good for the quality of the food and quantity.  Try the tuna tar tar!  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere with an extensive list of alcohol.  The only bad thing was that I sat in a small corner for 2 people and there was a fly that just wouldn't stop.  Besides that this would be a great place to go every week. Warning: The Kirin roll is huge! :)
