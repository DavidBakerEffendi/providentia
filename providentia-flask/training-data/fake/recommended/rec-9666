I came here for lunch and was excited by the Yelp reviews and elegant decor.  Lunch special was a good price - I got the fried dumplings with shrimp pad thai.  My co-worker got tom yum soup with the lychee + shrimp fried rice. The fried dumplings came in a sweet and sour sauce and wasn't anything special.  I guess I was just expecting hot off the griddle potstickers but got fried meatballs instead... :( The pad thai was an enormous portion with a beautiful presentation.  But the noodles were drenched in sauce and was way too much noodles and not enough egg.   The lychee fried rice on the other hand, tasted pretty good.
