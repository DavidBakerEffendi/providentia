I had dinner last night wih some of my girlfriends and we really enjoyed it!  The food was great, the wait staff was very attentive and Mario is adorable!  Before we went there, I was a little worried about some of the unfavorable reviews the restaurant got.  One there I realized nothing could be further from the truth.  Everything was delicious and I will definitely be going back with my husband very soon.
