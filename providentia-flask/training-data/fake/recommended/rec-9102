perfect for a late-night power grub. went on a fri around midnight, were seated right away (but the place was gettin packed). shared the pate and the bone marrow oxtail marmalade - melted in my mouth. it's pretty heavy stuff, i recommend splitting between 3. not much of a decor but very dark inside anyway. don't know about dnr, but the late-night ambiance was bustling with couples on dates and tipsy groups that neutralized the 'stuffy' menu. have gone twice and the experience was consistently great.
