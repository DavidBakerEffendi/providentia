I stopped by Punjab this afternoon for a quick bite and some chai. For $5, you get 3 veggie dishes on top of rice with a mini-salad. The Aloo Gobi was my favorite. Good deal and good Indian food for your lunch break. And I agree with Nish's review, the chai is great. I work a few blocks away from this spot and I will definitely be back for more.
