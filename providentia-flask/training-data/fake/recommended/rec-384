A nice laidback bar perfect for happy hours. There are a few TVs here, and the bartenders are pretty cool about letting the patrons control what they want to see. The happy hour specials are just right. $5 sangrias are just right, and this is one of the few places I can go for Midori sours. The best thing here is the portabella and bacon salad. I think they use bacon fat drippings in the dressing, which is like a wet dream of deliciousness. There's never been a lot of people whenever I come here, which is great because the service is very attentive.
