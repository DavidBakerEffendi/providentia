Always packed, so reservations are a good idea! That said, the two times that I have been there they have kindly fit me in on the shared marble table in the back. Honestly, I think it is the best seat in the house! You are right there int he middle of the action and get a chance to see what is coming out of the kitchen. I love the grilled octopus...with a squeeze of balsamic.
