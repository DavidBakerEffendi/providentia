It's about what I expected. Greasy meat and onions on a great piece of bread but it's part of the Philly experience. We got there right before a huge lunch rush which lasted the rest of the time we were there. I'd venture to say that a Whiz wit would be awesome at 2am on the way home from the bar though. I'll try Pat's next to compare, then I've gotta get a roast pork that people rave about. I love sandwiches!
