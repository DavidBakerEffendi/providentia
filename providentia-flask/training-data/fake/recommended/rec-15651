Walked in without a reservation, and were told there was a 20 minute wait. It was a Saturday night, and the restaurant looked packed (both outside and in), so I was rather impressed.  However, since there isn't much of a waiting area, we decided to walk up the block to kill time.  I imagine this will be an issue in the colder months, when standing outside/walking around isn't exactly ideal. Once we were called, we were sat downstairs, which is more intimate (the upstairs, by the bar, is more of a scene), but the *screaming* baby sitting next to us really detracted from everything (it was also after 9 PM, and why someone would bring a baby to a restaurant like this is beyond me).   Despite this, the food was fantastic.  Started with proscuitto and cheese, which was a great, but then moved on to the entrees, which were each a homerun.  Had the taglietelle and the truffle gnocchi, which was, just like the other reviewers stated, pretty amazing.  We were able to pair the two with a nice glass of wine, of which made for a special meal. Yet, to be honest, we felt a bit rushed at the end.   The waitress kept coming by to see if we had paid our bill, even though there was clearly wine left to drink.  After her third go around at our table, we finally decided to pay the tab and leave.  I don't know if they close the downstairs earlier or what, but we did also note that everyone had their checks on the table as well, but were in different stages of meal completion.   However, I would definitely come back, or even do take out -- the food was that good.
