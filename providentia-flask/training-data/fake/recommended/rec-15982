With all this hype about this restaurant I was a bit disappointed with the food. The food was okay. Nothing super special. It seemed like more of a Korean fusion than Korean food. The service was okay also. It was hard to get the waiter's attention when we were squished in the corner. It was expensive for an okay meal. I would probably not go back unless I really had to.
