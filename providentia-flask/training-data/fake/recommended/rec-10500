Last of the decent places to eat and drink in this area. When the neighborhood opens up a nightclub down the block that is "Eco-friendly" you can best bet a place like this is on the endangered species list. Ear Inn has great atmosphere that cant be replicated or imitated. The character of this place can only be earned by the test of time. Dining area reminds me of a set from the movie Popeye, and the food is surprisingly good. Please try to go while its still around.
