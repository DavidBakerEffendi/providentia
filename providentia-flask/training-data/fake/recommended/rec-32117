The people here are great. They are very friendly and fun to talk to. The coffee is outstanding. I ordered iced macchiato and it is so awesome. The place is a tad small but cozy. One of the best place in NYC for travellers who took megabus or Amtrak because of the location and the business hours. Will definitely come again if I ever find myself in NYC in the future.
