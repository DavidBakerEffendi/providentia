I'm already obsessed with the Caracas location on the LES, so I was preeettty thrilled when this one opened not too far from my neighborhood. I was worried it might not stack up against the original, but after several visits I can safely say that's not an issue. It is just as delicious - I even have a few new favorite things I hadn't tried at the Manhattan one, including the Mulata arepa, the Venezuelan guac w/ plantain chips and the yoyos (really sweet, they kind of taste like french toast!) Actually, it might be even better, because this location is bigger than five square feet. There's even a back patio! I also don't think I mentioned the greatest part of the Caracas experience on my other review -- THE SAUCE. The sauce the sauce the sauce. They put bottles of this stuff on each table and I am not joking when I say there is no dish known to man that this sauce cannot improve. Holy moses. Seriously, if they sold the stuff at the front counter they'd be sitting on a goldmine. Get your ass over to Caracas.
