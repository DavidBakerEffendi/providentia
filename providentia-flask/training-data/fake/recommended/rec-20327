I've been here several times now.  On my initial visit, I enjoyed sampling whiskey and eating some cheese curds, all in a laid back atmosphere. However, the past three times I have been to Char No. 4, I realize it doesn't have that much of a unique perspective to offer.  There are so many solid bars in the general vicinity (Clover Club, for example, where the prices are soooo worth it) that unless you want to have an ounce or two of a really unusual whiskey, it's just not worth the money.  It's too bad, I really, really want to like you, Char No. 4. Beyond the prices and disappointment with the concept, my overall experience there was always pleasant and I will give them an extra star for the attentive service.
