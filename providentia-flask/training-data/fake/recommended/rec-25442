I ended up here on a last minute hunt for good thai.  Didn't know there was such a great restaurant in my own backyard!  Bangkok Kitchen was delicious, fast, fresh, and  priced reasonably.  We got an appetizer and 2 entrees + tip = $40.  The decor would fool you into thinking you were on the LES.  Loved everything about the place and will be going back in the future.
