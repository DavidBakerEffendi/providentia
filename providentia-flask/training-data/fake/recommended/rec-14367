Atmosphere - Small, Chinatown, hole in the wall. It was what I was expecting from the reviews, didn't lose any points for this, but didn't gain any either. Cleanliness - I admit, I am a bit of a germ-a-phobe and this caught my eye. The cashier guy handled the sesame pancakes, while refilling a tray, with his hands after countless interactions with money and people. He wasn't man handling them, but definitely were touching them. They also had these small wax bags for the pancakes that didn't cover the whole thing, so when it was set down, the tips would touch or almost touch the counter, where all transactions took place. Take it for what you will, I still ate it, ignoring this in the back of my (germ-a-phobe) mind. Dumplings - I got 2 orders of the steamed (boiled) vegetable dumplings. I think 6 or 8 come in an order. But one order was enough for me at $2.50. When I ordered they took them out the fridge so it was fresh, and I'm assuming they don't get much veg orders compared to the fried meat dumplings. They were ok, the dough was good, but I wasn't a fan of the filling. It seemed a bit too salty, white peppery, or MSG'y (I am indifferent to MSG), which made me take out the extra filling, by the end of the meal. There was also, like, sand or something in the filling, I assume they didn't clean the veggies enough. The veggies had an ok flavor. Also got a sesame pancake which was good. Oh and the dumplings didn't come with sauce, which wasn't expected and would've been nice to have. I don't think they give any, didn't see anyone else get any. Maybe if you ask? Money - Nice and cheap, as expected in Chinatown. I was satisfied with $3.50 worth of food, and stuffed with $6 worth. The Verdict - From a veggie guy, I wont be coming back, I love me some dumplings, but I didn't like the filling very much. I've had better Dumplings in Chinatown.
