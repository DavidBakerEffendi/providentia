surprisingly good!  no, really...  had their guacamole burger and had not regrets in having chosen something that was not in season;  not for the east coast anyways.  so, enough said. i was impressed with how the place very much projects a very southern-ish flair.  and the girls are so mm...mm  momma like!  :)  rosy and maria (the hostess) were cute and carried a pretty smile the entire time i was there (granted, i wasn't at the restaurant that long -- yet the gate to my delayed flight was right next door -- terminal C).  a rarity for a venue located in such busy intersection at EWR.  i was impressed.  mmh mmh  :)
