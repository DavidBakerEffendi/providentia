Attempt #1: Came on a Tuesday night at 7pm... was told the wait for 2 people would be an hour and a half. Gave up because we were too hungry. :( Attempt #2: Decided to be more strategic and went on Sunday night at 5:15pm. The wait was still 45 minutes for 3 people, but we weren't that hungry so that was fine with us. Ended up chilling at a nearby garden until our name moved to the top of the waitlist on this cool phone site. Once inside, we decided to split some sides to share, and each get our own burger: - Truffle fries ($5.50) - They came with truffle cheese and truffle salt, but I thought the truffle taste could've been a tad stronger. I really liked the trio of sauces that it came with: jalapeno ranch, diablo, and garlic aioli. - The original burger ($12) - The default is medium rare, which was perfect for me. The meat came super tender, and the burger included shiitake mushrooms, caramelized onions, tomato, parmesan crisp, and Umami ketchup. The flavors I noticed the most were the onions and the ketchup. The burger was just the right size to be filling but not food coma-inducing (at least for a small girl like me... my male friend thought differently.) - Tempura onion rings - They were okay, nothing amazing. I liked the truffle fries way more. This was two weeks ago, so I don't know if the hype has died down at all, but I definitely want to come back to try the other burgers. The woman in charge of taking down names also mentioned takeout starting in probably a few months (when business has died down enough that the kitchen can handle it) so I'll be looking forward to that as well!
