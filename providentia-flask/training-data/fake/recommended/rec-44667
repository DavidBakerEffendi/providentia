Like other reviewers said - The back room is gorgeous. Brunch was tasty - but a little expensve. I felt kind of ripped off for what I got ... And the cocktails came in TINY TINY glasses!!! I mean, I guess it's reflected in the price of the cocktails, but man, you feel like you're drinking out of a 3-year-old's sippy cup! I finished mine in 2 gulps. I could order 10 of those, and they would equate to 2 regular cocktails in any other restaurant.
