Just when you thought ABC couldn't get any better...  The menu is more concise than average however it works in B4's advantage.  I was blown away by the non-conventional flavor combinations and how well they worked (i.e. 'sweet potato planks' aka sweet potato wedges/fries that were served with a sesame peanut butter sauce).  Your standard items such as the pizza, pasta and not to mention complimentary bread tasted very fresh where the dough had a certain 'lighter than air' texture.  I highly recommend going but make sure you book a reservation as this place fills up quick!
