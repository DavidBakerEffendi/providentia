I have to say, Yelp has always done me right and so I was optimistic going into Ilili since it has a lot of reviews and the average is 4 stars. You people let me down. I mean, not tremendously. But a little bit. Everything was good -- it was. I especially liked the lentils and the yogurt (larbe? can't remember the lebanese word), and the desserts were tasty. But....it felt a little weird to be eating street food (shout out to Mamouns) like falafel and humous on a white table cloth. Everything was fine...just not great or even very good. Â  As a main, I had the hamachi (tasted very oily but was oddly also light) and my husband had the lamb chop. He made a "meh" face when I asked him how the chop was. And -- and perhaps this ages me -- but the joint was LOUD. We were seated at a table right by one of the speakers and that sucked a wee bit. Anyway, stop by Ilili if you're in the hood, but definitely don't go out of your way to go.
