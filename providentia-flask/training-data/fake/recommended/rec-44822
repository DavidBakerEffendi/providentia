The Bacon Cheeseburger at the little owl in Manhattan keeps it simple. This burger is only served at lunch and is worth a special trip. A bakery bun, mouthwatering patty, melted cheese, and flavorful bacon makes this one a classic. Add in single serve mini condiment bottles and a cool little corner spot feel, and you feel like you are somewhere special. This burger takes something simple and dresses it up gourmet.
