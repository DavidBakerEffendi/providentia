This place never fails. I've been frequenting this place for quite some time over the years with my family, and I don't think we'll be changing habits anytime soon. This is our go-to place on Restaurant Row and our go-to place for some fantastic pasta and Italian cuisine, andd our go-to place in Midtown if we're really feelin homey and want some home-style dishes and friendly service. The all you can eat pasta choice, "Sinfonia di Pasta", is really the best deal on the menu. One of us usually always orders that so the rest of the family can have a taste here and there of the many varieties of pasta the kitchen is cooking up. The wine is excellent and the portions are hearty. I love the veal here - it's so tender and literally melts in your mouth. The bread is awesome as well. Becco's got a classy-casual ambiance to it, the staff are warm and genuinely happy to have you there. I'm actually looking forward to our next family dinner here. Thanks - here's to you, Becco (followed by cheesy grin and two thumbs up)!!
