Im a bit sad I didnt get to check this place out more thoroughly when I was in town. They seem to have both a great cocktail and food program going. Considering I was right next to it where I was staying I didnt stop in until I had a few remaining hours before leaving the country. Sat at the bar and challenged the bartender with something not too heavy as I was getting on a cross Atlantic flight. She came up with a version of a lemonade that really satisfied. Did some people watching and eavesdropping on some of the locals before heading out. Seems like a great local joint and when I swing through here again, ill definitely spend more time
