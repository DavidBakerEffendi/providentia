My reason for a 2-star rating: Our waitress charged us full-price for Happy Hour drinks.  I even told her that the price was wrong, and she still refused to change it. AND THERE'S A HUGE SIGN AT THE FRONT OF THE RESTAURANT THAT SAYS, "HAPPY HOUR DRINKS - $6!!!" But on my receipt, every single drink was $10.  POO on you, Yucca Bar.  I'll never go there again. After reading so many 5-star reviews from other Yelpers regarding Yucca bar, I decided I had to try this place out. I took my friend for Loco Tuesday, half-priced tapas.  We journeyed long and far, paying much bus fare and subway fare to get from our home in New Jersey to the East Village, seeking what we were told we would find: tasty, inexpensive tapas and yummy drinks. Not the case. While the tapas were reasonably priced and tasted fine, there was nothing fantastic about them.  The drinks tasted good, but they were over-priced (seeing as how I expected to pay Happy-Hour prices.) So take caution... Happy Hour is not what it appears to be.
