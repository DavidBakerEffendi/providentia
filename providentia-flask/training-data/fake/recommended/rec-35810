This is one of my favorite Chinatown destinations--it's cheap and delicious! I always order the Tom Yum soup (perfect if you're craving hot and sour--esp. in the wintertime), the raw flank steak (served with fresh cilantro, crispy shallots/garlic, crushed peanuts, and a chili vinaigrette), and usually a whole steamed striped bass with ginger and scallions--and for around $20 a whole, fresh fish is a super bargain. And an avocado shake for dessert! YUM!!! And let's get to the good part: C H E A P Â A L C O H O L. Awesome. Beers are under $3, mixed drinks are under $5. But that's everywhere in Chinatown pretty much. Any minuses would be that it takes a long time to get a check or refills sometimes, and I think it closes pretty early--like 10pm?
