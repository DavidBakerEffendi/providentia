the flatbread/pizza I had a few months ago was pretty good. The spaghetti bolognese was only ok. The staff were extremely nice and helpful. If you're in the area and hungry, this would be a quick and filling way to go. I wouldn't go out of my way to get here though. As I do live nearby, I'll give it another try.
