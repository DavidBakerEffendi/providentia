Food is excellent here. The ingredients are clean and fresh--really important at a hotpot place. The ice cream afterward is very refreshing, and a good end to a hot meal. In addition, the rice wine selection here is fantastic. Try any of the sojus--worth the money. Probably the most legitimate hotpot place on the east side.
