So, a couple of weeks ago the wife was jonesing for Mexican and had  heard about this place from some friends. I'm not a big lover of Mexican but usually order beef fajitas when she drags me to one of these places.   We arrived later in the evening so the place was fairly empty,, only 2 other tables occupied with 4 and 5 people. So imagine my surprise when we stood waiting in the entrance-way for over 12 minutes waiting to be seated. I finally wandered to the back of the house looking for an actual employee.  At that point the waiter pops out from somewhere and asks if he can help us. I inquire is they are still open as we have been waiting in at the door for over 10 minutes. He say, "yeah, well, I'm by myself tonight" as if that should explain and make everything alright then, So we are seated and he take our drink order. The wife orders a margarita a I a coke. Just about another 10 minutes pass before the drinks arrive. During this time I note that fajitas are not on their menus. However, when I inquired he states they make them, it's just not on the men. Although the price quoted seemed a bit high, I was just happy that I could get my fajitas. My wife also ordered a beef dish although I forget exactly what. And off he goes to put in the order. About 10 minutes later he's back at the table to tell us that "they are out of beef" and asked if we'd like a chicken dish? Having now wasted almost 3/4 of a hour here  just to come to find out that they don't actually have anything we felt like eating, we gave the thing up as a bad job and headed to the local Chili's having sampled only the Coke and a margarita, which the wife says pretty much sucked. To recap, service sucked, drinks sucked and the food was non-existent. I believe we'll be passing on Fiesta Hut in the future and can only suggest that others do the same.
