Dessert was good, especially the apple strudel and the german chocolate cake. Came solely for dessert but they gave bread and butter on the table. Bread was nothing special, just cold plain bread. Accidentally went to the bar next to it, thinking it was the restaurant and ended up eating at the bar. Menu very limited at the bar, with no dessert.
