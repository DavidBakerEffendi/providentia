Maybe I'm being a little bit biased because I came here during my birthday bar crawl, but I remember LOVING Swift. I can't comment on the food (see previous bar crawl mention) but their beer list was beautiful! The bartender bought me a drink on the house, the Irish guys beside us bought us a round. Someone accidentally ordered too many beers for their party and brought it to us... seriously. The place is huge and fun and I love the vibe. The bartenders were funny and chatty without forgetting people. I've never been to Ireland, but I hope everyone is as friendly as they were at Swift.
