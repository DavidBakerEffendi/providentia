A really solid and fun place, totally different than the typical Philly scene. There's a large indoor portion, as well as a huge outdoor courtyard with an army of heat lamps and fire pits. Even on a chilly night, you can sit outside relatively comfortably, especially once you have a liter of craft beer in your hand. They also feature ping pong/foosball tables, smores to roast over the fire ($1 each), and games like jenga and uno. It's a really festive atmosphere usually, everyone there is looking to have a good time. The food is also great! I had a sausage there which was everything you'd expect. They have these crazy fluffy pretzels which make for great beer food. The only downsides: $14 can be a lot, even for a full liter of beer. Also, despite how huge the place was, we had to wait outside for 5 minutes (of course we were the only ones in line) on a saturday night. Depends on the weather. I imagine this place might get impossibly crowded in the spring and summer. Oh, and if you sit outside, be prepared to smell like fire/smoke. It's going to happen.
