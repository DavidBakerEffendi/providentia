A very nice addition to the downtown dining scene.  I reserve the right to come back and modify this when I've eaten more often, but I'm very pleased with Dish. Two friends and I spent a pleasant afternoon here on new year's eve, having an early toast and a late lunch at the bar.  The food was delicious, the service friendly and the room very attractive.  We kept it basic - burgers, calamari, salad - but the food was prepared with care beyond its casual theme.  An iceberg wedge salad came as a group of tiny wedges, each flavorfully dressed and sprinkled with bacon.  A plate of crisply and lightly fried calamari was a generous portion and well-liked by my friends.  Burgers and fries - both beef and turkey - were well-prepared and very tasty.  The turkey burger was presented as a "Club Sandwich," including tomato, lettuce, bacon and guacamole. The restaurant offers very pleasant, open spaces in a large dining room, a comfortable bar, and even features a small dessert bar just inside the front door.  There's a large area of the dining room at the rear of the restaurant that can be closed off for private parties.  The decor is sleek and modern with a hint of industrial, but still comes off warm and welcoming.  Who ever thought you could say that about a place that includes metal chains as part of the decor?! This was a great place to while away an afternoon over some drinks and good food.  We weren't rushed or ignored.  We enjoyed our food, and we felt like we were in a "city" kind of place.  Can't wait to try Dish for dinner!
