It's 3am, you have been drinking for 8 solid hours, losing count after about hour 4. But, wait, on your cab ride home, there in the distance is a fuzzy little beacon of hope, lit up on the edge of Chinatown (conveniently right before your taxi will take you home to BK). It's time for NOODLE TOWN! It's packed, lined up out the door but worth the wait. And when you get a table the service is brisk (don't expect Danny to make too much small talk) and in no time your hangover is already been cured by the hot salty goodness that comes out the kitchen (don't look in that direction by the way, i believe that ignorance is bliss). And when you have a bag full of leftovers in hand you can't quite believe the bill only comes to $24. Really. I have eaten here more times than I can count and if I don't go there at least a couple times a month, the cravings start. Order: roast duck or other bbq'd meats, beef pan fried noodles (a mainstay- another option to try is with black bean sauce, a new discovery for me!), any of their wontons and dumplings, special fried rice...and the list goes on. An integral part of a true epic party night in NYC.
