Meh.  Tia Pol was decent but definitely didn't live up to my expectations.   Everything we ordered was good but not spectacular.  The tapas for the evening were: salt cod and potato puree razor clams and cockles lamb skewers tuna stuffed with marinated white anchovies toasted baguette topped with tomato puree with trio of spreads sauteed swiss chard special The wine the waiter recommended was excellent, as was the sangria.  The service was speedy and quite friendly.  Seating is intimate (you sit at the same table as others).  They did take a reservation for two on a Tuesday which was definitely a life-saver.   All in all, would I come again?  Yes, but probably only if I was in the area.  And could get a table relatively quickly.  But my search for phenominal traditional tapas in NYC continues!
