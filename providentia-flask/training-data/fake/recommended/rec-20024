Since when does Mexican food mix with French food? This place is really nicely decorated and all, but the food is over rated. I have been here once and will not go back again. I had the Queso Fondito as an appetizer and the hanger steak for dinner. I've had better and cheaper hanger steaks elsewhere. I truly did love the creme brule though... They had 3 kinds of them and the chocolate one was really really good.
