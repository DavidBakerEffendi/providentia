Let me start off by saying that I don't normally write reviews, I'm really more of a leech when  it comes to Yelp.  Anyways, this is one of the few times I've felt the need to actually write a review. There are a few different things that are great about this place.  The first, and one that seems to have been said ad nauseam, is that the food is fresh, healthy, organic, and considering these things, also very affordable. The owners are so down to earth and you can tell that they really take pride in what they do.  You really don't see that too often and it's quite refreshing. Lastly, the biggest thing that I took away (besides feeling incredibly satisfied) is that these guys really do put every dollar into the food.  It's a small space on Amsterdam (not Broadway) and there are hardly any decorations.  They bring your food out with paper napkins that they probably buy at Walmart and a pint glass of water.  No frills and I love it.  You can tell they spend as much money as possible on getting the best ingredients money can buy.  If my memory serves me well, I think Fidel said the turkey, chicken, and lamb were all from a farm in northern NJ.  The veggies were all from a farm in Wycoff.  Anyways, I'll stop rambling now but I can tell you that I'll be adding Busters to my repertoire of local spots.
