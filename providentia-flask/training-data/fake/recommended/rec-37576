went for a birthday meal and fell in love. The restaurant has a very cozy setting and love the fact that their menus have the date written with menus constantly changing. I had the duck which was scrumptious. A rare BYO with great quality food. They had excellent service and would definitely come back. Amazing dessert as well.
