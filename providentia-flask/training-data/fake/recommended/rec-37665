Juniper is my favorite neighborhood spot. So downhome and friendly. Everyone that works here is Asian. They are seriously stereotype-busting with their southern fried comfort food - I always order the truffle burger with gouda cheese and spicy fries.  Daresay I believe their burgers better than DuMont (which still holds mac and cheese crown in my book.) I think they may be suffering some growing pains a bit from becoming a smash success -  but certainly they are the nicest folks on the block, and deserve their great reputation.  Be patient during the lunch and dinner rush, or if you are a neighborhood person, come around closing time (10-11pm) to chat with the owners and the regulars.
