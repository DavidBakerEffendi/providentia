Went here for a special wedding anniversary. One walks out of many fine dining establishments in NYC feeling that they didn't quite deliver given the hype, that the food was ultimately a tad boring, or that the quality of entrees did not match that of the appetizers. Not so at Bouley. Given how often the tasting menu changes and how many reviews this place already has, I won't focus on listing specific menu items. Every dish was between very good and amazing. I also appreciate that they throw in a lot of extra dishes not listed on the menu, and they gave us an additional dessert to boot. The breads are absolutely to die for (don't miss the saffron one and the fig one, if they're available). The service is great, although I have seen friendlier/warmer waiters overall. There was quite a bit of foot traffic in front of our table at first, but that subsided. The place is classy, knows its identity, and will spoil you forever.
