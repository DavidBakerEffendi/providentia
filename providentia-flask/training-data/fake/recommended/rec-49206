I am a Jersey girl (North dirty!!).  I only know Manhattan - 34th street and above.  That being said, I must say this part of Brooklyn is cute!  Nothing too mainstreeam and very quiet.  And yes, hipster.  Though us old people like to call it "indie." The ambiance is great.  We sat outdoors which is pretty much the back yard of a brownstone, which was a lovely/comfy/homey set up.  Nice plants surrounded us so you definitely felt like you were in the backyard and you were getting a home cooked meal.  The inside was nice, but I didn't get a chance to really look at the bar, which I heard was made from old pianos. The food was great.  The fried calamari (which is what we always get no matter where we are) was awesome and it came with an anchovy mayo dip = YUM!!!   Another YUM factor is that we ordered the Skate and the Rake (both fish) that was tender and perfectly seasoned.  They were immensed in peas and beans, so at least it's healthy! The only downfall is that my boyfriend originally ordered the prime rib but they ran out :( I definitely recommend this place.
