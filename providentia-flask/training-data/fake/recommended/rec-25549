Lunch specials are fantastic options. Kofta kebap was tender and well spiced. Tavuk Iskender has a flavorful tomato sauce. Ezme was amazing! Lebni outstanding! Hummus was the best I've had in a long time. Service was attentive, efficient and not annoying. Restaurant  was clean and elegantly  decorated.  Music was beautiful.  My Turkish companion said the flavors were authentic and gave the food his seal of approval.
