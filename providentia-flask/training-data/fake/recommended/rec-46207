I wanted to like papas, but after giving it a second chance we won't be back.   Pros The tomato sauce is very good.   Its sweeter than most others in the area. The outdoor atmosphere is nice. Cons The sausage and pepperoni was excessively oily. The sausage had bits of bone and a lot of indescribable bits in it.  I expect this to happen once in a while but combined with the sheer volume of oil this was a deal breaker. The crust was well done but still too soft The antipasto was iceberg lettuce, oil and tiny cubes of cheese and salami.  It wasn't worth 7.50 Sorry papa.  There are too many other pizza places in this area to make me want to come back.
