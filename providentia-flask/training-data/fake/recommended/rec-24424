Welcome to a charming little tapas joint in Chelsea. Salinas is a great date spot, with a nice dim setting that is lively but not too loud. They have a number of good dishes - I had the braised short ribs entree. I'd also recommend the Comandante cocktail. Overall, there are lots of interesting dishes to try, the price is ok, and the ambiance is very enjoyable.
