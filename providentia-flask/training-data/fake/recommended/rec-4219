For real, though, tequila is no longer just something to justify going home with ugly people anymore.  Xochitl, like its sister restaurant the magnificent Zahav, goes above and beyond the norm to create an amazing dining experience.  I always chill at the bar, as Xochitl has some of the most hospitable and knowledgeable (not to mention heavy-handed) tenders in the city.   Though some truly great tequilas will set you back a bit its more than worth it.  Personally, I'm partial to the Casa Noble Anejo, a tree-bark brown delight that my friends and I describe as "the one that smells like Grandma and tastes like Grandpa."  A warm butterscotch nose precedes the cherry tobacco flavors, finished with lively spearmint.  Its on this one that I really learned to appreciate sipping tequila rather than the old standby: lick, slam suck.  No limes and salt, please, just a snifter-shaped glass and a side of sangrita (the amazing spicy tomato and citrus aperitif served alongside most tequilas enjoyed neat). Its impossible to be steered wrong on the menu--everything is heavenly--but the true delight is always going to be the tequilas, whether standing by themselves, in one of the creative house cocktails or in the margarittas made with freshly squeezed limes. As an added bonus, Xochitl is quite often a bustling hub of food industry peeps, especially on Sundays.  You're never going to find a more lively, and engaging crowd.  Staff from Zahav--those lucky bastards--are encouraged to enjoy their shift drink at Xochitl (and vice versa) but chances are you'll find restaurant people from all over the city.  And really, if there's one group you ought to trust about where to find the best food and drink, its them.
