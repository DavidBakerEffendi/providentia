I was in the area & thought I should try an "authentic" Philly Cheesesteak.  Maybe this was an off-day, but I was charged $12 for a cold sub with grilled onions & cheese.  Maybe I should have gone for the cheese-whiz version, but I just couldn't do it.  The meat had little to no flavor.  The fries were good & if you wanted fixin's there were unlimited hot peppers as well as ketchup & different mustards.  Next time I will try Sarconne's down the street.  They have a sign about how good the bread is & their bakery is just a few doors down.  And when I went in it smelled wonderful.  And this was after eating a whole sub + fries + a drink.  Imagine the enjoyment if I was actually hungry.  Regretfully yours, in the city of brotherly love.
