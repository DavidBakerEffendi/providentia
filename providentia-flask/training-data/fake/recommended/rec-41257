wow! wow! wow! Amazing! We came here for dinner on a quick weekend trip to Philly and were quite pleased. We sat at the kitchen counter, which was great, we could watch all the cooks and the amazing Peter Serpico in action. Seeing all the the different dishes come together right before your eyes made it difficult to choose which ones to order. We decided on the duck liver mouse, oxtail soup, egg custard & caviar, deep fried duck leg, cope's corn ravioli, seasonal vegetables and the goat cheese sorbet for dessert. All were unique and delicious. The duck leg was great, it's served on a bun with cucumber and hoisin, kind of like a mini bahn mi. yum! Loved the chalkboards covering the walls.
