One of the best sandwiches I have ever had! I have tried the roast pork, the roast beef, the beef brisket and the Italian pulled pork! All 4 were delicious and I thank Adam Richman for introducing me to this fine sandwich shop! If you are at the Reading Terminal Market and don't mind waiting at least 20 minutes in line you will not be disappointed. The roll was spectacular (to me a good roll really makes the sandwich) the pork was plentiful, juicy and full of flavor. I really can't do cheese but I had a bite of my brothers with the sharp provolone and broccoli rabe and it was very tasty. I can't wait to go again!
