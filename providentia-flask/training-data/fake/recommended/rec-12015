I spent my day off this week stay-cationing in Red Hook - one of my new favorite places in Brooklyn. The Lobster Pound was my first stop, and it was a really great experience. Although it didn't look as though they were open at first, the owner happily made a killer (Maine style) lobster roll & even let me peek at the lobsters swimming in their tanks. It was a nice way to feel far away from the normal Williamsburg/Greenpoint hustle of people & things, while only being a short G train ride away. I do agree with the other reviewers that it was a little pricey, but I was completely into it. I'll be stay-cationing there again very soon...
