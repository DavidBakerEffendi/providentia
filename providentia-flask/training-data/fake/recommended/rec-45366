I'm writing this review after our second visit to Rucola. We had a fantastic meal thanks to Julian and the incredible crew there. The Bolognese, hands down the best I've ever had and the crudo was something exceptional. The grilled trout was similarly impressive and perfectly cooked and seasoned. Overall, it's a wonderful and much welcome neighborhood spot, unpretentious, dependable with delicious food. Considering its size and how busy it consistently is, it never feels crowded and there's no deafening roar, plus we've never had to wait long for a table. It great to have another go-to in the area where you're guaranteed a good fare and a good time.
