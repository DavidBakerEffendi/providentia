I have been to this place several times, lunch and dinner.  Overall, my assessment is still "this place has potential".   It is super nice to see so many different raw oysters featured.   A great place to sample different kinds.  Not cheap though.   Besides the oysters, simply grilled items are good.  The lunch items offer good value.   The trajectory is probably up.  Your experience may depend on the wait staff.   Quite variable.  Some good while others need much more training...
