Good for carnivores, those who prefer seafood, and vegetarians.  Very friendly staff, reasonable prices, quality of the food was very high.  Someone said the neighborhood was sketchy; it wasn't Park Avenue but I didn't find it threatening.  And if you're still concerned, they have their own parking lot that surrounds the restaurant.
