R.I.P. Hoagie Haven. Look, I grew up on this place, but it's changed for the worse.  Terrible service, too.   It used to be, they cared about service and how you liked their sandwiches.  Now, the owners are just resting on the brand and hype. Last time I went in, the guys making the hoagies didn't care about you.  I like to pick the condiments on my hoagie.  The guy didn't pay attention.  Not sure if he even understood what I was asking for.  I mean, who slathers ketchup on a cheesesteak???  In the glory days, they used to ask you before they placed each ingredient.  "Lettuce, tomato?" "Hot pepper?" And they don't use the same "salad dressing" anymore.  Not sure what happened to it, but the replacement is just unremarkable. So in the end, what I got was a cheesesteak that tasted more like a bad hamburger from McDonald's. Like I said, R.I.P. Hoagie Haven.  Used to be great, but too many other good options.
