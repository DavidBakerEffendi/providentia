Is this a chain? Because it sure tastes/feels like a chain. The menu is full of the typical traditional crowd pleasers - hot artichoke dip, overstuffed chef salad, big juicy steaks. If they snuck some blooming onions on the menu, I wouldn't be surprised. So no, not the place for the roving gastronome. However, for the half dozen times I've been here, the food has been of consistently decent quality. It's dimly lit atmosphere is enhanced by being slightly below ground and although it can get crowded, the vibe is pleasant enough, in a midtown business-suit kind of way. If you're going on your company's dime, there are far worse places to spend an hour or two. And if you're going on your own, hey, you're probably into this type of joint anyhow. Win win.
