For what I was expecting, I was not very impressed.  I brought my hubby here for his birthday, everyone I know whose dined here has said only good things, I'm not sure what was going on the time we went.  I made a 9pm reservation online, I figured we would have to wait about 20 minutes after checking in with the hostess, I didn't expect to wait close to 45.  When we were sat, a very friendly waiter came over, I told him it was my hubby's bday and that I'd like a candle in the cake at the end of our meal.  I had read a few other review where they said they gave a complimentary glass of Champaign but we did not receive anything.  Although I really like this waiter the rest of our experience was mediocre.  We order a nice bottle of wine, the girl who was serving it managed to spill more on the table then she did in our glasses. The first waiter after realizing what happened apologized but never asked if we wanted out table changed (it was pretty soaked through).  We ordered oysters from the tavern menu, they were delicious except that I kept getting some of the shell with my oyster.  After we order I believe the 5 course meal, each dish was delicious until our entree, I felt there was barley anything lamb on the plate and the entire dish was cold.  Finally desert came, unfortunately there was no candle in the bread-pudding or whatever it was that my hubby ordered. For a 400 dollar dinner I expected a little more from this establishment and to feel much fuller than I did.  Maybe we just came on an off night but I didn't feel my hubby's birthday dinner was worth the price tag.
