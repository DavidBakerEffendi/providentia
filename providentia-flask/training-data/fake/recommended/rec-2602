Like everyone else my friends and I were HUGE Top Chef fans... my boyfriend and I arrived early for our reservations and took 2 seats at the bar for a drink... we decided on 2 glasses of Chardonney... the bartender had us taste test the wine. now some may call me trashy or maybe I'm not going to the right places but we had never been somewhere that has done that so we were off to a good start!  Now knowing that we were going to Harold's restaurant there was the obvious 'oh I hope I get to see him'... which fortunately while we were still waiting for our now late friends apparently really good friends of his were seated next to us at the bar and he came out to have a LONG chat with them practically sitting on my lap (still has his pencil behind his ear!).  So after I got over gawking at Harold I decided to have a glance around the restaurant and I nearly had a stroke because my season 2 FAVORITE top chef SAM was having dinner in a booth which lucky for us when our friends finally showed up we were promptly seated right next to his table!  Of course we had wine.. I sadly don't remember the name but it was a nice white.  For appetizers we shared the duck meatballs, crab salad, and the rock shrimp salad all were DELICIOUS!! For entrees we all did something different and passed them around so we could all have a taste I know there was the duck, ravioli, red snaper, and I forgot the other because I was so enthralled with the side of spinach and broccoli with pork belly which just melted in your mouth.   To end off the fabulous meal we each had a class of moscato and shared the rhubarb desert which was very good.  I will be back.
