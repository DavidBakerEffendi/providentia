Loved this place. Went in around 730 on a Saturday night and was told the wait would be 30-40 minutes. Barely had time to sip my wine across the street at Pierre Loti before I got a call! Sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender for recommendations. Â He suggested 3 tapas per person which was way too much food. Portions are big. Overall, service was attentive and friendly. Must order items: face torchon bocadillo jamon iberico gambas with creme de huevos fideos with chorizo and clams rabbit 3 ways patatas bravas can't wait to go back
