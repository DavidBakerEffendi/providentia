At first glance, this may look like just a sandwich shop, but Hanco's serves up the type of food that will haunt you. In that maddening craving, dream-about-it way, not the haunting you get when you go out of town to visit less than gourmand relatives and get stuck eating at Chilis. The classic is a large, crispy crust baguette piled high with pork, vietnamese ham, pate, cilantro and marinated carrot and daikon salad. At less than $5 a pop, it's the best bargain on this block and tastier than most of the other offerings nearby. The bubble tea is loaded with boba -- Hanco's serves up at least double the portion of chewy, tapioca beads as Beard Papa. You can't beat that with a stick. Maybe a really fat little straw, but not a stick.
