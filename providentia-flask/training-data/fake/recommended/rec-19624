PROS -very extensive beer list -beer was good -girls in german garbs -nice interior CONS -the food wasnt anything to brag about -it seemed to gimicky for my tast -as someone else mentioned before, it seems like an easy place to encounter the frat crowd and or family's -food was kind of pricy for what I got it seems as though many other people really enjoy this place, so i hope my review doesnt stop anyone from trying it out. Regarding my experience, it was mediocre at best
