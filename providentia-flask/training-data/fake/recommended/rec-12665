Cute little burger joint. The truffle burger was wonderful- was medium rare as I ordered it and great flavor. I should have read the reviews more carefully- I didn't know it's BYOB but will be sure to bring something next time! The macaroni and cheese was slightly disappointing. It lacked any seasoning whatsoever... Looked amazing though.
