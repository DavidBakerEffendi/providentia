Great Italian restaurant with awesome vino.  The place was packed this Saturday night and it just a great vibe.  The Italian wines were all so good and smooth.  I ordered the capellini angel hair pasta with seafood...very yummy although slightly on the salty side. I just really loved how cozy this place was.  It felt so warm and a friendly atmosphere.  Makes me really appreciate life and good food with great friends.   That's what life is all about.
