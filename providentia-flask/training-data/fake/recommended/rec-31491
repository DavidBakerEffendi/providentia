Went to this place for my birthday dinner this past weekend. It was my 5th time going. This restaurant is an excellent Italian byob. The food is great, and so is the ambiance and the service. Some of the food I have tried there: Grilled calamari Caprese salad Gnocchi Lamb shank Pasta in white sauce with shrimp and muscles These dishes are not overly complicated but their execution is close to perfect. Seafood is always fresh and meats are top quality and well seasoned. Dining room is small but it would be right at home if it were in Italy. Highly recommend.
