Let me start off by saying I don't eat chicken.  My friends do and I joined them.  They swear by the chicken and loved it.  I had seafood paella and it was tasty and overflowing.  I eat my fair share of food - and yet, half way through I was full.  We also shared the yucca fries.  Tasty as well.   But nothing here stood out as excellent and they cram too many tables way too close together.  You can't even move without bumping the people next to you.  And the tables are small... plates were half on the table and half off.  I mean... pull a few tables out and make people wait a few minutes!  Ambiance is on the lower end, certainly not romantic.
