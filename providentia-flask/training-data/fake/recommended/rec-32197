Had eveything on the first two menus except the sable patty.  Everything was just right.  We didn't order the brussles sprout Caesar, but the gm brought it out anyway...he knew how good it was.  Perfectly cooked without losing it's the natural flavor and aroma of the sprout.  Seabass crudo was awesome with avocado cream cheese that had a little crunch in it (not sure).  Chicken liver was the fluffiest I ever had and was perfect with this thick cut but crispy but really light toasted rye.  The pork belly rueben (open-faced) was incredible and I'm gonna go back for happy hour soon just for this.  The porkbelly was sliced thin and cured perfectly and the bread was pretty thin but was crispy throughout.  Varnishkes I hadn't heard of but they were buckwheat raviolis with an amazing poppy butter and peas toppings.   Finally, the smoked Montreal shortrib came out fully on the bone, super Smokey.  They took it back for cutting and came back and the inside was a darker red than pastrami.  Tastes amazing.  The exterior gives you a super Smokey taste then when you get to the middle the meat basically dissolves in your mouth and you get all the juiciness and meaty flavor all in there.  And they give you a ton with pumpernickle and pickled veggies.  I put some on the bread but I thought it was best just going in for the meat only...you really get to appreciate the whole process that went into it...especially after all the great courses that preceded.  This was a great meal.  If you get a chance to try the many items like I did, you get to experience probably the most expansive variety of tastes and flavors I've had in a meal.  Didn't talk about the each of the desserts but they were all pretty spectacular.  We didn't want to touch the panna cotta it looked so good.  Also a great take on black n white cooked and a great apple strudel that I think had a whole(de-cored) in tact apple inside.  They do cocktails right with good options and service is on point.
