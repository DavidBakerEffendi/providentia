Well it is a small and cozy deli that serves pretty decent food at decent prices!  I recommend the potato salad on the side.  Price wise I am used to 6-8 dollars for a deli sandwich in the city so this isn't too bad.  As for the sandwiches, I got a park street, one thing to say is the bread is good and that is the essential part of a good sandwich.  I got the park street on an Italian roll.  The ingredients are fresh and was a great composition of flavors.  And for all of you who say you cant screw up a sandwich... believe me you can and I have had some god awful ones.  One thing I suggest is asking for the addition of oil and vinegar and if you are feeling fancy a dash or two of oregano, I think it is the Jersey in me but that makes any sandwich better.  To finish off my meal when we went to pay we got oatmeal raisin cookies right out of the oven.  Now if that doesn't make a person happy... i am not sure what would!
