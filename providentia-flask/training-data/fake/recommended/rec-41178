Very average Thai food restaurant, but the decor is fancy and it would probably be a very good cheap first date spot, since for whatever reason they didn't jack up the prices. The tom yum goong was decent -- it was not overly acidic, like at some other Thai spots. A bit too cilantro-y for me though. I went with the most generic dish I could think of, that being chicken pad-thai, and it was also Â incredibly average. My boyfriend got basil fried rice, which was actually very good; it was well seasoned and filling, even if it didn't contain any meat.
