I've seen serious vegetarians eat pork here...I kid you not, the meatballs are just irresistible. I have only taken out from here, while the tables/atmosphere seems nice, it's always crowded with people waiting for either a table, take-out or the bar. Spicy pork meatballs are the answer. They are light and fluffy with just enough kick. Add some provolone and sauce and yum yum yum. All sandwiches come with a nice little mixed greens salad. Bread is always fresh and delicious and doesn't overwhelm the tasty meatballs. And for those vegetarians that ate the pork....I mean, good for you, but you didn't have to...Meatball Shop's veggie meatballs are by far the best vegetarian anything I have ever had. I have no idea what's in them but they are also light and fluffy and just delicious. Insider tip: call ahead if you're taking out and save yourself some time.
