I took my wife here for a congratulatory dinner.  She's a foodie and is generally difficult to please, but we had an excellent experience.  Our waiter (Alex, I think?) was attentive and knowledgable, our food was outstanding, and the restaurant setting was clean and nice.  They have complementary valet parking, which is a pretty big plus in downtown New Haven (especially on evenings as a chilly as this particular one.)  We sampled many of the dishes available, and every single one was delicious.  Their drink list is pretty good too.  We'll definitely be returning.
