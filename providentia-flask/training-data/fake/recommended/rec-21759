It seems that they've worked out the portion issues previously noted. I work a block away, and thought to try Lulus today, and I'm glad I did! I had the french lentil soup (vegan) and it was wonderful, though could have used a touch more salt. Then I had the pork and roasted vegetables which was great.  The salsa verde was more like a pistou, but quite tasty, and the roasted vegetables today were butternut squash, mushrooms, and fennel.  Very tasty. I heard the woman next to me ask the waiter about gluten free options, and she seemed delighted at the array. The waiter was lovely, kind, and handsome.   There were bunch of solo-diners like myself, who were friendly to chat with, and not over bearing.   I will most definitely be back, its a welcome addition to a somewhat ambiguous neighborhood.
