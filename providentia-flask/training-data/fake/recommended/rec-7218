Went here on Mother's Day a table of 6, they put us outside in the rt corner, the garbage stench was so bad we moved inside , they cranked the rap music up so loud , we could not here ourselves talk.... The food took extremely long and not all of the dishes came out at the same time, with the last dish coming out when most others had finished .... The food was great however, chicken curry was great, as well as mimosas, not sure we will go back.....
