Went here for the Shiny Toy Guns concert. I go here pretty regularly. North Star can be dark, crowded and noisy. If that's what you are in the mood for, they have good drinks and good food. No complaints there. My only complaint is that their concert management staff made a weird situation really unpleasant. The week before the concert, I bought seven concert tickets from the bar, and paid cash. When our group tried to get inside the doorman told me that my tickets had already been scanned, and asked that we pay agan to get inside. I explained that something in their system must be wrong. He said it was "impossible" that our tickets were legitimate, and he told me to back off when I was trying to explain what happened. We waited 10 minutes in the cold before the manager showed up. He explained that their ticketing system was on the fritz, confirmed that our tickets were on a list, and let us inside. No apology from the doorman or the manager. Not the end of the world, but for the out of town guests, it wasn't a good way to start the evening. Entirely avoidable with some good old-fashioned customer service. Boo north star. Don't be dicks to music lovers who bring six friends.
