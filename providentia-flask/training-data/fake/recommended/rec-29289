Seriously delicious huge cheesesteak sandwich that was simple yet flavorful and just as fabulous, there are an amazing number of bottled beers also available. Quality meat, wonderfully tasty soft roll, and a serious line out the door with the few counter seats snapped up as soon as they were vacated. The waitresses are amazingly friendly considering the frantic pace they have to keep and no one waited for long to place an order. Orders called in are given priority but even those ordered on the spot were made with impressive speed. Great prices and definitely a place frequented by locals and tourists alike (with way more locals than newcomers).
