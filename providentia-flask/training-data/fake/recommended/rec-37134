If you're craving not fusion yet also not authentic mishmash asian food, definitely come during happy hour. Their happy hour features beer from their respectable keg selection for $4, a featured cocktail for $5, and $7 pork chicken or veg buns, which i guess is a good deal. Now onto the food. The pork buns were quite ordinary and tasted dry, but their presentation was unexpected as they evoked tacos. Then we had a bibimbap. This was a total miss: the egg was already cooked as a fried egg and placed on top of the rice, the stone bowl was not nearly hot enough to promote mixing, and it was also pretty small for $12. On the plus side, their unagi rice bowl was quite good. It had three meaty pieces of eel, decent teriyaki sauce, and surprisingly good rice. The service was subpar. We had a table of three, and as far as I could tell, for the entire hour that we ate there, we were the only customers. Our waitress was quite abrupt and rude, and even gave up refilling our water cups by placing the entire pitcher of water on our table, so we could just serve ourselves (!). She generally seemed disinterested and preoccupied in who know's what. Despite the struggles, I really do see this restaurant taking off if they improve a few dishes and waitress/ter morale.
