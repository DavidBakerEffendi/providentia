TL;DR: It's every.single.thing. i love about Maysville, but WAY closer to home, and in Brooklyn, so automatically more chill! Onto the meat of the review: If you're a whisk(e)y nerd, you must stop by Char No. 4 (and Maysville for that matter, since they are siblings). Don't be intimidated if you don't fancy yourself a drinker of the liquid gold, as the knowledgable and friendly staff will gladly guide you towards something that'll be sure to satisfy your cravings. If you're not burly enough for whisk(e)y neat (or simply in the mood for something a little more frou frou, which, hey, I know I like from time to time), they have a respectable, though petite cocktail menu. While I haven't actually lingered long enough to eat here, rumour has it the brunch is killer and the biscuits in particular are not to be missed, so I suppose I'll have to mosey on over when the sun's out. Brunch is a good time to irish up my coffee, right?
