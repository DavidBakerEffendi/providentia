The food is delicious here. I loved the Penang Curry and Pad Thai-- they were both flavored perfectly and cooked to perfection. If I can recommend one dessert dish, it would be the Flourless Cake with Green Tea ice cream. The cake melts in your mouth, blending in with the green tea ice cream taste, the experience is to die for! Room Service is a fantastic restaurant to go to, especially if you are in a hurry. I would recommend this restaurant as a pre-theater option, since it is located within walking distance to Times Square. The food comes in a very efficient manner, maybe after 7 mins of putting in your order. The service staff is attentive and knowledgeable; we definitely a fantastic time at the restaurant and will be going back soon!
