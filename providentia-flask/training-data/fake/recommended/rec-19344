Food: awesome, fresh Atmosphere: Decor is cute and simple + ethnic music (not usher piped in which really bothers me) Service: prompt and friendly Overall great experience. Made to order pita, lambajin pitza, chicken ouzi, and salad platter.  We always order to much food and we did it again, for 2 people, we had enough for an extra person, but I don't regret it because it was delicious!  The salads were so fabulous I could eat them every day!  I've never had anything like the lambajin pitza or chicken ouzi and they were both awesome! Cash Only It was kinda confusing when we walked in because there were a lot of men making the pita out front kinda like a pizza place and we couldn't tell if we ordered there or sat down.  You go sit and then order.  Got here, try something new if you haven't had it before- It's AWESOME.
