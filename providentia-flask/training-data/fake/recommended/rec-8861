Honestly, this place is about as lowly and disgusting as food gets.  It's like a bunch of idiots taking frozen food and actually making it worse.   Absolutely horrible service to boot.  It took 45 minutes to get a damn sandwich with 10 people in there, and 15 minutes to get a martini.  Ridiculous.  No one here cares at all.
