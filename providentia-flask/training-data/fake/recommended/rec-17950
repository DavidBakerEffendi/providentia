Cheap, fried, tasty, can't get much better than that. I used to come to this place with my dad when I was something like 5 years old. Â I brought my boyfriend here during our trip to Jersey, since he is a hot dog lover. We got a bunch of hot dogs, but did not specifically order the ripper. Regardless, they were quite tasty. My bf liked their special relish. The onion rings were delish! I can see why my dad loved this place, and why it continues to be so successful.
