I had a decent breakfast experience here.  Being on Pacific time, I awoke late and was happy to arrive here and know that breakfast is served until 4pm. I ate a huge breakfast here and everything was good from the Americana style coffee to the Tunisian eggs and the Pumpkin Pancakes w/cinamon flavored yogurt.   I left pleasantly full and set thru to dinner. Will definitely remember this rustic place and will come again someday.
