I would put this place on par with some of the best kosher deli's I've eaten at. The owner Mr Sabbatt is friendly and quite a character. While I was waiting for my Reuben he offered me free samples; pickles, shaved ham, shaved roast beef & provolene cheese. He told me he had been in business for 65 years. The Reuben was exceptional, it was perfect, it was delicious with fresh ingredients. The only down side is there is no dine in option.
