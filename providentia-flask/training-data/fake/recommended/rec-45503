What a great place! The food is superb and there is a very nice selection of reasonably priced wines, plus some very, very good wines. I liked the casual friendly environment which added to the ambiance. The wine cellar is a special treat for dinner. There is nothing better than attending a wine tasting with Jeff the manager and sommelier and then having dinner!
