Yummmmmm ... NYC offers global cuisine that's AS if not BETTER than the food found in each originating country and region.  I have yet to travel to Alsace, but I can hardly imagine a better Tarte Flambe!!! Thin crust, homemade pizza type bread that's just crispy, topped with the tasty goods.  Cheers!
