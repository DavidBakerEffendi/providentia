They have a "B" out front and that almost made me turn around and find another place for dinner, but something told me to try it out. I am happy I did, because this is what I experienced: Service = 4 Food= 3 Ambiance= 3.5 My rolls and soup were great and my husband's were also awesome. The service here is what brings up my review. I appreciate staff who go the extra distance to ensure your experience is pleasant. I will definitely be back!
