Summary: I don't usually give out five stars, but when I do, I prefer Cafe Sabarsky We expected a good meal, but were totally caught off guard by how outstanding everything was. We started with the beet salad which paired perfectly with the goat cheese accompaniment. Next we had the schnitzel which was amazingly tender and amazing with the lingonberry sauce, and the Bavarian sausage which was light and delicious. Oh and let's not forget the pretzel, so incredibly soft yet crunchy on the outside. Lastly the Einspaenner coffee, a Viennese specially of espresso topped with their amazing homemade whipped cream, was an incredible finish.
