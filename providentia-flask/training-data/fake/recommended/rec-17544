This has to be one of my favorite places. I love the atmosphere and the decor is beautiful. The food is delicious. The fried plantains are one of the best I've ever had. The appetizers are small portioned but the entr√©es are a good size so it makes up for it. The staff from my experiences are friendly. I love to go in the summer when you can sit outside in the patio where there is a waterfall-like structure. In my opinion, for the quality of the place and food, it is underpriced as compared to other places I have been. I'm always suggesting this place to people I know and plan to return very soon. Yum!
