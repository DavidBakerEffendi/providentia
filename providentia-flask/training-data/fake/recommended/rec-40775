I was only in Philadelphia for the weekend and all of the hotel room propaganda said that Starr restaurants were pretty good. Having walked all over Center City on a Saturday night looking for anything to eat that had less than a 3-hour wait, we decided that a non-chain place that didn't take reservations would be our Sunday night treat. This place just felt fun. Maybe it's overly kitschy when the sun's up...I wouldn't know. But at night the vibe was just right. We started out with some really good shrimp and chicken dumplings, and I fell for the Thanksgiving dinner plate. The food was top-notch, but the drinks were excellent. I had a very yummy Tanq and lime juice while the Mrs. enjoyed a S'more martini (complete with marshmallow stirrer). Our waitress was perfectly attentive without being overbearing and provided really useful advice on menu choices. The manager even came by for a chat, which is always something I enjoy. By the time dessert came around, we were way too stuffed to order anything, but did anyway as everything up to that point had been so good. You can totally eat for $20 a person here, or you can dine for $50. I'd recommend coming in a group of more than two, as we were kind of partitioned off from the rest of the place in our two top. Would definitely recommend and will try another Starr restaurant when I make my way back north.
