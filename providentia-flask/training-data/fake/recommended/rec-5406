Seating area is the cutest thing ever! Just rows of benches outdoors with lights and even a PING PONG TABLE!!!! Plus they have imported pretzels from Germany - yes, IMPORTED PRETZELS WITH CHEESE DIP! Along with that, they have a wide range of beers, and for the non-beer drinkers, they also have wine and cider :)
