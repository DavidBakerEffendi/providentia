Pleasant, comfortable space, quiet, decent service. But too expensive ($35 pp) for good but not great food. Shrimp shumai were okay, but way overpriced --- $6.50 for 6 little pieces that could have come out of a frozen food packet --- not obviously fresh or handmade. My seafood with pan fried noodles had very good ingredients but was bland. My friend's lamb dish -- half with eggplant, half with basil sauce -- was far more tasty. A good place for a date, family, or friends, but I there are far better places for the money.
