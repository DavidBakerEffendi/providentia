Got the unlimited metro card just so we can hit this place up whenever that craving for jap chae, spicy chicken, and pickled radish just screamed to be filled in between paychecks. K-town is just an awesome place to be in general and we vow to one day live within a 2-3 block radius of 32nd & Broadway, but if you don't want to shell out the big bucks for table barbecue at Shilla or Kum Gang San across the street, this place will quell that gnawing Korean hunger pang deep into the wee hours of the night. Our Korean Posse disapproves of eating here too often though, as they say Woorijip has a secret love affair with MSG. It's ok, if the price of good, cheap, quick food is possible blindness, it might be a price that will just have to be paid.
