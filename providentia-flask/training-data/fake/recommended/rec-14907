The Jones is totally rad, dude! There was a really sweet vibe to that place right upon entering the space. It's fun, spacious and quirky--from its blown-up 60s-theme images on the walls to the national landmark and state night lights at the tables. There was a lot of attention to detail paid to brand of The Jones and that is something I definitely respect and notice. You felt comfortable but not comfortable enough where you would show up in your PJs and not run a comb through your hair. The menu is simple, yet you can find something for any craving, I'm sure. I went with the Grilled Chicken sandwich with roasted tomatoes, arugula, aioli and a side of french fries. The food tasted good, but nothing special or out of the ordinary. I do have to mention that one of the people I was eating lunch with got a salad and it was HUGE. The serving size of that bowl of salad could feed a small army. The service was pretty good, our waitress had a lot of good tips/suggestions. This place is a solid 3 stars, but I gave it a 4 just because of the extra mile they went with all the design aspects of the brand.
