Very cute little B&B in the southern Vermont.  It's run by a friendly local and his Japanese wife.  She makes a fantastic Japanese dinner if you make a reservation.  The B&B itself was cute - nice little lake in the backyard - and it's really quiet.  Very cozy overall.  If you're in the area and want a nice B&B experience, check them out.
