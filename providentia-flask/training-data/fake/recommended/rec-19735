This isn't your grandfathers Thai food restaurant. This place is hip and breaks all stereotypes. The music is at times techno Asian like and really is fun while eating this awesome new fusion Thai food. There are not any standard curry dishes with the familiar coconut sauces but instead blending some not so traditional Thai spices like Turmeric and cilantro. I have ordered and enjoyed an appetizer of a type of braised beef spare rib that was so tender and delightfully spicy. The spring rolls were wonderful and filling also. I often order the Wok chili beef with turmeric which is always spicy and as I'm told by the staff, can not be toned down regarding the spiciness , so if you're not fond of spice  don't order this dish . I have also enjoyed the Pad Kee Moa w/ beef instead of squid  and thoroughly enjoyed my lunch. The staff is very friendly, and often fill your glass with water when you're close to running out.
