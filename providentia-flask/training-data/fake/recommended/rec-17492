Let me preface this by saying that I went here with a party of 25..... the experience may be different with a smaller group. We made reservations, but it still took them 10 minutes to seat us.   OUr waitress was OK considering the size of our party.  She got everyone's orders right and was very patient. Took a while to get our drinks.  But when they got there, they were good! It was about 1 hour before our chefs got to the habachi tables to prepare our food.  Again, I'm assuming it was due to the size of the group.   He served our rice first, then our meat/fish.  By the time the veggies and lo mein were served, I was done with the rice and my fish.  The order of it seemed odd to some of us.  I found the food to be a bit salty.  They put soy sauce on everything they prepared some most of the items had the same taste. Some complained (to us) about the charges on the bill.  Seemed pretty average to me -- about $25 per entree and $6 for cocktails.
