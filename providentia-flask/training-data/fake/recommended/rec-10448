Its the pizza that made the Brooklyn Bridge famous. :) The bf and I waited outside in a line for at least 20 minutes on a windy day back in May. I had made him stand in line for Artichoke pizza, but was highly cynical that there could be something much better. Then we were finally called in.... Its lovely inside, beautiful brick stove in the back, cute little tables, wonderful service, and simply delectable pizza! It took me by surprise, seriously, how amazing my pizza was. We ate until we were full and beyond that. Their thin crust pizza is the Godiva of pizzas, leaving you satisfied, yet craving more. We laughed, talked, and swapped pizza from time to time. Their toppings are fresh, and juicy. The tomato and veggies on our pizzas felt like they had just been hand picked. I was and still am impressed. Its worth the wait in line. Its simply a New York must do. So go out and walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, go to an event at Saint Ann's Warehouse, but whatever you do, just make sure you eat your lunch/ dinner at Grimaldi's. It is the cherry on top for any perfect date.
