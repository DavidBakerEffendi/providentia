Abates was packed and the wait too long so my husband and I decided to try Anastasio's. Liked listening to the 50's music while browsing the menu. Thought prices a little steep for the pasta dishes we ordered. Dinner arrived hot; serving size was ample, seasonings somewhat bland, and the frozen peas included in my dish disheartening. The salad was large but was all iceburg lettuce; one pepper slice, 1/4 tomato piece, 2 canned olives and a slice of cucumber; the dressing was tasty. Would I return - maybe. Â There are so many better Italian restaurants on Wooster St. and in the general area.
