Yum-O! Seriously, this place is DELICIOUS! My cousin and I stopped here for lunch and had a really good meal and super tasty drinks. She had the bruschetta and I had the churrasco with the yuca fries, we both had a caipirinha and two mojitos apiece; my drinks all had passion fruit and hers were original/lemon flavored. The yuca fries were the best I've had. Usually they're too thick, but these were crispy and light. The churrasco was very good, as well. Â I thought the drinks were really strong, not a bad thing, but way stronger than I expected. I would definitely recommend and come back to eat here!
