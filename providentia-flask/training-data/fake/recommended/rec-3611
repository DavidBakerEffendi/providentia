We came here on a Saturday afternoon craving some gourmet pizza and we were not disappointed. Although they were still serving off of the brunch menu, our waiter indicated that we could order pizzas off their main menu or suggest a pizza and he would likely be able to make it. The place was half full and we were seated right away. Both the decor and the staff were "SO Brooklyn" so it was a great place to bring a friend from out of town. I had the mouthwatering (seriously, just thinking about it, makes me salivate) Pear Gorgonzola Pizza. Hot, crispy, rich sweet and salty perfection! My friends ordered the sopressata and a pepperoni & red onion pizza, both of which satisfied our cravings and our tastebuds :) The rest of the brunch menu looked enticing too! The staff was friendly and even brought extra marinara for us to finish the crusts for no charge. I'll definitely be back!
