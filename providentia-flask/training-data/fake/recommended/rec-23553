Funny enough, this was NOT our first choice of place to dine on Saturday night. We had another place in mind but it was a 45 minute wait and that isn't possible with a 4 year old. We decided to head into Burlington and we picked ANOTHER place to eat but the 4 year old's bladder was about to burst and we parked anywhere and rushed into a small pizza shop. When she finished peeing we were walking around looking for a place to eat and we saw Leunig's. My sister in law had recommended it so we tried it. Loved: The fact that a high end bistro offers a children's menu with crayons and paper to color on. This really helped keep the adult's conversation flowing and not having to entertain a kid for the entire time. My Fussli pasta: OMG! Delicious. It was kinda like a Mexican dish in a French bistro. Avocado, corn, black beans, onions, and a bunch more with fusseili pasta... I died. I loved this and was fairly sad, I couldn't eat more. Â  My husband had the steak and that was incredible. The steak was cooked perfectly, the mashed was full of flavor, the veggies were perfectly cooked. My daughter went with pasta with alfredo sauce. Can't go wrong there. All in all, a perfect A+. My only suggestion is to spice up the sangria a little bit. :)
