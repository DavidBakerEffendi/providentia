Now this is how Italian Pizza should be.  Considered as one of the 38 Essential restaurants in New York right now by Eater  NY.  Ordered a whole pizza, one half being the vodka pizza (w/ sweet sausage) and the other half being the mushroom prosciutto pizza.  Both very good, thin crust where you can really taste the ingredients and the outer crust toasted to give a little crunch. Also tried the roasted octopus which was delicious as well, had a nice citrus flavor dressing for the veggies and the octopus was tender and seasoned really good.  And their service is just awesome.  Great place for dinner in the heart of Little Italy.
