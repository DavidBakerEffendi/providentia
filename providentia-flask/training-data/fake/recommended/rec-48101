Barrio is dangerously close to where I live. A short walk and I have endless amounts of tasty treats at my finger tips. I can not say enough about them. Atmosphere is warm and cozy, great sunlight. The morning buns are probably the least exciting thing to look at behind the glass but the flavor is amazing. A croissant dough with vanilla sugar rolled inside.. It is a must try. A great spot for the neighborhood.
