The sushi is ok for a quick bite.  I wouldn't rank  Sushi California as a place I have to go to when I'm in the area.  The fish seemed pretty fresh but the let down was the overdone style.   I ordered the tako-su which is generally octopus & vinegar.  Their version is a seafood sunomono with an overwhelming soy/vinegar mix.  Good but not what I've experienced anywhere else.  I had the hulk maki which was entirely underwhelming.  The 2 sauces completely overrode the flavor of the maki.  Very disappointing.  The sashimi is small portions but pretty good quality fish.   I would recommend for a quick bite on a business trip as a place that is better than a strip mall sushi spot should be but not a 5 star place.  I'd go 3.5 but yelp doesn't allow.
