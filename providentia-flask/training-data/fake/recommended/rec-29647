Never eat here! Stopped here for dinner with my boyfriend after several recommendations and ended up with a terrible experience and FOOD POISONING. My bf got the lasagna, and I got the veal osso buco. The manager/owner Joey was very friendly, and the house Chianti was tasty. That's where any good experience ended. The food arrived quickly - too quickly. Seven minutes of wait time isn't even enough to heat precooked food up in the microwave. The veal was tender, but exceptionally bland. The risotto was the worst I've ever had. It was soupy and flavorless. When we complained, Joey offered us some gnocchi, which was, if possible, worse. The pasta was overcooked, and the brownish sauce on top was unidentifiable. Topped off with some Kraft parmesan cheese, it was a plate full of nasty. The lasagna was steaming hot. The noodles were overcooked. The cheese on top was barely melted, however, and the meat and sauce combination, tasted mediocre and came with a side of thirty six hours of gastrointestinal upset. The only other positive comment I have, is that they didn't charge extra for the food poisoning.
