A winner. Everything we had was excellent. Â Arugula salad with shiitakes, toasted walnuts, goat cheese, and lemon vinaigrette - beautiful. Beef roulade special (with asparagus stuffing) - wonderful. Papperdelle with wild mushroom and toasted walnut sauce - darn near stunning. Service was top notch. Even when the metro waiter put his hand softly on my back one too many times, I can't say it really bothered me. At least not enough to take a star away. It's BYO, so if the wine list sucks - it's your fault. For his part, the waiter promptly uncorked ours, and when we had some left - he promptly supplied cork, bag and carrier so we could take home what's left. The only ding was the polenta. Actually the polenta was delicious. But the way it was presented on the menu - it was listed with artichokes, chard, and white beans. We thought it was some kind of funky salad and promptly ordered, when actually those were each individual side dishes that were available. That confusion aside, everything else was brilliant. I'm from out of town ... but I sure hope to come back.
