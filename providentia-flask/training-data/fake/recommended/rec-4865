This place has quickly become a weekly tradition for my boyfriend and myself. The bagels are large and delicious, the staff is unbelievable nice, I like the decor and now they have blinds so you don't boil if you chose to eat inside. They have an awesome out door patio which is a wonderful place to sit and eat in the fall. All of their sandwiches sound delicious and I like that they are named after cities. And most importantly it is affordable and well worth the money spent. Definitely the sandwich spot on Fairmount!
