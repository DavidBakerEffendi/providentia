I don't really know what some of the reviews here are complaining about. It's a dive bar, and a good one at that. Upstairs is cool, the staff is super nice, the food is decent bar food, and they (usually) play classic punk rock (dead boys, the clash, etc). If you're not fond of hipsters and yuppies, come here during the week, there is a pretty good crowd of rockers and such. Same for fridays after 11 or so all that yuppie/hipster stuff clears out. I personally couldn't care less who comes in because they usually leave after a round or so. So ignore the out of towner reviews and check it out if you're into the rocker scene. TL;DR-- Cold beer, hot food, rock n' roll. What more could you want out of a dive bar?
