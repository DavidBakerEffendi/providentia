Stopped by here on a Friday night for a few glasses of wine at the bar. Very cute place--small, nice fixtures, and very friendly staff. Based on the ambience I would say great place for an intimate dinner with friends/significant other. Will definitely be back to try the food! If you're looking for a quiet, cute dark-lit place for drinks in SoHo without the loud noise/college kid scene this is the place to go!
