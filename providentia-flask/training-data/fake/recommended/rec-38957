No surprise, but locals come here for the fries. Good, but smallish, burgers too. The prices are low, which is fortunate because Al's is cash only. Order on the way to the counter, grab your food, and find a seat. The clear squeeze bottles by the napkins aren't filled with water. It's white vinegar. I think I'd rather have cider or malt vinegar.
