This is without a question one of the coolest bars in Astoria. It's always packed with cute people. The owner is just the coolest guy, who's also a bartender. The ambience is fantastic, Â great food, unbelievable price and awesome service. I've spent whole nights and afternoons there, plus partied some unforgettable parties and met the nicest and the craziest people there. It's the spot! Shout out for their champagne and the yummy Mac and Cheese!
