I've heard such great things about this place, but i wasn't wowwed at all. Came here for our 2nd anniversary dinner, we should have went to the FOUNTAIN for what our bill came to! This was about 6 months ago and to be honest, I can't even remember what I ate. I'll have to give it another shot one day.
