I came here for my birthday a few days ago. Since I'm not living with my mom anymore, I have missed Filipino so much! I'm from San Diego so you can find a Filipino spot fast! I found this spot in the city & I must say it is amazing! There aren't any Filipino spots where I live so now that I've found this, this is the place I will go to. The place is small but very cute & the staff are friendly.
