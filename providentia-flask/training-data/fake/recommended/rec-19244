Super busy for Sunday brunch. Thankfully, it was a nice day and my friends and I had no problem waiting outside in the sunshine. You should definitely call ahead before going because there will be a wait. Food was great. I tried their signature Stuffed Challah French Toast. I don't normally choose sweet breakfast dishes, but I'm glad I did. It was delicious. The waitress warned me that it would be a very big portion so she advised that I get the half size. That still felt like a lot to me, but it was something I had to eat every bite of. I also got a side of bacon and the "homies" with cheese. The sides weren't anything special. You could probably just skip that. The waitstaff was very attentive. My coffee cup was never left empty. I love diners so I'll definitely come here again and try out their lunch or dinner menu.
