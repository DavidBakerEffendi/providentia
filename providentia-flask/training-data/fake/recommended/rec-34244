Went here for Valentines Day with my girlfriend. It was recommended to me by her. The food was excellent. I had fillet mignon and my girlfriend had the ny strip. I personally liked the ny strip better and you get more steak for the money. I was not to fond of the butter they send out with the bread. I would of preferred Â regular butter over what they served. The bottle of wine I chose was excellent and they served it correctly and professionally. Mike was our waiter and he was kind, courteous and went out of his way to keep us happy. I will def be coming back. A bit pricey but I was definitely expecting it for this great steak house.
