A good place to find yourself, not necessarily one to plan for. I used to occasionally end up here after work and never had a bad time. Crab fries are all they're trumped up to be, beer flows freely and pretty cheap and...well, the game is on. It's a pretty standard sports bar with a great marketing campaign and some official partnerships. It is just fine, and you probably won't regret spending an hour or 2 there. My only beef is that they asked me to turn my hat around, but I supposed they were concerned about the glare from the indoor lamps getting in my eyes and causing an accident or something, so it was probably for my own good...or whatever. It couldn't have been a need to maintain a dress code in a place where jerseys are predominantly worn. Anyway, don't go out of your way for C & P, but if your co-workers invite you or you want to kill some time before/after a game, why not?
