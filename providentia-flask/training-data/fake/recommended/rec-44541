Came here for business dinner. I got the mojito the first one was alright, for my second on I ask them to put more lime in it. For appetizers we order Empanadas Jamaiquinas which was Spicy beef turnovers over pickapepper sauce & Tostones Rellenos which was Fried green plantains filled with chicken sofrito, shrimp criollo, ropa vieja or picadillo. For my main dish I ordered Paella Marinera with consisted of Shrimp, octopus, calamares, scallops, clams and mussels simmered with saffron and garlic in a caldera of valencia rice with the option of lobster tail. All the food was delicious.
