Went here on a whim one night, in the mood for Spanish food. Free soup! Very tasty. I ordered a paella, my girlfriend got the garlic chicken. "Fricken delicious," she said. But not good reheated the next day. The portions are quite large. We'll probably go there again if we're in the mood. The sangria was good, tasted fresh. Not particularly exceptional though. Prices were reasonable.
