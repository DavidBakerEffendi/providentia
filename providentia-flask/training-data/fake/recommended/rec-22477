So we went for restaurant week in the beginning of the month, but I've gotta say, I just wasn't loving it. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe they knew they were going to be super busy and just cooked a butt load of meat. But if that was the case, they let the meat sit and dry out and just get yuck. All of the meat we had was so, so dry and underseasoned. It just wasn't good. We've been to Chima a few times and always have a great meal, so I just assumed Fogo would be the same. So sad, but it definitely wasn't. The salad bar was okay, not anything spectacular. All in all, I would say Chima is the way to go. It even feels a little less gimmicky there. I definitely would not go back and pay full price for that meal.
