This is place is great, went there last night with the girlfriend. Good thing we got there early in the evening, all the tables were taken within another hour. The waitresses were very polite and always filled up our drinks. They place a little bag of popcorn in the middle of the table so you can munch on something while you wait. Being a first timer, the waitress had no problem explaining how to get a great dining experience at the restaurant. We ordered several dishes and shared them all. BLT Salad - the dressing was delicious and the lobster really made it stand out. very good portion to start out with. Korean BBQ wraps - the meat was perfectly cooked, a little messy to eat but nothing too bad. Braised Pork Belly tacos - a little too cheesy for me but the girlfriend really enjoyed it, they had too much pickled vegetables as well. Oxtail Terrine - although it was very small, it was cooked perfectly and was delicious. The puree on the side went perfect with it. Hampshire Pulled-Pork sliders - a little on the spicy side but overall, pretty good pulled pork slider. For dessert we had ice cream and sorbet. One flavor was thai iced tea which was AMAZING and they had a corn flavor which was pretty disgusting. I can't remember the last flavor but it tasted like apple. Definitely worth coming back, great addition to the neighborhood.
