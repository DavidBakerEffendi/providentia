I went here for dinner on a girls night out, and we were all very pleased with our meals! We were also able to walk in without a reservation at 7:00 on a Saturday night, which was great! The atmosphere was really relaxing, but still fun as there were crayons and white paper to draw on at every table. We were seated by the fireplace, so it was very cozy and comfortable. I ordered the Buffalo Burger which was very tasty and juicy, but not the best burger I have ever had. The girls ordered the Turkey Burger, Fish and Chips, and soups and salad. They all said that their meals were great too. The waitress was not overly friendly, but it could have been because we asked her come back a few times before we were ready to order.
