One of the best places I've been to in New York. The service, food and vibe was all amazing. Our server (a young cute guy with dimples) was very attentive and knowledgeable. He recommended the perfect wines and foods for our taste buds. He even provided a complimentary dessert! We ordered the brie cheese and beet salad. Both uniquely paired sides that I would have never have thought to put together but nicely complimented each other. We ordered the macaroon log for dessert, and was able to try the creme brulee. Highly recommend both. Would highly recommend this place!!!!!
