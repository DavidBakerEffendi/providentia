No complaints about the food: Delicious food. Authentic and well-done. Great menu. However, this place could use some serious polishing. The service is quite slow (not the amount of time to actually get your food, but the line to order moves SO SLOWLY, as there's no organized system for the person taking your order to put it through). Also, the prices are a little unreasonable. Brunch for with a lattee and a small sweet crepe cost $10.
