One of the best Italian I had so far in New York. The pasta are made fresh everyday, you just want to have a significant portion of pasta with Olive oil and Parmesan - it's that good. Fair wine list, best panacota I had outside of Italy and France. I asked for a coffee, I was given a Ristretto of great quality. I will go there many more times and will add to this review.
