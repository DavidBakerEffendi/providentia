I have not one negative thing to say about this place. Went for an afternoon "brunch" with some lovely locals. Food is unbelievable. I was blown away by the cajun shrimp and grits dish. The shrimp had just the right amount of kick and was cooked to perfection. The gravy was rich, meaty, but not too distracting from the also perfectly cooked mill grits. Grits are amazing in general, but the combination of cajun seasonings and the ham gravy made me fall in love even more so. Get that dish for sure. The gumbo and chilis kick ass. The duck sandwich was ridiculous. I could have kept ordering over and over until they rolled me out. Nice beer selection, full service bar, the atmosphere is chill, comfortable with a touch of sophistication. Love the name of this place - is the owner middle eastern or indian??? But then the menu is true through and through Louisana cuisine. Really a great little spot and a must for any visitor of Philly.
