$60 bucks I can never get back. Idk if it's their style to burn everything but the veggie burger was burnt. The bottom of all the buns were burnt totally black. The pulled pork was dry, overly salty and they ran out of the slaw that goes on it. How do you serve someone, something you don't have everything for? I wouldnt of ordered it if i had known. I think they served us most of the leftovers from the day before. We got two truffle aioli sauces they tasted totally different. One like plain mayo the other like it should. My husband did like their chicken sandwich it was fresh but not worth $9 bucks. The food took too long to come out. Â Honestly, I'm really disappointed this places food was no better than a crappy buffet. Adding insult to injury the waitress said she'd give us a discount for their slip up with my meal. They gave us a $1.50 off. Oh too kind! I forgot to add their website said they open at 3:00 on Sundays when we walked in they looked at us like we had two heads. We asked are you open? They said "no, we open at 3:30. Hope they change that.!
