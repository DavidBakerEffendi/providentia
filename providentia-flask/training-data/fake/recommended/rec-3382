Went there for brunch with the wifey. Place is small and nice. I guess it's self seating. Wifey orders the crispy dough with eggs and wanted to substitute for herbed eggs waiter say flat out no it can't be done. No I'll check, no it will a little extra nothing just no.....that was a turn off. So Waiter comes with the plate of shakshuka that I ordered in one hand he has a plate the other has two plates one on top of another wtf!!!! I don't know where the bottom of the plate has been!!! Why would you put it on top of my food....the shakshuka lacked in the spices in my opinion. The crispy dough wasn't crispy at all it would help of they didn't put the eggs on top of it! It was soggy,warm and rubbery! Seemed like it was sitting in the back for a little bit. The flavor was really good Â though. The hummus was excellent! Overall it was ok...... don't think I would go there again.
