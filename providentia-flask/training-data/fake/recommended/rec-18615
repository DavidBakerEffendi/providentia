There was a moderate line on a Wed. night 8pm. The service is quick, though the guy got the wrong order with more than one tables, which is understandable on a busy night. Tried chili burger and grilled chicken sandwich. The chili burger was very good. Chicken sandwich is an ok. It's probably not a great idea to order chicken sandwich from a place better known for their burgers. I would definitely come back to try the burger when in burger mood. All that being said, if you are not a burger fan, there's not much on the menu to choose from =)
