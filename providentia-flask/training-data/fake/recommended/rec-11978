I have been a fan of brooklyn star since it was on 6th and Havemeyer. I seem to remember it being a bit more approachable before. Had a good dinner when I was at the last location, but this time around I thought the food was a little too foodie for the average person and a bit overpriced for a week night i.e. Â the cauliflower salad and even the wedge salad etc. Would consider coming back on occasion on a weekend, but not a place that I would go to on a regular basis.
