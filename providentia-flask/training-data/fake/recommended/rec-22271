We were visiting Brooklyn with my 80 plus year old Dad this past weekend and I made reservations here after seeing the wonderful reviews.  I really loved this place.  I was impressed because the gentleman that greeted us had our table set up and he remembered my reservation story.  The restaurant feels personal and I loved eating in the garden. The food is very good and fairly priced.  I had tagliatelli with peas and a cream sauce.  It was heaven on a plate.  Wine menu was extensive and offered many different price points. The only down side was that somehow, even though many tables were seated after us, our food took about 1 1/2 hours to arrive.  Staff apologized profusely and offered more wine, gratis.  Because it was such a lovely evening, the wine flowed, family stories were shared, the food was delicious and the staff humble, it was easy to overlook and just became part of the story for the evening. I look foward to another visit.
