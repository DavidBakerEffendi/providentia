SO GOOD. The vegetarian chili is magical. Even boring broccoli sides are fantastic. Their pies are also something super special. I will be back for sure, whether it's for lunch or I don't even know what. awesome awesome awesome. Not five stars because it just didn't have that something extra but overall a really good place to get brunch/lunch with good friends.
