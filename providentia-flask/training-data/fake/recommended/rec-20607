This is a sexy and romantic little spot. We came here last night (Thursday) and the bar was full but the seating area off to the side was very open. I arrived earlier than my cheeky monkey friend and they let me sit down wherever I wanted, nice! Their wine menu is broken down by Old World whites and reds and New Worlds whites and reds. The menu lacks description, but you can ask the server and they'll explain anything you need to know. The snacks menu is awesome, I wish I had been more hungry to try everything. I had the croquettes (béchamel and chorizo) and the spinach and crab dip with Amy's bread. Oh Lord, the dip was good! Very rich and had a strong crab presence. Drunk. Like seriously. I had a glass before I left my house, a glass while I waited for my friend, then we had two bottles. The overheard us talking about her birthday and surprised us with an ice cream sandwich topped with a candle! How sweet! I think the sandwich was good, like I said... Drunk. Will definitely return.  Maybe with a date? There were lots of couples sucking face.
