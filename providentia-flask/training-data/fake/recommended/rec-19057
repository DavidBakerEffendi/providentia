Several times I have gone out of my way to go to this diner on late nights. I like their fish tacos, (even though i wish they were a bit larger), Mac & Cheese w/ pork belly bits is YUMS, I like that I can get avocado with anything, I like that they have both regular diner/breakfast options and also latin food options. I like randomly getting up to dance salsa when we're buzzed. Place is small, narrow, always packed and busy, takes a while to get a seat and get your order, but its always worth it. Same chef and owner as Yerba buena, but a much cozier experience and menu; flavors are more familiar and comforting, and the menu supposedly has a pinch of Venezuelan influence too, im a native so you know i love that. A cuban diner is SUCH a great idea. And conveniently located.
