The Sunday brunch food is okay, but not great. I was a bit disappointed, after having read lots of great Yelp reviews. Went with two friends. We waited about 30 minutes to be seated (for Sunday brunch around 1:00 p.m.). Nothing like the wait you'd encounter at, say, Sabrina's or Morning Glory. That said, the service throughout brunch at Chhaya was definitely veeeeeeeeeery slow, though I imagine it's faster on other, less-crowded days. Not the end of the world for us. The decor is pretty nice, informal. The room is spacious and relatively well lit. There's a high, long table in the middle (like a breakfast bar) where about 10 strangers can sit together, and then there are private tables around the perimeter of the dining room, plus two in the front window. We ended up being seated in a not-particularly-inviting corner in the back, though again, it wasn't the end of the world. All told, we had the berry waffle (with whipped cream), the chili waffle (on a cornbread-ish-tasting waffle), and the Philly cheesesteak waffle. Each of us thought the food was bland. My berry waffle had a strange taste, though it might have been the cornbread-ish flavor my friend identified in his own waffle. I'm usually intrigued by strange, new tastes, but I thought this was fairly ordinary food. And they were pretty stingy with the berries. In contrast, when I have waffles or French toast at Sabrina's, there's something fairly joyous in the flavors. The verdict: the brunches at Sabrina's, Morning Glory, and Jones are considerably better-tasting, I don't think I'll be back. Maybe the lunches here are better.
