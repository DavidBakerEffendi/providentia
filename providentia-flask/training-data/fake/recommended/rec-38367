Again don't let my 3 be seen as a negative. This is great place for good solid pub type food. They seem to have the "as little work as possible to be technically a brewer" attitude. It doesn't seem to be a highlight, they have growlers and they have some tanks not working in a glass cage somewhere. I have had beer there more then once and can't tell you 'their' brews vs others on tap. Wouldn't recommend a huge party and people in our group have gotten funky chicken on their sandwiches, but we did take a stroller there and the host was very accommodating and it was during a busy time. Nice place for a beer and burger and nachos.
