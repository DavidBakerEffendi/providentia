First, let's say we all agree this is not fine dining. But really, where can you get some of the best lasagna on the planet for $8.60 for a serving as large as a platter???? We tried this place for the first time last night. It's a bit run down looking from the outside and it's a bit run down looking on the inside, but that lends to the experience. This is old fashioned Italian cooking like going to your Italian grandma's on Sunday afternoon. Our server was extremely efficient and friendly. The food came out very quickly. I also tried their minestrone soup and it was good. I will definitely be back and I would recommend it to anyone looking for cheap, good tasting carbs.
