Calling this place "authentic" New York pizza isn't quite right. The pizza here is alright, but the kind of pizza they serve is more classic old Italian style than classic New York City. Think stretchy bunches of cheese, moderate spreads of sauce, and thinner than you'd typically expect crust. Nevertheless, the prices aren't that bad and the ambiance is okay. Fun place to take a friend or family member who is visiting, brag about it being the oldest pizzeria in the US etc., but it won't soon be my go-to spot to satisfy my weekly pizza cravings.
