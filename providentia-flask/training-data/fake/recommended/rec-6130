YAY!  A truly great place.  Delicious fresh original food.  We started with a dozen oysters and a great salad - both truly excellent.  It's all over Yelp, but that meatloaf sandwich is one of the best things I've eaten in the last couple of years.  And I sort-of second-guessed my choice after I ordered because I wouldn't normally order it.  Amazing.  I loved it.  It's covered in salty fried onions that vividly remind me of the onion rings at Nauset Beach, if anybody knows what I mean.  My husband got the duck which he claimed was better than my sandwich!  Hard to believe, but a great sign.  The cocktails were excellent and the waiter described a rye one to my husband (a diehard Manhattan drinker) that rocked his world.  Oh, and for dessert - hot outrageous cake donut holes (YUM) and a steamed lemon cake that was so good and so different that it pushed my review from four stars to five.  I love it here and can't wait to return.
