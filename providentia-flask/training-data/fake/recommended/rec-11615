I would eat here weekly if I could. We always get two platters - one falafel and one mediterranean, which is quite a lot of food. The veggies and salads that you get as sides are delicious and the falafel are always perfectly cooked. I love the za'atar pita and yummy sauces as well. And I always feel healthy after eating here. This is my favorite place to get falafel in the city.
