I drove for about an hour to check out this place.  It is a nice, clean environment.  There was a long wait, but that was to be expected on a Saturday night.  It is BYOB, which I really liked.  They serve only salads, and pizza - nothing else.  The pizzas aren't pre-crafted, so you choose your pizza style, then add the desired toppings.  The waiter was very helpful and answered my questions thoroughly.  I ordered a white pie with spinach, sausage, and garlic and it was just amazing!  I highly recommend this place, and will definitely be going back.
