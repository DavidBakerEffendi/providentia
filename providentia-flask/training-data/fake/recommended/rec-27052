A co-worker and I flew into Newark last week and had a decision to make...go to the hotel for dinner or head to Tribeca for dinner.  To me this was a no-brainer...Tribeca.  Using Yelp mobile we were led to Locanda Verde sitting conveniently on a corner with a parking garage across the street.   We were sat at a table with a nice view out the window.  My co-worker is a kind of large man and the tiny metal chairs here were uncomfortable for him.  He says he felt as if he were sitting on a elementary school chair. The server was incredibly friendly and explained the menu items we asked about with great knowledge and offered wine and beer selections to go with our dinner choices. We started with a blue crab with jalapeno and tomato crostini ($10).  It was piled high with incredible crab meat.  The flavor was great but I felt it could have used more jalapeno flavor.  The seeds of the jalapeno were removed and it was slice incredibly thin (Think Goodfellas slicing garlic in prison), so it had little to no heat. For my entree I chose the paccheri with Sunday night ragu and provolone picante ($20).  This was pasta perfection.  The ragu was thick and filling, the pasta was perfectly cooked.   I really enjoyed my visit here and would certainly return.  Easy parking, friendly staff and skilled chefs make this place a winner.
