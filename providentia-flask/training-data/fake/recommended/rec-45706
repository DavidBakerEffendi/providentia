It's the end of 2014 and Nosh Borough has been open for 5 months, and I'm upset that I've missed out on five months of amazing food. It seems they are getting the recognition and reputation they deserve. I'm still enjoying the afterglow of my first meal here, so here's a brief review of the food: PULLED PORK WAFCO: Succulent, juicy hunks of pulled pork with pickled veggies in a well-built waffle taco. It's not a weird sweet-breakfast thing: it's just a very good, thin waffle bread, that holds together well and soaks up the delicious juices. Excellent. DIRTY RICE: Simple, spiced rice, with fennel and small pieces of Italian sausage. It's a great side and you enjoy every bite. If you want more variety of textures, though, go for: COLLARD GREENS: Wow. The greens retain a bit of texture on the first bite before melting in your mouth. Spicy, rich broth and little pieces of ham hock bursting with flavor. This is as good as or better than the greens you get in the best southern BBQ joints. I will be back to taste the entire rest of the menu. I got my food to go so I didn't experience eating inside, but the owners said they are going to make more room inside so get ready to bring and impress your friends.
