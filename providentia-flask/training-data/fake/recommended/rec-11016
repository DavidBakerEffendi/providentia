2 1/2 stars. Have eaten here a few times and liked it without ever being able to love it due to the following: * Indifferent wait staff. * Bathroom usually needs attendance, atmosphere otherwise cozy. * Appetizer BBQ special is pretty good, and a nice quantity, but the vegetable quality and variety is poor. Read: boring lettuce, huge cucumber slices and browning mint leaves. The rice paper wrappers arrive stuck together. The char flavor on some items is pretty nice, though. The chicken quality is good, as are the chargrilled pork rolls. * Goi cuon aren't special at all. I've had better in Bucks Co. * Vermicelli noodle bowl with char-grilled beef was good, not special * Chicken chow fun was soooooo average. Bleh. * The salted/pepper shrimp tasted nice but was like chewing fingernails as soon as it cooled a bit - not crispy enough. Also featured the intestinal tract with FECES!!! Ugh. * Prices OK for Philly Lastly, asking if my uncle and his girlfriend who are near their 70s liked it, I was told only "it was cold". No other response. This could be for 70-year-old reasons, or that they've eaten in many other more cosmopolitan places, but why even wonder?
