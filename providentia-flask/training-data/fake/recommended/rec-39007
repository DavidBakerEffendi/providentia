Moved in the neighborhood and when my mother came to visit I took her to Lupa after hearing about it. Everything I ate, from the prosciutto to the salad to the cacio e pepe to the ricotta and honey and everything in between was perfect. Waiter made some great recommendations which helped, forgot his name but taller gentleman with a foreign first name dark hair. Excellent waiter. I'll certainly be a regular at this place because of his recommendations and the quality of the food. Also to try the chef's tasting menu. All in all spent about $160 between my mom and I, without drinks. For that price, it was well worth it. A more relaxed environment than Carbones down the street (Nirvana appropriately playing in the background) but the food was as good, if not better.
