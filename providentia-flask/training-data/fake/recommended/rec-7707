Holly Golightly can have Tiffany's -- Cha-an is my favorite place in NYC, the place I go when I want to feel cocooned in peaceful luxury, like absolutely nothing can go wrong.   Cha-an is always a lovely experience from start to finish -- the space is cozy and intimate, the service is sweet and warm, the tea/dessert menu is extensive and every item is unfailingly delicious.  I have a particular soft spot for the black sesame creme brulee (the sugar crust crackles to Amelie-like perfection under your spoon, and the earthy/nutty black sesame flavor is a great foil for all that dairy richness) and the honey oolong tea.  The only thing that keeps me from coming more often is the distance from my neighborhood.  If you haven't tried it, you're missing out -- don't forget to bring cash, and get a glass of their special kangen water on the side to re-learn what water should taste like!
