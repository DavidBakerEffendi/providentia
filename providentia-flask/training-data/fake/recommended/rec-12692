Went here before I took my girlfriend to see Wicked for her birthday; we had a pre-dinner glass of red wine at the bar before we were seated; the family style dining option was enjoyed as we feasted on the eggplant chicken parm dish; my date with her acute taste buds was impressed with the sauce, of which I immediately followed suit in agreement and enjoyed; we worked our way through the pre show dinner with a bottle of red wine; the crowd here was a bit loud for my taste; I don't know whether it was the young children there or the drunk, animated Italians; the seating is very close to each other as expected in New York; we were fortunate enough to have a nice conversation with the female couple besides us which made the experience here all the better.
