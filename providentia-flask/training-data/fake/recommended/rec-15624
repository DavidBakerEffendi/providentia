The 800+ reviews and extremely long wait don't lie when it comes to the deliciousness of Uva. Â My friend and I had a 7pm reservation on Saturday evening and upon entering this restaurant we were hit with 30 or so people waiting to be seated. After 20 minutes of waiting even though we had reservations, we were extremely happy and the wait was well worth it. First off all, the decor in this place is amazing! Exactly how I envisioned what I wanted my wedding to one day look-rustic, elegant and romantic. Anyway, back to the food.... We shared the grilled calamari salad appetizer to start. Y-U-M!!! My friend is a super picky eater and usually only eats fried calamari with marinara sauce. After trying one piece she couldn't stop eating it. Delicious!! For dinner I had the fettuccine with shaved veggies and shrimp. For something so simple it was really incredible. She had some sort of mushroom ravioli of shorts and said it was amazing as well. Needless to say, there was literally not a crumb left on our plate. Maybe we were starving, maybe it was incredible or maybe it was the few glasses of wine from the extensive wine menu. Whatever it was we can't wait to go back!!
