I was really looking forward to trying out this restaurant and I was quite disappointed.  It was extremely cramped; like the space of a nail salon turned into a restaurant with communal seating.  The portion sizes were quite small.  The wine was high quality, but by the glass servings were on the smaller side.  Over I was disappointed and thought it was overhyped and overpriced.
