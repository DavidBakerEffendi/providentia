Went here with my brother, his wife, and my girlfriend. Had a great time. We got there at 5pm (start of dinner) and only waited because my brother was late. After 5 minutes, they brought us in to a GRAND welcome by the staff in Japanese. We felt so welcome and happy. Literally every staff member we walked past greeted us, smiled, and bowed. We ordered an order of the pork buns and the vegetable buns (the girls were vegetarian). I tried both, and despite the simple look, the pork was a great, tender cut of meat with a flavorful sauce. I tried a bite of the vegetable bun which was delicious as well. I got the Akamaru Ramen, which was recommended by the server for a first-time offender. It was delicious, but as advertised was not too spicy, so we ordered a side of spicy paste, which corrected the deficiency. To be honest though, if you don't need spicy ramen, it was perfect on its own. The pork was pretty good (not as good as the pork in the buns, though), the noodles were cooked perfectly and the right thickness, and the broth was perfectly seasoned. No complaints, aside from the spiciness, but the waiter did tell me to order the Karaka Men if I wanted something spicy. Next time, that will be my order. Only downside of this place is the wait (when we left the waiting room was FILLED, although we went early and so didn't have to wait) and the price ($15 for basically noodle soup, $9 for 2 pork buns), but I think nowadays if you're a Manhattan restaurant that carries the word "ramen" in your title or on your menu, you can get away with murder, and $15 is comparable to their competitors. The pork buns were about double what I was used to paying for in Flushing, but the quality justified a modest increase in price.
