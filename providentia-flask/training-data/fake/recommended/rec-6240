Love this place. I often go alone and sit at the bar, and the bartenders are very friendly, and efficient. The food is good too, in particular they make the best lamb burger I've ever had. Juicy and spicy and delish. Most of the other dishes I've had are good too. Nice neighborhood Medittereanean restaurant, with yupper west side crowd.
