Have gone here 3 times this summer and have yet to be disappointed.  The outdoor seating area is basic, but cute.  Inside is your standard bar, but their draft beer selection is fantastic (Victory, Saranac, Long Trail, Flying Fish are only a few of the beers on tap) and their food is awesome.  The sliced steak sandwich is my favorite!  Yum!!!
