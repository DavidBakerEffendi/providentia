I went to The Smith last night for dinner with 3 girlfriends.  Our reservation was definitely necessary, as the place was jam packed.  The service was nice and the food was great -  my Goat Cheese Ravioli with pesto sauce was delicious.  It is a little on the pricier side, and a lot of the main courses that were pricier are common meals.  I'd go back there again.
