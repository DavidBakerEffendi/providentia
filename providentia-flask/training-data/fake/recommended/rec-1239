I love that the owner died. I really do. He was the one who starred in their borderline racist "Speak English" ads. That'll bring the tourist to Philadelphia Geno, well done sir! One day, hopefully, Geno's Steaks dies too - they are cheap on the meat, and the meat, if you get any, tastes and looks very non-cow like. Trivial question: Do you think Geno's distaste for non-English speaking people just stopped at their inability to speak Amerrr'can? Hmmmm, I don't think so....
