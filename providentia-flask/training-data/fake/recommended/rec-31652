Decor: is outdated and plain weird, the food is way over priced, this is the second time at this place and i have to say i was unhappy Â first time i ordered salmon and was tasteless plus the presentation was horrible rice and some kind of sweet mashed potatoes, those flavors don't go together.. Yesterday i had chicken cacciatore and the same rice and mashed! Uggghhh! Service is good, but i go to a restaurant to have the whole: ambiance and good food. I really don't understand why this place have goid reviews.
