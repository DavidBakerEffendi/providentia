Four stars only because i liked the view.  This restaurant is on the water and the structure of the building is cool.  The view of the water is a little industrial but i dont mind it since there are barely any restaurants like this on staten island.  I came here with my cousin and we got the 20$ pre fixe (it might have been more than 20$). The food was salty... Not terrible but definitely too salty.  We had a good time overall but i probably wont come back to eat, just drinks.
