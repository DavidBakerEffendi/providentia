Awesome indian food. Try the murg dingri (chicken curry), super tender chicken and incredibly tasty curry. I've come here probably over 30 times, and each time I cannot be happier with the food. The samosas are the bomb, service is chill, and prices are not too cheap, not too expensive - but juuuuuust right.
