Oh my god! This place is amazing. We stumbled into it, not knowing anything about it. Just trying to get shelter from the rain. Walked in and it is SO INCREDIBLE. This is certainly a place we will always come when in NY in Hell's Kitchen. It has great atmosphere with perfect music and just loud enough to be lively and still allow conversation at the table. Dinner was one of the best I have had in New York.
