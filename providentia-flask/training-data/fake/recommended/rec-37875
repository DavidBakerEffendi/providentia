New favorite place to eat in NYC!!! Everyone in our party of 5 was happy. We all have varied tastes so "family style" made me a little nervous, but it was easy to please everyone. Pitcher of white wine sangria (yum on a warm day), crusty bread, house salad, chicken parm for the girls, veal parm for the guys, linguini all around, followed by a nice light, heavenly tiramisu to share! Off to see a show on a very pleasantly full tummy!
