Hate to admit an ex introduced me to my favorite restaurant in my favorite hometown!  They have the best brunch I've ever had and the monkey bread is an absolute must!!  Not to mention awesome retro decor complete with green shag carpet.  Can't step foot in downtown Philly on a Sun morn' w/o hitting this place up!
