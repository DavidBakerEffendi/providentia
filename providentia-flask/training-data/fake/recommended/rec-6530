I just cheated on Shake Shack...(and I liked it too eeeks) Took me a while to decide: battled between price point, ambience, taste, service etc etc. But in the end, I crowned Umami as my #1 in NYC based on level of happiness I felt while taking in each bite. It was just a little better....a little. What we had: 1. UMAMI BURGER: The Winner. Something about the sauce that has a Korean bbq quality to it. I can't pinpoint it. Also...that crispy cheese really was nice. The bun is light and soft and a little sweet....is it brioche? 2.TRUFFLE BURGER: it was good, but didn't impress me. Not much to say about it. 3. TEMPURA ONION RINGS: nice batter, super thick and juicy onion rings. It's missing some flavor, though. 4. TRUFFLE FRIES: good, but i didn't care for the cheese - too much going on. The sauces it came with was pretty awesome. Fancy for a burger joint, but it's a pretty casual place overall. I'd definitely come back, but only really for the Umami burger...and on a Monday evening with no wait.
