I was fairly underwhelmed by this place. The staff weren't the most helpful or friendly, we waited ages for the food and when it came it was just average. The bloody marys are the worst I've had in a while, watery, no spice. The place looks very nice inside, I just think the food and service needs improving. Don't rush to check this place out, I'd give it 2.5 stars if yelp had that option..
