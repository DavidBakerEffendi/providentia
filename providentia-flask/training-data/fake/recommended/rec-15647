I dream about this place.  It's that good.  The only issue with this place is that no matter the time of day, there is ALWAYS a wait.  However, no other place is able to curb my Asian cravings as quickly, effectively, and delectably as Ippudo does.  Bravo. I've had such fond experiences with the pork buns and Akamaru Modern that I tend not to stray from those items.  Definitely worth the time and the prices!
