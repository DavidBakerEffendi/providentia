Pretty solid happy hour (I believe there was a smattering of beers on tap & select wines for $5 ) and decent food. It's right around the corner from the office, so I know we'll end up there more than once. The crowd reflects the area, ie guys in suits and everyone happy that it's after 5PM, but good energy. Staff was great. Manager was super sweet and went around multiple times to make sure everyone was happy. Top 40 playing in the back. Restrooms downstairs, I can see that being a hazard after one too many, but still clean and nicely decorated. Not too shabby for Midtown West!
