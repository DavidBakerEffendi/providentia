We went here as a family for the first time on a sunday night and had a wonderful experience! It was buy one get one free pizza night, so we got a salad and 4 pizzas between the 3 of us and ended up taking a whole pie home leftover! The service was excellent, ambiance was comfortable, and food was delish. We will be adding this spot to our favorites list! (Better than pizzeria vetri in my opinion)
