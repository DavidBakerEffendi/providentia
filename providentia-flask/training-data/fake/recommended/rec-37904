The mushroom pizza was delicious.  If I lived in Philadelphia, I would OD on it.  I have been to many great pizza places on the west coast and the east coast - the mushroom pizza here was among the best I have had of the wood-fired variety (the crust reminded me of Pizzeria Delfina in SF).  LOVED it.
