I'm in Philly a few times a year on business and this spot always seems to find it's way into my dinner plans. The atmosphere is retro-chic like most other Starr restaurants and features tapas cuisine. The large tables downstairs can fit up to 6; the hanging chairs upstairs are funky and fun for two. The bathrooms are even nifty with their one-way glass at the sinks (don't worry - the stalls are out of view of the mirror). Perennial favorites include the lobster mac & cheese, peanut chicken skewers, chicken quesadilla, and the Continental salad (definitely for sharing). The desserts are divine and it's unfortunate there isn't a super-duper huge serving size for those. My favorite is the strawberry shortcake but really I haven't had a bad dessert.
