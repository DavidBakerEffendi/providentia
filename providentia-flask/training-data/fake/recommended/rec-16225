For my 40th Review why not take on an oldie but a goodie. This place has been reviewed enough times so I will have nothing new to add to the mix. I came here a while back with my amigo Dave to catch up as it had been a while since we last saw each other. We both studied abroad together in Valencia and were thus very familiar with Tapas and Sangria. This place had a lot of hype and certainly lived up to it. They had an interesting variety of  Tapas as well as the most popular ones. The patatas bravas and chorizo were to die for.  It provided the perfect backdrop for two American boys yearning to go back in time to another place. Great spot! Great Neighborhood!
