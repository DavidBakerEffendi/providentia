Breakfast with my 6 year daughter was exceptional. Quick, delicious and very friendly. It was a nice surprise for such a nice place to be so welcoming with a child. Â By the way the eggs Norwegian were AMAZING. Best ever - the English muffin was perfectly toasted and not soggy which tends to be the downfall on eggs Benedict in most places.
