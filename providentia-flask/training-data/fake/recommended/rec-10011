Found this spot based on customer reviews, place was empty on a Thursday evening around 5pm, but we were treated very nicely and quickly seated. My husband and I shared the whole fish of the day, which was very fresh, our friends shared the seafood risotto which looked amazing and they enjoyed it very much.
