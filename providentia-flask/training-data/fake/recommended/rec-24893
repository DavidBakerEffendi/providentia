Juicy juicy meat sandwiches. No, seriously. Ask for extra napkins, especially if you add the greens or roasted peppers. DiNic's serves some classic sandwiches, but I like the Italian pulled pork with provolone. There are a dozen seats at their counter, or line up and try to find a seat somewhere in the market. Follow up with Bassett's ice cream. Efficient service. Worth the wait in a 10 person line, maybe not worth the wait in the line when it stretches across the center of the market.
