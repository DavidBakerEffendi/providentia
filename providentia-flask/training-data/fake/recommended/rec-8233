I was in Philly for a wedding. I went to Chinatown, and it was...Chinatown.  The food sucked.  Why would any Asian want to go there?  I thought I would be stuck without anywhere to go or do.   Then the recommendation for the Reading Terminal started coming in.  Boy am I glad they did.  This place was awesome.  Food everywhere!!  After going to Pat's several years ago, I swore that I would never buy another one.  I kept to my word.  I had the leftovers of what my wife couldn't finish.  It was so good!  I got into the longest line that I could find, and later found out that I was standing in the line at DiNic's.  I got their famous pork sandwich, and it was good.  The wife also gave me some of her leftover shrimp Po boy sandwich.  Awesome place.  Too bad, I will probably never go to Philly again.
