The restaurant opens at 5 p.m. on Sunday. I arrived at 5:08 and was told I was the first name on the list. Great.  Sat at the bar and had a tea with a shot of brandy.  When my friends checked to see how long the wait was, we were told it would be two hours.  Even though we were first on the list.  So I went to pay for my drink and it was $13.  FOR A TEA AND A SHOT.    When the drink is more than the burger and there's a two-hour wait when you're first on the list, there's something wrong.    If you're not an uber foodie, save your money and your time and head over to Royal or Good Dog.
