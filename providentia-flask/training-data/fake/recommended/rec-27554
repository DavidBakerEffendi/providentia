This is one of my 3 favorite restaraunts in Williamsburg. The food is dependably delicious and cooked with love. I generally get one of their savory crepes, usually the curry shrimp or chicken. If you have room for desert, there are amazing sweet crepes as well. It's affordable, the staff is familiar and attentive, and it has a cutesy atmosphere. I highly recommend!
