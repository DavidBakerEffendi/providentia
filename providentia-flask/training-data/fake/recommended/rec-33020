Flavorful food. The service was really good, as the server was very attentive. Â Plenty of Vegetarian and nonvegetarian options. They encourage you to eat in the traditional way, which is with your hands, but will also supply utensils if you ask for it. The atmosphere is quiet and friendly which is great for enjoying the food and having a conversation. The hostess was very knowledgeable and was able to explain all the food options and their different flavors so you can make your choice. It looks like a hole in the wall when you're approaching the restaurant but from inside it's very warm and inviting. You must also try their coffee which is made in a traditional clay pot! Will be back!
