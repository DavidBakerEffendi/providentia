I've been searching Philadelphia for years to find a great, inexpensive sushi restaurant. This place is it. There are only about 8 seats around the counter, so you might have to wait- but it'll be worth it. If you prefer not to wait, they'll make your to-go order in the blink of an eye, and they also deliver.
