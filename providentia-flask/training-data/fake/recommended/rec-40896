Awesome spot, very friendly staff and a DELICIOUS meal of salmon, cauliflower (probably best I've ever had), and asparagus. Price point is evidently higher than that of restaurants in the area, but very worth it bc it's evident they make almost everything in-house. Had passed this place many times on the way to nostrand ave subway and I'm so happy I stopped. Highly recommend. Will be back soon.
