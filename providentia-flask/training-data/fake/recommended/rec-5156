I love Chavellas. I loved it when it was tinier, and I love it now that it's just tiny. I adore that I can now with my amazing food, have a margarita (so good) and I appreciate that they accept cards in the new spot. It's a great neighborhood restaurant, and the quality is fantastic. Unique food creations and always ask for the specials. I also really love that it still feels small, despite them tripling the space. The tables are still close together, (although not uncomfortably anymore) and it still feels comfy. Here is why the new place got four stars for me and not 5: If they change these two things, throw it up to growing pains, I'll gladly give a five because I love this place so much. 1) music is too loud. On a Sunday Morning why are horns blasting in my ears to the point that I want to leave? It's not a Saturday night out. I honestly had to stop eating until one song stopped. Background music please- this is not a club.  While the music selection is fine- great even, it's just obnoxiously loud. Been to the new location 3x and all three times it was intolerable. 2) New staff isn't as personable as the old faces I got to know. However, I'm sure they will get a hang of it. One hostess really seemed to have an attitude problem- as though this was such an elite place now- I can be rude and snide. That's not the feel Chavellas should, or I believe wants to have. That being said:  This place still has a small feel, with big results.
