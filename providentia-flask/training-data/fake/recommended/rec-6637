Whoever thought to put honey and hot sauce on the chicken biscuit...I think I might be in love with you. The biscuit was also really really good - almost a little like a croissant (I really don't want to think about how much butter I must have eaten in that meal...) I lucked out and was able to sit right down without a wait. I don't know that I would necessarily wait around as long as it sounds like you often have to, but I would go back for sure.
