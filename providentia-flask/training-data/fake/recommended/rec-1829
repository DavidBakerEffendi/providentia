I headed to Pat's last weekend when my friend was in town and wanted to try a Philly cheesesteak. We got there around 11:45am on a Sunday, and it wasn't too busy. There's only street parking, which I was worried about, but we managed to find a spot within a block or two. We ordered a cheesesteak ($9) with cheez whiz and onions. The cheesesteak appeared before we handed over our $10, and we sat down to split it. There are a few outdoor tables around- but no bathroom (just a warning!). The cheesesteak had fresh, tasty meat. The cheez whiz was a good ratio, and the bread was the perfect consistency. Definitely a very tasty cheesesteak, if a bit expensive (Geno's across the street is also $9, though, and a lot less tasty). If you want to try one of the cheesesteak institutions, definitely come by Pat's! While I won't say you won't be able to find better cheesesteaks elsewhere in Philly, the cheesesteak here is pretty good, and it's definitely a fun spot to bring people from out of town. And if you're choosing between Pat's and Geno's, definitely try Pat's!
