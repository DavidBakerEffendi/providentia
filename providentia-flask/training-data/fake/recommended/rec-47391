I know after writing this review I will probably go back again.... HOWEVER my MAIN grip with this place is I came here with a friend for dinner during the week and we were waiting on our other friend to join us who was running late. They sat us at a tiny 17" round table because they wouldn't seat us a bigger table until our friend arrived (understandable). Our friend came after we ordered some drink and apps and we all ordered dinner. There were two four tops open. The staff refused to seat us at a 4 top. Our 3 dinner plates wouldn't even FIT on the round table. And we were practically sitting on top of other people next to us. THE ENTIRE TIME WE WERE EATING NO ONE CAME IN AND SAT AT THE FOUR TOP. The food isn't so good I need to be eating with my plate on my lap for a 15 dollar burger. Apparently we weren't spending enough money to be worthy of the space?! I asked to be reseated several times and they would not do it. I'm so over the shitty attitude in these tiny precious Williamsburg restaurants. The food is really not that good. I recommend Manhattan Inn if you want something just as good for cheaper, with more space and a nicer staff.
