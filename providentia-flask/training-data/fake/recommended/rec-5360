This is a must-go spot whenever I get to Manhattan for a visit.  I always order the Akabaru Modern with pork belly and an order of pork buns.  I always try to time my arrival with an off meal time so that I don't have to wait too long. I'm not exaggerating when I say my mouth waters whenever I think about this rich, flavorful broth.  I have yet to find a ramen equal anywhere else.
