My first time in Philly, knew I had to try Geno's and Pat's...I don't even understand why there's a competition because Pat's is so superior. My cousin is a born and raised Â Philly-er, I dont know if that's the proper name for them, but she told me to try Pat's but I wanted to try both. Genos was good but not anything that I couldn't get in New York. Pat's was incredible though! The meat was so fresh and the cheese OH MY GOD THE CHEESEEEEE! I did one traditional and then one cheese mushroom pepper pizza steak, normally I'm all about the toppings but their original was so good I really just couldn't improve upon it. Don't waste your time at Genos, head straight to Pat's!!!!! For the record I shared this with my boyfriend and brother, I'm a big girl but these sandwiches are intense, I couldn't have handled 3 alone haha. I ended up getting 2 to go which I plan on enjoying for a late night snack and for breakfast! I can't wait for my next trip into Philly just so I can indulge in one of Pat's INCREDIBLE cheese steaks again!
