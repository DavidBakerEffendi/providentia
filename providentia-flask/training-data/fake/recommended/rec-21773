took my brother and his girlfriend here on their first visit. i spotted the place while walking by to meet them on union st, with no prior knowledge of it. here is the short and simple of it: -sat in their outdoor patio/garden which was amazing -chef sent out a free appetizer of beets over quinoa with a glaze, amazing -food itself was amazing: healthy options, great portions, came out at a good pace -service was excellent, staff was friendly and not overbearing i will most likely take anyone that visits me there because they have BRUNCH DURING THE WEEK and are not hipster, pretentious or yuppy. comes highly recommended.
