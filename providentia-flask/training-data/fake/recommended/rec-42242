I wanted to give this rating 4 stars for two reasons: the server was very attentive and thorough and the Ox Tail Fried Rice was AH-mazing. My girlfriend also thoroughly enjoyed her sushi. Otherwise, however, I wasn't very impressed by this member of the Blue Ribbon family. The Blue Ribbon brand sent me in with the highest of expectations and those weren't met. Don't get me wrong, it was a pleasant and tasty experience and we didn't have to wait which is always a pleasant surprise on a Friday night in Park Slope. Â Having said that, Blue Ribbon Sushi in SoHo - best sushi I've ever had; the brasserie in SoHo - also outstanding. Which is why I wasn't expecting a bad soundtrack, a 5 page (ugly) menu and a diner type atmosphere. I'll be back to sit at the bar for happy hour but not for dinner.
