Came here for brunch. I have no idea what's so great about this place. It certainly is not the food. I couldn't taste the difference between my eggs and potatoes, that came with it, and a fried crab cake, that could just be the fries, which some dude was carrying around for customers to sample on a dish, that kind of just looked like someone's leftovers.. It's just very bland generic food, that you could find in any regular diner.
