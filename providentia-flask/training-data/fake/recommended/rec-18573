Service was awful. But it may have just been this one particular waiter. He was so inattentive . Our food took forever and when it came 2 out of 3 dishes were cold. He was not apologetic at all. Never asked if wanted more drinks when our's were empty. Had the waiter apologized for the Â wait and cold food and made up for it by keeping our drinks full. I wouldn't have been so turned off and would even considered going back. The ambiance is nice and food is fair. Wouldn't go back based on this experience.
