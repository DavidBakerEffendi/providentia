This place was amazing! A friend and I were looking for something new to eat and decided to try here. We got the garlic shrimp and grilled red snapper and shared our sides which were rice and beans, yucca, plantains and these other fried bananas that were ahhhhmazing! Everything was so fresh and flavorful. The atmosphere was so warm and cozy. The wait was a little long because everything was made to order but it was so worth the wait. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming and I cannot wait to come back for those fried bananas!!
