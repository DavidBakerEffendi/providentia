Holy SHIT!  What just happened?  I woke up with tzatziki on my face.  Salty, creamy, crunchy, spicy kosher fast food to satisfy your soul.  What are you waiting for?  Go, go, go! *Note*- there is a constant line to order food (worth it), a few seats inside and a few benches outside (you may not get a seat), and you are highly likely to eat over your calorie limitation for the day.
