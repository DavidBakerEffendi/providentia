On a cold evening the cafe had the wood stove burning and we warmed right up.  Great menu - the caesar salad with shrimp was amazing. The flavor was so good it stayed with you in a good way. Yum!   Cozy very small environment, great bar, great food and a must when you are in that area.  Can't wait to go during warmer weather.  Great recommendation from agood  friend.  Thank you.
