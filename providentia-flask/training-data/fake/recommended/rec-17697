My friend really hyped up this place as her fav place in the city.  Usually that's the kiss of death, but not in this case. Come here for lunch.  It's one of the best deals in the city.  It will still be expensive, but nothing like coming for dinner.  I did it twice.  Both times excellent and memorable.    Second time for my birthday and everything was flawless.  Actually just thinking about it makes me want to come back for lunch again!  Some things that stood out- porcini flan, steak, and just at the end when you're pretty much stuffed this huge chocolate dessert.  They also gave me a  nice size cake to take home for my b day.  awesome.
