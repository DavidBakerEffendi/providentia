A bit basic, no frills sort of place.  Staff friendly and many choices.  Food was great and I'm always happy when the gluten free meal I order is actually tasty.  They do a great gluten free pasta.  No wine so BYOB was encouraged.  The place was hopping when we ate there and I suspect everything on their menu is good because it was very very busy.  In spite of this the service did not suffer.
