Wow, I was shocked that you can get a yummy bowl of noodles for cheap here.  I remembered trying both the beef and the seafood knive-shaved noodles.  However, the beef noodles were the best that I have tasted anywhere.  The perfect amount of tendon and the meat just melts in your mouth.  Also, there is the best treat near the cashier which we took extra- bala fruit hard candy.
