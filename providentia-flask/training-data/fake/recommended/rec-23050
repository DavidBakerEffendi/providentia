I visited this restaurant 5 or 6 times when I first moved to the area and although I liked it the first few times I felt disappointed in my experience my last few times. It was good but, not impressive. Still, I would have given it an average of 3 stars based on the total of my dining experience. I can't even tell you what I ordered since it's been 4 years. For the last several years, I have been going to a Thai place on Rt 10 even though Pat Thai's is right up the street from me. I rather forgot it was there but then decided to try it two weeks ago hoping it would be as good as my Rt 10 place. Not so. I was really disappointed. I REALLY wanted to like it. I had a hankering for Tom Kha soup and I love the twang it usually has. It didn't have it. My hankering was not satisfied. My S.O. had the Fried Calamari, (which he orders no matter what restaurant he is in), and said it was rubbery. The portion was also a little skimpy. We split three entrees and thank God. The prices are reasonable I think because they really limit the portions. My S.O. eats a lot and it was barely enough food for him. An appetizer for him, a soup for me and a split of three entrees, while for me it was plenty, but for him not nearly enough. Granted, as I said he eats a lot, (no, he's not fat) but not enough really? I thought the Panang Curry w/beef was good and the Pad Phok w/chicken was ok, but the Pad Thai, which is such a "touristy" popular dish, was not as good as I am used to. The noodles were a bit dry. The whole dish was not bad, just a bit dry. Well, I'll keep searching for better Thai. This is a BYOB BTW.
