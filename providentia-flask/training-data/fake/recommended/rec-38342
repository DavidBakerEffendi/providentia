Sweetwaters is awesome if you like mediocre food and thin wallets. There are a couple pros, namely its location and the building itself, which are admittedly spectacular; however, they are the only reasons this bland, overpriced restaurant continues to exist. Don't get me wrong, atmosphere is important and it's great to be able to dine out on Church Street, but you can do that any number of restaurants elsewhere on that strip and feel way better walking away from your meal. Everything that might be good about Sweetwaters is done better at other restaurants, usually for far cheaper. I honestly don't think I've ever been so disappointed with a meal, and when a friend convinced me I'd had a bad experience and wrangled me back in through their doors, my second taste was equally frustrating. The managerial staff is unpleasant and unhelpful, as well. Try Leunig's right across the way -- go before 5:45 or after 10:00 for one of the best meals in Burlington for only $15. This is but one of the many superior options available to you. Just don't waste your money at Sweetwaters.
