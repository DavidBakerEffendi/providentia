Ok...I'm updating my previous review based on a dinnertime visit. It was raining, I'd just had a looong day at work and was just so hungry that I caved in and walked into Alices Arbor on my way home from the train. I was planning on just having a cheese plate and wine but the super nice, new bar tender and guy with the long curly-ish hair described the meatloaf so well to my growling stomach I caved and ordered it. The evening experience at this place is a complete 180. I chatted for some time with the staff who shared some insight on the restaurant's history and building efforts. It definitely gave me a new perspective. I very slowly enjoyed the cheese and then devoured the meatloaf. Sooooo good. I will avoid the brunch/lunch for now because I still think the food was lackluster. But I'll hope that upon my return the daytime food and service will blow my socks off! Thanks Eric G for your thoughtful response as well.
