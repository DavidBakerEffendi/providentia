For the most part this restaurant was very good... We were by the kitchen, (last table all the way at the end) so we literally felt the heat... i wish we could have ate away from the kitchen.  It was a bit warm and stuffy for my liking. For the neighborhood, i would say that this restaurant is very expensive for the area.  Average price if you stuck it somewhere in NYC. the (warm) bread basket is phenomenal.  not to be missed. now, onto the food... i think depending on what you order, is a hit or miss. We generally enjoyed everything with a few critiques.  Let's get the bad stuff out of the way.... the lamb ribs, were in no shape or form, that impressing.  Our rack was oily, too sweet for me, and too fatty.  I would not order this again.   The octopus with chorizo was pretty good, but even better than that was the squid ink tagliatelle with peekytoe crab.  It was seasoned perfectly (usually i find this combination too salty elsewhere) and by far my favorite dish of the night.  My next second favorite was the lobster.  Which, was a half order (as most of their entrees were allowed to order half)... The cod was a half order, and the portion just seemed way too small.  It was good...nothing mind blowing. We over ordered a bit, and would have been fine without the lamb ribs (which came out last).  Too stuffed for dessert, but their wine selection is quite divine.  Overall, a good restaurant, and I still want to try its sister restaurant Battersby.
