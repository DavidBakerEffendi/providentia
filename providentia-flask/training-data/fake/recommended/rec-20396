I had a wonderfully mellow brunch here on an otherwise dreary December Sunday.  My companion and I arrived at 10am on the dot to a wisp of a line and were shortly welcomed inside and seated by the charming staff.  By the time our orders arrived, the place seemed more a less full, but not overly noisy. My pecan pie french toast was perfectly sweet (not saccharine) with a warm wink of burbon flavor running through its syrup bath.  My brunch-mate found her "short stack" of buttermilk pancakes to be a bit taller than she expected, but delicious. We split some sausage patties which were savory and unexpectedly colorful. Over all an absolutely satisfying ... and affordable ... experience.  Their entire menu was enticing, so I'm sure to be charting a course to the Channel again sometime soon.
