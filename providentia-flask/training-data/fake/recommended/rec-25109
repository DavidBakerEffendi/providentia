Big Wong is my go-to place in Chinatown. Their prices are low, portions are huge, and the food is amazing. I love the little bits of shrimp in their wontons and their beef pan-fried noodles that come with substancial slices of beef and vegetables. It's been a while since I've been to Big Wong but I'll be sure to hit it up next time I'm in the area.
