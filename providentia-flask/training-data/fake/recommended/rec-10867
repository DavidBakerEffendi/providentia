Went to Brooklyn Crab because I heard of a new crab house on the water in BK. To there credit, and the reason for the second star, is the atmosphere and staff.  The decorations and feel to the restaraunt is awesome, the mini golf and corn hole downstairs are a nice touch.  The ambiance is just right for a seafood place.  The wait staff and bartenders were very friendly, and answered all my questions on what to order.   The food was mediocre at best.  The food is very expensive for poorly prepared seafood.  I was disappointed with just about everything I ordered.  The lobster was rubbery, the snow crab and king crab tasted thawed, and the Jonah Claws were just terrible.  I also ordered the overpriced oysters, which did not taste all that fresh. My advice to Brooklyn Crab is to improve your food or lower your prices because something has to give.
