OMG! I'm always always always always satisfied with Buttermilk Channel! From appetizer straight to dessert! And there is always room for dessert...especially their claim to fame pecan caramel ice cream sundae! Folks that work there are super cool and pleasant not to mention the owner. Doug is amazingly cool! Every chance I get, I bring folks by...from birthday's to graduations or just for eatery sake! You will love this place.
