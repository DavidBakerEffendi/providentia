This is my bar in Montclair. Tried all the other options but keep coming back here. What keeps me coming back is the beer selection, the maple wings, and the service. Mostly the service, best I've had in the area by far. But beware, it gets BUSY in here. Finding a bar spot can sometimes be frustrating when you're really craving a beer. But it's busy for a reason, so be patient.
