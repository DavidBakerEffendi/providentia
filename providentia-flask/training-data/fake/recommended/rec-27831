I was very disappointed with my visit here. I came with 2 friends so we were 3 people total, we had made a 9 pm reservation. My friends got there at 8:30 and sat at the bar drinking, I arrived at 8:50 and sat at the bar at 9 pm the manager/ server dude said oh just 10 minutes there's people at your table. I thought that when you made a reservation it meant something, I guess not. Upon trying to close out at the bar we are told there is a 20.00 card minimum, um weird. None of us had cash so one card gets used. So we continue to sit at the bar having a drink. We finally got seated at 9:35pm. We ordered the guacamole and plantain chips to start. Would definitely never order again, it basically had zero flavor. We ordered our food and waited. The food was ok, not great but fine I have definitely had better Cuban in the city. We finish, our waiter is no where to be found we wait for at least 10-15 for him to bring the check. We put our cards in to evenly split the check, which is never a problem at any other NYC restaurant. We wait, wait, wait. About twenty minutes passed before another person in the restaurant picks up our book. She walks away. Then a couple minutes later our waiter walks by with the book to run the cards. He then comes to the table and says we have a 25.00 minimum on cards. At the bar it was 20.00, now it's 25.00? So we split it on two cards wait some more and then leave. There was no signage anywhere in this place saying cash only or that there was a card minimum which is obnoxious. Ok food, subpar service, will not be back.
