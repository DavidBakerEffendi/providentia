I have been here several times for the ramen and pork buns. And the ramen always bring me back again even for hours of waiting in line. Yesterday is the first time we tried some new appetizer there. They are also pretty good and competitive to other Japanese restaurant. Cod fish with the mayo sauce will be a must had in my future visiting. There is a special salty taste inside the fish which we cant achieve from home cooking. But the special ramen we ordered yesterday is not as good as their classic ones. It served a dry noodles and toppings with a dipping sauce. After all I will definitely come here again for some new findings.
