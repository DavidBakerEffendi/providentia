I rarely find myself at P.F. Chang's, mainly because I try to eat at more indie spots but every-time I find myself dining at one I am always very happy and this location was no exception!  The wonton soup was stellar I could see heading in for just that and some Sapporo and calling it a day!  we also had lettuce wraps which were really good but they always are, and mongolian beef, I am not gonna lie I have had better Mongolian beef but all in all I was a big fan the service was prompt the beer was cold and the food was delish!  If I am ever in the neighborhood again I would stop back in for sure!
