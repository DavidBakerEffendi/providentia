I gave this place 2 stars as the menu looks great. BUT...My husband and I didn't even make it to the food. The menu looks great, but it's simply WAY TOO cramped!  We were seated at a table made for 4 that had place settings for 8 the neighboring couple had their wine and water glass on our place setting and multiple plates that took up virtually the entire table. That's a bit extreme to say the least.  I feel like no matter how great the food is, you just can't enjoy it when you aren't seated comfortably.   We still want to try it, but we'll have to come back at an obscure hour.
