First, super nice staff.  We have chatted more than once with the Head Chef, Nick, who is really nice and has created a very creative and unique menu.  The servers are chatty, helpful, and professional.  One night around Christmas we were in for drinks and I was in the mood for a christmas cocktail.  I asked the barman if they had a special holiday drink and he offered to come up with something for me.  He asked me what I would like an I said "something Christmas-y, I love cranberries."  I know, very helpful of me.  He created something amazing!  Really nice of him.   The menu consists of small plates, which I like as you can try several different things without feeling like a total glutton.  Oh brunch?  DId you ask how is the brunch?  Do you want to hear about brunch?  Okay, brunch.  So we decided to go to Cafe Henri for brunch.  Of course the line was out the door.  My husband said "Why don't we try this place?", turns out a friend of his knew the owner.  I looked in and saw no one (calm down it was in the fall) and said "Um.....there is no one in there and Cafe Henri has a line out the door.  I don't think that is a good sign."  Hubby decided that we should try it anyway and literally shoved me through the door.  All I can say is Pistachio Pancakes.......YUM!  YUM YUM YUM YUM.......YYYYUUUUUUUUMMMMM!!!  The next time we went back for brunch, 2 weeks later, the place was full.   Open Door is a great addition to the neighborhood.  We have lived here for almost 11 years and though we still frequent the old neighborhood joints, it's nice to see a new place that celebrates the history of LIC.  The decor consists of old pictures of the neighborhood, a re-creation of the Pepsi sign, and really nice wood booths. p.s.- We really do love Cafe Henri but it has not really changed it's menu since it has opened.
