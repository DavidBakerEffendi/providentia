I live in the Ironbound and found this place through a Portuguese friend of mine . Many, Â many places to eat in Ironbound . Most are overpriced and mediocre . Portugalia is exceptional . I prefer to sit at the bar and grab some cold red wine and their "frango" ( roasted chicken) which is the juiciest best seasoned that I've had around here . The prices are more than fair and the service is awesome . They have a separate dining room if your with a group and the other food items are just as good . Great spot!!!!
