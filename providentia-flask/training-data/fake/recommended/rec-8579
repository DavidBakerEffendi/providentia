I have never been more appalled with a restaurant in my life. I created a Yelp account just to write this review. I am a vegetarian of 15 years. When ordering Massimo's delivery, I let the server know that I do not eat chicken. After finding chicken on my Greek Salad (which does not say that it includes chicken on the menu, it says "Di Feta Salad $8.69 The best Greek salad in Princeton"), I called the restaurant to let them know of their mistake. The manager of the restaurant accused me of lying. I did not want a reimbursement, I simply wanted another salad. He said he would not serve it to me and that it is my responsibility to specify "no chicken" in a vegetarian salad, even after informing the person taking my order that Â I am a vegetarian. I have dealt with many restaurants as a vegetarian and have never felt more disrespected than I have here. The manager is extremely unprofessional and I think it speaks very poorly of his establishment. If I could give this place zero stars I would have. Go to Dangelo's if you need Italian, there are many better restaurants in Princeton. DO NOT EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT. YOU WON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN YOUR FOOD BECAUSE THEY DON'T EITHER.
