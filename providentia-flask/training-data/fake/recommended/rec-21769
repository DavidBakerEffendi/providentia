An hour and fifteen minutes after placing our burger order and watching takeout order after takeout order being sent out, and asking and asking for our food because the NONWHINY kids were getting hungry, the food arrived....and the order was wrong. Bonnie's burgers are good but I'm not going back. Not worth the stupid wait for completely inept service and I don't really want to smell like a line cook because the exhaust system doesn't work. Â I'll stick with Corner Burger. They're nicer, and they have a working exhaust fan.
