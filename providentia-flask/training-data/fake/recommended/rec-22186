This is a great fast food restaurant if you want a more variety than just burgers and fries. My favorites include the eggplant parmigiana sandwich, grilled cheese and hot chocolate. The seafood variety is also pretty good. They renovated the interior recently- looks good and def am able to spend a few hours here on my iPad or watching one of their many tvs while I wait for my car to be fixed at one of the local mechanics
