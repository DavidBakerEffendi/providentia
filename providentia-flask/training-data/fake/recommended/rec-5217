Found this little place by accident after visiting the Abbot marsh in Hamilton.  Family owned, everything prepared from scratch, it has only been open for 3 months. We had delicious sopas, chicken soup and freshly made juice.  The salsa is wonderful.  Portions are BIG!!!  Will definitely be back next time we are in the area.
