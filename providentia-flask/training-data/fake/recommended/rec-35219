Omgggg I have been to almost every Japanese restaurant in Philly, Izumi is by far the best japanese restaurant in Philly! All their dishes are awesome. Although their location is quite remote from the city center making it a little inconvenient, but their quality of food makes up for this!!! Service: very professional and made great recommendations. Here are some of my favorite menu: 1. Special monster rolls (my favorite. It is so good that we ordered the second one) 2. Tuna (in small platter section) 3. Surf and turf ( this is a special menu and it was awesome!!! It consist of perfectly cooked medium rare wagyu beef and seared scallop) 4. Seared scallops (in small platter section) 5. sunomono (good for light appetizer but some may think that it is not that great compared to other alternatives but I still like it) 6.uni sashimi is awesome. (But if u don't like sashimi then u might want to skip this. Their scent can be strong for those who are not used to uni) 7. Pan seared scallop (large plate section. I think this menu is good but not great as compared to other menu I just recommended but if u are a scallop fan like I am, you will like this menu too since the scallops are served with mashed taro blended with potato and some vegetable purée which is so good) However, there are some menu which I think is so so: 1. Passyunk avenue roll 2. Tuna wasabi salsa As for dessert, their chocolate bread pudding served with coconut ice cream is superbbbb. Love it!! We also ordered lychee creme brûlée, which is also good but a little too sweet in my opinion. (But please note that I like not-too-sweet dessert so my standard of how sweet things is might not be accurate compared to most other people haha)
