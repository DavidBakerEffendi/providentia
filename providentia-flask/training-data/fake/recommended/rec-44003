Ordered pagan beef, basil tofu, chili chicken and 1000 layer bread with curry potatoes dip and it was delicious. Â Reasonable price with a huge selection which can be confusing and overwhelming to pick from. But with little assistance from the server, it turned out great for two of us. Definitely return for more.
