With my daughter back from school for the weekend, we did some shopping (they did some shopping, I walked along) in Philly.  Stopped in Village Whiskey based on the casual atmosphere and some pretty darn good Yelp reviews.  My first impression was of how small it is, 12-15 feet wide?  We waited near the back with drinks waiting for our table, dodging wait staff and other customers the while.  Got a table outside which was very non-descript. Service was pretty good but nothing to shout out about.  We started with some cheese puffs that were just sort of...ho-hum.  Also had the pickled tomatoes and olive tapenade that was very good! At the table we went with the duck fat fries as well as the cheese and beef fries.  I preferred the simple duck fat fries which were damn good.  The cheese fries were a little too smothered if that is possible but could have had them more as entree they were so hearty. We had a pulled pork Sammie which was OK, but I think mine at home is better.  The burgers were good if not a little difficult to eat.  They are very thick making it tricky(challenge accepted). Solid burger but I may have expected much more based on reviews. I give Village Whiskey a solid 3 1/2 stars, good ingredients, fresh taste but just wasn't "WOW'd"
