One of the worst sports bar i have ever been too. I went there last monday for monday night game and the bartender will take forever to serve you beer and wings. She was holding our wings in hand for like 10 min while she was just talking to another customer. The only person who get good service there are the guys who know the bartender. One more thing that the bartender had so much attitude on her face. I am never going back there and my only advice to others dont ever try this bar its worthless.
