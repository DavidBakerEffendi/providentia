Best pizza in new haven. Hands down. Perfect crust, thin, crunchy and slightly black on the bottom. The pizza sauce is always on point and delicious. Pies are enormous and having a traditional new haven clam pizza is an experience everyone should let their taste buds enjoy. The anchovies pizza is great too.
