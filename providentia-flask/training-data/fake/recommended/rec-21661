I went to makoto again last Saturday night and the food was excellent as usual! The quality is superb wether you have the sushi or a cooked dish. I can't understand the people down here? How do you explain an outstanding local eatery being only half full on a Saturday night when the crapy ass chain restaurants like TGI Fridays and cheese burger in paradise are packed? Why!? I'll tell you why. Open your minds white bread American! Don't be scared to experience new stuff. You rather pay higher prices for shit food at a well known place like Applebee's instead of having fresher, way better quality food and a local mom and pop spot? Come on wake up and expand your horizons you bland boring bastards from the burbs! Jeez! Seriously though respect yourselves and demand better. You deserve it.
