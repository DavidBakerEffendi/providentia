Juventino was fantastic. I went there last night for my birthday dinner and had an amazing time in their gorgeous garden out back. We started with tasting a few unique wines and the staff was knowledgable and friendly. Oysters and beet salad were perfectly balanced with savory, sweet and tangy, and the lobster tortillas were tasty. We took our time and felt taken care of. We will certainly be back. Fabulous experience.
