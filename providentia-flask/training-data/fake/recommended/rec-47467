I am oh-so-pleased to have a place like Five Leaves in the neighborhood. So far, I have enjoyed the cozy environs of this new little utopia on five occasions, none of which have disappointed me. I've sampled the roasted beet salad, truffle fries, pumpkin and butternut squash soups (served with crusty rustic rolls from the Sullivan Street Bakery), and the bacon wrapped dates. UH, YUM! My beloved recently indulged in the sage scrambled egg sandwich and declared that Five Leaves would be his new haunt. To boot, Five Leaves serves some of the most flavorful and pleasing coffee around. I could easily fritter away an afternoon sipping one of their cappuccinos and noshing on a roll or laze away a winter evening drinking a glass of their temperanillo and nibbling on some fries. Â I will say that I have yet to indulge in a full scale dinner adventure at Five Leaves and I am slightly disappointed by the fact that though their beet root ravioli does look interesting, it is the ONLY vegetarian entree on the menu. Will it kill you to offer something other than pasta? And would it kill you to offer two options? Other than this one critique, Five Leaves has my vote as a top notch addition to the hood.
