Went here with my friend this morning after reading amazing reviews- everything was as amazing as described!!! It was busy and we had to wait for about 30-45 minutes for a table but once we got inside service was fast and friendly. I ordered the eggs Benedict with a side of hash browns. The hash browns were the perfectly cooked- I like them a little crispy on top. The eggs Benedict were delicious and the best part was the AMAZING buttermilk biscuit underneath. I seriously could have ordered a dozen of those biscuits alone for breakfast. Along with the delicious jam they put on the table- I ate until I could eat no more. Another great point about the service too- even though they were busy the waitress did not rush us even when we ordered another round of drinks after our meal. I loved it here and will definitely come back next time I'm on the lower east side!!!!!
