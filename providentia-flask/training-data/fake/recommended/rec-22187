I would come back here to drink but I was not impressed by the food. + 1 star automatically for having Hitachino for $8, my fav beer ever that is super hard to find and is $11 at Cask Republic. The selection for beers on tap was pretty good as well. We ordered the hummus plate, the frites with the chipotle sauce, and the cubano sliders. The best app was the hummus plate, but they give you WAY more than you want to eat and way more than can fit on the 8 slices of pita, how about you guys do not overfill the plate and charge less instead of making a big waste as that stuff has to all be eaten fresh! The roasted eggplant and cucumber/tomato mixture on there to add to the pita bread wasn't bad either. The cubano sliders which I was really excited for were a major disappointment. My first bite was actually magical because I got just the right amount of everything but after that it was disappointing. Too much bun, and then when I would get a whole piece of pork it was so spicy I couldn't taste anything else. Plus they give you 3 sliders for 10 bucks, It should be 4 at least at that price. The frites which they are known for didn't really excite me either, and I love anything made with potatoes. It just tasted like the homefries my grandmother would make for breakfast with leftover restaurant french fries from the day before. Super crispy, and the chipotle sauce was nothing special as well. They saved themselves from a 2 star review by having hitachino but I don't think I will be eating here again.
