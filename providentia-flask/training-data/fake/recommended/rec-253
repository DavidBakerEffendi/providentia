just had lunch - one of the pre-fixe lunch specials - $12.50 for the 2nd lunch combo - salmon sashimi, rice, chawanmushi  - egg custard w seafood, miso soup, shrimp tempura - all super fresh and very very tasty!  I can't wait to go back! food came out fast, they were pretty packed with a line waiting however we took up the two bar seats - great deal, value, perfectly satisfying! also, i must add, very friendly and courteous service.
