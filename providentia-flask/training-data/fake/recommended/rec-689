been there done that. will never do it again. you have to stand in one line for a sandwich then stand in another for fries and drink. the sandwich was flat. hardly any meat. no seasoning. mostly bread. the worst steak and cheese ever. i would say subway or the guys in the mall Â are better. Philly home of the cheese steak or not? bring cash they don't accept credit.
