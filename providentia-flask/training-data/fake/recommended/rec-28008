Bland food and rude service. Having resided in Lousy-anna for a few full moons I indulged and immersed my self in amazing cuisine options that only they could create, Not an expert in any way,I longed for some Crayfish from a bucket and some southern beer. The food Gods answered my prayers. I frequent restaurants that attempt to imitate complex recipes from a far, Crayfish mac and cheese..... The food is mediocre and slightly over priced. The specials written on the walls by the wait staffs children on construction paper is a nice unique touch. The staff is somewhat rude and snotty in that trustufarian hipster NY Â transplant skinny jeans boots in the summer with colorful scarf biking Williamsburgh vibe. The bar keeps I have experience will cut you off if you hiccup but increase in the ability to ignore once you have decided you need a glass of water to cure my ailment that obviously shows a sign of a massive capernoited state. Last time I checked a hiccup is not a sign of being "white girl wasted". To be honest your better off going to Popeyes for "authentic" Louisiana food. GO, LSU TIGERS!!!
