I lived in NY my whole life and finally got to try Difara's!  The old man who makes all the pizzas is adorable, but the wait aint so cute.  I guess that's what adds to the unique experience.  I went on a Saturday night around 7pm or so and it wasn't too crowded.  It took less than 10 minutes to get our order in, but it was about an hour wait to actually get the pizza.  Again that's because there is only one person making the pizza. The downside is the remote area of BK this place is located in.  If it wasn't for the all the hype I would have no reason to trek out here.  Basically everything was closed aside from a Walgreens across the street.  We had an hour wait so we just walked around the neighborhood, which didn't have much to see.  Eventually we ended up at Walgreens to kill some time. Now to the important part...the pizzas!  We ordered the classic and another pizza with cherry tomatoes and basil. If you're a fan of thin crust, this will hit the spot.  It's a bit pricey compared to other pizzas (I think the classic was $32) but the TLC that goes into each pizza makes it worth it.  Definitely a must try if you're visiting or a native NYer like myself.
