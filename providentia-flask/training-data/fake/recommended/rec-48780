Sorry there is nothing Greek about this place.  We went for a light dinner and the food was, well, gross.  I mean if you are a Greek Restaurant you should at least get the Tzatziki right.  We ordered that and it was tiny portion, tasted like mayo and was served with chips.  Chips??!!!  I also ordered some pasta dish and it was way too heavy.  My husband ordered some soup and it was OK.  The salad was cheap lettuce and olives.  Maybe their meat dishes are better but certainly the veggie ones are terrible.  Two stars are only for the good service.
