Becco is my go-to theater district spot. It's fairly reliable to get a reservation as long as you call a day or two in advance and they have something for everyone. The $25 bottles of wine are a great deal. I've discovered some great wines that I otherwise wouldn't have ordered. The all you can eat pasta is a real crowd-pleaser. They always have three different types of pasta and the servers come around with pans of each one every few minutes offering you more. It also comes with either a great Cesar salad or antipasti appetizer. Only issue is that it attracts some loud out-of-towners, but that's to be expected in this neck of the woods. If you're seeing a show, this is a great spot!
