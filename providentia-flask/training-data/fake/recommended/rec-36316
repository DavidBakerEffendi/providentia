Okay, so we've all heard how fantastic the pizza is here... Its story time kids! We arrive around 1pm on a sunny Friday afternoon and wait in line for the obligatory one hour or so before ordering 5 large pizzas, probably enough to feed two decent-sized families.  Since it was the first time visiting this glorious place for a few of us, we got to sample an assortment of toppings, including the delicious margherita. We decide to park ourselves on the benches with the panoramic views of the New York City skyline across the Hudson, and you just couldn't ask for a better day to do this. Now, laying out 5 large pizzas on a bench within viewing distance of the ginormous line outside of Grimaldi's is not exactly the ideal position to be in as the caretaker of those pizzas.  Yes, you can definitely see the hunger and anticipation in those eyes; its almost a little frightening. It wasn't long before we were approached by a group of girls looking for a slice and my buddy (who was unanimously elected as pizza caretaker by the way - democracy is a beautiful thing) was then put in the position to figure out exactly how many slices and for how much we would be willing to give them up for. While he was busy making the necessary calculations, I was busy coming up with a real business plan of setting up a booth and doing this for real, reselling Grimaldi's, down the block, by the slice. It probably wouldn't work, but good pizza and good times anyway!
