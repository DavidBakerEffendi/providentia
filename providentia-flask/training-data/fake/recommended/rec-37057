Okay, first trick to this place for dinner is to come at around 5:30pm to beat the lines. My 2 friends and I were seated immediately with very little wait. Seeing other reviews, I spotted secret off-menu items, including one exquisite 5-spice ground DUCK-burger. My friends and I split a basket of truffle fries with 3 different sauces. For me, I'm a huge fan of duck so I was very please to sink my teeth into this one. Server was excellent in making recommendations, and the atmosphere is great to take anyone on a date or special occasion.
