I love this place! Gluten free pasta to Gluten free dessert, It was so delicious. They also have organic wine! There is plenty to choose from for regular pasta lovers too. It is great to have your waitress ask if you are allergy sensitive or would like your food gluten free. Super cute place for group, family or date. Love Love Love I can't wait to go back. It is a little pricey but so worth it.
