On a cold night, I decided to eat in. So I looked on Yelp and found this place that had some good reviews.  Which at this point I think they wrote themselves. So be warned, the positive reviews here are bogus. I was told that my order would take 45 minute to deliver.  At 50 minutes, I called and asked where my order was.  I was told they forgot about my order and it was going into the kitchen now. 1 hour and 45 minutes later my order arrived.  No discount. No excuse. Just here is your order.  I was so hungry that I dug in.  But it turns out that the food is worse than the service. Do not eat, or order from this place, if you like food. Don't believe the good reviews.  I am betting they were written by the restaurant and the employees. This place is Terrible.
