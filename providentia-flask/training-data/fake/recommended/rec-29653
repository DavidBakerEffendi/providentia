I figured this place would be really good and authentic since almost every person in the restaurant was Korean.  I ended up getting the $7.99/pound buffet and everything was pretty good, but it was not the best Korean food I have ever had.  They did have a nice selection of beer and sake, which was very reasonably priced.
