Located in a convenient spot in midtown and as a result is quite busy during rush time, you will find Comme Ci Comme Ca.  The paint job on the truck is very cool and it was nice to see the man in the flesh, who is painted in cartoon form, inside his truck, helping cook and operate the business.   They have a few different sandwiches, as well as hummus plates with choices of meats.  And a few different sauces to cater to different palates.  All of the food smelled nice while waiting in line.  Which moved a bit slow and then a girl who ordered after me, somehow got her food 5 minutes before me.  Not a big deal, just slightly annoying.  What kept me from giving 4 stars for what was a fantastic tasting sandwich, is that the portion was kind of small.  Their really was not too much meat and veggies inside it.  I was still kinda hungry after eating it.  Perhaps, I will stop back a different time, fork over a few extra dollars for the "grand platter" or whatever their combo with couscous is referred to.
