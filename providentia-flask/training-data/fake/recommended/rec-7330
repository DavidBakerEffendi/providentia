Amazing first dinner to kick off our visit to NYC this summer.  We started off with a scallop appetizer special that was perfectly cooked.  My wife had the Ravioli di Ricotta con Burro e Salvia with Butter and Sage, a handful of gigantic ravioli.  I had the Lasagna which had a bechamel and a meat sauce.  By far the best lasagna I have ever had.  The space was tiny, as many NYC restaurants are, but despite it being packed when we arrived, we didn't have to wait for a table.  Both the host and the wait staff were great.  I would highly recommend Bianca.  This was one of the tastiest and most reasonable dinners we had the whole week.  Great little spot on Bleecker Street.
