Umami. It can be described as a pleasant brothy, meaty, savory taste with a long lasting, mouthwatering and coating sensation over the tongue. This definition is right on the money when talking about The Truffle Burger. With house made truffle cheese and truffle sauce, the only thing missing from this burger is your mouth wrapped around it. Be warned though, the flavor is very one note and you'll need something sweet or sour to cut through it. Soda and or dessert recommended.
