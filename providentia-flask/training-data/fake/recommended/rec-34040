My new fave restaurant next to the SpottedPig/Breslin.  I love all these little piggies.  This is Italian restaurant is packed with french influences.   And WOW.  The flavors were incredible.  My preference is small bites with big flavors.  This place is out of control.   Undoubtedly, the best lamb chops in this world.  Next to the Guanciale (cheeks) pasta with a yummy red sauce. Everything was so good! The restaurant exudes a hip environment, of course, at the Gramercy Hotel- very New York scene... loud but not unbearable, service was really good.  Lots of expensive wines by the glass.  The Red Angel wine is beautiful. Seriously......Go. Now.
