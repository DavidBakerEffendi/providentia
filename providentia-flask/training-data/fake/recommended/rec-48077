painfully adorable inside, with a real fireplace in winter! i quite love the atmosphere. good music. pretty wallpaper. lots of thought went into the details. but, alas, i am not a coffee snob and i find the coffee nearly undrinkable! terribly watery and somehow slightly burnt at the same time. likewise, croissants coated with a heavy honey glaze that is not to my liking, and the egg croissant always tastes a bit like it's been sitting around for some time. if they could just get some reasonable coffee and maybe some bagels, i would be there everyday.
