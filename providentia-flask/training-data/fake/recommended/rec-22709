The meatball and spicy Italian sausage combo was amazing. Authentic Italian flavors , perfect rolls - everything was right on the money. They are very friendly and eager to customize your order just the way you like it. Also the building has been updated, so it is appealing and inviting. I give Maple a slight edge over Franklin or Corner due to the outstanding food, friendly staff and pleasant atmosphere.
