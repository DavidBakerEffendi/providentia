Can you eat Lamb? Or Just try it. Please must try it. You don't have to go to Middle-east, pakistan or any fancy restaurant. If you have $6 and you can be patient to wait till 7pm and willing to wait (if there is a big line) for your chance to get one of the BEST lamb-dish EVER, you SHOULD/MUST try this awesome food. Portion is HUGE and you get meat, salad, rice and flat-bread. Secret white sauce and spicy sauce. Must try white sauce (if you can't handle spicy sauce). Seriously too die for... You would want to just settle in NY just to eat this everyday. Please forget about hot-dog, hamburger or sushi for one night and try this. This will make your day!! PS: Did I say that I am not a big fan of meat and especially middle-eastern food and pretty picky-eater? :) It's seriously good.
