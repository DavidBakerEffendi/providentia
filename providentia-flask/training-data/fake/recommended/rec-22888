Happened upon here while running errands in the LES and noticing it was a new establishment had the curiousity to try it out. They do "gourmet wraps" with organic, natural ingredients.  I had the Howling ($8 )which was marinated chicken with pickle, mixed greens, feta, and yogurt sauce mixed in wrapped in a date and pumpkin seed wrap. I sorta agree with a previous poster. The marinade on the chicken was a bit overpowering and couldn't taste anything else (i.e. cheese, wrap, sauce). Fairly decent sized. Got the Wolf attack on the side ($6) which are basicaly tots covered in their version of a chili-cheese sauce. Apparently you can get the Attack inside a wrap too but decided against it as i thought it might be a weird combination. With a can of soda my meal came out to just north of $17 so I'd say its not particularly a budget lunch, but because of my order of tots I probably had more food  than I needed. The wraps range from $6 to $9 and fries/tots are about $4. Small place, but has a few stools and a swing setup. Also have a few beers by the bottle. I came on a Friday afternoon and there were two workers behind the counter so it wasn't as slow as some have experienced. But you will definitely wait about 5 minutes at least as they do take their time in getting your wrap prepared.
