So so food Small place but excellent service . Getting parking spot is sometimes pain Especially on week ends. I heard lot of good reviews about mango lassi. But I wasn't so impressed with one And We ordered paneer tikka which was not so good either. I would not recommend. I would avoid visiting this place again.
