Wish I had gone here for coffee and cake instead of breakfast. I had the Sabarsky Fruhstuck and it was just OK, not worth the price. Wasn't impressed with the breads or jams. Came with ham and soft-boiled eggs but no cheese. Coffee was nice and I liked the decor and ambiance except for the flies. Service was a bit cold. Come after you visit the museum, not before.
