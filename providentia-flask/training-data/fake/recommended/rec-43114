We went there for breakfast today. We loved it!!!  It was clean, food was delicious and atmosphere was comfortable.  We did not have any small kids with us but there was a large presence of kids but you did not hear them at all. There was a small  playroom that kept the kids contained while the parents enjoyed their meal. I will definately return for lunch or dinner.  I was very surprised to see how much I enjoyed this place as I normally like my usual places and this is far out of my way but wanted to try it.
