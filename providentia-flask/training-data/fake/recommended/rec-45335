Went to a food event that they participated in yesterday and they served one of the best dishes of the event. Delectable perfectly cooked pulled pork sliders.  Worried that the new location is not as good as the original?  Worry not.  These guys know their stuff.  It was served with an absolutely perfect BBQ sauce and even opened a bottle of habanero sauce to throw on for good measure.  Good call using a potato roll to help soak up all that flavor.  Awesome.
