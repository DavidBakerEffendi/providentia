It was my first cheesesteak experience in philly. to be honest I was expecting the mto be somewhat greasy and heavy, but they were not at all. so yummy and light, unbelievable. We ordered a steak hoagie and cheesesteak, no cheese on the hoagie. it was quick too. sat outside and enjoyed the sun. very nice environment and neighborhood. definitely go there again.
