Had lunch here after the marathon. Very authentic food really good. We had dumplings and the pigs ears for appetizers both were delicious. We had seafood noodles and seafood stir fry noodles. As you would expect the noodles were plentiful and great. No credit cards here but they have an ATM by front door. Not a fancy place but real Chinese food at reasonable prices. Three people $50
