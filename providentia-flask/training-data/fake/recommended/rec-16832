The concept is simple (standard sandwich menu items, that's it: brisket, pork, roast beef are three classic choices) and yet I would never get bored eating repetitively at Dinic's.  These sandwiches could be the standard by which all sandwiches are graded.  The cheese is top of the line sharp and really accentuates the sandwich taste.  I'll have sharp provolone roast pork and greens made to perfection any day! It's simply delicious and, well worth a wait in line to sit there and eat your sandwich in front of the counter.  They have top notch quality all around here!  Props for the free WIFI at Reading Terminal, too.
