I remember when this restaurant opened when I used to live in the neighborhood. Everyone thought they were CRAZY to open a restaurant on "empty" 10th Avenue. HAHA- well the Highline opened, and the rest is history. Cookshop was also an early adopter of the farm-to-table approach, and their food has always been fresh and tasty. Always busy, but service is good, and they honor their reservations (no "feel free to have a drink at the bar" for 20plus minutes-ugh). I had lunch at Cookshop recently, and glad to see that it is still as good as ever. A nice neighborhood joint. The ONLY problem I have is that they have the most uncomfortable dining chairs in the city.
