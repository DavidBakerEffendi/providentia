If you are familiar with the old Rudy's, the new version is a VASTLY different experience in almost every way.  Rudy's seems to have been re imagined in the style of a Beligian beer bar, with mixed results.  We went on a Friday night and it was very loud and very crowded.  There seemed to be a back area with tables that may have been a little more dining friendly, but the decibel level was so high in the front that I had difficulty talking with the rest of my party.   The beer selection was excellent, many Beligian offerings and other delicious craft beers.  The menu contained some interesting selections, but seemed more like a "bar" menu than a true restaurant menu.  The frites were very good, but the mussels were a bit overdone and the broth was not as flavorful as I've had in other establishments.  The biggest problem with Rudy's was the service.  Our server was frustratingly inattentive and it took a very long time for us to get drinks, entrees and even our bill. If you are looking for a delicious Belgian beer, then this is your spot.  If you want to have a night out with friends and enjoy a good dinner, you may want to look elsewhere.  Overall, I did not have a bad experience at Rudy's, but with so many other options available in downtown New Haven, I don't plan on rushing back any time soon.
