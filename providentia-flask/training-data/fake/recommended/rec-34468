Food, service, atmosphere, all great. Very happy to add Bustan to the regular rotation. We started with the mazettim and probably overdid it by choosing five spreads: hummus, babaganoush, tzaziki, tahini, and spicy feta. These things are so ubiquitous that it's easy to forget how amazing they can be when done well, with fresh ingredients. Bustan really gets them right, and makes it far too easy to fill up on appetizers. Resist, and maybe go for three instead of five. For mains, I went with the gnocchi with porcini sauce and truffle oil. Delicious, a perfect amount of shaved parmesan, not too heavy on the truffle, and really fluffy gnocchi. I might have wanted a larger portion if I hadn't filled up on the apps, but overall was really happy with the dish. The others in my party had the roast chicken and chicken merguez, and the lamp kibbe served in a terracotta bowl inside a huge pita. I didn't taste either, but they smelled wonderful, and dishes were rather clean by the end of the meal.
