Great place for drinks, good place for apps, especially the bruschetta, but not so much for main dishes. Probably not the best place to order fish but even the pasta we ordered was just ok. Very cool decor and very lively overall vibe. I'd stop in for a drink next time I'm down on Bleecker, but won't go again for dinner.
