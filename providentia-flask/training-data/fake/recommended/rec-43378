Great place to have a beer. The bar tenders know what they are talking about and can guide you thru an extensive list (and some not on the list) of Belgian beers. Food is very good but I tend to save my $$ for the drinks when I'm in the city. Â Is a must stop when I'm drinking in NYC. Also a big fan of the original location on 43rd St. Everything I said earlier rings true for both locations. Long story short, go there. You'll be happy you did.
