Food didn't impress me at all. Very bland. I make better ceviche than this place. Almost no attention to service. Gentleman pouring us water paid more attention than our "ultra cool" server. He at one point dropped a fork in my girlfriends lap and said " it's safe". Riiiiiiiight. Nice tequila menu.
