Outstanding!  Fills a great void in Murray Hill.  The chicken is moist and tasty.  I got all White, and it was two nice-sized breasts.  For one of the sides, I had excellent ratatouille -  again, hard to find.  It's primarily take out, but there's one very large table that's comfortable for singles and couples to share.  Friendly service, plentiful handi wipes, no alcohol.
