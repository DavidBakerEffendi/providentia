Although a little far of a walk out to 11th, overall a very good experience, went here on a weekend to try their wings, and they were having a pitcher special, we got a pitcher of rolling rock for $7-9 and their wings menu is 20 wings for $12! they have lots of good flavors, (too bad our bartender charged us for two $8 orders of ten wings instead of charging us $12 for one 10 piece order :/ lame) the wings were pretty awesome and the overall prices were pretty cheap. a good sports bar thats not too crowded during the day, hopefully this place stays cool the next time around..
