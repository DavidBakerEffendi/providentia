This is has an iconic restaurant for me since high school, and I would look forward to eating here upon crossing the Hudson. New York meant only one thing back then: indulgence. This place has withstood the test of time and stays consistent. It's great to have such an excellent entry point into Indian cuisine. I recommend the lamb and paneer options, and always ask for extra chili. Green chutney also proves to be a great companion to whichever roll you decide to get. I've never been here in the daytime, but I never had to deal with a major line in the night hours. Then again, I am patient when kati rolls are in store :)
