Really, surprisingly, not a fan of the food here. I had the friend steak (don't know why, not my usual, just went out on a whim) and it really was the toughest piece of meat I've had. The cocktails were good and service was spot on and friendly. But my friend's fish meal was just OK as well... was disappointed by the lack of tasty southern flavors...
