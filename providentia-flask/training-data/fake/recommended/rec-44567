I'm a little bit thrilled that there is such a great little brunch spot at about an 8 block walking distance from me... It's definitely small, hence the name of the place, Nook, barely holding even 30 people if that.  The host, who was also the waiter and the server, was fabulous.  Considering he was pretty much on his own, he did a good job minimizing any unnecessary lag time.  Our wait time on a Sunday afternoon at 12pm was no more than 15 min. The brunch menu was simple, but seriously, everything looked really good.  Started with the Fresh Farmer's Cheese with raspberry comfiture on baguette, which was yum.  I did wish the cheese was a bit stronger but only because the raspberry was so flavorful.  I ordered the bacon, chives, and tomatoes egg scrambles which was tasty and not overcooked.  The "house home fries" was basically something like really good mash potatoes.  The light salad on the side was a nice touch.  My partner in crime had the eggs benedict which he enjoyed, and from the bite I tasted, it indeed was good but not overly amazing.   I gave this place a 4 because it definitely succeeds for what it is and what it doesn't pretend to be.  I hate brunch places that think they can rip you off for admittedly good food by charging you fine dining prices.  Cozy, unpretentious, and fun for people watching (we sat by the "window" or lack there of) I will definitely come back for brunch to try more of their menu.
