I was charmed by the atmosphere here and the owner (I believe) was friendly and accommodating I was a bit disappointed in the food. I had the chicken biscuit sandwich and I found the chicken very salty and greasy and had an unpleasant hot sauce flavor to it. We also had beignets that the owner admitted the dough had not thawed properly so he did not charge us for them and they were ok. Overall, the experience is ok as my hubby and our friend enjoyed their food, I just found the food to be a let down but would try again, maybe it was an off day for the chicken?
