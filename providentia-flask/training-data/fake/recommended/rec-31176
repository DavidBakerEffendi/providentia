An absolutely picturesque place to visit after a Broadway show. My boyfriend and I saw Pippin and after ventured to Joe Allen's at the suggestion of Yelp reviews. Its this quiet not-too-descript place, tucked away keeping it more quiet and intimate. The interior stunning. A little dim however its odds and ends collection of curiosities that line the walls glimmer nicely in the lower light. The waitstaff were knowledgeable and were able to explain some of the ingredients in dishes we were interested in. The peel and eat shrimp were succulent and fresh, the dip served with them flavorful. Chris ordered the Steak Tartare with a Malbec wine. The dish WAS TO DIE FOR. It was perfectly seasoned and not too dry or pasty. I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo Pesto with a Magic Hat beer. The Alfredo pesto was rich and zesty with sweet, whole shrimp scattered about the dish. We finished our meal with an order of the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with vanilla ice cream. It was the perfect goodnight kiss of flavor to conclude a delightful meal that was just as entertaining to our palettes as the prior show was to our eyes. Can not recommend highly enough.
