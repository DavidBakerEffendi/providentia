My boyfriend and I really like this place. It's not too far, so we can walk. The owners are friendly. The food is really good. The sauces are the real gems though. Use them on everything! The chicken is moist, and the mac is cheesy. I've had 1 wafco, but i'll wait to try them all before commenting. On our lazy days, they deliver quickly.
