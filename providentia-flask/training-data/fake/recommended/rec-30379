GREAT brunch spot but make reservations early as this place was hoppin' on Sunday afternoon!  We arrived early and had to wait, which was fine...after all, this is New York and most restaurants are very small. The menu was plentiful with a great mix of traditional "breakfast" menus and brunch options.  Our food was absolutely amazing and the service was great too.  I chose to eat here based on Yelp Reviews and was not lead astray! Give this place a try!  It's worth it!
