This place is great! I've been coming here since I was young and besides the slight price inflation, everything has stayed the same. Go for the wonton noodle soup and you will find no where else that does it the same. If you're about the "atmosphere" or anything posh along the lines of that then this is not the place for you. Authentic Chinese food and place.
