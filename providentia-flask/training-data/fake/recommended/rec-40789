I've been here a total of three times and each time it's gotten better. I was hesitant to try this place out but glad I adhered to the many rave reviews from others. I've only been to a handful of Mexican restaurants and this one takes the cake on authenticity and price! SO many options on the menu I was almost overwhelmed. Â The flautas were the most intricate tasting I've ever had. i think i'll be going back again and again just for those. The first time i went there i took out, it is a wait! I suggest taking a seat and eating in here. The wait time is cut in half and plus chips and salsa for the wait. Great food and an awesome price is the bottom line here. If they had a liquor license this place would be a goldmine. Two people including drinks for under twenty bucks?! can't beat it!
