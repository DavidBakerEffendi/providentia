We brought my son & wife, daughter & husband and our 2 young grandchildren to Elaines for brunch last Sunday to celebrate the birthdays of 2 of them.  The food was good, the atmosphere is great for children & the staff is very cordial & accomodating.  The price is very reasonable for what you get.   My only negative is that there was a large group there on the top floor who made the lines for hot food very long.  Since there is only 1 employee at the hot food table to make waffles & fresh omelettes & slice ham & roast beef, the wait on line was too long.  I'm sure they knew this group was coming & wish that they would put another staff member on the hot food table to get guests through quickly.
