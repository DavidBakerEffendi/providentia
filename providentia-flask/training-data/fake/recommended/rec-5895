A delightful and thoroughly delicious experience!  We were dining with a group of 15 but it still felt like an intimate dinner.   The atmosphere is cozy but open, and the menu is wonderful.  We tried the mussels and pan seared scallops as appetizers and the Berkshire pork chop for the entree - everything was cooked to perfection!   A great bottle of wine and congenial company made the evening!
