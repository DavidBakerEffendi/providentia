I am so relieved to find a much better pancake spot than IHOP. I really can't stand that place. I had an apple crepe with oj and tried the chocolate chip pancakes w bananas. Everything was good. I've had better crepes but I was okay with these b/c of the cheese filling & flavor. OJ was freshly squeezed but a little warm for my liking. I just added some ice to solve that problem & it was excellent. I mean you can't go wrong with fresh juice. If your in this area forget IHOP & try OPH!
