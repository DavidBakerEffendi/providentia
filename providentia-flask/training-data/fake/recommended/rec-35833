We were worried to come here because of the hype but this place is rockin!  Make sure you have a reservation cause it gets really packed.   Everything we had was perfect!  The brussel sprout crudo sounds crazy but was so good, we couldn't stop eating it.  Cruncy with parmesan flavor. The salumi plate was very fresh.   For entrees, we had the cauliflower pasta- delicious!  and the Stefado-Beef stew.  Tender and cooked to perfection.  It just fell apart!  The lamb with root mash was very satisfying and flavorful.  Wait, who's that sitting next to us at the next table?  Charles Phan of Slanted Door  (SF) with his family!   It was really cool to see someone else from the bay area here! Jonathan Waxman was working and when i purchased his cookbook, he came over to sign it!     We will be back on our next New York visit!
