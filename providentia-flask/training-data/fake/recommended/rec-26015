Not impressed. I got a combo platter with hummus, eggplant, tzatziki, and falafel. It was a good amount of food for ten bucks, but none of it was great and some of it was pretty awful. The veggies were good, if a bit salty. I usually need to put salt on everything, so it's always a little surprising when something strikes me as too salty. The tzatziki was ok, but had a weird taste. It was the most acidic I've ever had, and tastes almost pickled. Maybe it had been sitting in the fridge too long? I don't know. The falafel was good, and I bet the falafel sandwich is the best thing on the menu, but it wasn't the best I've ever had. Moist and crunchy, tastes fine, but nothing amazing. The hummus is what really got me. It tasted bland, like some kind of gloppy gruel, and had the aftertaste of eggs. Couldn't eat more than a couple bites of it.
