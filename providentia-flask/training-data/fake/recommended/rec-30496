Never been here late, but my lunch was p-retty sweet. I went with my parents when I was showing them the tourist Philly - and it totally took them back to the mid 60's - kind of hilarious. Turkey burger and bloody mary's - soo yumm. I also tried my Dad's tomato soup+grilled cheese - also delicious. Comfort food and comfy place - like like like.
