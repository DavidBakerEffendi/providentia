Excellent food; excellent service.  Fish, fish, fish -- if you do not life fish, go someplace else. BYOB!!! No reservations -- we came at 5 pm on Saturday, and IT WAS CROWDED; we walked by at 10 pm and there was room -- in between 5 pm and 10 pm it was hell if you did not have a seat already (we did).  Definitely worth coming here for a good fish dinner.  Street parking -- good luck!
