Great beer selection, nice atmosphere. The music is not too loud so you can actually hold a conversation. Have tried the fried calamari and a shrimp sandwich with fries. The fries were amazing, especially with the sauces. I cannot wait to go back for more fries. The calamari was good too, sandwich was okay. I actually day dream about the fries sometimes.
