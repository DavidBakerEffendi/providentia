Excellent Thai food.  The tom kha gai comes in a decent size bowl with lots of spices, mushrooms, onions, chicken, and cilantro.  The pad thai has a good balance of flavors, though not too over powering.  The red peanut sauce with chicken is surprisingly spicy, has lemongrass, and is mixed with broccoli.  The chicken satay was tasty with good peanut sauce.  The lunch specials are a great value.  When you see the exterior and interior, chandeliers and all, you're left wondering if you stepped off of Park Ave or off 9th Ave.
