EATALY is amazing!   They have just about anything you could ask for in one place.  My only complaint is that no matter what time of day it is super crowded.  I think lunch time is the worst, closely followed by the after dinner hour. The market part is amazing, they have decent prices on produce and a huge selection of Italian dry goods.  If you are looking for specialty Italian products you are bound to find it here.  I love the bakery here, they have a large selection of specialty breads, all at great prices.  I got a baguette for about 3$ and the sundried tomato went for a bout $5.  For homemade, fresh bread this is such a bargin. Eataly does have food vendors, which I did not try because they were crowded and I had a time budget.  However, I heard from friends they are great.  I recommend coming here to anyone within the NYC area, or out of town.
