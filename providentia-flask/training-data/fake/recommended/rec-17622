I'm here pretty much every week for the house salad which is consistently delicious and a great size and has fennel in it. I'd love to get other things since I think the menu at Raymond's is pretty much perfect, but the house salad always makes me happy. Raymond's is busy every day of the week, but I've never had to wait too long for a table. I love the retro decor. It's well done and not over the top - from the paper menus with the logo stamped on, to the tiled walls and colored glass bottles. They do have specials, but I just think the lunch menu has something for everyone: soups, burgers, salads, all day brunch. It doesn't change, but it doesn't need to since it's more of a regulars kindof place. Â It's a great place for comfort food (the eggs and cheddar grits are amazing), but they have plenty of healthy options as well (like the house salad). And the mexican hot chocolate is amazing! I'm completely satisfied every time I go to Raymond's. My favorite place for lunch in Montclair. The service can be less-than-attentive and they should work on simple things like filling up water glasses and coffee cups.
