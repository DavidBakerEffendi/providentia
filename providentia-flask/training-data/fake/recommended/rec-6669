Amazing meatballs. I repeat. Amazing meatballs. Juicy, flavorful, melt in your mouth, fragrant, perfect wonderful meatballs. Get the meatballs. Also, the saganaki. A mouth watering MUST HAVE for cheese lovers. It is the only way that saganaki is meant to be done, just like they do in Greece. Baked, melted, wonderful authentic saganaki without the fried outer crust as they will sometimes do in less-authentic places. Garides Ouzo (shrimp in ouzo tomato cream sauce) appetizer is also extremely delicious. The Tzatiziki is done right.  Cool, thick greek yogurt and flavored nicely. It comes with fresh warm pita bread and makes yet another great starter. Pylos has many nice greek wines to choose from and the staff is very helpful in assisting with this. If you have never had Retsina, now is your opportunity to give this unique pine-scented white wine a try. Of my many trips to Pylos, I have been so enamored with the appetizers that I have rarely made it to any main dishes. The 2 times that I did try an entree, they were both tasty but I prefer to make a meal of the many delectable appetizers to choose from.  Couple this with the fresh horiatiki salad and you'll go home full and happy.
