The most amazing brunch I have had to date. Don't underestimate this quant storefront, they are packing bold and intelligent dishes behind these doors! YUM! Satisfying portions, bounty of flavors blended beautifully regardless of what dish you order. Classic NyC flavors and style. Homey feel with an upscale twist. Well balanced earthy and new ideas. The standouts were the goat cheese and polenta poaches eggs and the challah French toast. These two dishes showed the strengths of the chef and the level of care taken in putting together each dish. Our server Gabriel was phenomenal, he made us feel welcome, at home, not rushed and was happy to go over everything with us. He really made our meal!! We will definitely be back, thank you guys!!
