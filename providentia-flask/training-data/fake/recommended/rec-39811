Beer and burgers.  The wait could be awhile, but luckily my friends and I were seated within 10 minutes.  So we ordered a burger and beer.  The burger patties are 2 inches thick and quite tasty.  The service is not great, but decent.  Even though I'll wait 45 minutes for a Shack burger, I wouldn't wait that long for a burger from Corner Bistro.
