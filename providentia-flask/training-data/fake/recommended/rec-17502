Were it not for the awesome company we enjoyed our dinner with, this would have been a total loss. The atmosphere attempts "rustic", but leans more towards "unfinished". A little too dark for my taste (which thanks to my father, always makes me believe they are trying to hide some details they'd prefer you didn't see...paranoid, I know...thanks Dad!). The food was mediocre for the price. We started with a flatbread pizza that could have just been called "bread". The sauce that did adorn the appetizer was as salty as they come. My meal consisted of the Linguini Nere. A fra diovolo dish that was drowning in an overabundance of salty and over-spicy flavors. I expect a kick, naturally, but this was too much. The dish also has shrimp, and I question the freshness of the shrimp in my dish that night. It was certainly not turned...but it seemed like it had surely been frozen a while. My fiance got Baby Arugala Salad and Chicken in a Balsamic Demi-Glaze. She too had complaints of THAT being very salty as well. A salad....was....TOO SALTY!?!!?! While my "darkness in a restaurant" paranoia is one thing...over-salting the food DOES show me that there is something they are hiding in their quality. Completely unimpressed overall, and further eyebrow raising came from us over their "cash only on specials" policy. Very strange, shady, and off-putting. We expect not to return.
