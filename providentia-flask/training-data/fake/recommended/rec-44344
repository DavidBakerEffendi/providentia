This place is the absolute Worst! I would never eat here again! The manager/Server was the absolute worst. He was Rude, Pretentious, and insulting. He was annoyed at asking questions about the menu. The food was awful! It's a wannabe Italian restaurant. The Pizza has no flavor, the homemade crust was bland and the sauce just wasn't good. The pasta was not very flavorful. Â The service was bad. We ordered a side of brussels sprouts and they brought us a brussels pizza and the side as well as over ordered other food. We spent a lot of money for poor service and mediocre food. We were pushed out by an incoming birthday party and I would NEVER eat here again. I would go to the one of Many other AWESOME ITALIAN RESTAURANTS in NY. BEWARE. STAY AWAY. This is a bar and not a restaurant.
