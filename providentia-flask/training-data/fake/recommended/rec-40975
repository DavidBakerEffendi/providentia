I went here for brunch after Martha's one block away wasn't quite brunchy enough for my friend. It was great. We were seated within ten minutes of arrival around noon on a Sunday. The place is bright with daylight and a fair amount of booths for bigger parties. The menu is a standard brunch menu, with a few eggs benedicts to choose from, a standard two eggs any style and custom omelettes. I wanted to try the tomato egg bake but decided to go for a green salad instead of the toast and potatoes for my two egg combo and it was delicious! Fresh arugula and a creamy vinaigrette. The pork sausage links were on point as well. My friend got the eggs benedict and loved it. It's served over home fries and they are made with red and yellow peppers in the hash which is a nice touch! The coffee flowed freely and they have decaf coffee! I love this place. Solid, classic brunch spot.
