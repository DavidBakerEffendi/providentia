Came here on a double date. Place is good. but don't order crawfish unless you know what you're getting yourself into. A lot of work for very little food. The shrimps were solid and the boil sauce that covers everything is really good. The Boil is a cool experience and something different to do for dinner, but I won't be rushing to come back. I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot, but I would also be just fine having that as my first and last trip there.
