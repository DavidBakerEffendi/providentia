Pomme Frites is amazing. There really is no other word to describe it. The poutine reminds me of the summers I would spend in Montreal. The garlic mayo dipping sauce is garlicy and mayo-y and just plain tasty. The pesto mayo is also rather tasty with its pesto-y goodness. The best, however -- BEST!!!!! -- dipping sauce is the pomegranate tariyaki (and yes, it is spelled like that on their website). Those thick, perfectly cooked fries won't know what HIT 'EM with the pomegranate tariyaki sauce. It's beyond drool-worthy. Come early (but not really, as I believe it opens at 11am), come often.
