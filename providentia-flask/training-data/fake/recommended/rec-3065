I went there last night with some friends and the food was really really good. Between two friends and myself we sampled and shared three appetizers and three entrees. The serving sizes were fair and the food was all very delicious. In fact, all three of us kept on raving this might be our new favorite spot in the neighborhood since our favorite restaurant has recently closed it's doors (RIP 7A). Also, the drinks were strong which we loved. The only negative was they're a cash only restaurant and really, truly, who carries cash anymore?! I'll definitely be back for more....if/when I find some cash lol
