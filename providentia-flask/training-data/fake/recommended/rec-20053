the happy hour drink selection is NOT for me. both prosecco drinks are way to sweet. Â The other drinks are very strong and looked bad too. The eggplant appetizer didn't taste good. the bread that came with it to dip is very hard. Calamari was good. Nice flavor as well. But overall I didn't like the place and left early.
