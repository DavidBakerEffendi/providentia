So cute, so cool, so low key, yet so hip!!  Perfect little breakfast/brunch spot in Chelsea.  Big menu, lots of options!  Self service place so you enter, order your food, they reserve your table for you by putting a patterned handkerchief on the table.  Such a nice touch.  You get your number, and sit.  Then they'll bring you your food.  But everything else is self serve.  Almost had a having breakfast at someone's home kind of feel.  The food was good! The people were awesome!  Love this place!! Come early though... weekends tend to fill up and then the wait may be longer.  We got here at about 9:30 on a Sat morning and were able to get right in!
