I had been to Pylos for brunch some years ago and remembered the food as good so recently decided to head there with a group of friends for dinner.  Indeed, the food is still good (though in no way remarkable), but the same cannot be said for the service. We were brought the check while we were in the middle of dessert without having asked for it and felt rushed throughout the whole evening.  Worse yet, a week later we discovered that the our card (one of three) was charged twice.  When we called to politely have the matter settled the manager promised to issue a credit for the amount immediately.  10 days later, we received a call from Nicos explaining the he had just (!) found our receipt and apparently one of the other cards was not charged.  To my amazement, he proceeded to say we would only be issued a refund if the restaurant obtained the contact information of the third party not charged originally in order for them to get reimbursed.  Stunned, I have disputed the charge with my credit card company. While this is a place with decent Balkan food, for the price you can definetely skip the below par service and mentality and have similar (or better) experience in many other Mediterrenian joints in the city.
