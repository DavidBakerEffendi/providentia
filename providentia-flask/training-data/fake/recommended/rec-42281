What is most comforting about Momofuku Ssam Bar, and for me what saves it, is that after you've waded through the crowds and placed your order, after you finally dig in and take the first bite, the food is an island of delicious sincerity amidst an ocean of pretension. The enormous hype, the prices, the clientele, the sleek wood-paneling, and the servers' thick-framed glasses all set the ssam bar up for miserable failure (or at the very least, disappointment). But then there's the food. The pork buns are as spectacular as everyone says. The spicy sausage and rice cakes plate is a super spicy, slightly sweet, tangy, crunchy dish I highly recommend. We tried a honeycomb tripe dish served cold with some simple vegetables (celery, peppers, carrots) - really unique and totally accessible for offal. We also sampled the Edwards country ham dish, which gives you about 20 extra-thin slices of succulent ham served with some "Redeye" mayo which is coffee and sriracha-infused mayo. The country ham dishes are perfect for munching on between bites of the more substantial entree-type dishes. I'm not sure how anyone not in the industry would be able to make an informed decision about which of the four ham dishes to pick, so that was a little discouraging. Our server assisted us by contributing: "most people get the Edwards." Sold! I'm definitely going to return, definitely again with adventurous guests, and see if the rest of the menu is as special as the plates I've tried.
