We threw a birthday party here and were treated like family. The meal was almost all shellfish so i couldn't eat most of it, but people said it was good. The one issue is there was just so much food! The place is on a corner and has a bar/waiting area so it can be confusing where to enter. The inside is relatively small, but was big enough for 25 of us to have our own area. The party was had at a very fair price and the food was fast, warm and delicious. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a hearty meal in the area. I also think it's a mob front.
