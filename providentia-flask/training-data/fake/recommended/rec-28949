Positive: Decent price for a filling meal while enjoying the streets of New York, especially in the late hours of the night. Negative: Lost its quality and taste over the past few years. Overall: Great place to go with a large group or with people trying to experience New York. Â But if you want higher quality and taste, try elsewhere. Revisit: Only when family and friends come from out of state.
