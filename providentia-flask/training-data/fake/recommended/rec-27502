I first came here four years ago when a local friend brought our group of friends here after a night of shenanigans. I forgot about this place, until I stumbled upon it during a recent trip back to NYC. I headed to 5th ave, when I passed by a large crowd at the corner of the Hilton hotel, and realized that this was the famous street cart! The chicken halal with the white sauce and spicy red sauce is the prefect combination. I even had a friend ask me to bring some back to SF. Too bad they don't have a cart out here.
