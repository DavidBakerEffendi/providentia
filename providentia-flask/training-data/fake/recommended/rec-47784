Underwhelming. I got a mushroom whiz wit and I took a bite and tasted nothing but the ketchup I had put on top, and not because I had put too much on. When I tried a bite of the meat itself, it was juicy but not at all seasoned. This place might be good to visit to say you've been, but you can get better steaks elsewhere.
