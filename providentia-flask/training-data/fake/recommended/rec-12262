My wife and I have eaten at Little Szechuan many times, making the trek from Princeton which should say something about the quality. We love it here, The food is quite good and comes with generous portions. Their combo menu is a great deal, even at dinner, and they make a killer egg drop soup. The atmosphere is very nice, with nice decor and a pleasant level of conversation. The waiters are very attentive. As native Californians, used to being able to find food late at night, we have really appreciated Little Szechuan's later hours than most area restaurants. I definitely recommend it.
