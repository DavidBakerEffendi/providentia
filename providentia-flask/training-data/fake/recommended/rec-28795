Went there on DEC 15th 2013 with some friends. I had the Ahi Tuna dumplings and the shrimp dry pot. The dumplings were deeee-licious and the dry pot, which I had at a level 3 was flavorful and awesome. It could have been hotter but overall it was very good. My friends had the dry pot also just a different meat inside. I also had the mango-citrus basil lemonade, it. Was. Heaven. deff goin back.
