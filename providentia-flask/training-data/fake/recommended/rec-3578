Probably my favorite spot in Greenpoint / Williamsburg for brunch.  They have the best biscuits and gravy that I have had around here.  Their menu is also loaded with a huge amount of other tasty options. Biscuits and Gravy - A+ Cornbread Bowl - C-  (Wtf it's like 10x smaller than anything else they make...?) Cowboy Burger - A+ Bloody Mary - A Jimmy's was a staple of mine while I lived in Greenpoint and I frequented the place often.  The service was always great, not outstanding but solid, the good was always amazing.  I'm disappointed that I haven't been back here since I left Greenpoint for Astoria.  There are a couple of negatives though, the spot is tiny and there is nearly always a good waiting time to get a spot in the place.  Also because of how small it is the tables are really cramped together sometimes making it a bit uncomfortable unless you get one of the end tables. Thought because of this I have heard some ridiculous conversations and seen some ridiculous things.  One time a guy and girl sat beside me and ate, the girl ordered the veggie plate, took two bites, said it was amazing and that she didn't want it boxed up?! There are some terrible people in this world, it's a shame they even find there way into places like this. 4/5 one of my favorite spots to consistently pig out in all of New York. **They also just opened at a new location where Calyer was located**
