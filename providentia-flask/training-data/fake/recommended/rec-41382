Meh, indeed. I had the clam pie. I think. I ordered it anyway. Got a cheese and garlic pie, with - possibly - tiny bits of clams on there. Â Looked like the kind that came out of a can, pre-chopped for your chowder-making convenience. There was so much garlic, in raw, large chunks, that it was all I could taste. It was all I could taste later that night - through the whiskey. I could still taste it when I got up the next morning. It didn't taste any better then. And I love garlic. The crust was thick and doughy. Soft. Like the place itself. I can't say I'm a huge fan of Franny's, but Franny's has the same prices, and kicks this place's ass up and down the street, leaving it whimpering like the little doughy pies that it serves.
