This place is amazing - the fish is fresh to an unreal degree, the people who run the place are lovely and sweet and and helpful and knowledgeable about everything on the menu, and the atmosphere is simple and refreshing. They have clearly put a lot of thought into the place and it shows. It's not super fast (nor is it 'slow'), but it's charming and tasty and well worth it. No comparison to the back of Pine Tree Grocery (which is fine for Crown Heights sushi, but a sad thing to settle for otherwise) - Silver Rice is really above and beyond in a completely quiet and unpretentious way.
