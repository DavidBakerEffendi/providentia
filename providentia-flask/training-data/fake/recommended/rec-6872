Awesome food, great drinks, nice backyard. Nice little spot in out of the way Gowanus has lots of cutting edge food with a menu that is totally different every time we go. My favorite is sitting in the back yard with their extensive french cider menu (wine bottle sized, perfect for two people), their big selection of natural and interesting wines, and a lot of the really interesting modern styled cooking (foams, sous vide, etc.) that makes for great meat dishes that aren't just big steaks plopped on a plate.
