The lamb chops are good and if you excuse the servers who are all getting used to a new place, it's pretty decent food. The decor is mod and cozy and I love the windows that open onto the street. My fiance is in love with the Mahi Mahi pita wrap and the mashed potatoes are delish. It's worth a trip to support a local business. They should hurry and expand the menu though.
