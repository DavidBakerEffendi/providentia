I heard mixed reviews.  One friend liked it and another friend absolutely LOVED it!  Well, I have to agree with friend #2!  I went there for brunch with her and had this AMAZING steak sandwich.  If you love meat, you must try it.  Waitress was nice as well as the host.  The food came out relatively fast, too.
