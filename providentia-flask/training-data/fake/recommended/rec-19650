Dinner was amazing! Highly recommend the grilled squid, steak, salad, collard greens, tilapia, breaded banana. Tasty, delicious, and a good price. I was there with my husband and two children (ages 6 and 8) and we all enjoyed the food tremendously! We are going back! I am still thinking about how amazing dinner was! We were on our way to the Prudential Center to see the Harlem Globetrotters. The show was great, but dinner was even more awesome!
