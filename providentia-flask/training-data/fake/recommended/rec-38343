Good pizza. Service was awesome. I would go again in the future. Avoid the China Cola. It tasted like flat watered down coke. Also, sit next to the oven but watch out for the pizza maker. You don't want to get hit by the oven tool they use to place the pizzas in the oven. The oven would also be a good place to sit during those snowy Burlington winters.
