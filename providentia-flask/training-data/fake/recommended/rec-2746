I discovered this place several years ago and my coffee-drinking has never been the same. Lulu's French roast is, flat out, the best coffee I have ever had in the U.S. Made from a special blend roasted in Western Massachusetts, it's incredibly rich, while avoiding the unpleasant, burnt taste of a well-known brand that features a mermaid on its cups. There's an unfortunate side effect: You may never have a cup of coffee anywhere else that tastes quite right. Fortunately, they sell beans and ground coffee (I use a 2.5 grind in our French press). The baked goods (Lulu used to be a baker on the shoreline) are also good. Strongly recommended for coffee lovers. Nothing I've tried in Connecticut even comes close. The vibe is casual, comfortable, with children welcome.
