My adopted Jewish uncle Arnold introduced me to Sally's Apizza years ago and it is the best pizza I have had outside Italy!! First of all, there is always a queue, I have never come here and just walked straight in, so be prepared for a little wait....it's so worth it!!! Every time I come here I have the white pie.  I thought it would be bland, I mean, pizza without red sauce....c'mon, this pizza was amazing!  The red pie is also to die for, all the pizzas are yummy!  The wait staff are so friendly and the decor is old 50s Sinatra cool(he used to frequent the place in the day)  How do I describe this pizza...what sets it apart is the crust is super thin and they put some special blend of butter/olive oli on it or something, I'm just guessing here, but it's like nothing I've ever tasted on a pizza but in my mind, it's how perfect pizza should be.  I'm having a mad craving right now for Sally's, I wish I lived closer.
