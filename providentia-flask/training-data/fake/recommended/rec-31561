I have been coming here for Â years. Mainly because it's local, there's always parking and the food is pretty good for diner food. there are a few signature dishes I really enjoy like the balsamic salad with Szechuan chicken. (Huge serving) I also love the red, white and blue breakfast waffle loaded with plenty of fresh strawberries, bananas and blueberries. My only real issue is the wait staff. They have so much turnover there. I honestly do not think I have ever had the same waiter/ waitress twice. I also notice the prices going up and the service staying the same. NOTE: I never once had bad service. Everyone is friendly. It's just that the new wait staff is always confused when I order my salad. Plus my husband keeps getting his turkey club made differently depending on who takes the order. Different prices too. I will continue to eat here and hope I can find a waitress/ waiter not so wet behind the ears :) P.s. Bring back the rainbow cake. Yum
