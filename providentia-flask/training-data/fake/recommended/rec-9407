The atmosphere is very loud. The space is tight and the staff is friendly and attentive. It's similar to a cafeteria style seating. The bathroom is unisex. The music is loud at night. I did not try their desert but the steak is good and the salmon and purple potatoes are good as well. Good for a first date if you do not want to get intimate also great to hang out with friends.
