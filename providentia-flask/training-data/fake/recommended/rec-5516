We arrived there at 12:00PM just in time for Brunch and the place was crowded! The interior was neat and  welcoming. We ordered Belgian Waffles with caramelized bananas & rum soaked raisons, Poached Eggs & Smoked Salmon Hash and to drink, we ordered Shanghai and  Hawaii 5-0. The food and the drinks arrived within a few minutes we ordered and it was delicious. We also got to enjoy the food while swinging on the basket chairs. It is a neat, affordable restaurant with good food and we would definitely go back!
