This place has something comfortable, pretty and special about it - really lovely atmosphere. Hits the right balance between neighborhoody (I live a few blocks away) and relaxed, but still super charming and with excellent food and service. Good spot for date, friends, family, everyone (in small groups since its so small). Started with champagne accessorized with pomegranate seeds - a longstanding favorite which I was happy to see there. For din I shared a bit of everything with my friend - the truly scrumptious sliders, lobster soup, and a pasta app (maybe gnudi?). All were delicious, had nicely orchestreated flavors and were beautifully presented. They delightfully split the 3 apps on a little platter for each of us. We then shared some greens and the chicken. Perfectly cooked, seasoned, the works. You will have a great dinner, portions are generous, timing is spot on, and the service had charm and personality. Had a nice and affordable bottle of dolcetto too. The two things I don't like are 1. that weird settee where people wait for tables, which mars an otherwise remarkably un-awkward space considering how tiny it is and the fact that you have to walk behind the bar to get to the bathroom. 2. the dessert. we had something chocolate-y, maybe a cake or torte, and it literally tasted like it came out of a box. did not compare to the fabulous dinner, but not a dealbreaker since i'm not someone who needs dessert after a full meal like that, plus there are lots of amazing places to waddle to after for a bite a something sweet.
