stopped in for an early lunch today with a couple of friends, and we were all very pleasantly surprised. i myself tried the chicken shawarma in a whole wheat pita, and loved everything single thing about it. i love bread - so just want to put it out there that not all pitas are made the same, and taboonette's whole wheat pita is definitely a winner - wonderfully nutty and flavorful, and most importantly, still SOFT. the chicken was tender, cooked perfectly, seasoned well. the cucumber tomato salad was fresh and crunchy, and the hummus added a nice creamy moisture to the sandwich. i rarely write reviews after trying a place just once,but i'm very excited about this new addition to the neighborhood - can't wait to go back and try it again!
