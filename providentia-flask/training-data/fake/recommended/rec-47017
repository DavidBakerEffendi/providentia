wow. loved it. this is one of those jems that i love finding, where you can tell friends that visit philly to go because it is one of a kind and really good. we got the beef tendon noodle soup and it was a huge portion! big bowl for two people easy. the broth was so tasty, noodles were SO FRESH tasting, and the beef was so moist and tender. i am hungry just thinking about that savory, hearty, filling bowl of deliciousness.
