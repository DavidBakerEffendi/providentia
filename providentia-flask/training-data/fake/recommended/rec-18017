Stay away!!!!! Horrible service and quality of food!!! Take the time to drive to another Red Lobster! I order a drink while I waited at the bar because I had a 45 min wait for the table. The bartender took about 15 mins to acknowledge me then proceeded to charge me first before even making my drink. I waited 30 mins before my drink was made because he forgot. My drink arrived to my table without a straw! There were no silver ware at the table. Our salsa came out and we waited 5 minutes while the waitress looked for silverware. It's just a nightmare I can't even go on. I won't ever return to this red lobster! I should of went to Olive Garden smh!!!
