Love love this place!! The food is delicious especially the 'new Orleans chicken'. The appetizers are great. I even had alligator (gasp) they tasted like meatballs w a divine cream dipping sauce. The ambience is really cute ala New Orleans style. I've been to other New Orleans style restaurants and they didn't compare. You must go! Rich food and it's not all spicy food as one might expect. My mouth is watering just writing this review.
