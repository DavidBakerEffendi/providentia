My favorite dish here is Lomo montado Â which is a beef steak, French fries, onions, tomatoes and soy sauce stir-fry and fried eggs on top, most of the time is pretty amazing but unfortunately this is not consistent, sometimes this same dish can be disappointing, so is this is a hit or miss I've been coming to this restaurant since they opened (few years ago) and the food used to be great, now I see they're cutting on the ingredients, like the tomatoes and lime juice in the salsa criolla (now they serve just raw onions) or the jalea which is 90% calamari when is suppose to be a mixture of assorted seafood
