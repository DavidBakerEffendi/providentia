Amazing.  Some of the best Middle Eastern food I've had. Always delicious, always a nice atmosphere, best baklava. Not always the best service--they mixed up my takeout order once, and another time forgot the hummus I'd ordered.  But, it's really cheap, so I didn't care too much. Worth the trek out to West Philly.
