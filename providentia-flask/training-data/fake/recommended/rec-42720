Excellent food, excellent atmosphere and excellent service. Came here for a late night bite (kitchen is open till 2 a.m) and everything was absolutely delish. Not a lot of the restaurants in this area are open late so coming here for a romantic meal was quite a treat. Bread and olive oil came out first- bread had slight chewy texture and I would have preferred it to be warm but the olive oil was great. We had the charred octopus to start- wow so delicious. Nice size portion and the octopus was cooked to perfection. My lovely boyfriend had the linguine with clams- very good. Could have been a slightly bigger portion but I'd rather have quality than quantity. Then I tasted my dish....wow....amazing, fluffy, pillowy gnocchi. The gnocchi were like clouds and the sauce that smothered them was rich and delicious. The sauce was creamy, nutty and buttery to say the least. And no one can ever complain with fresh Â black truffles on top (and not just a few....a nice amount of truffles decorated my plate of goodness). All in all, we both loved this place and will return for another late night date.
