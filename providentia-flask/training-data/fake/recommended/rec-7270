No complaints on service or food. My Corn Fritters & Philly Cheese Steak were a tad spicy but I'm a wimp so most won't mind. It was LOUD in there at lunch time. Tables are very close together. Dessert Chocolate Mousse we as my favorite part of the meal. Â if you are willing to spend the money (which you likely are b/c you are probably staying in the Hotel) enjoy a lunch here for sure!
