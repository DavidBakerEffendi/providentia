i didn't get it?  maybe i expected too much.  it's just sloppy, inexpensive street food.  it was decent.  i don't feel compelled to ever have it again.  if it's nearby and you're hungry- it's $6 well spent.  in my opinion, craving this type of meal or going out of your way for it is ridiculous.  not bad, but definitely overhyped.  good enough for 3 stars, but not worthy of 4 or more.
