How have I not reviewed Cloverleaf yet? I'm here plenty! At the very least I am here with my (beer loving/beer obsessed) boyfriend, about 4x's a month. Let's start with the only thing I care about reviewing: FOOD. I know everyone at Cloverleaf would be so offended, but I don't care for beer at all (gasp!) So, the food, they have a very basic menu of Irish Pub/American fare, I've had their burgers, their appetizers, and their salads, all of which are completely fine. They do not blow me away by any means, however, they are good especially for the price. They have weekly specials which always sound interesting and innovative, I'm sad to say I rarely take risks there, but the one time I did I was very, VERY pleased. I got the Al Diablo Mussels. It's a pound of Prince Edward mussels in what I am guessing, just based on taste, is a white wine/red paper/tomato based broth. It's served with a delicious garlic baguette and it really is such a treat. Every time I see it on the specials menu, I'm there. What really makes Cloverleaf a nice place is the staff. They are some of the nicest people I have ever met in this type of setting. They are pleasant even when they are extremely busy (which is pretty often), the staff is always friendly and welcoming. If you're going to Cloverleaf, go at night, in the summer, sit on their patio with your friends, order drink after drink, eat nachos and laugh. That's a guaranteed good time.
