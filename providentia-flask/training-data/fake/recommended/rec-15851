In the land of Thai food that is 9th avenue, this place shines brighter than most. The pad Thai, and pineapple fried rice are my favorites, but I have never had anything I didn't like on thier menu. The price range is the same as most Thai spots in this area, but this one has a much cooler feel to it, from the 1930s flapper inspired atire of the bar tenders, to the gigantic chandelier encased in glass in the middle of the dining room. Cons. Kind of loud, really busy during standard peak dinner hours Also, when they first opened they food quality was really exceptional, but i think they have fallen off a little bit over the years...
