Thanks to all you Yelpers my husband and I wandered over to this little gem knowing the service is super slow. Slow service-check. Now that we have that out of the way can we get to the food? Authentic, fresh Mexican food is hard to come by even in Manhattan much less NJ. So we are thrilled to live near place where tortillas are made in house ever single day. Recipes are straight from Grandma's kitchen and even the salsa is a secret concoction. Pork is slow roasted for hours on end, flavored and spiced lovingly. I am a girl who loves her mole sauce and when I ordered it, I was asked if I knew what mole tastes like. Meaning, this is serious mole, not that crap they serve at Chevy's. And it is! Frankly, if you think a burrito should be as big as your head then this is not the place for you. On our first visit we began chatting with the owner, her son and, eventually, her daughter and after five times there we are treated like family as well. This joint is 100% mom and pop, the real deal, love poured into every bite. p.s try their killer margaritas!!
