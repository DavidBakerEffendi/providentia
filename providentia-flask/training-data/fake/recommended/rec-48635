Forget Chanel NÂ°5, nothing is as good as smelling like a slider from St. Mark's burger. I've been coming to this place often for burgers and beers (try the Sixpoint Rye.. trust me, this is one of the very few places that carry it on tap.) If you want to come in for good burgers at a reasonable price- this is definitely the place to go. At night it often gets really crowded and full of drunk and hungry customers, but I usually like to go and pre-drink (excellent happy hour prices!) then fill myself with burgers to soak up all the alcohol I'm about to consume later that night. plus: Sixpoint Rye and a decently poured Guinness! Good happy hour prices and they also serve wine.. and their Guinness shake is excellent. Also, the waitstaff is really friendly and I've had rounds on the house a few times after ordering several pints and becoming a regular. Sadly- I rarely come across this practice anymore at other places, so I really appreciate it when it happens. minus: can get crowded, you smell like burgers afterwards but I think that's a good thing.
