No NY trip is complete for me without a stop in Little Itlee. The smells of marinara and garlic mixed with the aromas of the humid sewers seeping up into your senses is like candy I tell ya and last week didn't disappoint. I was on my way to see my friend Rocco Deluca play at the Bowery (great show by the way!! Catch him next time he's in town) and since Mulberry was just a few blocks from the venue we figured, why not? As we cruised the streets, we really were just looking for somewhere that we didn't have to sit outside and somewhere with a friendly Italian guy standing at the door. We approached Pellegrino's and got all of the above. The gentlemen escorted us in and sat us at a very nice table. He then told us about the specials and one jumped out at me as sounding really good. It was a lobster and crab roll kinda deal with a cream sauce and it just sounded deelish. My friend went with her vodka sauce and sausage and mushroom pasta dish and as soon as the plates arrived, I knew I ordered wrong. But lucky for me, she often eats like a bird and so I enjoyed the rest of her meal after pretty much picking at mine. Since time was a factor we pretty much ate and ran off to the show, but for a nice dinner after a stressful week, it was really good.
