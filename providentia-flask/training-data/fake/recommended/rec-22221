To begin with I Â have never written a review, bad or good. HOWEVER the Crispy Barbecue Duck was so bad I felt I should warn people, before they wasted thier hard earned money on this expensive entree. The duck looked beautiful when it arrived at the table. The vegetables it was.served with were very good. However, the duck was cold, very under cooked, with a thick layer of cold fat under the skin. It definitely was not crispy. In truth it didn't even taste like duck. I add the duck confit was lack luster and dry. The chef should be ashamed. Obviously the macaroni and cheese and the grilled cheese sandwich, anyone can cook a steak which was.good too. The duck confit was.lack luster and dry.
