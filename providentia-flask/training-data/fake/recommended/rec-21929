I went on a VERY slow night but it sucked. I got hassled for trying to open a tab, which limited how much I drank, so my knowledge on the prices are limited. The atmosphere reminded me of a rain-damaged basement. I felt bad for the bartenders who were being hit on by the unfortunate looking men who outnumbered the women. The only good thing about this place was the free popcorn.
