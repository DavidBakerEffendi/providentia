I think this place is way over valued , they have an amazing branding , and a young vibe , location on the corner and good corns - That's it ! Everything else is really whatever , cheeseburger is really tasteless a , low quality - the steak sandwich is good although they do not put enough steak in it . Overall the place is really not what it looks like . Once again brand wins , but if you are looking for a nice lunch , just go somewhere else
