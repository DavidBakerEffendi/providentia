Dark and sexy with an amazing vibe and perfectly prepared food makes you want to keep coming back to this place.  The waitstaff is friendly and knowledgeable and the food is definitely not an afterthought.  Really enjoyed the beet salad ravioli, the mushroom lasagna and of course the wine! Go here you won't be disappointed.
