I can't say much about in-house dining but my friend and I went late at night to get one of their fat sandwiches named the fat king. It has cheesesteak, chicken fingers, bacon, mozz sticks, honey mustard ketchup mayo lettuce and tomato. This thing was a beast it had to have weighed at least 4 pounds! We split the sandwich which was an 8in ($8.50) and it satisfied us both. The taste was similar to your run of the mill fat sandwiches but I did enjoy the texture of the fried foods especially the mozz sticks, they were gooey from first bite to last and you don't normally get that with run of the mill fat sandwiches. Everything was perfectly warm and delicious.
