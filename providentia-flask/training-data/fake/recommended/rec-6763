The City Tap House at Logan Square was an eagerly anticipated restaurant in my office. They did a great lead up to opening, with samples and free beer tokens to people who work in 2 Logan. Two of my coworkers and I went to have a snack and a drink on a Friday afternoon a couple weeks ago, and I found them to have a vastly improved tap selection over what the Public House had. I really enjoyed the lambic I had, and I know my coworker liked her Great Lakes Brewing Company beer. My other coworker had a specialty mixed drink, and he was quite taken with it. We also shared the bacon-popped popcorn, which was amazingly delish, and the pulled pork nachos. The nachos were extremely tasty, but they were a little pricey at $15. That's one problem with this place, even for where it is at, everything is pricey. A burger is $14... Not really a place to grab a casual lunch at. That's a shame considering it is right in the lobby of my building. But, overall, it's far better than Public House, so I'll take it.
