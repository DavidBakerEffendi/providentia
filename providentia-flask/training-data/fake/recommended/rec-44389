In Burlington now the bar is much higher. This used to be really good but now I think I am in the its not you its me mode. Had chili and a ruben. Both unremarkable. Their chili used to be one of my favorites now there just hiding average chili under a pile of crap cheese. The ruben was very greasy and featured decent corned beef and too much packaged sauerkraut. The beers do seem to be overly warm but I think they are going for the cask conditioned english brews. I went for an IPA and it just didnt taste finished and was flattish but that may also mean they are going for the english thing.
