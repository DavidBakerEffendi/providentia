We were looking for neighborhood Italian restaurant that served fresh and tasteful dishes.  We found just the place serving favorable and homemade dishes with friendly servers, close to home, BYOB and at reasonable price. While pizza aren't the best in town almost all dishes especially seafood pastas the one of the best I've tried in years.  We will be going there very often.
