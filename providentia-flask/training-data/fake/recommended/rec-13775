Ok...I know I have the grunts of disapproval coming. I just don't get why people enjoy burgers where the meat is the size of a large fist. Don't get me wrong, it was juicy and all that good stuff but since when does an overabundance of meat automatically mean a great burger? I have to say that for the shear size of the burger, the prices are great. Also, I do remember them have great beer prices. Another problems lies with the name Corner Bistro. When my boyfriend arrived, we were a little put off by the appearance of the restaurant and even more confused when we walked in. We were expecting a little bit more ambiance given the name. Oh well, just not my cup of tea I guess. Maxie's coffee burger is still my numero uno:)
