I can only speak on the paninis, which do not disappoint. Even when delivered the sandwich is warm and the bread is just as crunchy as it should be. They'll customize your panini any way you want and the variety of spreads and aiolis that they offer give you even more options. I love this place for a quick sandwich. Finocchiona is my favorite.
