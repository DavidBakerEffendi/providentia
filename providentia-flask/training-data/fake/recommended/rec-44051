Five stars for the absolute plethora of pulled-noodle choices: thin, moderately thick, thick, wide, knife-cut.  I'm missing a couple, probably.  The only downside being it will take you a while to decide noodle type you want (I favor the knife-cut, in which the chef slices off pieces of dough into a pot of boiling water with an enormous Chinese cleaver). The same rich boney broth you get at Lam Zhou and otherwise expect from a pulled-noodle place, dark and rich with flavor.  The noodle soup here comes with some vegetables (baby bok choy and/or spinach) and some pickled mustard cabbage, so it makes for a nice light meal, particularly if you get the cold cucumbers as a side dish.  Overall a slightly more refined presentation (and taste) than Lam Zhou, not that I would pass up either. As for lackluster decor, that means you haven't been to Lam Zhou.  Compared to them, this place is practically bursting with atmosphere.
