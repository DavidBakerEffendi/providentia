Mmm Penelope! This is probably the best place for comfort food in the area.  I have tried quite a few items on the lunch and breakfast menu and never been disappointed. The granola on the breakfast menu is amazing.  The veggie burger is hands down one of the best in the city!  I love the fries and the green salad and of course I have to mention the hummus and avocado sandwich.  If you eat meat you would be doing yourself an injustice to not try the chicken meatballs. They are absolutely divine! I'm not big on sweets but they have lots of fresh baled goodies too. My only complaint is that they are a little pricey(about $15 for lunch) and never seem to have special or discounts so I only indulge occasionally but I guess when the food is that good they bank on you coming back one way or another.
