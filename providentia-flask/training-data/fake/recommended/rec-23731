THis was one of the first places I ate when I moved to Philly. It was a late nite and I picked it on a whim to treat my wife to our late anniversary dinner. It was a great meal. We got the clams which was delicious, because we licked the dish clean. THen we got I think the mushroom with blue cheese, which again was really good, and we settled down with, well, hahaha, i can't remember with our pasta but it was really good. definitely recommend it.
