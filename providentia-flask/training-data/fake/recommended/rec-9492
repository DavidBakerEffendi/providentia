I made a reservation there for my birthday with a large group of friends. They gave us a great spot to sit at and we were attended to pretty quickly. Even with a large group they didn't get any orders wrong which is nice. However, because the prices were pretty high, we thought that they served large portions. So we told the waiter that we are going to share meals, so it would've been nice to have been warned that the serving sizes are only big enough for one person. But other then that, the food tasted awesome and the flan is amazing!! Overall, we had a great experience.
