Probably one of my favorite restaurants in Philadelphia Chinatown. I'm a huge fan of hand drawn noodles, and the dish is prepared amazingly here. I honestly have no complaints about the service, food, or prices. I absolutely adore the seafood noodle soup - it's what I always get whenever I come here to eat. Both the shaved and the hand drawn noodles are delicious in terms of their texture. I would say that if you are feeling adventurous and want to try a new type of noodle, the shaved noodles have the perfect amount of tug and chewiness, which makes for an extremely satisfying meal. The soups are my go-to, but I've also tried the stir-fry noodles, which also taste delicious. I've actually had hand drawn noodles from Nan Zhou, China, and the dishes at this restaurant are very, very authentic. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. The portions are extremely filling and reasonable for the price that you pay (including tip, most dishes will come out to less that $10). Remember that it's cash only though! Service is super fast, so if you're in the mood for a speedy but still very satisfying meal, this is definitely the place to go. For a group of 6 people, the wait time was still less than 10 minutes, which is fantastic. I believe that in the back of the restaurant, you can also see people making the noodles (such an awesome process). All in all, Â I never get tired of eating here. Highly recommend coming here to introduce yourself or your friends to very authentic Chinese food.
