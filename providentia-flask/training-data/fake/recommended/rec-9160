Honestly, I'm pretty sure this is the best dining experience New York has to offer. Food, atmosphere, service (we had 5 people constantly waiting on us) = stellar. I was so lucky to be taken here for valentines day... SO SO sweet. Big time points. ;) The interior of Bouley is gorgeous. The first thing you notice when you check in in the smell of apples in the coat room, and the lounge area is filled with the smell of fresh flowers. The decor is kind of traditional/french but is beautifully done.  Such a romantic place for a date. We are both foodies, so we really enjoyed choosing both of our menus so that we could try everything we wanted. The chocolate dessert was OVERWHELMING. I made the strategic decision to just take one bite of each piece - I highly recommend this technique. We had the 5 course tasting menu, and paired it with a bottle of French spicy red. I chose foie gras for my main and it was certainly the best entree I've ever had. So tender and buttery with a cherry reduction. Such a great flavor blend.  Portions were perfect - the food is so fragrant and delicate you don't need or want a ton of each dish. Just enough take in the taste and fragrance.  All of the dishes were plated beautifully, and the textures of each dish were very unique. I love the fact that you can watch the kitchen through the windows that face the street as you're leaving. You can actually see everyone scrambling and plating the dishes you just ate and enjoyed. I liked seeing David Bouley working hard to impress his clients.  Bravo, dude! Best meal I've had, and certainly the best date. :)
