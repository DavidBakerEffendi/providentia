I have been to Becco a few times for lunch, never for dinner.  It is located on Restaurant Row, which is a street near the Theater District that has a ton of nondescript, seemingly mediocre restaurants.  Becco, on the other hand, has not disappointed in the several lunches I have had there. The restaurant has a nice, intimate front area and a larger patio area in the back through the kitchen.  The back area is very nice in the warmer months, as they have a glass roof in the patio area that lets in a lot of nice sunlight.  The service has always been prompt and excellent. I have only ever gone there for the lunch special, which is an appetizer + 3 unlimited pastas for a little under $20 ($18.95 the last time I went).  The appetizer is a choice of either Caesar salad or a vegetable antipasto platter with seafood salad on the side.  The Caesar salad is quite large, slathered in dressing, and comes with ample croutons.  The antipasto dish has an array of vegetables including eggplant, spaghetti squash, carrots, string beans, mushroom, and some mozzarella as well.  The seafood appetizer has a piece of fish as well as a small octopus and potato salad with a cilantro-lime-onion dressing.  The octopus and potato salad is very tasty, and the vegetables are also great. The pastas that they typically serve are: a mushroom ravioli in a sage-butter sauce, a penne dish with red sauce, and a fettuccine or pappardelle with beef or lamb ragu.  For vegetarians, they offer instead a similar pasta with vegetables, typically with an olive oil base.  The ravioli is very good and buttery.  The penne is usually pretty solid, but nothing special.  The third vegetarian pasta is typically my favorite.  The pastas they have here are very fresh and cooked very well. Overall, Becco is a good Italian restaurant with high quality pastas and superb, prompt service.  I am definitely planning on returning here again for lunch.
