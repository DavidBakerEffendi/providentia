My roommate comes here consistently for brunch each weekend, and she took me and a couple girlfriends with her this past Saturday.  I really enjoyed the whole experience!  I found it charming to be seated in this bright, French-themed cafe on the wing of the dark, brooding Jane Hotel.  The interior has great windows overlooking the river that let in plenty of light.  The crowd is eclectic and fabulous.  The americanos are perfection; it's a nice change to get something resembling real French coffee for brunch.  The menu is made up of various Moroccan dishes with a French twist.  My smoked chicken baguette with roasted tomatoes, parmesean, and spicy aoli was crusty and delicious.  Despite a few service blips, the overall experience was lovely and relaxing.  The wait staff let us linger at our table for about 2 hours.  There is nothing quite like a sunny, leisurely brunch in New York with your girlfriends, and for me, Cafe Gitane is a top spot.
