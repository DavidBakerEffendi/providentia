I crave this. I've enjoyed two meals from here in the past month and there will be many more happy ones to come. The Honey green tea is amazing. The wraps are delish. The frites are like a drug. And the dips are the icing on the cake. The goat cheese wrap I ordered on my first trip was a bit lettucey for my taste but the hint of portabella made the whole thing worth it. I love how thin and tender the wrap itself is. The frites are just right. Not too thin, not too thick. Just a touch salty and crispy, but not crunchy. Then there are all those dips. The basil is by far the standout of the four I've tried so far. Garlic and eggplant were good. Mango chutney was surprisingly thin and forgettable. Although I haven't tried them, the desserts are more then tempting. Best of all? A filling, satisfying, and flavorful dinner for around $10. The only thing I would change? Charging a bit less for extra dips. 50 cents is just enough to prohibit me from ordering a second flavor with my small order. And it's hard to take risks when I know just how good that basil is.
