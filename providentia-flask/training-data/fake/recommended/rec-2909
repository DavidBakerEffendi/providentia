Nothing says fine dining like dropping $100 for a stop-light system to regulate the gluttonous conveyor belt of red meat responsible for veal-feeding a voracious ocean of Axe Body Spray's core demographic.  Was that a Maxim in the bathroom?  Probably.   Fogo offers all the refinement of Del Frisco's without the inconvenience of having to change out of your Chris Gocong jersey.   Their ought to be a red flag raised when the first thing out of anyone's mouth when describing this place is an animated "It's all you can eat!!!"
