Some of the best bar food in the city. Definitely try the hanger steak (comes with pesto mashed potatoes) - it will haunt your dreams (ummm...in a good way). The good dog burger is equally as amazing, but BE WARNED: make no plans to move for at least an hour after you've successfully finished the burger as you will go into a serious food coma. The sweet potato fries are also a must. It's a great place to meet up & have some drinks. The juke box is solid. Each floor offers a slightly different atmosphere. There is pool, darts & some sweet video games on the third floor, but not a lot of space to socialize in around them. My only complaint is the obnoxious office lighting (3rd floor only).
