Don't go in here if you're expecting an Eagles bar. Jets sound on during the Eagles Bucs game. Eagles game on a tv set to sling box that paused about every 5 minutes. Terrible bartender basically rooting against everyone in the bar cause he maybe bet 5 bucks on a game. 2 stars cause food decent but avoid this Shorty's location, uptown much better.
