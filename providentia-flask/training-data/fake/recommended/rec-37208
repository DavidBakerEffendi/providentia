Really good!  Two of the best fish dishes we have had (blue fish and hake). Expertly prepared.  The decor is warm and homey and there is a nice fairly priced wine list.  Portions are a little small but that's a good reason to order apps and dessert.  Only gripe was that the homemade bread was a little bland.  Served with delicious spreads though. Good, friendly service.
