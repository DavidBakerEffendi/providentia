It took us an embarrassingly long time to finally get to Paulie Gee's- but we finally made it. We arrived on a Friday night around 8pm- prime dinner time. After being told to expect a 30-40 minute wait for a table for 2- which was honestly shorter than I expected- we parked ourselves on the benches outside the door. No more than 10 minutes later, the hostess seated us. Amazing. After a legitimate argument over which pies to order from the extensive and creative menu, we ordered the Hellboy and the Ricky Ricotta. The Hellboy, with crisp, paper-thin slices of sopressata and a drizzle of Hot Honey was the clear winner, although we loved how creamy and fresh the ricotta was on the latter pizza. We also had the pleasure of seeing Paulie Gee the man work the room. More restaurant owners should spend the time in their dining room that the affable Mr. Gianonne does- it makes a difference. Can't wait to come back.
