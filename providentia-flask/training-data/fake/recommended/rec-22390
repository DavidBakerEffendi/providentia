Ok...here is my opinion:  The service was great, both over the phone and the delivery person. It was pouring rain and they came pretty quickly.  Service gets 5 stars.  I also tip extra when the weather is crappy. The food...the food:/ The snow peas, great portion size! I love steamed snow peas, just plain, no sauce, not even on the side.  They were, however, over steamed, so the texture was mushy, instead of crisp.   That pretty much sums up the whole meal, the egg roll (too greasy), the sesame chicken and the fried rice, all mushy in texture.
