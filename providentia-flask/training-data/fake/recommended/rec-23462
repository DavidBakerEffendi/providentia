I like to hear the bad first... it can be a little bit of a wait as it's a popular spot and they can use some more seating...well that is about it. I literally crave their seared tuna tacos and will go out of my way to get them. I find that the staff is always friendly and knowledgable. I even had the chef in the Soho one bring me a replacement when we realized that we had ordered the wrong item. Now that is service! They live up to their Michigan roots of niceness.
