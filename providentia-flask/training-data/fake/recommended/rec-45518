This is one of my favorite places. It's reliable and consistent. I always get the same thing, and it's always good. Even on busy days, it's worth the weight. Don't expect anything fancy; It's a diner, ya'll. Staff is nice. Coffee is good. Eggs are delicious. Biscuits are best when right out of the oven. Cash only. It's my go-to spot.
