my second favorite byob in philly. great northern italian food. defintiely get there early in the evening and grab a spot outside. they dont take reservations so be ready to wait or *shiver* walk down to audrey claire. i've eaten there so many times and really havent had a dish i didnt like. my favorite so far has been the quail. their seafood is always fresh, the pasta cooked perfectly and their portions sized perfectly. bring a few bottles of wine, site outside, relax, eat, and you'll have a great night!
