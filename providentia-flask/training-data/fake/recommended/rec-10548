I think this place is more for locals. I am working on a project at the Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center and when I called to see about getting lunch to go for 10 people I was told first they are not hiring??? and second that they have "regulars" and can not accommodate anybody else. I think I was talking to the owner as well. Anyway,  the conversation left me feeling belittled and brushed off so I am taking my business elsewhere. Too bad as well because I am at the GMDC pretty  frequently,  so who knows If I could have become a "regular".
