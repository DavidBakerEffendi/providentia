I like this place. Why? The staff are great and friendly, the food isnt the quickest, but its not slow and really worth waiting for. Hangar steak for lunch mmm. Its got a great beer garden. Best one in Princeton. Â We've been in a couple of times with our stroller and the staff havehave always seated us in a good place. Its our fav bar in Princeton
