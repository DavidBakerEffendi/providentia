No poser here... THE UP-SIDE: When you're tired of all that "Sopranos" type tourism stuff in NYC's Little Italy, go to Pelligrino's.  This place is authentic and fantastic.  It's fairly big and busy, but I had no problem getting a reservation a day ahead for a Saturday.  The food was perfect and the staff was just very pleasant and helpful.   THE DOWN-SIDE: No real down-side.  It rocks. THE SUM-IT-UP:  Go here for great Italian food.  It's an oasis amongst the touristy poser restaurants around it.  You won't be disappointed!
