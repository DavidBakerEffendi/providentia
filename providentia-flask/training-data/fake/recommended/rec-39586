I literally looked up in Yelp at the reviews right before dinnertime because my friends had recommended this place and stated this is where we were going to meet. I was in the mood to explore and find a new restaurant to enjoy so I settled upon Yuca.  We were immediately met by a friendly hostess and sat at a table.  Well much to my surprise Great food (Yuca crusted Salmon, perfect and not fishes at all)! Great value!  Perfect Mojitos (my favorite Pomegranate)!   The ambiance was cool and my girlfriends' food not only looked Good but tasted as it should. (Cooked and well seasoned)   I was totally IN at this point. Good portions, prices not bad at all (most tapas average around 13 bucks) but the portion sizes are cool.   I was pleasantly surprised with this place and would definitely recommend it to friends.  Not more I can say about this place other than its a definite win.  Go here with friends, on a date, etc and you'll be happy you did...!
