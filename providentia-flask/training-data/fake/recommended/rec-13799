Ambiance: Came here hoping for a romantic lunch with a friend with a gorgeous view overlooking the East River at Kips Bay. And it was. One problem though, there was a highway in between the restaurant and the river making us converse by screaming over the noisy traffic !own below. Food: Bread: I never review on the bread but this one is A-frigging-mazing. There's sea salt on the bread! Probably the best part of the whole meal. Appetizer: Salmon Tartar - came with a side of potato chips. It was a bit too fishy and bland for my taste. My friend got the bruschetta, she loved it. It had a creamy cheesy (?) filling in between the veggies and the bread. Main Course: They ran out of branzino, so they replaced my dish with salmon. Salmon was bland. I like the crispy skin though. My friend had poached chicken (bland), with squid ink (too salty) and quinoa. Meh. Dessert: Beignet (Deep Fried Dough) : Nice and hot with side of raspberry jam Peaches and Cream: Vanilla Ice cream with Peaches and Nuts. Awesome. Overall: Everything was pretty much bland. I guess the chef forgot to season ALL our dishes.
