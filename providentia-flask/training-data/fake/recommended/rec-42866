Important note right away: BEER AND WINE ONLY. And the beer selection could be better. I'm not buying the server's explanation that they're waiting on a spirits license, it's been five years. I get that the Community Boards in this neck of the woods are fascist, but five years? I doubt plans for a spirits license. That said, the beer and wine is enough, and this from a lush. Now I'm going to save time and leave out the minor annoyances of Market Table, because food is why you come to dinner, and the food here was terrific. Dan R., I hate Gwinnie Paltrow as much as you do, but my dinner, and my wife's, were fantastic. The food spoke for itself. Was it "white people" food? It's "farm-to-table", on the Top Ten list of Things White People Like. If that's not your bag, then leave the West Village, as it as well is on that list. Dinner was a couple of weeks ago, so memory is fuzzy. I had the octopus ala plancha appetizer, wife had the gem lettuce. Both were delicious, the gem lettuce was dressed very nicely. It's why you can get a lettuce appetizer and still love it. For entree, I had the spiced duck, which while maybe dated in terms of menu, was so good that I didn't care. Wife had the arctic char, which was also well executed (but it's hard to screw up arctic char). Dessert was a strawberry tart with a french name that I don't recall. I do recall that the crust was good enough that they must have a pastry chef back there. Wife had strawberry and chocolate sorbet scoops. Boring until you taste the chocolate. And I'm not typically a fan of chocolate sorbet. Look, I could see myself coming back and dropping a star in an update. But for now, five stars. Nicely done. One parting recommendation to the restaurant - if you are selling yourself as farm-to-table, note the pedigree of the food on the menu. I'm not looking for a Portlandia-style dossier on the duck, but it would be neat to know where it came from.
