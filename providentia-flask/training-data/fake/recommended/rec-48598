Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon with about 9 friends to get some drinks and food in the midst of a bachelor party.  Right when you walk in the bartender asks you what you'll have in a friendly manner. We all got some beers and sat and ordered lunch.  The food is really good. Everyone was please from the appetizers of wings and onion rings to the entrees of burgers and chicken sandwiches.  Even the vegan was pleased with his mushroom type selection! Then you go outside and they have picnic tables in a lot with a truck that offers beers and hot dogs.  A great place to chill out, even for us in the 90 degree weather. I've already told about 10 people about hitting this place up if they are in the area so I'll be back in the near future as well.
