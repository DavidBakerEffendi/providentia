This restaurant is small but they were able to accommodate 8 of us, albeit snuggly, for my birthday. The food was wonderful and the portions generous for tapas. I had the special goat cheese risotto balls and they were creamy and delicious. Two groups split cheese and meat boards and there was enough of each so that everyone had enough. The burgers were very good. The truffle deviled eggs were creamy and savory. The owner is friendly and was very helpful, suggesting wines and menu selections. A great way to spend a birthday!
