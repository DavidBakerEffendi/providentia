You can never do wrong with paella. In Salinas I shared a wonderful paella with a friend with sangria. Most people like to have sangria with classic red wine. For me, an occasional drinker, white wine was a better choice. The wine was refreshing, fruity and light. It accompanied the paella's strong flavor, without over powering it.
