I was here recently for my father's birthday.  I ordered a sampler of each of the type of oysters.  They were excellent!  I ordered a lobster roll off of the regular menu, calamari as an appetizer and the salmon entree off of the restaurant week menu.  All was good.  I especially liked the calamari.  The waitress was a young, thin attractive girl that was a total bitch...not a bitch to my table though.  There were some older people sitting next to us.  One was obviously hard of hearing and asked the waitress to repeat something.  The waitress very very loudly repeated herself.  The loudness was at a level where you weren't sure if she was being rude or she was just ensuring that the old lady heard, but it was loud and obnoxious.  When she left their table she involuntarily rolled her eyes.  I don't like to go to restaurants to see people get insulted.  Your job is to be a waitress...to serve people in a kind and professional manner.  Be nice is all I have to say...especially to the elderly!  I would come back for the oysters....on a monday though when its buck a schuck!
