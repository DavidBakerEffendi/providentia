I have nothing to add that hasn't already been said. Just wanted to throw in yet another opinion that National Mechanic's serves the best veggie burger ever. It's hard for me to imagine how anyone who has been a vegetarian (or just a veggie-burger enthusiast) for any length of time wouldn't love this burger. Obviously some people disagree but that's to be expected: dissatisfied customers with dissenting opinions are always more likely to seek out an online venue through which to voice their divergent point of view. Â I would estimate that if you like veggie burgers, there's at least a 90% chance that you will love this burger. The veggie burger itself gets 5 stars. I like National Mechanics as a bar but not at a 5 star level, hence the 4.
