Inside is a bit sad looking, and staff are overworked serving the microwaved food. Meh.. gets worse with each visit. I guess in total I have been 5 or 6 times over my years in New Haven, and each time the staff look like theyre having a bad night .. although that doesnt stop them adding a compulsory tip on (which the servers one time tried to disguise as tax to try to get double tipped, how disrespectful). Pad Thai looks like a grey deposit on the plate, curry is ok but tasteless. The good news is there are other Thai restaurants on the same street to try (although New Haven really excels at classic north east pizza and burgers rather than Thai food).     Probably wont go back.
