There's more in the future for these guys than just being a truck on a college campus. They cater to college kids: a lot of food, you can hold it while you walk to class, and it is cheap. I love the BBQ Crepe. And it's fun to watch these guys work to, they have crepe-ing(!) down to a science. The sweet crepes are probably the crowd favorite though. The cookies 'n creme crepe is perfection, and I've had my eye on many others on the menu. The wait can sometimes be a bit, but that comes with the success of any good food truck.
