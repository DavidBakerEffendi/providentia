One of, if not the best Japanese Ramen in town.. The decor at Ippudo is very modern and city sleek. But before you even get a chance to try their ramen, be prepared to wait a while. Due to its popularity, the wait can be upwards of over 2 hours. My suggestion is to leave your name down on their list and walk around the shops in the area or have a drink then go back. Luckily they will keep your name on the list if you are not present at the time they call it. Akamaru Ramen is best item I've tried there so far. Rich and flavorful broth with ramen cooked to perfection. Be prepared to pay for perfection though at $15 a bowl with only 2 pieces of chashu, pork. If you're a big eater like I am, save some of your broth for "Kae-dama" which is another portion of ramen at $2. Recently took my girlfriend there and she loved it. Funniest part was when we got home an hour later she said "I'm soooo surprised I didn't need to drink a gallon of water." Not too salty nor full of MSG. I can't wait for their midtown west location (Early 2012, 51st St, between 8th and 9th Ave) to open up since that might possibly shorten the wait times. Must try if you have not already.. Highly recommend.
