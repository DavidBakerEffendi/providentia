Went back to the old stomping grounds this weekend. I can't believe I forgot how huge Molly's burgers are.  At least 2 inches thick and they come with a large portion of mashed potatoes, fries, potato salad or onion rings.  All this for $10.  I got half way through my burger before I said uncle.  The meat (and mashed potatoes) were really flavorful.  Everyone enjoyed their food (there were 11 of us dining) and the service was attentive, even during a Friday night crowd. I miss being able to go to Molly's for a pint.  They have a great fireplace to cozy up to in the winter.  It's just a warm and inviting pub that I love! mollysshebeen.com/welcom…
