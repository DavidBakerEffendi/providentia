Ended up eating here as a last resort for a pre-fireworks meal on the Fourth of July.  As every place was packed, we went to the only other restaurant that had room, was close to the Hudson and served Bloody Marys. We started off with perfect Bloody Marys. It is definitely closer to the top of the list, "Best Bloody Marys." Had it extra spicy, didn't overpower the vodka. We skipped the appetizer and went straight for our meals. I ordered the quail, and I'm glad I did: it was tender, flavorful, savory, well-seasoned and far from the rubber quails I'd eaten in the past.  We also ordered a side of frites, which were fried with herbs, a nice touch that I hadn't seen before.  I'd add that the fried herbs were delicious. The service was also great. We were given a wait, but the hostess was very courteous about it. Our waitress was knowledgable, and the busser was prompt. Bartender was friendly. Couldn't argue with it. Definitely a fan!
