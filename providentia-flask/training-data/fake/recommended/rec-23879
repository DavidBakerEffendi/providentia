Went here with a few friends after a Phil's game.  Hostess was a little distracted, so we found a place at the bar.  Once we sat down the service improved dramatically.  The pork carnitas tacos were probably some of the most delicious tacos I've ever had.  Also got the fried plantains which were very tasty.  Looking forward to another late night taco party next time I make it down to Philly.
