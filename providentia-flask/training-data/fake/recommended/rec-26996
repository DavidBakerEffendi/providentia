This was pretty great. Spruce tip IPA was lively. The foie gras was more like a taurine than what I was hoping for, but good none the less. The bone marrow wasn't served how I was wanting either, it came spread on toast. It was tasty however. The cornmeal dusted fried oysters with house Kim chi were lovely. Two trips in two days, partly because they didn't have heady topper the first day, so we had to go back. All in all I love the concept of local farm to table and Vermont has a lot of stuff to pick from.
