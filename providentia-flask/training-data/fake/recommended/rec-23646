After a long day of pseudo-studying paired with a few glasses of wine, myself and some of my friends headed to Domo on a "we want sushi and sake" whim.  It was kind of a bummer when we found that it was BYOB, but I guess that fault lies on our shoulders- we know to check before we go. Very cute place, the decor is interesting, in a good way.  For such a small place it felt both warm and open.  The waitstaff were very nice and attentive, but not too attentive.  I got the miso soup, a spicy crunchy tuna roll and a sweet potato tempura roll.  I was a little underwhelmed by the sushi.  Not that it was bad by any means, it was just a little bland, which may have been my choices.  I usually get spicy tuna... this one just didn't pop to me. Going back, I'd like to try some of the entrees on the menu, and next time I'll be sure to bring a bottle of sake.
