Went here for brunch last Saturday and had a surreal experience.  Party of six. We got there around 11 and it took them about a half hour to take our orders because the kitchen wasn't ready.  I ordered the eggs Benedict on fried oysters, and my friend ordered a vegetarian omelet.  My eggs came out and I almost couldn't believe it: when I bit in, instead of oysters there were oyster-sized pieces of fried chicken.  I was in denial and just ate the first one.  Half way through the second one, I had a very awkward exchange with the waiter in which I showed him the chicken.  He said he'd get the cook to make me new ones.  I was full at this point (and pretty disgusted) and said I didn't want new ones.  He came back with two fried oysters anyway and explained that the cook grabbed chicken by accident.  I can't imagine how that happens and have to conclude that they were running low on oysters and trying to skimp. My vegetarian friend's omelet came out with bacon on it.  When she said something the waiter took her plate (sides and all).  By the time she got her plate back we were long done eating (except my little plate of two fried oysters) and we all sat around watching her eat.  A brief apology and the full check came out despite two ruined meals.  Honestly, if he'd brought a few free Bloody Mary's out I wouldn't be complaining here but you can't screw up that royally these days and expect customers to keep quiet.
