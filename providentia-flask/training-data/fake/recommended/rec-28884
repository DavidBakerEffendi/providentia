This place is nothing to rave about.  The food is just ok.  It's inexpensive so it's not a complete waste.  The Tiger Shrimp Rolls are good.  The Thai Spare Ribs needed sauce.  The beef in the Nuur Kratiam (sauteed sliced beef with broccoli, cabbage, carrots and onions in a fresh garlic sauce) was tough. The Koong Kratiam (sauteed shrimp with broccoli, cabbage, carrots and onions in a fresh garlic sauce) was extremely bland.  I could have ordered this at my local asian restaurant and tasted a better flavor profile.  As I read in previous reviews THEY DO NOT DEVEIN THEIR SHRIMP which is very unsettling.  I guess you get what you pay for. As for the set up of this place, I can't stand it.  When you walk in you assume you should wait there for someone to come seat you.  Actually you have to walk into the middle of the restaurant and wait to be seated there.  ARKWARD.  The host took a really long time to seat us.  The bathrooms are also located in the middle of the restaurant which I did not like.  As soon as you open the door the toilet is right there.  So if you accidentally walk in on someone they are giving you a full frontal view and the people dining behind you have the same view. Not interested in going back. NOTE: CASH ONLY!
