this morning I called them to check with they have vegan choices in their menu and woa! what a surprise, the guy on the phone was supernice, then once I got there with my husband my waiter was so helpful and accommodating!!! I'm so proud of Chavela's for supporting the vegan choices because more than animal activist that are people with real health conditions and cannot have animal products and this is just a wonderful surprise! The food always taste fresh, the service attentive, and the stuff very well informed. I might throw a little vegan get-together in there and not tell anyone is vegan because the flavors are there and you don't feel like you are missing a thing!!! thank you Chavelas!! *vegan and vegetarian choices available lunch, brunch and dinner! *consistent food and service *worth the wait, but try to get there early so you might not even have to wait!
