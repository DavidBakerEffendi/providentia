What can I say that hasn't been said about Mamoun's? Let's just skip the chit chat and say that if you want savory, tasty, inexpensive, quick food this is the place to grab a bite. Been here several million times and it's Johnny on the spot every single time. I recommend it highly after traipsing out of the bar(s) and the late night hunger beast demands immediate attention. Word of alert: I LOVE all things insanely spicy but their hot sauce is not for mere mortals, be very careful! Don't be like my naive, newbie self the first time and douse your food. All in all, you'll eat like a king or Queen and will have more than likely spent under $10. Plus they're on the East and West so they got you covered, who can argue with that?
