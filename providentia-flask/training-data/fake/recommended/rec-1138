This place is terrible!! The meat was dry and cutt to thick with no flavor. To top it off they are racist and horrible service-not friendly at all. When we got to the window, there was a sign saying if you don't speak English you can't order.. a little racists.its all good I will never go to this place again and anybody that ask, I will tell them not to go as well.. I'm also going to contact the food networks that advertised this sh!T HOLE and ask them to remove these Jack's.. the food was terrible and the attitudes were as dry as their cheese steaks.
