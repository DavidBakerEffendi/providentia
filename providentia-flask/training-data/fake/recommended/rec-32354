I used to come to JB's once a week to meet up with a friend. Lately their is a big change in my favorite food items. The Caesar salad is icky. Too much dressing. AND the tacos. The serving used to be 3 tacos Â with lettuce and tomato and two types of salsa. Now, they give you two with a side of rice and beans and they are smothered in jalepeno peppers. I like spicy but this is just overbearing. SO.... change back to your old ways JB's or I will have to make myself a new friend.
