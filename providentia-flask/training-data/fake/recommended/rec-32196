Hands down the best burger I've had in Philadelphia. I order their Kobe Burger with Cheddar every time. They pile the cheese on and the bun is always soft and fresh. As for the beef... It's the juiciest most flavorful burger I've ever had. It is always cooked perfectly to order, and is amazingly well put together. I would recommend this to anyone who wants what burgers are supposed to be.
