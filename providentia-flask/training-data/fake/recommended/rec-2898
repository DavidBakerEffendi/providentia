the first day i set foot on campus, a scared, timid high schooler accompanied by her mother for a tour of temple campus i had my first crepe truck expereince. hungry after the car ride to philadelphia we were directed to the crepe truck for lunch...and let me tell you...it basically sold me on the university. the crepe truck has been my favorite lunch spot for the past 4 years (and everyone else for that matter if you can't tell by the lines). its affordable, tasty, with a friendly staff and the ability to custom order anything on the menu. PLUS over the years they have added to the menu, including falafel and new sauces! ps. i love sauces and these guys are more than willing to share their insider sauce combo secrets. just ask! who wouldnt pay a little over $5.00 for a filling meal with veggies & protein (plus a drink!) you can call ahead, or even place your order and walk away to grab some cash at 711 and they dont mind. here is an insider tip. in addition to their drink cooler on the bottom of the truck, they make an AMAZINGLY cheap, caffeinated iced coffee that as pulled me through more than a million never ending night classes. beau monde, reading terminal, ANY crepe i've had in the city elsewhere is nothing compared to the wonderments of the crepe truck crepe truck, i promise to come back for some alumni lunches!
