My girl and i dined there twice. We come back for good food and for a friendly service, not too intrusive, just right. And of course i have to mention the food! The fresh oysters special is a must-have, together with the cured salmon board. Both are to die for! We prefer sitting at the bar, plenty of space and a fast service. Thank you!
