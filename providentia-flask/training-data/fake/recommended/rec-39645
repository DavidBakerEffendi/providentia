Overall great experience. In the heart of the flatiron district the entire complex is fun to shop around before or after the meal. I've been to the rooftop twice so far this past fall and even without the open roof, it's a great atmosphere. Their selection of house brewed beers is unique and the staff is knowledgeable regarding which choices will pair well with your meal. I've had the pork shoulder and home-made sausage. The entrees are simple, with only kraut and mustard accompanying the meat but it is really all you need to go with it. The only thing that won't make me come back here all the time is the price, but that's expected.
