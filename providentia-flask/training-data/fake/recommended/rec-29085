I admit I was not interested in noodles and was dragged in here one day when my girlfriend wanted to try it.  I know that this is a noodle house, but I was disappointed to find out that I couldn't order anything but the noodles.  Anyway, long story short I tried the duck noodles and they were really good. As it turns out the noodles come in a soup, and so I had a duck noodle soup for dinner.  It was tasty and I left full, but inevitably I was hungry again later.
