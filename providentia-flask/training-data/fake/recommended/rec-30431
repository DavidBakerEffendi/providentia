Cookshop is a cornerstone in Chelsea's renaissance. The food - all sourced locally and seasonally - is always exceptional and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. If you're ordering wine, ask for the sommelier - he is extremely helpful, and great to talk to. We have eaten there a number of times. The last time we had the scallops which were delicious. We went for an early Sunday night dinner so they could accommodate our young daughter, and despite being fairly busy for such an early hour, they were very gracious and set us up quickly. The brunch lines on the weekend are long, but it's worth the wait.
