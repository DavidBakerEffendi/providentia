This place is small, romantic, the service is out of this world.  The signature Bloody Caesar is amazing.  I had the fried Chicken sandwich.  It was perfect, the Tabasco and honey on it gave it a sweet and spicy kick that was what I needed at the beginning of the day.  I would recommend that you make reservations due to limited number of tables but you can also risk it and walk in but I wouldn't recommend it, it could take over an hour to get a seat.
