This place used to be absolutely amazing, just as everyone else said. It is DEFINITELY NOT anymore. Even their signature dishes (Muglai Chicken, special chicken samosa) are frankly not even up to the standard of a normal dish at an average curry house. This place used to be so good that I still kept ordering from them a few times, even after it was obvious the quality of the food had taken a nosedive. But after the last nearly inedible order I placed with them which included a curry that basically tasted like sugared tomato paste, I decided to post a review to warn yelpers to not be fooled by the now ludicrous 4.5 stars.
