5 stars because they have consistently delivered above-average food and service, and when something goes wrong (rarely) they make it right.  Max group doesn't lower the quality on their suburban outposts.  The steaks are on par with Max Downtown, though not as fancy or expensive.  The fish is similarly top notch.  Great quality, reasonable check, nice atmosphere, and above-average service... 5 star.
