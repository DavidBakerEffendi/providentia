So Red Hook Lobster Pound isn't the easy place to eat at. You basically have to drive there if you don't live in the neighborhood.  I'm one who doesn't go anywhere in the city unless it's directly accessible by train, so I hate that this place is so far from one because both my boyfriend (who isn't easily impressed by food that just tastes "OK") and I both loved the lobster rolls. We drove to RHLP with the intention of finding a good lobster roll. We'd literally been visiting restaurant after restaurant all week looking for one (three other seafood restaurants which got high stars on yelp, but we feel didn't deserve it), and we found it here.  The roll was perfectly buttered/grilled (CT style), and the lobster meat was a plenty, and oozed fresh! We also got the lobster bisque, and while I was happy to have plenty of that fresh lobster mixed in, it wasn't my favorite... It was OK.. But I have to say that once we ate our lobster rolls at home, we wanted to go back immediately and not only get another lobster roll, but try the shrimp rolls. Unfortunately, getting back to the restaurant was not an option. Also, $15 for a roll is expensive, but my boyfriend that it was fair seeing how fresh the meat tasted. So 5 stars for the roll (it deserves to have been voted by New York Magazine's 15th best sandwich/1st best lobster roll in NYC), minus half for the bisque, and another minus for the location...
