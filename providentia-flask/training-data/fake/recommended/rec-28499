I was expecting a lot from this place since it has a 4-star rate on yelp, the food is really tasty and good. I think it's a very healthy option for post-workout meal. unfortunately, me and my bf had to find out that there is a rubber band inside of the salmon cake. So, it's very not a pleasant experience on my first visit, and it's over priced!
