I think this really deserves 3 1/2 stars... I've been to Maysville for both drinks and brunch. I would definitely recommend coming here for drinks, especially if you are a whiskey/bourbon fan. However, I was underwhelmed by the brunch. Drinks: I am not a huge whiskey/bourbon fan, but I loved their cocktails (most of which include bourbon). Their whiskey list is very extensive--they probably have every whiskey you could possibly think of. They offer 1-oz tastings or 2-oz pours of each, which is great. All whiskeys are very reasonably-priced. Brunch: I was not a huge fan of their brunch. They have very few options to choose from. I ordered the quiche, which was way too salty and lukewarm. My boyfriend ordered the crispy grits, which he said were great. Our friend ordered the chef's breakfast, which included 2 fried eggs and duck sausage. He said they were great. Service was a bit slow. We had to keep asking for coffee refills and waiting very long for our check. The bartenders are great, though the bar could get a bit crowded after work.
