Great food and service - We had the Captain Crunch Balls, Tatter Tots, Southwest benedict, shrimp and grits and it was all delish - Great Place and bough our own pitcher of Bloody Mary's- Highly Recommended - we only post places we like so a lot, so yelp always pulls them off - but if you see this one check it out - we went all the way from Jersey for brunch and we will do it again and bring some friends
