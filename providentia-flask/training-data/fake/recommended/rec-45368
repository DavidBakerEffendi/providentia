I was really excited to try Chavela's... even talked them through an entire delivery order and then we realized I live outside the delivery zone (oops)... my husband and I walked 20 minutes to pick up the food. And then... I was heartbroken. My very "vegetariano" Plato Don was a "carne" Plato Don. So I'll try again. The rest of our order was very good. Not earth-shattering, but very good.
