Geno's is okay, but the ordering system is lame (separate lines for separate items).  The staff is extremely hostile and unfriendly in a seemingly intentional way.  It is a stupid business model to have, when any given day probably 10-15% of their customers are first timers.  Plus, they have the worst selection of "celebrity pictures" adorning the walls outside.  You think I am impressed because Shavlik Randolph ate here once and signed a picture to document this?  Exactly. Anyway, I have had better cheesesteaks elsewhere.  The bread was kind of hard.  Though it was flavorful, the portion of meat seemed to be a little on the smaller side.  The cheese is pretty good.  Obviously, since the whole cheesesteak cannot be greater than the sum of its parts, it merely struck me as normal.  Nothing worth raving about.  The fries were a little better, though.
