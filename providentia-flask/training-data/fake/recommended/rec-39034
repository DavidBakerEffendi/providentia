Ended up at this place again.  Bartender came up to me and asked me what I would like to drink.  I asked him "just recommend any beer".  He gave me the hand signal that non verbally says "hurry up , I am busy" (waving his hand in a circle).  When I saw him do that , I almost had a stroke and had to take deep breaths to calm myself.  Suffice to say I was close to grabbing him by his neck.  Now I could understand if the place was slammed with people, it was not.  After I calmed down, I had to watch this bartender and see for myself , where the fire was.  After watching him, it is clear he has a ADD/OCD.  I saw this guy lining up receipts, putting them in "perfect" order, only to grab them all and do it all over again, he did many other odd things that demonstrated a high degree of anal retentiveness that I have never witnessed prior.  At this point I realized he has a mental problem and I should not take his arrogance and poor attitude personally.  Check the guy out thought, watching him when he is not serving will provide you some laughs, he is the tall skinny dude with black hair.  Adios, I will never go there again.
