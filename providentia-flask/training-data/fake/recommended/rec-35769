I have dined at Fare twice now and have really had good experience. It is wonderful to have a new addition of finer restaurants in the neighborhood besides the usual watering holes that serve greasy food. Fare's service is friendly, accommodating and unpretentious. Our server, Jessica was a delight. The 1st time, my friend and I had the beets salad, polenta with mushroom and wine (thank God they have a good wine list). We sat outside for more than 2 hours for dinner. They never kicked us out or interrupted us. The 2nd time I was there, I had ordered the salmon, very light and perfectly made. My friend ordered the chocolate flourless cake, dense and a little on the dry side though. I like Fare's food because its very clean and simple without "frills." I personally feel that sometimes, too much accompaniment can get too overbearing that you can hardly taste the food. Hence, I describe Fare as simple and tasty.
