I'm so excited to celebrate my birthday here next Thursday. My boyfriend and I were here about 3 weeks ago and had a genuine good time.  Service was great, our server didnt try too hard and got that we were just a couple of knuckleheads who exude awesomeness. I'll be highly impressed if this place handles my party of 20 absolutely insane but truly great people.  Keep you updated...and for you complete assholes that complain about the hostess making you wait outside, she probably offered you to wait there as they do not have a bar to seat you at while they prepare your table for the AMAZING meal you clearly are unworthy of eating and its a small space and yes you standing there probably does cramp her style...of doing her job to great people into an inviting atmosphere, not one where some snotty NoLibs yuppy or hipster bitch is appauled that she wasnt treated like a princess and sat immediately ON A STAURDAY NIGHT! Get over yourself and remove the pea from your butthole.  MODOMIO you guys are amazing! Barbara
