Have you ever seen El Vez, the Mexican Elvis?  That is part of what inspired me to plan a dinner here.  Ok, that and the Starr Restaurant quotient.  Glad I did -- great menu (the kind where I had real issues selecting!), eclectic, fusion menu that delivers on the flavors. Not to mention the tequila list was great - included all my good standby repo's and my favorite special tequila... Don Julio 1942. We had one of the  flavor packed guacs, then I had the seared ahi... yum!   Combo of cool flavors from the sauce, with the chile packed coating.  My friends both had the taco sampler, and I wound up with the enchilada sampler,  Open, soft tacos are not at all uncommon to us Californians, so we were very happy with the lovely presentation - the varying flavors were also a hit.  the mahi mahi taco rocks.  Of the three enchiladas, two were great, one was ok.  The Black bean was great with a warm, rich sauce; the chicken mole was perfect - spicy, sweet mole with delicate chicken.  The veal enchilada was not quite a hit.  Fairly oily and not super flavorful. Service was friendly, though perhaps not the best at making recommendations and describing food.... the server we had really didn't seem to enjoy more interesting flavors and foods.  I will be back when I am in Philly - good food in a not fussy atmosphere!
