The best Pho I've ever had!  In the Hartford area, there are 3 places to get really good Pho.  The other two do have expanded menus, so if you are going in a group of people that have various tastes, Pho 501 might not be the best choice.  They serve Pho, end of story!  But it is perfect!   The broth is where a lot of the magic happens, and this place just has it right.  Not oily, clear, and excellent taste.  They have many choices for your proteins, but only advertise shrimp or beef.  If you ask, you can have all the goodies, such and tendon and tripe.   Seating is a bit crowded, but this reminds me of busy restaurants in NYC Chinatown.  When a place is this good, it's going to be busy.  Be prepared to share the big tables with other Pho fanatics!   The service is average, but the cashier is over the top wonderful.  She always asks how I'm doing, and remembers exactly my order from before, even if I haven't been there in over a month. The last feature I love about this place, is that I can get Pho to go!!  You can get it hot to eat right away.  Or, as I do, you can get it for later.  The noodles, veggies, and beef are separated and the broth comes in a large container.  I like to pick this up on my way home from work, then make it at home.  Love it!
