I'm gonna drink the Brooklyn Star haterade. Now, I came for brunch, and I have heard that the dinner is way better. I have mixed feelings about their "absolutely no substitutions" rule. I get it, but.... it just seems kinda harsh. I don't know. But I get that the chef wants to maintain the integrity of the dish he/she created. Moving on... the brunch menu is so unbelievably heavy. Everything is just sauced or fried or buttered to the max. We got some of the baked goods to start and they really were delicious, albeit so indulgent... the donuts were delicious but just dripping with oil... same with the cinnamon roll but it was oh so wonderful. The best thing I had. But after eating all those fried pastries, I couldn't bring myself to order a platter of french toast or fried corn cakes, so I ordered yogurt with granola and berries. I know, what a nerd, and it was actually good... I just wish they would have had some kind of omelet or something more healthy, or that you could do substitutions to get that omelet... anyway. The reason this place is getting 2 stars is because I polled my 5 other brunch companions, who are well aware of my affinity for Yelp, and asked them what they would give this place out of 5 stars, and everyone said 2 or 3. So I decided on a 2, because that's how I feel. Sorry Brooklyn Star, but I'd love to come back for dinner.
