This was my first time here in philly. I was hearing all the rants and raves about this product known to man as the elusive Philadelphia Cheesesteak. Mind you I'm from the south & the only steaks we mess with is typically grilled and seasoned to perfection. So a really great friend of mine took me to this place for my first cheesesteak. When it came in front of me, I was so amazed at what I saw. I immediately took my first bite and I almost lost my mind. My taste buds experienced such bliss that it felt orgasmic! Such a huge flow of emotions flowed through my mind as I continued to indulge in this cheesesteak. I was ecstatic, I was calm, I was frustrated, & I was angered. Why you ask? I felt angered because of all these other places I've had these so-called Philly Cheesesteaks at. Rock on Philly! I hate the snow but your hot sandwiches keeps everything in balance.
