Quibblers could note that Jolie Cantina is neither really French nor really Mexican, which is true but beside the point.  It's very tasty and very fun, and I think the concept of "authentic" food is overdone anyway.  Why would you want a total replica of French food in Brooklyn?  Without the sense of terroir and local ties, it just doesn't work, nor should it.  Jolie is a fun hangout spot, fushion but emphatically Brooklyn, for good food and nice booze, great for small groups on a weekend night.  The way to order is to share a bunch of small plates--the pecan molten brie is particularly fun, and I'm a big fan of their tasty salad.  It's fun and enjoyable and light, they take reservations, and they're consistently enjoyable.
