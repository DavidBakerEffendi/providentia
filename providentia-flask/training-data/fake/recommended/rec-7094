One of my favorites.  Firstly, I go to restaurants for the food (and sometimes ambiance) but I would start by saying the service was outstanding.  We got sat quickly and seemed to have someone check-in whenever we needed something w/o be obtrusive.  A+.  The food was superb.  I got the escargot, which I'd get again.  The Amelie salad was unique and healthy.  We also enjoyed the mushroom flatbread and daily soup.  The finale, which should not be missed, was the chocolate cake.  Highly recommend and pair with the port.
