I finally had a chance to eat here after having been told by several co-workers that this is one of the best fish and chip joints in Jersey. Going to this place is a real trip. It's kinda like taking a trip back in time. The decor is straight out of the late 70's. It is some what dingy cafeteria style but that doesn't bother me. The service was friendly and efficient. Now down to the reason I was there. The fish and chips. The fish was delicious! Perfectly cooked, firm white flaky meat . The batter was nice and light and not the slightest bit greasy. As for the chips what a let down. Why pair such a delicious piece of fish with frozen fries. I mean really, how hard is it to make your own fries? That's why the three star rating. I will go back and try some of the other authentic Scottish dishes on the menu. To me this is a really homey kind of place that I like.
