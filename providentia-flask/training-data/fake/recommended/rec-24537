This is one of the best places for tapas in NYC.  It is a casual sit down place but that doesn't take away from the delicious tapas they serve!  The prices are lower than a typical tapas restaurants and you can bring your own wine and there are no corkage feeds. Will be my go to spot for delectable tapas!
