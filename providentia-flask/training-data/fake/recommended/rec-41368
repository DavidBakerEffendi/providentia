Cozy as in tiny, standing room around perimeter with small shelf to eat if you want, and great food. Â This is one of the best tasting tapas places in NYC - Oh yeah, I said it... Can't go wrong with the Sangria, Squid ink, Pimientos, & potatoes with spicy aioli... Doesn't seem too easy to get a table but I have scored each time I've went.
