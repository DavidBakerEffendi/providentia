Pricey but very good! We went on a crowded night (new Penn students & their parents) but received complimentary drinks to make up for the wait. Our waiter, Josh, was very friendly & informative about their menu. For our entrees we ordered the duck with mushrooms and the chicken that comes with INCREDIBLE bacon mac & cheese. Literally mouthwatering! Even if you don't order the chicken dish, order the mac & cheese as a side for only $7. I was going to give it four stars due to price but it is what it is. Appropriate for a higher end restaurant, especially counsidering they work exclusively with local places within a 300 mile radius.
