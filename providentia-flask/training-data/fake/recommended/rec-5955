One of my favorite sushi  restaurants in Philly.  I have been here twice and both times the food has been up to par.  For starters, I recommend the tuna pizza (just delicious!), and the miso soup.  The fish is fresh!  I don't think you can go wrong with any of the sushi rolls-sooo yummy!  I like the fact that they keep it simple in keeping a balance of the taste of the fish with the additional sauces added.   My favorite sushi rolls here are the zento square roll and the spicy tuna roll, both are fabulous!  I also recommend the monkey and volano rolls.  For dessert, I've tried the banana fritters---i could keep eating more!!! The restaurant is small, but charming.  The staff is attentive.   The prices are very reasonable for high quality food.
