The restaurant itself is chic but casual, and offers a relaxing ambiance. Great to go with friends over a fun meal! The bar is actually communal-ish, so you many elbow neighbors here and there. If you want more privacy, try to sit at the table. Lunch's 3-course menu option ($25 ish for appetizer, entree, dessert) is a good value if you want dessert, too..it's like going a la carte, ordering 2 dishes and getting dessert free (price wise). Don't leave until you try the signature pork puns with Hoisin sauce and cucumbers..thats what you gotta get. A simple and old recipe yet it's very consistent in texture and taste here..the pork is always melt-in-your-mouth WOW!
