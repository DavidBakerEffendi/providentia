Dessert review only. Walking into Max Brenner was like falling into the chocolate river at Charlie's Chocolate Factory. Scents of cocoa engulfed the entryway and even seeped out of the door to allure passerbys. It sure did the trick for us. We came here to enjoy the dessert and we did just that. We ordered the Urban S'mores Fondue and it were amazing! You toast your own marshmallows and they provide you with 4 dipping sauces: milk chocolate, peanut butter, caramelized bananas, and raspberry puree. It was quite expensive, but worth it since I was visiting a friend in town and she's worth it! Not sure why you would come here for dinner--it looked very expensive.
