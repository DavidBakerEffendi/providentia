Ate here once and although the pizza was delicious, can't forgive them for the 1 hr 45 minute wait!  Luckily we snagged a table for our party of 4, but still, the kids got restless after about an hour.   Trying to get the attention of the woman at the counter (I think she's a daughter of the owner) wasn't easy, and she didn't sympathize with my situation of hungry, bored kids.  I had the time to look around and notice the filthy walls and floor of the place-not appetizing at all.   Watching the elderly gentleman owner make each pizza by hand is interesting and it's the last step of drizzling olive oil all over the pizza that helps make it taste so good. Just not sure if it's the best pizza in America.
