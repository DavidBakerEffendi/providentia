We had burgers. They were not bad. Fries were ok as well. Yawn. Average. I understand this place is a wine bar and I may not have picked an item that represents the overall quality of the place well. One element of note was the seating, which was high - my feet could not touch the ground and rested on the stool's legs. It was also uncomfortable for a longer dinner because there was no back support too. Essentially we sat on bar stools.
