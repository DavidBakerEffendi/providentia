Tatooed moms is ok I guess... I hadn't been there in a few years, then I was in town the other day and met some old friends there... Nothing has changed a bit, other than that you can't smoke now downstairs.. (hahaha... if you know this place, you know this is pretty ammusing) Anyhow, if you're a 21-25 Year old punk enthusiast who still lives in your parents basement, that Tatooed Moms is for you... I however; am not. In 1998 maybe yes? But, fact of the matter is, I may still be a Jeans and T shirt guy, but my Obelisk Jeans and Morphine Generation Ts generated me some strange looks by many T-Moms goers. Â My Jeans probably cost more that any of the T-moms patron's Cars and when that reality hit me, I realized I may have finally out grown Tatooed Moms.
