On my latest weekend trip to NYC, I found myself walking around the East Village before meeting some friends for brunch.  I had been here once before and had one of the pork sandwiches, which I remember as being very good, so I stopped in for a pre-brunch sandwich.  This time I went with The Sidecar (beef banh mi).  It was probably the best banh mi I've ever had and up there on the list of best sandwiches I've had period.  The beef was tender and flavorful, the veggies crisp.  The condiments (a pineapple salsa type thing and some kind of spicy mayo) were also nice.  However, what put this over the top was the bread.  Perfectly warm and crisp.  I could just eat the bread.  Didn't get any drinks this time, but I remember the basil lime fizz was pretty decent last time.  This is definitely on my places to try to get to when I'm in the city list.
