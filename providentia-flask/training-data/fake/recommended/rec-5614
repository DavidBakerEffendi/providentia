Had a wonderful time at the Continental Midtown Saturday night kicking off my sisters Bachelorette party with a delicious dinner and cocktails! I had a great experience planning the event with the Event Coordinator Keri. She answered emails promptly and could not have been more accommodating! She was a dream to work with! Dinner was family style tasting menu of about 7 or 8 courses and the cocktails were delicious. Try the Twizzle!! Â Our waitress was very attentive and kept our drinks and courses flowing, which was probably difficult considering we had 14 people. Would definitely go back for a special event or birthday dinner!
