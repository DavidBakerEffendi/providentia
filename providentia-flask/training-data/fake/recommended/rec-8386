This is my favorite place to order delivery. The food is wonderful, and consistant. Â If you ask for spicy, they go for it, and dont make you go through the 'oh are you sure' dance and then its mild anyway. Delivery is always fast, and the people who work there are so sweet! They always remember me and sometimes throw in a little extra something or other because i order from them a lot! Best place in the neighborhood by far!
