My co- workers and I ventured to Philly for a business trip. A quick search of Yelp yielded a restaurant that what was right up my alley. Due to the adventure it took for us to get there my supervisor exclaimed " this food better be worth it". In a nutshell it was. The Continental is a cute modern diner that doesn't serve traditional diner food if that makes sense. Instead of your traditional comfort foods you'll see modified versions such as the lobster mac and cheese made with gueyre and orzo which we had to try. The dishes are all brought to the table as they are prepared to encourage sharing.  In addition to the lobster mac and cheese we also tried the Korean BBQ tacos, spring rolls with crab and avocado and Thai chicken skewers.  All of we which were delish. If you're in the area stop by.
