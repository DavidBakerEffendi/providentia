Went with my best friend for dinner on a Thanksgiving Holiday shopping trip. For appetizer, we ordered their foie gras which tasted fine but not what my friend expected (Later, when she explained to Marc, he said next time he can make it how she likes it done). Also ordered their filet mignon which was cooked to medium and tasted good. My friend ordered a veal dish which she said tasted good also. In addition, we ordered a bottle of wine. In between the appetizer and meals, the waiters brought us several tasting samples for free which was a treat. Also, my friend is a big fan of Marc, hence she asked the waiter if the Chef was in the kitchen? To our surprise, Marc actually showed up at our table and chatted with us a while. He even convinced us to get a bread pudding for dessert, even though we were quite full from the meal. However, because we were so happy with his presence, we gave into it. Finally, Marc stopped by our table again before he headed for home. Because of this wonderful experience, I have to say excellent to the ambiance, food, decor, waitstaff, etc. Needless to say, my friend gave a huge tip to the waiter for his effort to get Marc to see us.
