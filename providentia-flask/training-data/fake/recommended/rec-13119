I was very disappointed with Maialino despite good reviews. We came here for dinner and shared several dishes and a bottle of champagne.  We ordered a few dishes to share fried artichokes, their signature dish suckling pig, pesto pasta dish, and tortellini w/ winter squash. Overall I found the artichokes (which was recommended by the waiter) and tortellini too greasy and the pesto pasta wayy to undercook.  I usually prefer my pasta al dente but the spaghetti was so undercooked it was still hard.  We asked them to take it back and they returned with the dish cooked with fetticini instead.  Strangely enough the new pasta was also undercooked..  I know I wasn't imagining this because everyone thought the same at the table.  The suckling pig not bad but for the price I thought it was a bit small..
