#1 in atmosphere; sexy, earthy, dark, low musing and ethereally lit. Great place to unwind alone, flirt with a love, and especially impressing out of town friends and family. definitely recommend arriving early for dinner, but even if you have to wait for a table it usually has a decent turn around and sipping the elixirs are a nice way to spend the wait. fried pickles, nuff said.
