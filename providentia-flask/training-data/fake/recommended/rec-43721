We came here somewhat spontaneously on a Saturday night. Ssam Bar looked busy, but the hostess said she could seat us in 10 minutes -- boom, sold. The pork buns are as good as I remembered. Pork shoulder with the cauliflower puree was excellent... a very elegant dish. I decided to throw in the spicy pork sausage and rice cakes. Great depth and flavor. This was the type of dish that gets even tastier the more you eat it. Being Chinese, it would have been even better with regular rice!
