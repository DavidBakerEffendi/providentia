People kept telling me about chicken and rice and I brushed off their suggestions, thinking "What could possibly be so great about chicken and rice?" Boy was I sorry that I waited this long to try this Halal Cart. I'm also sorry that my first and only experience was an hour after already eating dinner (members of our party got hungry again after walking around the city)--so I only had a few bites :( But they were the most flavorful, moist and delicious bites of my life. Warning: DO NOT drown your bowl in hot sauce. It is REALLY REALLY spicy. I mean it.
