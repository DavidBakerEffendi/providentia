Can't go wrong with fresh fries! This hole-in-the wall fries place serves up fresh cooked fries with a variety of sauces. My friend and I got the poutine first, which was good, but I do wish there was some meat on it. That's the only thing I felt was a bit lacking compared to other poutine fries I've tried. There was a PayPal special going on too and we found out we could sign up and get a $5 credit, so we got another order of regular fries with the Especial sauce (frites sauce, ketchup and raw onion). Good, but there was too much sauce globbed on the top. A good place to go to for a quick snack. Not much seating inside though.
