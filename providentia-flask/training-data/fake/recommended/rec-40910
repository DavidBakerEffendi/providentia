I love BBQ so when I learned that G. Lee's BBQ opened up in my neighborhood, I had to try their St. Louis ribs.  I've had ribs from other BBQ joints and I must say that G. Lee's St. Louis ribs are very good.  The meat was nice and tender and very filling. They get a thumbs up on the ribs.......but a thumbs down on the service. We had to wait nearly an hour (no kidding) for our ribs.  Other food items on the menu seem to take less time.  But the ribs took forever.  Too long of a wait in my opinion.  When my wife mentioned to the pit master/owner that maybe he needs to put something on the table (i.e. bread or muffins) to tie customers over when they have to wait so long for their food, he bristled at the suggestion saying that "We [G. Lee's] would have to pay for that".  Not an encouraging response.  I've had faster service at Dinosaur BBQ and Hill Country. My advice?  Don't go there hungry expecting a quick turn around for ribs.  You should ask them how long the wait will be first before sitting down.
