We picked this place almost randomly for lunch and I'm glad we did. The staff and atmosphere were great. I've seen some postings that the portion/cost ratio wasn't great, but I had no complaints. The quality and presentation was impeccable. It was a beautiful say to enjoy the comfortable outdoor seating. The food was creative, rich and filling. We only had salads for lunch, but between the little round chicken medallions cooked to a perfect crisp and the cheese croutons we got more than we expected from such a simple choice. If you want a really nice lunch experience at a fair price then this is the place. They've only been around for a couple of months and I was surprised they weren't busier. I hope they stick around, we're looking forward to coming back for dinner.
