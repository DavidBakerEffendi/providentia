I've been waiting to try Garces Trading Company for a while since I love all the other Garces places that I've tried so I made reservations during Restaurant Week. It was busy and the place is pretty cramped but overall I liked the cozy and rustic atmosphere. The hostess wasn't as friendly as I'm used to but it was a busy night so I didn't mind much. Our waiter was fine, very attentive and helpful with the menu. We started out with the cheese plate and charcuterie plate. Both were great and worked really well together. I enjoyed the accompaniments a lot.. spicy mustard, great pickles, jams and lavender honey. We then had the pasta fagioli and margarita pizza. I assumed I'd love the pizza and want to hoard it to myself and that I'd be fine with just a bite of the pasta fagioli since I'm not much of a soup person. However, the pasta fagioli proved to be AMAZING.. we could not stop eating it and were so sad when it was finished. The pizza was very disappointing. Absolutely no flavor, the crust was very doughy and the temperature was almost cold. Was very surprised!! Our entrees were the steak frites and scallops over risotto. Both were excellent. The steak was cooked perfectly and the accompanying sauce was awesome. The scallops were not too chewy and seasoned well but the risotto was the real standout of the dish. For dessert we both got the chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream (the actual name and description are a lot fancier but oh well!).. not out of this world but a nice, sweet ending to a mostly delicious meal. I would definitely go back to GTC!
