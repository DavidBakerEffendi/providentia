After looking on Yelp for some suggestions of a place to go out for dinner, I came upon this.  Based on the reviews, it sounded pretty good, and I figured that at the very least, it would be something a little bit different for everybody. It's worth noting, that of the three of us in our party, none of us are vegans at all, and I'm the only one who's even something of a vegetarian. Well, the reviews weren't lying...this place is pretty much awesome.  The food was absolutely delicious, and the entrees were only $10.  Of course, we also got appetizers, beer and desserts--so it did add up a bit--but everything is still reasonably priced. The beer list is pretty extensive, the appetizers were almost the best part of the whole meal (definitely don't leave without getting the $5 mushroom/chickpea "nuggets"), and even the vegan chocolate fudge cheesecake was great.  Seriously, I'm not a dessert guy when I go to restaurants, and the only reason I ordered it was because we were so impressed with everything we had thus far.
