I ordered the roast pork sandwich (wet!) and was completely amazed.  I originally wanted the italian style pulled pork sandwich, but they ran out.  The lady behind the counter said the roast pork and roast beef sandwiches are their specialties so hearing that, I ordered the roast pork sandwich.  I heard the guy next to me order his sandwich wet, with sharp provolone, so I did the same.  It was so good!!!   The sandwich was 8 or 10 inches long.. so a lot of food.  Lots of moist roast pork and its juices on top of the bread roll.  Delicious to the last bite.  Though the bread got soggy, I didn't care.
