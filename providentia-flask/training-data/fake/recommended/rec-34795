This place wasn't bad but I definitely didn't love it. A friend and fellow foodie was visiting from India and she but me in charge of finding a brunch place in Philly. I am not from the area so checked Yelp and settled on this place based on reviews. The place is loud and you feel sort of crammed into the restaurant. The ambiance leaves something to be desired. The staff on the other hand is super nice and very accommodating. My friend came with two huge bags and they checked them in for her without hesitation. Â  We ordered the tomato tart, the Mac and cheese, and the French toast. The tomatoe tart was okay and the french toast was too heavy and just not that good. The Mac and cheese on the other hand was super delicious.
