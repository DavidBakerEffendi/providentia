I think Agavé has the best guacamole! Make sure you stop by the tequila bar during Happy Hour - It's awesome! They have a lot of variety.  One time, we went there in a large group and I was pleased that the service was very prompt - They offered us a buffet style lay out, which worked out very well. I wouldn't really recommend Agavé for a sit down romantic-like dinner, as it gets a little loud from time to time - I think it's more conducive for a group of ppl and for Happy Hour
