Great food and very nice waitstaff. New chef (one month in) is going to do some amazing things. Menu changes with the season. Not too expensive, given some of the price inflation happening in Park Slope right now. Pros: Nice wine list. Unfiltered french sparkling cidre which you rarely see on wine lists. Affordable wine list. Apps are very interesting and good. The squid salad, raviolo and egg/mushroom apps were delicious when I went. Ramps were in season and also very good. Cons: Place is kind of small so if there is a big party, it can get loud, but its BK so they might ask you to join the party. This is a good place in Park Slope. Do yourself a favor a go here during one of the nights the new chef is there. He's got some very good ideas.
