Really, really great food.  It tastes traditional!  I went here with my family and enjoyed splitting the Plato Don, Entree of Guac, taquitos and the roast half chicken (very small) .  We loved it here and while the on tap margaritas are pricey, they are absolutely worth it!  Only downside --It was super loud and my family had a hard time hearing each other.  We found the perfect solution to that issue--DELIVERY.
