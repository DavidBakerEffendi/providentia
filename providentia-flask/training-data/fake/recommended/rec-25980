Amazing Margherita pizza. Their crust is the way pizza should always be made. Service, not so great, i understand when people don't like their jobs, but its not the customer's fault (Attitude not the best and also forgetting a item when the order only had 3 items and 2 drinks? lame). That said i'm not a fan of communal dining either, i like my own table or i'll sit at the bar. The food is the star in this bushwick hangout!
