My roast pork and broccoli rabe sandwich was pretty amazing. Too bad I'm lactose intolerant as I had to order my sandwich sans provolone. The meat and greens was good enough though. Very juicy and flavorful. I've never had rabe before I ate that sandwich but it was pretty good. I asked the lady at the counter for a side of spicy mustard and she looked at me like I was nuts. I put a smear of mustard on my sandwich after every other bite. It was absolutely great. The line at the DiNic's counter went very quickly even though there were 10 bazillion people in line. Now I just have to try the other contenders from the Best Sandwich in America show and make my own judgement. ;)
