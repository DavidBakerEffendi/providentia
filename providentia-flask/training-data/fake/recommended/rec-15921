This place is amazing.  Try the sangria, it is really good.  I wish I got a pitcher because they go down quick.  Get the spreads they are SOOOOOO good.  I had the Chicken Souvlaki that was also SOOOO good.  I cant wait to go back.  Service was pretty good and we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated.
