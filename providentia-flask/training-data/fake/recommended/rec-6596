I must have walked by Pylos a million times on my way to get arepas at Caracas on the corner, but never stopped in until a coworker wouldn't stop raving about it.  It was a Friday and I somehow snagged a reservation for the next night.  My friend and I had prepared ourselves all day by reading the menu online but it still took a pretty long time to decide because everything sounds really delicious.  Our waiter was super nice and helpful, and this is what we finally decided on: Roasted red pepper filled with spicy feta whipped with sweet and hot peppers (Amazing, especially with the hot pita they serve when you sit down) Savory phyllo pastries filled with the spiced, cured beef pasturma, fresh tomatoes and mild kasseri cheese (I liked these but my friend wasn't impressed.  They could have used more filling.) Classic grilled whole fresh fish, dressed with extra-virgin olive oil and fresh lemon juice (The fish that night was branzino- it was light and delicious, especially with the herb olive oil served with it.  But it was just a fish on a plate, could have used a side dish) Classic braised short ribs, in spicy xinomavro red wine, served with porcini mushroom potato puree (Heavenly.. so tender and they fell completely off the bone.  The potato/mushroom puree was the perfect side.) Roasted potatoes seasoned with lemon, oregano, garlic and extra-virgin olive oil (Kind of like the best french fries you've ever had) Overall it was a totally delicious dinner and we left full and satisfied.  I think I hyped it up in my head a little bit too much and that set me up for a SLIGHT disappointment.  But I will go back to give Pylos a second chance to give me that OMG BEST MEAL OF MY LIFE experience that I've heard from a lot of people.
