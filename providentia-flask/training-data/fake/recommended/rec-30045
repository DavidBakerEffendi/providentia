I'm always nervous to go out to dinner with an established chef, especially when I choose the place.  It better damn well be good because I'll hear about it if it's not.  I immediately loved the scene and the hostess was laid back and sweet.  We were sat at one of the bar tables-- a sort of built in wooden booth.  It took us a while to order but the bartender was patient with us. For dinner we started with the Chick Corea salad with escarole, chick peas and ditalini-- the pasta was very undercooked (this coming from a huge fan of very al dente pasta) but the escarole was fresh and dressed very simply with lemon and olive oil.  The salad would have done well without the pasta, in my opinion-- but still very refreshing and good. We had the Red, White And Greenberg pizza-- which was delicious.  Perfectly salty and sour with the guanciale and onions.  Really excellent right out of the oven.  We also had the Rooftop Red pizza-- really simple and light and "healthy" (those are some really loose quotation marks, lets just say healthier than most of the other pizzas).  My companion, smart man that he is, kept commenting on how awesome the dough was-- it really is AWESOME.  Pizzas are the perfect size for 2-- or 1, but I didn't  tell him I could house a whole pizza, how very un-ladylike. Paulie Gee also stopped by the table, looking sort of like the dad in Curb Your Enthusiasm but younger and much cooler.  I like this place and I like Paulie's whole schpiel.  I will be back.
