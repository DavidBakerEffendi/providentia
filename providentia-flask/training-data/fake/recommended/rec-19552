Sabrina's is not a diner.  Don't treat it like one.  Be ready to wait, and to deal with the Hostess who sits outside and never smiles, but has her act together.  She's like the soup Nazi.  She knows Sabrina's is ridic, and if you don't like waiting for an outrageous meal, then you can get the hell off her list and make room for the next party.  She takes no prisoners, and I don't blame her. When they finally call your name, you feel like you just got picked to go into Studio 54.  Everyone around you is jealous, they all look like they want to punch you and steal your table.  And rightfully so, as they know you are sitting down to have a ridiculous meal. Everything is good.  You want suggestions?  Get everything, but extra of the Cheddar and Jalapeno Polenta Fries, because they are the one item that I could eat constantly, and not care if others judged me for it.  Whether you go breakfast or lunch, you won't be disappointed.  Never been for dinner, but I hear good things. The waiters and waitresses are cooler than you'll ever be, myself included.  They are not arrogant or stuffy, they are just cooler.  The dudes have tattoos and Mohawks, and well so do the chicks.  There are no standard uniforms and they are all much more artsy than you or me could ever be.  I've yet to have a bad customer service experience there.  Food is always hot, service is always friendly.  They acknowledge that you've been waiting awhile and respect that fact that you're ready to boogie down with some stuffed French toast and veggie frittata.  For two people you can usually get away with a $25 check. Go here, you'll dig it.  Be nice to the hostess, or it's "no soup for you, 1 year!"
