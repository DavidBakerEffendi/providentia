Been here twice and was twice disappointed. The gumbo was bland and nowhere near to tasting like New Orleans, though the corn bread was good. Had the shrimp po boy that was supposed to be on French bread but came on a sandwich roll that tasted like a hotdog bun. It only had 5-6 shrimp that still had the tails on. The side of potato salad was good but not worth 4$
