Sorry to break it to you, America, but you don't know s$%^ about pizza. It f@#$%% sucks. There, I said it. The stuff that is being served at 99,99% of pizza places in this country is an insult to the whole grail of pizza making. Pauly Gee's is among the 0,01% that gets it. It is unbelievably delicious. They have a broad selection of both classic and new "creative" pizzas. We tried one with pickled grapes and cheddar that was amazing, and one vegan pizza with fennel sausage which was also incredibly good. The staff was un-attentive and slow, but the pizza good enough to give them a 5-star review. You have to check this place out.
