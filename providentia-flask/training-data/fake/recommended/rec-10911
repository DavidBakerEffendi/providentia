I love this place!  It's small, unpretentious, consistent, reasonably priced, and serves really great, healthy seafood provencal style with some comfort (fried oysters, mashed potatoes, and french fries) foods on the side.  I love that I can go across the street and pick up a nice bottle of Sancerre or Poilly Fume and bring it in and they happily put in ice for me....  my only wish is that they had some nice seasonal greens for sides instead of the garden veg which are standard on the plates.  Desserts are great too!  mmmmmmmmmmmm Don M.
