I am willing to try this place again--once you are inside the atmosphere is nicer than it looks from the outside and the service and prices are fine.  We ate here on a Saturday at 5:30 and the restaurant was nearly empty.   The food was kind of bland for our taste, but (with the exception of one pesky fly) everything seemed clean and maintained.  We got a Veg. platter as an appetizer and the vegetable pakora was  very good (the samosas and panneer pakora tasted like they might have been reheated.)  We also enjoyed the Mango lassi.
