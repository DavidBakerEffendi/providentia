My friend and I found ourselves in Philly for a concert and we extended our stay in order to explore the city and it's food. We had the good fortune of being in the city during resteraunt week. After a morning spent walking the city and visiting the Magic Garden I was hungry for some yummy fresh food. My trusty Yelp App found Barbuzzo for me! We arrived on a Monday at 1:00. The place was packed! The hostess was very polite when I told her we didn't have reservations, she suggested we could find a spot at the bar. We gladly did. The bartender whipped up a delicious French Farmer martini for me on the spot. He may be my new best friend ;) Everyone around us had a pizza and I was seriously tempted but they also had an intriguing anti pasta plate with all veggies. I ordered that and never looked back on the pizza! Since it was Resteraunt Week in the city the chef had a tasting menu available. My friend ordered the tasting, with chicken and mash potatoes. She enjoyed every hearty bite. For dessert she had the salted caramel and it was out of this world. The service was outstanding and friendly. I mentioned to the bartender that it was my friends birthday and he brought another dessert out for her with a candle in it. Very thoughtful. We never felt rushed by the staff even though they were obviously very busy. I would love to try this place again if I ever find myself back in Philly!
