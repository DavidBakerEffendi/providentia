I took away a star since parking is so bad. They should invest in a valet service. Otherwise the seafood is fresh and tasty and the decor is very nice and tasteful. The owners Sharon and Chris go out of their way to offer a memorable experience. The drinks are super and very well mixed. Nothing is lacking here. The crowd is very mixed with many different races and all will feel welcomed. Local celebrity residents are known to make an appearance all the time. Dress smart and smile!!!!!
