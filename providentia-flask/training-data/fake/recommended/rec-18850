I visited Laduree on the suggestion of a friend who shares my affinity for gourmet sweets. Laduree needs some serious reworking to earn a favorable rating from this Yelper. Call me spoiled, but I've been enjoying macaroons (or Nicolette's as we called them at Wegman's) for about a decade. However, I don't ever remember paying $3 for ONE single piece. Yes they're delicious. They're exquisite. But Laduree can do a few things to increase their volume and drop the price. First, put your cash register on the right side of the counter so that I don't have to awkwardly weave back through the line to get out the door. It's called "traffic flow," Laduree. Make a better loop. Second, don't give me a $3 card-stock, rope-handled bag with every order. Ask if it's a gift? Ask if I even need it? Maybe I only need $.05 paper bag to carry them to Neil's Coffee Shop since Laduree offers nowhere to sit so I may enjoy their overpriced products. Ditch the bags and drop the price! Yes, I know packing is part of the presentation. I suppose I come from a land where excessive packaging is considered wasteful. I could not believe that some people were buying $40, $80 and even $100 worth of these treats when there is no bulk discount offered for even a half-dozen count. I suppose Laduree is just an example of the extravagant side of New York, a side I will not be revisiting.
