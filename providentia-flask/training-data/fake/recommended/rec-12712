Hagi is an izakaya I was introduced to years ago when I went with some friends of a friend to see Wicked. It's in the theater district, on 49th between 6th and 7th. I loved it because it is so different from the other options in the area. Some of that uniqueness seemed to fade as it became more known, but it is still a world away from the world in Times Square. If you're familiar with Japanese pub food you can find something you will like, such as yakitori or noodles. I am a creature of habit there-- I almost always got the seafood pancake, okonomiyaki.Â However, the drink (if I got one) I would pick randomly. If Hagi is packed, the restaurant next door is fine. There is no use waiting around for hours, unless you have somewhere else to go in the meantime (they will call you) or feel like hanging out in the stairwell.
