It's a giant burrito. Sometimes, a giant burrito is just a giant burrito, not rocket science. I can't say I'd be able to tell the difference between this or Chipotle if I were blindfolded, but um...who cares? I guess my standards are low - the only thing I don't like it chewy gross bits of meat. El Fuego did not serve me chewy gross meat, so I was happy. Oh, I tried the crunchy tacos and got one with each kind of filling. I have to say that the chorizo was by far the tastiest and I imagine I'll get that next time I go. It's a block away from where I live, it's dinner for under $10, there's happy hour every week night from 5-7 and it's fast. I think that equals four thumbs up.
