My Favorite Pizza!  Even though I no longer live here in the area, when I come back home, this is the first place I visit.  My family has been eating here for over 30 years, back when they used to be on the other side of town.  All of the food is authentic italian and is a mom and pop shop.  The pizza is unbelievable.  You will not be disappointed.
