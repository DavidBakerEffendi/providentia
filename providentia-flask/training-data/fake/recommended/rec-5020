Went to Morgan's for the the first time last night for dinner before the John Legend concert at the Barclay's Center. It was amazing! Sat at the bar instead of waiting for a table and it was fine. The bartender was super nice and fast. The pork ribs were outrageous, meat fell right off the bone. The fatty brisket was amazing as well. Also ordered the brisket tacos, but they were too spicy (my fault I didn't ask before ordering) and the corn bread. Now I am a cornbread lover but this one was not for me because it was made with peppers in it. Also had the mac-n-cheese side which was good. Had a beer, very light and smooth. Over all the food was great as was the service. The one thing that made it a 5 for me was I told the bartender that I didn't like the cornbread and that we couldn't eat the tacos because they were too spicy and they didn't charge us for it which I loved. Courtesy like that goes a very long way and it is definitely a very smart business move because it will keep customers coming back. Will definitely go back there again soon, definitely to get more ribs and want to try the pulled pork. Great place.
