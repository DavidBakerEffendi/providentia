FTR Suckas!!! =P I was impressed and I'm a fan of Sushi You! Sushi You is a solid 4 Star restaurant. Service is fast and friendly.  Fish is fresh. Prices are reasonable. We were the first patrons on a cool Wednesday night (11/18/09). The restaurant is small and seats a maximum of ~20 and was eventually 3/4 full. I was surprised to find out that they get a lot of take-out and delivery business. We ordered many things but the stand-outs were: * Yellowtail Handroll - (~$4) Nori was crisp, the rice was sweet and vinegary, the fish was fresh. Sushi You adds a twist with Tempura crunch in this handroll. If I stop here, this restaurant is 5 STAR. * Xanadu Roll - (~$12) Yellowtail & Salmon sashimi over Tuna and cucumber roll. Tasty and fresh - 8 pieces of YUM!  (4 STARS) Unfortunately, they do not seem to serve beer or wine. But a small serving of complimentary Sake is available. If it weren't for the 4 hour delay of UA Flight 95 from Newark to San Francisco, Lynette and I would not have gotten a chance to eat at this great restaurant and hear some exciting news! Congrats to yelp.com/user_details?us… Dirk and Pia! (+1 STAR) pix laters...! check'em out! I'll be back when I'm in the area!
