I really hate to do this. I really do. I wish I could leave another star for ambience and drinks but the service is so atrocious that it trumps the delicious cocktails and decent food. I'm in no mood to go into depth about my experience because it makes me cringe. Since I myself am involved in the restaurant and service industry it always makes me unbelievably sad when a restaurant with immense potential fails at the simplest task. SERVICE. It's obvious that whoever is running this joint is a hot mess. Therefore, the staff follows suite. Everyone seems confused and disoriented and I can imagine why. 3 servers asking me for my order at different times is strange enough but when I asked for a manager they told me she was bartending and not able to talk?? Is that even allowed? Weird. But the cocktails are good.
