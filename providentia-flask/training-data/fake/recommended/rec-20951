Stopped in for breakfast to see what this new spot is all about. I have to say I was very impressed for a business just getting on their feet. Service was friendly and prompt. I ordered eggs Benedict which were delicious! not too much Hollandaise, crispy English muffin, and perfectly poached eggs. The manager Tom also came over to make sure everything was up to par which I found was a nice personal touch. He informed me that they will be making some updates to the decor which I am very excited to see. Will definitely be back to see how this place progresses!
