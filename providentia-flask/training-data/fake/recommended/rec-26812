The Chicken and Rice cart is genius. For $6, you can get a huge takeout of Halal meat, rice, salad, and pita bread. It's a wonderful concoction. I think the white sauce is the secret ingredient. It makes the whole plate taste so much better. The cart opens at 7:30 PM and lines already start at around 7 PM. Here's a tip. There's a Halal cart open right across the street and there's barely any waits. It's the same as the Chicken and Rice cart that everyone else waits in line for. If you're brave enough, walk the road less traveled. You won't be disappointed. In fact, you might snicker at the rest of the people who are waiting on the other line.
