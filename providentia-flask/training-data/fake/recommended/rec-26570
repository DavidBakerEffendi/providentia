This was my first time here. The restaurant has  a very friendly atmosphere. I sat by the bar and the  bartender was very nice and attentive.  There were a few other patrons.  The place was pretty empty but it was a weekday and pretty late. A nice gentleman invited us to a drink which we thought was a nice gesture. He seemed to be the owner or atleast the manager because there were pictures of him with other people all over the bar. This is one of the few bars that sells "coquito" which is a coconut cream and Puertorican rum drink. Overall it was a pleasant experience.
