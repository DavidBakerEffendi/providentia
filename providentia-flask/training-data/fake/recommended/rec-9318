I heard so many great things about this place, I had to try it for myself. I had my birthday dinner here earlier this month and it was very successful. Although my party was reduced my half due to the pouring rain, the manager was still able to quickly make the necessary adjustments to accommodate my party. We waited no more than 10 minutes to be seated despite our last minute changes. I didn't have to pay for the guests who didn't show up and no one seemed annoyed by my guests not showing up but me lol. The place is beautiful and very popular apparently. Â There were two other parties celebrating birthdays. The space was a little crowded but we were all comfortable. The food did not take long at all taking into consideration that it was 15 of us. The food was delicious. No complains from any of my guests. Our waiter was the best! Thank you Vicente, my birthday was amazing!
