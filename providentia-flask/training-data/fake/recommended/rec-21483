This place did not meet my expectations at all. Heard it was decent from a few locals but I would disagree. Went on a Monday night and it was pretty slow. We had a group of six so it was automatic gratuity and so our waitress probably decided to not care because she was getting the tip no matter what. She never refilled drinks and just sat in the corner with four other FOH staff and they just sat and talked and completely ignored us. Instead of answering simple questions she told us to look harder on the menu. The only person who was helpful was a back waiter or busser. Overall I would never return on account of that crappy hospitality.
