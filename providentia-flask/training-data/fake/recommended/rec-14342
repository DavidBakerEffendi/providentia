I don't understand how a restaurant can get a larger order that may take some extra time to prepare and can't just call and say "Hey man, big order. Might be a little longer." I'd be fine with that. More than fine with it. PSP however, do not communicate. What I want you to know is that instead, they leave you hanging for 90 minutes and when you call them, this is the conversation that happens: "Prince Street Pizza" "Hi, I'm calling to follow up on an order I placed a little over an hour ago." "Yeah, gonna be 30 minutes." "Oh. I was quoted an hour for delivery." "Well, we gotta lot of orders." "I wish you guys would have called to tell me." "Well, what do you want from me? We gotta lot of orders. I'm sorry." (HANGS UP) I also want you to know that happens after another 30 minutes. When the delivery guy does shows up, he slams the pizzas down on your conference room table and huffily acts like you demanded he come to a remote Siberian military base in the middle of the night with pizzas you requested be cooked in his kitchen at home, even though it's actually 2:00pm and you called a pizzeria, a place known for their ability to make pizzas, and paid them to do so. I fully recognize where I messed up. Maybe my order was bigger than usual. But come on PSP. You make pizza. It's what you do. Being upset that I put an order in and NOT COMMUNICATING about it with me and then showing up late and being rude to me is as utter and complete a failure as I can possibly imagine. No, that's not true - you could have brought me hamburgers. Then it would have been a complete failure. Who cares if the pizza was good or bad. PSP, you gotta talk to people.
