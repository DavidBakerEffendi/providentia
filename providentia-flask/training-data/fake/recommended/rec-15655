This place was fantastic. I took my boyfriend for his birthday dinner. He got the short ribs which had amazing flavor and his favorite part- no bones! I had to try the gnocchi de ricotta. Unreal. Such great flavors. My only downfall was that the meal was so rich in flavor I could only finish half of my plate. The ambiance was great, casual, and welcoming. I definitely recommend this restaurant!
