best chicken and rice cart I ever been too! thank you jesus is walking distance from my job. I just cant tolerate the lines.. try and go off-peak times! dont know if there is such a thing but if you dont mind it, it will still be worth it! becareful of the hot sauce.. just a drop feels like a ball of fire!
