A+ Dine in service. No wait staff, although great employees and environment. Tables have advertisements for local business in that town. A+ Food taste One employee was so entertaining, he started singing and cooking. Casual dining and delivery.  I haven't tried their delivery service, although would recommend while shopping on main street to get a quick bite to eat here. Reasonable prices considering the town. I believe it is $2.25 for a slice of pizza with one topping.   B+ Very clean dining area
