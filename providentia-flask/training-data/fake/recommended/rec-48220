After leaving the Phillies game, I was walking around with my YELP app open, sweat dripping down my calves trying to figure out which cheesesteak place I should hit up . Of course Pat's and Geno's had the two most reviewed places, but they also had some of the worst reviews....Seriously, Geno's has over 1200 reviews and are 2.5 stars? Yeah, I don't care if they are famous, I'm not dropping 11 bucks for a mediocre cheesesteak and poor service. Found this place Phillip's instead on Yelp and that's how I decided where I was going...so thank you Philly yelpers for that. Anyways, after locking my doors and passing pawn shops and a western union I found this shining beauty. Got a cheesesteak ($8) with provolone and onions, came out fresh, tasty and with manners. Â The meat was tender and there was a swell proportionate of mushrooms. I'm glad I went here to get my cheesesteak fix, it definitely deserves more props. Just because you aren't famous, doesn't mean you aren't delicious.
