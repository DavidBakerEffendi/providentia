If I can, I pretty much eat at Siggys at least once a week. I was eating the quinoa avocado salad with salmon burger for quite a while and I recently changed to the live earth salad. But I love their beef stew for dinner or their salmon special is always what I'm craving! The sweet potato fries ain't to shabby either. I just wish they were open on Sundays! But people need their rest I know. My friend had the eggplant lasagna which had the perfect amount of sauce for anyone who is obsessed with tomato sauce. He certainly ate the whole thing. The pricing is pretty right on and I always leave feeling good and healthy. Huge fan.
