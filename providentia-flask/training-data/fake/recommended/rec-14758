I've been up and down the state of New Jersey and have eaten at diners along the way.  I was very disappointed with my visit and I usually don't expect much from a diner.  I was there for breakfast with a co-worker.  The older gentleman who sat us did't seem very pleasant and friendly.  Here is what struck me the most about this diner.  The menu is probably back from the 1980's.  Not the menu itself, but the offerings on it.   They offer pancakes with sausage, bacon, ham, etc. They offer French Toast and Waffles with the same as well.  They didn't offer pancakes, waffles, or French Toast with any kind of fruit.  No blueberries, strawberries, bananas, chocolate chips, walnuts, etc.  That is a staple in every diner I have ever been to.  I was hoping for pancakes but I didn't order them because I didn't want plaln pancakes with meat.  I stuck to the broccoli omelette. Portion size was good but it was typical diner.  Coffee wasn't bad.  Service was good.  I wouldn't go back only because I love pancakes, waffles, and French Toast, but I like them with some type of fruit with it.  The price was really cheap.  $14.40 for the table before the tip. .  We each had an omelette and I had coffee.
