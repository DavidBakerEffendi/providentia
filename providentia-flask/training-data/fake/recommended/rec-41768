Love it, love it love it. Three reasons to frequent Barboncino: 1) great service. Friendly, knowledgable bartenders and waiters. Always accommodating even when it's crowded and always working hard to fulfill your order. 2) great pizza/drinks at great prices. Their happy hour (both evening and at 11pm) is too good to be true. Their draft beer selection is solid. Not impressed by their appetizers, but have loved every pizza I've tried here. The crust is impeccable. 3) cozy, quiet interior. Classy, non-pretentious, non-smug vibe.
