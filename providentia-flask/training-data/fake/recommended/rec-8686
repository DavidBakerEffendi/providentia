I recommend the hot eggplant and the duck shawarma. The server will push the overpriced entrees, I ordered the lamb kabob entree and it was Â 34$ and the size of an appetizer. Just get the mezas , maybe 5 or 6 for 2 people is good. Everyone talks about brussels sprouts but they don't taste like brussel sprouts so unless you wanted to prove to your mom you're eating your brussel sprouts then don't bother with that item. The ambiance is nice, although the tables are very close together. Check out the restroom, it's an interesting extra where there's no women's/'men's just individual bathrooms.
