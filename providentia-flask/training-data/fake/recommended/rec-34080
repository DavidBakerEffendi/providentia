This would be a five star review if it were not for a couple of issues. They run out of food later in the day and may be closed at what appears to be random times.  I guess the problem is scarcity; I want more and when I want it.  I have only ever ordered the corned beef, which is excellent, and I have tried the pastrami, which is also excellent.  And relatively inexpensive for cured and smoked meats in NYC.  Although this year they have increased the prices of the there sandwiches by a dollar, you can still get a decently sized "small" sandwich for $6.  (I'm a large kind of guy).
