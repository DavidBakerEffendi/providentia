This place is def worthy of 5 stars. Have been here 3 x's, didn't have to wait as I had arrived before the 'rush' which i guess is around 7ish and on. The line on our way out however was ridiculous. Please try the patatas bravas and the jamon croquettes - they are the best i have ever had! I didn't find this place any more expensive than other tapas joints around the city.
