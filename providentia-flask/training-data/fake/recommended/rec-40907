This place blew my expectation out of the water! Came here the other night thinking I was just going to grab a sandwich and ended up getting a little bit of everything because we just couldn't decide!!! We have since tried almost everything on the menu and I would say my stand out dishes would be the lobster ragout, short rib, lobster roll, catfish with bacon sandwich, and the arugula salad! I'm probably leaving a few items off but seriously you just can't go wrong! If you're lucky and you're able to grab one of the few seats in house the staff is more than friendly from the cashier to chef and even dishwasher! This is a great secret gem in the heart of crown heights and we can only hope they will expand their business into different neighborhoods or get a food truck going!
