I've been to El Camino twice. The first time I ran into friends there, and we ended up playing dominos, drinking tequila, and enjoying the nachos. As I recall, the service was good. The second time was a more cozy dinner post-blizzard with a friend. We enjoyed the food immensely; I took a chance on cactus burritos and was not disappointed at all. My companion got one of the specials, chicken and waffles (weird to a northerner like me), and she loved 'em. Again, the nachos. So good. We shared a pitcher of sangria - also yummy. Service was killer. I think her name was Devu... I glimpsed it on the check but never asked. Anyway. My only complaint was that the music was a little loud for the dinner hour crowd. They were playing some throwback hits, though, which Ginger and I thoroughly enjoyed. We'll be back for brunch next!
