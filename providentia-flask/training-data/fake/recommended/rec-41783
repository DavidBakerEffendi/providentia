We order take out dinners from here once every 2 weeks or so. We honestly can't remember the last time we actually ate there- the place is always so crowded there's at least a 30 minute wait on a weeknight where we end up going home and getting it delivered faster. But that said, the food is definitely tasty and at a great price for it being "fancy Mexican." Here are our "go to's": chicken enchiladas with salsa verde, the aquacate con queso torta, the bistec torta, ceviche de camarones, taquitos, smoked fish guacamole (a special), pollo al horno, and the flan. The only things we honestly would never order again are their soups (tortilla soup and black bean soup). And only order the elotes callejeros when corn is in season, otherwise it's just mushy and tasteless. But when the corn is good, it's amazing! Every so often, they forget parts of our order. A little more often, the food containers get crushed and black beans get all over the place. They should really invest in cardboard separators! Only real downside of ordering delivery is we can't get their awesome drinks!
