A friend and I went to fare for dinner last night. She had been telling me about it. And for good reason! We had the hummus... So good! And the hummus was topped with these crazy good olives! (I know doesn't sound that crazy, but I work with fine foods and know my olives... These were really good!) Next we had the grilled octopus salad. And I was taken back... At first i thought that our server (who was wonderful mind you!) and given us the wrong dish. The octopus was so soft that I thought it was chicken! Blew my mind!!!! Then I had the vegetable cakes. It came with two cakes a mushroom cake and a carrot cake. The mushroom cake was great.... However it had nothing on that carrot cake! My friend had the soft shell crab and she said she loved it! Now I have never written a review on yelp... But this place is so good! And I can't wait to go back!!!! Also they have a wonderful wine and beer list. Tons of seafood and vegetarian food. Really some thing for every one... More places should be as welcoming to people of all diets! Thank you fare!!!! Ya'll kick ass!!!!
