I would give Uva a 4.5 if i could -- not quite a 5 but slightly better than a 4.   I dined at uva on a wednesday night, at around 7pm, which i would say is pretty early for dinner, and the place was already relatively crowded.  We waited about 5 minutes for a table for 2 and got seated in the adorable outside patio.  Our waitress was great -- very familiar with the food and pronounced everything perfectly -- and she suggested a fabulous effervescent wine for us.  My friend and I were very hungry so we started with the regular bruschetta, the stuffed eggplant rolls and the mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto.  Yum.  We had trouble choosing between all the amazing sounding apps but those were definitely not bad decisions.  The mozz+prosciutto was a bit salty but thats to be expected and the apps were a bit cold, but they arrived really quickly so i guess you have to pick your battles.  For my main course I got the ravioli casarecci stuffed with prosciutto and mozzarella in a pink sauce with subtle chunks of tomato and artichoke which was amazing.  The dish was perfectly balanced and nothing overpowered the other ingredients.  My friend got the special which was a seafood pasta dish in a pink sauce that looked great as well.  The portions were good, as we were stuffed to the brim but we finished every bite.  After 3 appetizers and an entree we passed on dessert but I would love to go back and try some, because if they're anything like the rest of the food i'm sure they're amazing too.  We ended up paying about $60 each which is a bit steep for a casual dinner, but we got a solid amount of food and i would say it was well worth it. Uva is a lovely spot for a nice and easy dinner.  The food and atmosphere are both great , and although its not cheap, its not expensive either, and its probably some of the best Italian food you'll be able to find in the area at that price point.  Nothing blew my mind but everything was above average.  I will definitely be back!
