Hell's Kitchen is surround by Thai place. Yum Yum, Bangkok Thai, Tai Thai... that's just in a two block radius. The interior is what really sells the place. Black and White art deco, surrounded by glass that allows natural lighting and it's dining area is huge. I had the Pad See Euw Noodles which if you get the lunch special, it's $6.50 with an appetizer. Unbelievable.
