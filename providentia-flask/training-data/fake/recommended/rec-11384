Hello, Seitan Cheesesteak! What more could you ask for if you're a vegetarian (which I'm not)? And I still order it all the time. I think that says a lot about how good it is. I venture out and try some of their other selections (which have always been good), but I always return to the Seitan Cheesesteak. The Abbaye definitely boasts a following. They have good food and beer and the staff are always nice. Casual atmosphere, it's also good for groups and kids. Plus, they have sidewalk seating during the warmer months and you'll always find patrons with their dogs enjoying the day. The waitstaff also cater to the dogs by providing water dishes and ice. It's definitely one of my favorite bars.
