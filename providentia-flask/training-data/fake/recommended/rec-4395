Stopped here for a happy hour with a friend and left happy.  Fare takes its happy hour seriously, providing a fairly extensive happy hour menu that includes a happy hour food menu and discounts on all of their draft beers, some bottled beers, some house wines, and some cocktails. There are about half a dozen beers on tap.  The selection rotates and is bound to include at least a few beers you'd want to try.  There were at least four I wanted to try and I got to sample all of them.  They were all different kinds of great. For food, I tried the fish tacos -- which were adequate -- and the mushroom flatbread -- which was yummy.  There were certainly other food items I'd want to try on a future visit. The decor is modern and neat.  Service was friendly, though not always attentive.  Happy hour prices were very good.
