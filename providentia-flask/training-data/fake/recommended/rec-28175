Oooohhh, how l adore Petite Crevette! I have to internally sigh every time I think about it. I've been here a handful of times for a nice evening with the bf. The first time he took me here I was so pleasantly surprised. As soon as you walk in you know it's a special place and I love that it's a bit off the beaten path. The seafood counter in front is deceiving because once you walk through to the back, you're welcomed into a lovely little dining area (and by little, I mean little). The menu is based off what they have available. I've had clams, mussels, the seafood mix (lobster, shrimp, scallops) and the sea bass....soo soo delicious, tasty and seasoned right. The fact that they're BYOB is icing on the cake!
