Recommended by a dear friend during our recent trip to NYC. Beco is a small, warm place tucked in the heart (well, one of the ventricles) of Williamsburg, that hipster paradise, but Beco isn't at all pretentious. It's very cozy, and the staff is very friendly, quick with a recommendation for those of us not all that familiar with Brazilian cuisine that doesn't involve massive amounts of charred steak - not that I'm complaining. I thoroughly enjoyed the "feijoada," a black bean and meat stew complemented with rice, farofa (yucca flour), and couve (sauteed collard greens, which I loved), along with a pair of baked empanadas, and a plate of cheese bread, compliments of the house. Very enjoyable! My visit to Beco was also made better by the company of dear friends. I definitely want to go back to Beco the next time I'm in NYC.
