I'm always looking for a good cup of coffee wherever we visit. Square One impressed me with their regular cup of coffee ... so I went back and tried an iced coffee when we went back a couple weeks later. The iced coffee was on par with Peet's (my favorite). I've not tried any of the espresso drinks (not my style), but my son was happy with their mocha.
