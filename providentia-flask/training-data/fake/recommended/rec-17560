I had dinner there a couple of hours ago. I would strictly stick to the appetizers. My boyfriend and I had the Chorizo en Salsa de Vino Tinto and Tostones Rellenos de Ropa Vieja which were amazing! The way they cook the Chorizo in the wine makes it taste like heaven in your mouth and I was amazed that they made a little bowl out of the Tostones and filled it with Ropa Veja.  But our dinner was very bland. I had the Vaca Frita and I understand it's fried but it shouldn't be that greasy. It didn't sit right in my stomach. I've had Vaca Frita before at a different Cuban restaurant and it was so much better. My boyfriend had the Lechon Asado and it was very fatty and plain. It was a huge piece of lechon with skin and bones. There wasn't any seasoning. It came with a little cup of garlic butter or something. We've also had that at different restaurant and it was far better than it was here. Their beans are plain. Their maduros are great. Their rice is okay. Overall, it was okay but not amazing.  We skipped out on dessert because I didn't want to be disappointed any longer.  We should have brought wine for Sangria but it skipped our minds. They might be good with tea but real food is their downfall. I would have liked to just eat the appetizers and call it a day.  And holy hell it was way overpriced for the quality and taste. Needless to say, I won't be coming here anymore. If you want authentic and amazing Cuban food worth your taste buds and money go to Cuban Pete's in Montclair. Also, Cuban Pete's gives you bigger portions. Mambo had small portions. I felt like I was on a diet from how little I got. But I do have to say, I did like their decor. Sorry Mambo, but never again.
