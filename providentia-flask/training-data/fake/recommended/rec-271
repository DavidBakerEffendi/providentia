Visited Cascalote for dinner with the family. The restaurant is very small so I highly recommend reservations. The atmosphere is perfect for a date or get together with a few friends, Latin music and dark lighting for ambiance. We sampled lot's of different things on the menu, including the signature cocktail with grapefruit soda and tequila. It's awesome, you must try! The porkchops and salmon were also cooked perfectly. Fun atmosphere and great food. Can't wait to go back!
