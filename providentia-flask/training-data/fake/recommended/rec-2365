First date night in a very long time, and even longer before publishing my review. I was in the mood for scallops, and their scallop entree was delicious. Well seasoned, great coloring, and over a nicely cooked piece of sweet potato. The appetizers were also quite decent (although I can't recall exactly what I ordered). It was a bit strange in that the place was very empty, and while the servers did not make as many rounds as I'd like, they were also nice/polite, so I have little to complain about. Â Overall, it was a bit pricey, but I did enjoy my food very much, so it was worth it as a one time visit.
