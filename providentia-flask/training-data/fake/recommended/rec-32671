Went twice on last NYC trip, on June 22nd and 28th.  It is very different from our first time as it has expanded quite a bit.  It's nice though as there is room to sit, and the A/C was nice on a hot summer day.  I still kind of like the old tiny place though.  Unfortunately, the prices have "jumped" up to $ 0.25 (from $0.20) a dumpling! :)   The fried dumplings were good both times.  I liked both the pork and cabbage and the pork and chive.  The sesame pancakes were tasty both times as well. Unfortunately, while the shrimp dumplings were good the first time, they weren't so good the second time.  The boiled dumplings in general seemed slightly off the second time.  I also tried the steamed pork bun and it was pretty boring. Stick with the fried dumplings and the sesame pancakes.  Still can't beat the price.  The novelty for us has waned a bit, but I still like this place a lot for a quick and cheap lunch or snack.
