We stopped in here for dinner with some friends  while visiting the New Haven area. The place has little parking so you may need to search around to find a spot. The service was friendly, the dining room was clean and the seating was ample. I thought the pizza was good but my husband loved it. The bruschetta was also fresh and we all enjoyed it. The price was great! We got  a medium which was more than enough for my husband and I. It was plenty of good food for a great price.
