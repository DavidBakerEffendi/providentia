Well let's just say the beers are cheap and the meat is yummy! Went to this local corner dive for a burger and beer on a Sunday night, and it took almost an hour to get a table...but if you go, WAAAIIITT and get a table. The burger is pretty delicious and while you might get a delicious bacon cheese, feta, mushroom, egg, everything else you can think of burger elsewhere BUT the meat in this patty is better than most other places...and overall enjoyable!
