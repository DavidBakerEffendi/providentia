I sort of knew what to expect going in, tight seating with a possibility of a long wait. However we snagged a seat almost immediately. Great waiter who really knew his stuff and had no problem dealing with our being a bit indecisive. Had the the lobster roll, not amazing by any means- especially the hot dog roll, the cheddar and short rib fries, yummy, and the spicy popcorn shrimp, wow. Grabbed a couple of the smaller dishes afterwards, not out of hunger really, but wanted to try them out. The pickles were fantastic! Especially the ricotta thingy. My only issue was the hostess, who was directly in front of us and constantly texting. Really annoying and distracting. She hid the iphone from all the staff who went by her, including the hostess from next door, but didn't think that the customers should be shielded from her lack of professionalism.
