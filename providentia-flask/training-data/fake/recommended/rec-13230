I am not going to pretend like I know a lot of about this kind of food, I don't. What I do know is after trying a slew of noodle bars, Soba-Ya takes the crown. So fresh and so clean word to Andre Benjamin. That is this place in a nutshell. Prices are right and the menu is pretty overwhelming for people unfamiliar with the whole noodle phenomenon but keep ti simple. Nabeyaki Udon with with shrimp tempura is a home run every time. If you're in the lower East and want a cool atmosphere, Soba-Ya is the right call.
