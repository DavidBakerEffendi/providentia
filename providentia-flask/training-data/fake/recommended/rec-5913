Warning: once you've experienced Koch's, you'll never look at sandwiches the same way again! Seriously, it's that good. I really can't say anything that hasn't already been said numerous times in much better reviews than I am capable of writing, but I will sum it up for you in three words: Koch's is awesome. This not an ordinary deli, it is a west Philadelphia landmark. It almost doesn't matter what I order; if it's on the menu it will taste good. Most sandwiches will set you back eight to ten bucks, but it's well worth it. You can't get this quality anywhere else. The portions are huge and all the ingredients are as fresh as can be. If you don't know what you want, talk to the staff. They are knowledgeable, friendly, and know what they're doing. This deli is takeout only, although there are tables and chairs outside. There is free parking across the street in the CVS lot.
