This was my first time here. From the minute I walked in I knew this was no ordinary restaurant and bar. There was a large lunch crowd, and the menu had daily specials.They also serve dinner.You have a choice of sitting at the bar or the high top tables that surround it. If you want something a little more quiet they also have a dining room. My waitress came over immediately. She first took our drink order. They have many beers on tap and interesting micro brews.I tried a peanut butter, chocolate porter named Sweet Baby Jesus! At first I tasted peanut butter. On my second sip I tasted hits of chocolate. Then finally the porter. The Tiger's Tale has a nice lunch menu. They have an interesting selection of food from Alligator Sausage, German food , hot and cold sandwiches,burgers, chicken, salads etc. My favorite was the Grouper Ruben sandwich with fries. When my sandwich came out it was amazing! Fresh plump grouper on a marble rye bread. The grouper sandwich was topped with cole slaw, Russian dressing, and melted Swiss cheese oozing out of the sides. It was the perfect combination .The sandwich was huge! They don't skimp on any ingredients!! I was pleasantly surprised,the grouper melted in my mouth. I've eaten this sandwich many times living in Florida. I must say this was the best Grouper Ruben sandwich I have ever eaten. One of my friends ordered the alligator sausage hogie. It was also nicely done and seasoned. This item is unusual for this area. As we all were eating I saw many dishes coming out from the kitchen. The burgers and sandwiches looked great! The salads were huge.The Tiger's Tale really serves quality food and drinks! The staff is very friendly and welcoming. The clientele all looked very happy. They have a private parking lot and easy access. The dress and atmosphere is very relaxed and casual. I can't wait to return . This is one place I can come to over and over again.
