If you like salmon, get the smoked salmon with brioche toast appetizer as an entree. As far as I know, this only pertains to lunch. My friend got the Bar Steak, which came out in two slabs with french fries and I got the duck confit (apparently a pretty popular dish). Both the steak and duck were great! My duck confit was a bit greasy, which made the chips underneath the duck very soggy, but the sauce was delicious. The service is spectacular. Not spectacular like they're super cheery, but spectacular as in they are incredibly attentive and genuine. My water cup was never empty, despite drinking like a monster. One other perk: if you're a single lady who dines by yourself, you get a complimentary glass of champagne.
