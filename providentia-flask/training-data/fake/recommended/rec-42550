This. Place. Is. The. Shit.  Had a Haitians Gone Wild night over here with my Haitian Yelp bros Yves V and Stanley L, and MAN was it fantastic.  When trying to introduce "foodie" friends to the food I grew up with, it usually consists of taking them to a hole-in-the-wall take out place.  What's more difficult is finding a nice sit down restaurant, and Saveur Creole fits that bill perfectly. Located somewhat off the beaten path in Montclair, it can be a bit of a hassle to find... but definitely worth it.  It's BYOB and conveniently situated right next to a liquor store, with an OK wine selection.  From the moment you step inside, you immediately feel like you're being welcomed into someones home.  The staff is very warm and the intimate setting is perfect for date night.  My one gripe would have to be that you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom.  WTF, who designed this place?!?  Other than that, I love the Haitian artwork displayed on the walls and the whole vibe is just very authentic.  While the prices are a little steep for this kind of food, I definitely think the quality and atmosphere more than makes it worth it. THIS FOOD.  THIS FOOD RIGHT HERE.  This is some of the best Haitian food I've ever tasted... dare I say better than moms (SORRY MOM).  If someone was coming here for the first time, I'd recommend they start with the sampler.  That consists of tostones topped with smoked fish and goat cheese, a meat patty, a vegetarian fritter, and pikliz (Haitian cole slaw).  For the soup, you can never go wrong with the bouillon.  For the main event you have to get the griot, which is pretty much the national dish of Haiti (a fried pork dish).  They make it so tender and juicy here, it's a must try.  I also recommend the legume with goat (thick stew), the goat tasso, and the conch.  You really can't go wrong, so try a little of everything.
