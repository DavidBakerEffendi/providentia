Murphy's is an interesting sort of place. The inside is very old eclectic environment that seems very much in line with ye olde Dartmouth. Under most circumstance I wouldn't have gone to Murphy's as Molly's is my tried and try favorite, but I decided to give it a try - after all they just remodeled. We decided to have fried calamari, a Cuban and a Bison burger. The calamari was chewy, but that is to be expected as I am a seafood snob (growing up on the coast will do that). The bison burger was okay, but is no match for Molly's Kobe burger. My fiance reports the Cuban was decent. The service was a sporadic and disjointed at best. The waiter seemed a little disinterested and was not very attentive. Â I can't speak to the Murphy's as a drinking establishment, but it is probably a better bar then restaurant. My recommendation would be to go to Molly's where you can draw on the table, get good appetizer bread, and eat the best potato skins ever.
