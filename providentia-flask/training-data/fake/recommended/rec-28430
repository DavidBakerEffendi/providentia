OK, let me say this up front.. this place is not a place to take a date and the food is not going to be four star.... YES, they microwave your food in a styrofoam bowl... but for $3 this is a great quick lunch you can get and I have to say their Indian food is a hell of a lot better than most Indian restaurants
