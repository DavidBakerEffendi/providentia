This is a favorite restaurant of my husband's as well as some close friends of ours who are on a first name basis with Benny (the owner).  We always enjoy going and ordering all sorts of different things that we can pass around and share.  I love all the variety, and try to have something new every time.   Enjoy the Vietnamese beer (Okay so that I've tried the same of more than once!), we always share the BBQ Platter and our eyes are always bigger than our stomachs as we share a Pho soup and both still order a main course each!  Makes for good leftovers!  : ) Be prepared to be there for awhile, but that is part of what I really enjoy about it.  It's quality time with friends rather than a rushed meal.  Everything always tastes extremely fresh, and I'd recommend trying it out if you've never been before.
