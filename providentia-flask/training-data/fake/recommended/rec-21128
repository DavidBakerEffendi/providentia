Love Maialino. Have been here several times for dinner and brunch.  The place is always packed but even when I don't have a reservation, they've been able to accommodate me (I'd caution this with the fact that my party is usually small if I don't have a ressie, and not at the peak hour b/t 7-8). I took some visitors here for Sunday breakfast/brunch - they loved it.  I've had most of their egg dishes, this time I tried the Porchetta sandwich.  This is not light breakfast fare!  I only ate 1/2 and packed the other half to go....but Maialino does this weird doggy bag check thing where they give you a number and have you claim your leftovers at the front on the way out.  Not surprisingly, I forgot to do that and I remembered a few hours later in the day when I started getting hungry again and wondering where my other 1/2 sandwich went. DDOH.   But the 1/2 I ate was delicious and I'd go back just to have it again. They also top off your coffee without charging you for an extra cup.  Don't know why that surprised me.
