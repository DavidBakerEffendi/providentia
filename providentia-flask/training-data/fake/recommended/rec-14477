This place is crazy awesome!  You feel like you're traveling in time and space to the Middle East in the 80's.  The atmosphere is off the charts!  I get the "falafel special" which is vegetarian, delicious and SO cheap ($2.50)!  I ALWAYS stop by if I'm in the neighborhood.  Limited seating (2 booths and a small table outside) but a lot of times there's a spot if you go at an off-time.   (Washington Square Park is a few blocks away.)  This place screams old New York.
