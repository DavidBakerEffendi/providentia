The food was amazing. I had the Southern Comfort breakfast with fried green tomatoes, sugar-cured bacon, grits, and eggs... delicious! The food garnered this spot the 3 stars I gave it. The looooooong wait in the cold and the fact that we were asked to leave immediately after paying for our meal due to a need for our table turned me off, times two. Go early on the weekend or during the week if you don't want anything to take from your experience!
