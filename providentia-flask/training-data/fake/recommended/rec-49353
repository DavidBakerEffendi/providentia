Food: 4.5 Stars Service: 4 Stars Superb. I came here for brunch with my girlfriend before catching a flight out of La Guardia. They were very helpful with helping me store my luggage and accomodating us pretty quickly. There was a line which you want to be aware of during peak hours. Unlike a different reviewer, I thought it was really unique and cool that they essentially used their door frame and chalk for the waiting list. I seriously doubt people would purposely smudge the names ahead of them just to get ahead in wait time. When we were seated, I will say the tables are pretty close to each other so you'll be packed quite closely. We ordered the: 1. The Croque Madame - which was very tasty, thick and heavy. Although portions looked kinda small at first glance. They're actually quite thick and heavy so you'll be fulfilled after the meal. There was cheese on either side of the bread which was melted in and still hot from the kitchen, which brought out so much flavor from the filling of the sandwich. 2. Waffle Sandwich - my favorite. It came with butter and maple syrup on top, a lot of cheese in the middle, bacon, and I believe an egg as well. Everything just blended together in a beautiful melted mess of sweet, savory, cheesy, crunchy and lightness. I've never had anything like it and would come back again! The menus and decor are also beautiful. Makes you actually feel like you're in a small parisian cafe, but you're in the middle of Manhattan. Highly recommended!
