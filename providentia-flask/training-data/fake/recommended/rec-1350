Place rocks! The tempura was amazing and the fresh fish was delicious. The server was highly educated in the world of sushi and my uncle remarked that he has only seen the fish offered at Izumi in Japan. PRETTY COOL Izumi is a staple for us and we continue to come back. The specials are amazing. I can't wait for the warmer months so we can take advantage of the outdoor seating!
