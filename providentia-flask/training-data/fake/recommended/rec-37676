What a pretentious rude dump. I actually have no idea what the food tastes like as the "chef" refused to serve me the masabacha dish with no egg. Weird since I'm israeli myself and know that masabacha is street food, and usually comes with the egg on the side, so really no need for the faux Michelin Â attitude. Stay the hell away if you're vegan, allergic to anything or generally don't like to be bullied. Fail.
