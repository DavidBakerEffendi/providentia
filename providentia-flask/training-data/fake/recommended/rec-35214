I dined at katsuhama yesterday with a friend and literally died when I tried their pork katsu curry. It was heavenly. As a self-proclaimed Japanese curry connoisseur, this is the best in the city. Better than Go go curry, better than Curry-ya. Tastes quite a bit like CoCo's in Japan. Obsessed. Will be back every Friday for lunch. Thank you!! :)
