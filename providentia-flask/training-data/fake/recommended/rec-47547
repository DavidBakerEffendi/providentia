If you are looking for fine French dining and a good value, look into Verjus. The lunch menu is very reasonably priced ( $9 to $13) for the 10 or so entrees offered. Plan on spending at least an hour as the food prep is complex. Culinary pride is quite evident judging from the taste and presentation of the Nicoise salad with seared tuna that I greatly enjoyed. This is an excellent spot for a business lunch and no doubt a romantic evening; your date will be impressed.
