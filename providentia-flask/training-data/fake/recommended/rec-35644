I have been searching for the perfect Coffee Shop in the neighborhood, and as much as I love LaVa, the 7 block trek to Cafe V is now a regular one I will make! A friend suggested that we go here to study one day and I am extremely glad I took her up on the offer. The cup of hot chocolate is exactly what I want it to taste like every time I order some, or make my own. The sandwiches are great, and the owner is always there to help you make the tricky decisions, on dessert! Which are baked fresh on premise, and I have not yet been dissapointed! I am so glad that Cafe V is new to the neighborhood, I hope their following picks up quickly. Perfect place to study or have lunch!
