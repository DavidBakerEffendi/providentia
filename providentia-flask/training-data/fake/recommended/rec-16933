I've been coming here since I started college at Montclair, and four years later I still love it for its authentic yummy Cuban food. It's BYOB, loud, crowded, and typically any given weekend, BUSY! If it's a weekend day I've found servers aren't that attentive, but I've learned to like it more when I come on a week night, because service is better and there's typically a short wait, or none at all. The sangria is good and the empanadas are to die for. Only down side is they are small and they are about all I want my meals to consist of, they're amazing. Bottom line is try and get here on a week day for a better experience, but be patient if it is a weekend!
