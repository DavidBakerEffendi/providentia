THE BEST CHINESE PULL NOODLE PLACE EVER! Everything on the menu is good! I recommend getting one of the noodle soup with an order of dumpling on the side. This place is also dirt cheap! The down sides are: 1. The place is dirty and do except your tables to be sticky (hey, its Chinatown so just suck it up) 2. This place only accepts cash. 3. Unless you know Cantonese or Mandarin, you might struggle a little. 4. The wait can be insane, especially during lunch times on the weekends. But to me the pros outweights the cons.
