Had a great time catching up with some friends over brunch at Mezetto today. It is a great summertime spot, we were by the window and it was almost like we were outside. There was live music, the service was extremely attentive and though we stayed a long time we never felt rushed. We started with the Mezetto trio which was really tasty and they were very accommodating providing veggies instead of bread for one person who could not eat gluten. Â The brunch favorites were the Mezetto twist on eggs benedict (roast pepper and arugula) and another dish which I forget the name of but eggs cooked with tomato. My favorite dessert was the halva parfait: very unique and refreshing. I'll definitely be back!
