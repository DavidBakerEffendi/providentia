My boyfriends been raving about this place, he even has his picture on the wall.... finally he took me on Friday. Great sushi. They have a variety of rolls to choose from I probably took 15 mins just to decide which one I wanted. We shared the 3 regular rolls for $10 as well as a specialty roll from the board. Totally reasonably priced for sushi you know will delicious. Fresh ingredients, love being able to watch the guys make the rolls right in front of you.... When I have a craving for sushi I'll definitely be back!
