I came here on a Monday evening for my birthday a couple of weeks ago. The wait was only a few minutes, which was really nice. My friends and I were seated all the way in the back, right in front of the kitchen, but luckily it wasn't too hot back there. Our waiter offered us a bo ssam pork shoulder, even though we hadn't reserved one in advance, because some party had backed out earlier, and we were sold (mostly because we didn't want to deal with ordering separately). Three guys and seven girls were able to split it comfortably. The entire bo ssam meal ($200) came with a plate-sized hunk of pork shoulder, 12 raw oysters (not enough in my opinion, but what can you do?), lettuce, white rice, and Korean pastes/dipping sauces. The lettuce was my favorite part of the meal.. very fresh and fluffy. The oysters seemed fresh, as well. The pork was well-cooked: crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside, but unfortunately it was way too salty. (Please take note, Momofuku!) We also ordered two servings of steamed buns as apps, which came with a total of six pieces (very little for the price.. $22, I believe). They were tasty, but, like I just said, pricey. Afterwards, my friends raved about the meal, but I couldn't get over the saltiness of the pork shoulder. I'm not sure I would go back to Momofuku (mainly because I'm Korean, and I could make ssam at home anytime), but I would recommend trying the bo ssam at least once. (I'm kinda curious about the rotisserie duck ssam, though.) I'd just ask for one that's light on the salt.
