I am not sure why this restaurant received so many good recommendations, but the Spanish Pavillion my partner and I dined was forgettable. Service was mediocre at best, and the food was forgettable. I've dined all over the world, and this restaurant, along with the service, was pretty bad. Not awful, but close. I could go on with the finer details of the dining experience, but this place is not worth the energy.
