I stopped into this coffee shop this morning on the way to work.  To my surprise, I stumbled in on an Aussie coffee shop.  As some would protest (I being one of them), the coffee in NYC is horrible (since we are over served my Starbucks on every other corner.  Blue Bottle has been one of my favorites and this is an welcome addition.   I ordered a flat white and The Smash for breakfast, outstanding.  If you are in the neighborhood, I highly recommend stopping in for a cuppa.   The one star demotion was for the prices.  The toast with butter & vegemite was $3.50 or $4 - for a piece of toast! I still have to check out lunch there but the menu looks good as well.
