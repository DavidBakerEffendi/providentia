First I should warn you, I really don't like family style Italian restaurants with the same boring dishes served up for less adventurous eaters. Pellegrino's is not that type of Italian restaurant. It has a very nice classy ambiance, great service, and a more refined menu than many of the other Italian eateries on Mulberry. I tried 3 appetizers and they were all very good. Zuppa di Gamberi - Shrimp bisque with Fish balls - just awesome Peperata Baresi - Red Holland Pepper stuffed with broccoli rabe, shrimp, parmesian cheese and brreadccrumbs  - excellent Traditional Stuffed Artichokes - An Italian classic that they do very well For mains I had the Scallops and Portobello mushrooms - very good For dessert: Fruit tart with a mascarpone cheese base and Freshly made stuffed Canelloni  with a ton of Pistachio nuts This was one of the best Italian meals I have had in sometime time. Thank you Yelp for helping me find this gem.
