I love Uva! Boyfriend and I came here for wine and appetizers twice in the past couple of weeks. The wine selection is AMAZING - I feel weird saying I want to try them all ;). Â I'm addicted to the bruschetta, but don't overlook the olives, they're hiding in the appetizer section. Finish off the meal with the meat antipasto for a great post work night. The service at Uva is so welcoming, a great mix of attentive and knowing when to back off, and the decor is very romantic. Definitely a great date place - leave kids at home (for all of us). I'd definitely recommend Uva.
