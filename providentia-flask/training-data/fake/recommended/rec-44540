I thought the food here was pretty good (crispy pork knuckles, chicken adobo, halo halo) but agree with the person who posted about the owner.  He was overbearing/pushy about what we should order and I found his many jokes to be more annoying than funny.  The waitstaff was great, though, and like I said, the food was pretty tasty.  I think I would go back, but not completely sure yet.
