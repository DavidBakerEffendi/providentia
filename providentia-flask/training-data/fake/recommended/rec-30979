I came here on a Saturday night, it was a decent time.  The bar wasn't too crowded which was a plus.  The beer selection was pretty good, they had Sweet Baby Jesus (a favorite of mine).  I didn't get to try the food, but the menu looked about on par with your average bar.  It's not Paddy's Pub, so don't expect much in terms of the show if you're a fan.  I'd say this is just a chill place to grab some drinks with friends.
