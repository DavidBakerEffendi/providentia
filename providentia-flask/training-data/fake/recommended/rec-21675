We came here for a birthday brunch on a blustery NY Sunday. We had a reservation, yet the obnoxious hipster host made us wait outside. When we asked if our 3 freezing kids could wait inside, we were told no. We finally did get our table, after about 10 minutes. Not a bad wait, except we were standing in the cold. Our table was too small for our party, yet they didn't correct it for us. We sat squished. It's better to have them tell you what they do have here, because they are missing a lot of basics. No Diet Coke. The smug waitress informed me they only carry regular. For the kids- no apple juice, no chocolate milk, no lemonade. And despite this being a brunch place, no hot cocoa or Bloody Mary. Food was ok. Not spectacular. My husband's order was wrong and they didn't bring him his correct meal for another 20 minutes. The kid's mac & cheese was very good. We split the order between 2 kids. Overall, the food wasn't good enough to make the obnoxious and horrible service worth it. I will not return.
