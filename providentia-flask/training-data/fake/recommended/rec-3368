Tucked into an unassuming store front right of Atlantic Avenue is one of the cooler bar restaurants of Boerum Hill.  I have mostly come here for happy hour and lunch.  All the sandwiches I have had are delicious and fresh. The cocktails I have had a are expertly mixed, showing off the mixology skills of the bartenders.  The service is prompt and friendly, the prices are reasonable. This place is a must try for lunch, dinner or happy hour.
