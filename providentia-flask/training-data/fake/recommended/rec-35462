Excellent food. Fresh pasta. Excellent tomato sauce, not heavy at all, light and sweet, just like my grandmother's from Italy. It's BYOB - which is very cool. Only reason this isn't a 5star review is because of dessert. The creme brûlée was not a custard and the chocolate lava cake tasted burnt. Go for the food...all the food!!!
