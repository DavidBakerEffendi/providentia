I have been to the Four Aces Diner a handful of times before and always had good service and great tasting food. This trip was entirely different. I went with my father around 11 am on a weekday and we sat ourselves (as is customary) but our table was covered in the food from the previous diners. The place wasn't busy so I don't know how this table got missed during cleaning. I had to wipe the table down but that was no big deal. We ordered and our waitress asked my father if he wanted hash browns with his breakfast sandwich. He specifically said that he didn't want them, while I wasn't asked if I wanted hash browns. Our food came out promptly but there on both of our plates were hash brown potato wedges. The food overall was nothing special, especially the hash browns which were basically a potato sliced in half and grilled with salt and pepper added. An extra $1 for two pieces of thin, stringy bacon seemed a bit pricey to add to a breakfast sandwich. After taking our order, our waitress never once came back to check on us. Not to offer more coffee or to check how the food was or to ask if we needed anything else. We finished eating and sat there for over 10 minutes waiting for her to come by so we could ask for a take home box and the bill. Our waitress was nowhere to be found anywhere in the restaurant. Finally she emerged from the back and gave us the bill and box, and when I looked over the bill I saw that the water I ordered was charged as a soda. At that point I was so sick of the terrible service and I knew that trying to argue with our waitress (if I could ever find her again) would be another half-hour process. I just paid it and we left. Other Tripadvisors have said that the Four Aces is under new management and have complained that it seems to be going downhill. I wholeheartedly agree, and won't be going back.
