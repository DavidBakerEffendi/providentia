I was really excited to eat here after all the good reviews I found here but when I get there and I get the food I was really disappointed , I had the herb Ck plater , the ck was really soaked in oil and a little under done , the biscuit was good , the Mac and cheese was nothing special . Overall was a mediocre experience , staff was nice , I had a feeling that I was in a fast food , I will not go back .
