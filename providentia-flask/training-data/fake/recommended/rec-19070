Ordered the Pork Cutlet Bowl and Udon combo.  The pictures on the menu make everything look sooo tasty, so good job on that... you managed to sell me cause I would've tried anything looking at those pics.  The pork was really good but wasn't a fan of the rice being so sweet so I couldn't finish the bowl.  The udon was really good --broth was good. When we walked in we noticed there were a lot of Asian people dining there which, in my opinion, is a good sign when you're in midtown and you're looking for authentic. Pricing was very reasonable.  $12 for the combo I ordered, about $7 for just a pork cutlet bowl.  So why not just opt for the combo?  nom nom. Would come back if I was in the area again.
