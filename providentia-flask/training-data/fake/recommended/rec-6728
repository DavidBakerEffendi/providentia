I'm probably not the best person to review a steakhouse, since I don't eat red meat often. But, no one else hass so here goes: We had reservations for a Saturday night, and it wasn't as busy as I expected. The decor is tasteul (just not MY taste- check out the asymetrical window treatments... weird) and the restrooms are really sort of impressive, and clean, which is important, right?) So, on to the food: I got the stuffed chicken breast (I know, I know- it's a steakhouse) but it was SPECTACULAR. Perfectly cooked. Stuffed with some garlic herb whatever- loved it. I did try a peice of the filet mignon, and it was really good, too.  Someone else got the T Bone, which I didn't try, but they raved. We got the green beans almondine (sauteed in butter and toasted almonds) which were perfectly cooked and delicious, and a huge cone of shoestring fries- FYI, they get cold in, like, 45 seconds. They have a pretty extensive wine list, some of which is resonably priced. (Just don't expect your server to be able to suggest anything. Ours certainly couldn't, and probably still plays beer pong...) It was fairly child-friendly, though I didn't  see a kids menu. We ordered the baby ziti w/ caramalized onions and cheese, and just sold it as "mac-n-cheese". She ate the whole thing, but I didn't care for it. Overall, the food was good, the service was friendly (just young and inexperinced) We'll be back. P.S. Free valet parking!
