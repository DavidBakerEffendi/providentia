Pat's over Geno's any day... best cheesesteak ever! Don't listen to the bad reviews!! They just didnt' know how to order it philly style. Good thing I had my buddies, they knew exactly how to order it! Â  Make sure you get Cheesesteak WIT (with onions) peppers... and can't forget the cheese whiz.... that's the magic to it all... Ya'll stop being bougie and get down to Pat's... what's the fun without the mess?
