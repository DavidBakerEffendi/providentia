ZOMG, so delicious. I had the Hawaiian, the Chorizo, the Reggaeton and the Cheesesteak. All but the chorizo were killer, especially the Hawaiian. It had better cheese than half the pizza joints in this city. The plaintain chips that came with our guac were perfect. The spicy guac itself was alright, but could be spicier. Still, most places don't even offer spicy guac. They accidentally brought us the white sangria instead of the red. It was ok, but I'm not exactly a fan of white sangria. The prices are insane, averaging out to $2.50 per empanada. I had four because I was starving, but if you skipped table service and appetizers, you could easily eat for $10. It's not too big inside, so we waited a half hour for a table, and considered ourselves lucky when at the end of our meal 20 people were eyeing us hungrily outside... Not to mention, it's open 24 hours!
