An comfortable West Chelsea spot--especially for lunch and brunch. Â A must-try is the Chicken Breast Salad, easily my favorite salad in the city: perfectly roasted chicken on a bed of greens, green olives (yum!) and golden raisins. Often quite busy at brunch, but reservations are easy to come by, even last minute.
