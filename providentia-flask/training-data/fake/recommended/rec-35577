In town for business and went to Tinto during Restaurant Week because of Yelp reviews and an intriguing pre fixe menu for the week. Three people, one from NYC, one from Boston and another who has lived in LA and Boston. By the end of the meal, the question was "Top 10 meal of Top 5?" As a table, we sampled 13 different dishes and sent every plate back cleaner than when it came out of the dishwasher. Standouts included spiced meatballs with a perfectly poached egg that turned the sauce into a silky masterpiece, patatas asturnianas that were Spain's answer to fine dining tater tots, and little discs of octopus that were soft and luscious with one side seared to perfection. The wine pairing was astute as well, and our server, Geoffrey, couldn't have been more pleasant or present at just the right times. I've been a Yelp user for years. This was the place that got me signed up to review. I don't know the next time I'll be back in Philly, but it will include a trip to Tinto.
