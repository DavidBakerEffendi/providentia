Don't know why an additional 5 - star review would be needed for this great business, but let me put my two cents in, and why I think this is one of the great spots in Philly, especially for Indian/Pakistani chaats & lassis. Though the online menu shows most of the chaats & lassis available, they are more than willing to let you try different combinations of different ingredients to try and find something to fit your taste and/or mood for the day.  Which is a very nice change from many restaurants which have the attitude "if its not on the menu, we won't make it/don't have it".  If you ask for something special, they will try and accommadate you (provided they have the ingredients, of course). My understanding of "chaat" is that it's supposed to be a streetside snack, or at best, an appetizer, and not supposed to be a full meal.  If you look at it in that light, you should have a very good experience here.   The lassi (Indian-style "milkshake") list is huge, and you can find something for almost any taste, from more traditional sour/salty lassis, to more Americanized, sweeter versions, and anything in between.  I've never been dissapointed in any lassi I've ordered here either. They also have a small variety of desserts, the cottage-cheese balls (can't think of their name), rice pudding, and a few others, for take - out.   Though there is a small area for eat - in, it's best for take out, as it's a fairly small place.
