To this day, and I have been on this planet for 28 years, the best meal I have EVER had. 7 courses (we went the carnivore route) and all were fantastic. The standout for me was the chicken cooked with lemon and olives. Seriously, how do they do that chicken? You just touched it and it fell off the bone. mmmmmmm *drool*.
