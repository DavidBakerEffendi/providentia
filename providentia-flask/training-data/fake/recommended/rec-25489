love this place! the cellar downstairs is very intimate and perfect for happy hour or for a lounge feel. The mac and cheese is great! The crowd is perfect and the wine is exceptional. Â I used to go to Beechers after work when I worked in the city and miss it so much now! its one of my stops back in Manhattan before a night out.
