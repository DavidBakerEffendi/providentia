I came here this past weekend and immediately fell in luv w/ it...  I am planning on coming to their tea ceremony at some point in the future.. -- not knowing what to expect, I ordered the pre-set menu set for $17, unlimited refill on "sentra" green tea (the mature one), and a full plate of small grain, salad, seared tuna pieces, and soup.... plus a small dessert.. I like the tapas style of a variety of small dishes... I will come back again next time for the macha-green-tea-latte, supposedly sweet twist on classical macha-green-tea..   =) Oh, luved the decor, the service staff wears traditional clothing, they are mostly real Japanese ppl and the place is decorated to transport you back to a century ago....   DEFINITELY coming back to this tea shop again.
