Excellent!! I found this place through Yelp in a saturday late night after work... Wine selections were really good as well as their prices. My boyfriend and I Â try the charcuterie and some of their cheese selections which were really good.. Ambience was vibrant and nice. The place is very cozy and service was super friendly ( our waitress was extremely nice and accommodating) ... :)
