Rangoon is great.  The only reason that I cannot give it a full five stars is because the food is inconsistent.  I'll go once and a dish will be amazing.  Then I will eat the same thing again the next time I visit and it will only be so-so.  However, there's always something wonderful and it keeps me coming back.  I've never had anything there that I thought was awful (well, there are these dumpling things I thought were not so wonderful, but maybe they were having an off day).   My most favorite things at Rangoon are the ginger salad and the thousand layer bread with coconut sauce.  So wonderful.  So good.  Always.  I've never had bad thousand layer bread.  Furthermore, I've never had bad service, which is very important to me.  I ate there last night and our server was very sweet, gracious, and attentive.   I'm not wild about the remodel.  The space feels a little less personal and I miss all those wonderful paintings.  But the minimalist approach does give it a very clean look.   All in all, the food is good, often great (but no guarantees!).. They have a decent selection of wine and beer, plus a few fun drinks, like tamarind juice, etc.  The prices and portions are both very reasonable and the service and setting are always very nice.
