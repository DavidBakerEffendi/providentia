I finally got a chance to check out the cheese truck today. With the weather bordering on arctic, I felt it was best to go with something quick with no frills. I ordered a tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich. The food was ready in less than 3 minutes which was fantastic. (Street food should be quickly prepared.) I rushed back to my apartment, sat down on my couch, and opened everything up. The grilled cheese sandwich looked like an everyday one but after one big bite it was evident that this was the real deal-- I have no clue what kind of cheese they use or how many tablespoons of butter are in between the yummy layers but it was almost perfect (second only to the grilled cheese served at Caseus restaurant). Then I got to the tomato soup. While it was pretty tasty, it wasn't the kind of soup I imagined. It had a very strong tomato taste, a lot like sauce. And there was a bit too much black pepper. I personally like a tomato soup with a creamier, sweeter taste. But still, it was pretty good. Of course I'll visit the truck again and try some of their specials.
