Sometimes you want to treat yo'self and spend $12+ on a few ounces of grain alcohol. I get it. We live in the first world, baby! You should be allowed the finest things in life, even if you make $12/h and have debt. But if you're going to treat yourself, you need to look the part: A new haircut, some cologne, maybe even wear some slacks and a button down. It turns out drinking expensive alcohol is better when you're not listening to dance music and looking at bros in shorts who snuck over from Ri-Ras. It's fun if you want to hang out with a lot of middle-aged Vermont businessmen. Wanna find the alpha dog? The guy with the Patagonia vest talking about how much he hates Obama. I give this establishment 1 Whiste Pig out of 5 Jim Beams and a slow, disapproving head shake.
