Very Nice Decor,  whoever remodeled was very creative. I had a delicious Crab BLT w/Avocado.. ALL  the staff was pleasent, I even got to meet one of the Owners who was an absolute sweetheart. .She made me feel right at home. . I definitely am coming back here.. why you ask? Because I like the Food but they dont deliver... but I can understand why.. I like this place, cant wait to return...
