This place is definitely bigger than it appears on the outside.  I often walked by here and never went in thinking it was a carry-out place with some seats, but there are two large back rooms.  It is definitely one of those awesome family-run places with awesome food and not a lot of "show".  I took my friend here because she is taking a trip to Greece next month, and found our new favorite neighborhood BYO.   We started with the Zeus appetizer, which could easily be a meal in itself if you want to try a little of everything.  The grilled octopus was phenomenal and the sauce was so good, I had to use the crusty bread to sop it up. I also highly recommend the stuffed eggplant.  I have never tasted anything so good and will definitely be ordering it again!   Overall, great food, inexpensive, no frills neighborhood gem!
