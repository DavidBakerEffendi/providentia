I went to both Pat's & Geno's based on their reputation. I also saw a show on the travel channel about these 2 places & figured I would give them a chance. My girlfriend & I split 1 Philly from each place so we could try them both. Neither place was good. Both places meat lacked flavor & the breads were soggy. According to several locals, there are much better places to get Phillys in Philly. ** I think Publix in Tampa, FL makes a better Philly than both of these places.
