Stopped by here when visiting New Jersey to try some Cuban food for the first time. The entrance was confusing... had no idea where to walk into the restaurant. It had palm trees everywhere and as you walk in, you had to duck down to get inside... Odd... otherwise you would be smacking your face into some palm trees. Honestly, the palm tree arch should have been taller or the trees should have been separated a little more in the entrance.. Upon arrival, we had no idea where to go.. We had to walk to the middle of the restaurant to get seated... Most places have it at the entrance. I was definitely super confused.. Alright to the menu... it reminded me of a Mexican restaurant with a twist. I wanted to try the enchilado with jumbo shrimp, but they ran out of jumbo shrimp. Sad day. Instead I got rice with pulled beef... The food portions were HUGE and they were all served in clay bowls. The dishware was in the middle of the table in a vase. They also serve community beans with all the dishes. The food was good, but the service was subpar.. was so thirsty.. I was trying to conserve my sprite... so I could drink at the same pace I was being served.
