Going to jump on the bandwagon here. I love finding a good ramen and probably have spent too much of my life waiting in lines for one. That being said, Mu was on a different level compared to my other favorite spots in the city. The broth was rich and had a layer of complexity that I've never seen before. I was so sure I knew what to expect with that first sip but the layers of flavors threw me completely off (and now I'm salivating thinking about it again). I got the Mu ramen and also got to try the spicy miso. Both were good but the spicy miso was probably a little too spicy and rich for me. I also want to highlight THE CHICKEN WINGS. Please do yourself a favor and get these. The big bone is removed, so it's really one giant chicken lollipop. The batter isn't too thick or overwhelming, and with every bite there's delicious chicken juices that ooze out. I went on a Thursday night around 7:30 and waited 2.5 hours to be seated. Think the strategy is to probably go at 5 before they open and be part of the first seating at 6. There's room for about 10 people to wait inside the restaurant (seats around the wall), but it seems like most people went to wait it out elsewhere.
