Good overall experience - came a bit after 8 on a Saturday (with a reservation) and the place was packed. Definitely not a quiet, romantic spot but the space isn't large or overbearing. I had the black ink lobster and shrimp - very tasty and a good size portion overall. My girlfriend had the gnocchi which was also very good. I thought for the size of the portion the prices were very fair. They also had a good wine list to choose from - again fairly priced and very good. Would go back again, probably on a week night or other lower trafficked time.
