I went for brunch. I had the eggs benedict, as I am accustomed to having when I go out for a nice brunch. Very delicious, and a bit different than the traditional version. Also, props for this dish since it wasn't swimming in a pool of hollandaise (there was just the appropriate amount). I didn't have a cocktail, but my fellow brunch-goers tried their version of a bloody mary. I had a sip - again, very tasty. I was very pleased with the food. In addition, I had a lovely chat about urban transportation planning with the bartender while I waited for my fellow-brunchers to arrive. Mad props for that! I will definitely be going back in the future - maybe I'll try dinner next time!
