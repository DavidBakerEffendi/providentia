Absolutely delicious. Great ambiance and service. Love the black light medallion ceiling. Quick correction on veggies omitted in an order. Made my own curry combo, and they were totally accommodating. Great spices, sophisticated seasoning,  beautiful food presentation.  I will be back! Yummy lychee martini.
