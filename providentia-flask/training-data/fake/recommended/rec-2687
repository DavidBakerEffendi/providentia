I ate the shrimp and avocado salad. The pro is I'm a fan of the dressing; it's tangy and citrusy. Everything else about the salad is, 'Eh.' My biggest 'beef' is with the shrimp. My preference is for a slight sear on shrimp because most types of shrimp are just mushy. Also, I really don't understand leaving the tail on, especially for a salad.. Last gripe is that the proportion of spinach to everything else seems a bit out of whack. If this was like a $6 salad I'd probably be OK with these things. But it's$10 and change. This probably goes for almost all salads in Center City though. They're all over priced cause it's center city. But this one specifically doesn't seem worth the price tag more so than most. ** Update 8.9.13 ** Added a star for customer service.
