Oh good Lord!  Where has this place been all my life? Delicious.  I've been here for breakfast and recently went for lunch.  Best waitress?  Ingrid!  She is so kind, helpful, and goes out of her way for her customers.   There is so much on the menu...it will take you quite some time to choose what to have.  The best breakfast?  Viva La Revolución!  The best lunch?  Turkey sandwich and some butternut squash soup.   Heaven.  Must be missing a pancake house.  Cause it's here with us right now!
