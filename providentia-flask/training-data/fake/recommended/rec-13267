This Halal Cart is the most famous cart I know. People I know from California, all the way on the other side of the states rave about this cart just like I do. This is a MUST-TRY if you're in NYC, because there's nothing I've tried that's quite like this. The funny thing about the cart business in NYC is that there's tons of them on nearly every street corner, but this is the only one with a gigantic line. My friends who told me to try this told me to look for the yellow bag. I came here one night and the line wasn't too long yet. Maybe a 15 minute wait on a cold winter night. I got the chicken and lamb plate and man, they give you a lot! I saw other people putting these white and red sauces on top so we followed the crowd and did the same. My boyfriend and I loaded up on the white and the red as well, since we're pretty good at handling spicy stuff. Once we took out first bite, we realized loading up on the red was a big mistake. That stuff is lethal! Take it easy on the red... but other than that, this chicken and lamb with rice was amazing! You can't really explain to somebody how amazing it is, they just have to try it for themselves to understand how good it is. The great thing about this food cart is that it's fast (besides the waiting in line), filling (can feed two people easily), cheap (I think we paid $6), and somewhat healthy. The funny thing is that there's two carts nearby that are the exact same as this cart, but people line up at this one. I asked the Halal guys if they're the same, and he told me yes, but nobody goes to the other ones. Therefore, the other two carts just cook the meat to support the main cart. The reviews don't lie, this cart is amazing. So amazing that we came back twice in one trip. If we stayed in NYC for longer, I'm sure it would have become a nightly ritual.
