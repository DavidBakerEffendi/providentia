Looked like a Mad Men set--cheap 50s upholstery, but I guess that's what people are looking for now.  Food was good.  They call it comfort food--I call it good diner food.  A little overpriced, but worth it.  Sort of like a 50s upscale diner.  Not sure that's what they were looking to portray, but that's what I got out of it.  Had fried chicken basket, chicken pot pie (excellent!) and meatloaf (great peas!).  Overall, go for the food but the decor didn't do it for me.
