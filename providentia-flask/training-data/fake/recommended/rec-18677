Our food was pretty decent at Chavelas (my enchiladas were better than the usual Brooklyn Mexican joint enchiladas, the chicken tender and the sauce had a spicier-than-usual kick), and one of our many servers was supernice. But as a first-timer, I was surprised at how they packed 6 of us into a 4-top, and the guy sitting to my left kept hitting me with his elbow because I was seated too close to him. It's hectic in there. Because we were a group of 6, they added a gratuity onto our bill -- I wish they'd told us when they dropped the bill bc it took us a second to figure out the bill. Then, they continually checked on whether we were ready to pay the bill over and over again -- about four different servers in 3 minutes stopped at the table to see if we were ready to pay. It had not been that long so it was kind of stressful. I know they wanted to get other people on the table, but it came out feeling like less than a courteous and pleasant experience. Our wait was quite long -- Â about 25 minutes I think, at 5pm on a Sunday. PS - the sangrias ARE nicely fruity and heavy on the alcohol content.
