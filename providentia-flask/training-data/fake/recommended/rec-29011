Went for a few drinks at the outside bar.  It is small so I think that the inside bar would be better if we had had more than a party of two.  The atmosphere is unique and really cool.  Menu is interesting and different.  We enjoyed a few of the cocktails and found them to be delicious and fresh.  One thing I would say, and we weren't shocked but still would say that for the size and pours the drinks are VERY expensive.  There were a few glasses of wine for $9 and many for 11-12 a glass.  Knowing that I can get the exact same bottle of one for about $15-20 made it a bit difficult to swallow.    It was a special place to be enjoyed.  For two of us with 2 appetizers and 3 drinks each it was about $70.00 each.   I think I would wait to go for a really nice sit down longer dinner next time and just go all out if I'm already spending that much, and or I would probably have ordered a bottle of wine to split. Oh, we had the Locavore cheese and the lotus blossoms and they were great.
