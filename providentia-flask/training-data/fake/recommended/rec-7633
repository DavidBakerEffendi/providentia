A chic, smartly appointed restaurant where every table appears to be a booth makes this a great spot for couples. Seafood, beef and sushi frame the offerings presented on the menu. I recommend the cheese burger and the vegetarian burger. Get the coleslaw, it's got a sophisticated tasteful twist on the classic. The service is prompt and friendly. The drinks are somewhat pricey but the again this midtown east. We plan to return and explore the menu further.
