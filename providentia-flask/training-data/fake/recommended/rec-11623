although rye is a popular BRUNCH spot, it's NOT exactly my idea of a cute sunday brunch because the atmosphere reminds me of a dingy pub ALTHOUGH their dishes are served on fine china & silverware! for 5 people we waited over an hour on sunday but you're welcome to sit at the bar & grab drinks while yah wait ---donuts: lacking sweetness but loved that they're served w/ creme fraiche ---meatloaf sandwich: nice crusty bread but the meatloaf just wasn't for me! the crispy fried onions added some flavor though! NOTE: no RSVP for brunch unless you are a group of 6 or more
