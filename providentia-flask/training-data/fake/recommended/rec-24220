The ONLY reason I am giving them 2 stars is because I've had good meals here before. My dinner here tonight, however was NOT a good experience. I ordered the cheeseburger which I have gotten many times before. I asked for it medium well. When I got it, it was noticeably smaller than every time I had gotten it in the past, and they replaced their good wheat buns with flimsy sesame buns. When I got around half way into the burger, not only was it not medium well, it was RAW!!!!! I don't mean pink, I mean uncooked. OK, fine, I understand things happen, so I found my waitress (not the nicest person in the world, but not terrible) and she took it back to the kitchen. 15 minutes later, out comes the same half eaten burger, now looking more cooked. I thought again, OK, why give me a new burger when it was cooking issue. SO I bit back into it and the first thing I tasted was charcoal. The cook had put the burger, BUN TOP AND ALL onto the grill, resulting in a burnt bun. Worse, two bites into the burger, I came upon, to my horror, RAW MEAT!!!! Now I am not a beef eater, and when I order a burger I need it pretty thoroughly cooked to be good to me. This was not even close. I just decided to suck it up, because I just wanted to go home at this point. My dinner companion also noticed something different with his Bacon and Brie sandwich, noting as soon as it came out, that it was smaller than normally. I don't know if they are trying to cut costs, but do it elsewhere, don't cut portion size or use substandard bread. Will I go back? Yes, because they have a good beer selection. Will I eat there again? Maybe, but ill go for edimame which is impossible to screw up, or soup. No more JB Burger for me, which is a shame, because it used to be one of my fans in the city.
