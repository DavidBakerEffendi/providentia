I love this spot. Somehow it took me two years living in Astoria to venture down to 31st Avenue, but now that I have, it's a go-to for us. There's nothing better on a warm summer evening than meeting up here after work, ordering a bottle of Tempranillo and a roasted mushroom panini. The sandwiches here are top-notch. Super fresh and delicious ingredients. Amazing cheeses and creative combinations of flavors. The vibe is very laid back so it's a great spot for a casual weeknight dinner when you want good food and good conversation without having to spend a ton and get all fancied up.
