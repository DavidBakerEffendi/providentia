2nd visit to the Marshal and probably my last.  This place has good food, but the service is spotty and the happy hour "rules" are silly.  On this recent trip, we arrived at 5:00 pm with a reservation and the staff didn't appear to have anything ready. we were told it was happy hour, but only at the bar portion of the tiny restaurant. The bar has 4 uncomfortable seats and would not be able to order hh drinks at our table, which wasn't even ready because the kitchen hadn't opened. after waiting 10 minutes for a bartender to show up, we ordered our drinks and had to ask politely if we could bring our drinks to the table-- and they allowed us. Ate the meatloaf--it is worth ordering and the roasted vegetables (which were undercooked and hard to cut in the dish without the knife slipping around). the small scallops with duck bacon were chewy and did not impress. A couple of the dishes here are solid (chicken, bread) but the space is so tiny and cramped, it's just not that fun of a dining experience. The staff should be ready to go right when doors open and the happy hour "deal" should just disappear. It's not as if people are coming to the Marshal to drink after work.
