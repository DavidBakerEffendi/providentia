Food is good, typical Chinese buffet. Nothing more than expected.... other than the oysters! Went for lunch, got sushi hot food, self serve lo mein thing, etc. Was getting my last plate and doing my round... and there I saw oysters! Got excited and scared at the same time, cause it is a buffet and I didn't know how fresh it would be. Anyways, got one oyster to try. No lemon to be found.. asked a staff member. She brought it to our table and said oysters are for dinner, you want me to charge you for dinner or lunch? We said lunch, of course. Then we said that it didn't say dinner and she said yes, there's a sign. But truly, there was no sign there when we got it. Whatever. So she took my husbands plate of 3 oysters and I said how about my one lonely oyster and she said it was ok and walked away. OMG, didn't get to see where she walked to, but was she going to put that back for other customers to take? What if it was touched, tasted or something? Ugh, guess that's Chinese buffets for you. BIG ICK! We questioned ourselves that, but also said to ourselves... we shouldn't have asked for lemons! But anyway.. my one oyster was delicious.
