Table for 6. 5 turned up. 1 very gluten sensitive guest. Service was attentive. Wine list ok and affordable - most between $30-40. Food was nothing to write home about. One pizza was burnt to a crisp and had to be remade. I'd come back if a gluten intolerant friend needed to eat. Otherwise probably not.
