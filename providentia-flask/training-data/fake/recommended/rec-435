Love the ambiance. We sat upstairs on the balcony and it felt like I was in some sort of intimate library. Perfect romantic date spot. The menu is really extensive and varied. We had a hard time picking from all the choices so we asked for some recommendations and the waiter was very helpful. I was a big fan of the squid ink paella and braised short rib of beef. It's on the pricier side compared to other tapas restaurants but the service, food and decor justify the price.
