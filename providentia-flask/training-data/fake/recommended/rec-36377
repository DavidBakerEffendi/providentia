I have eaten at Balthazar's a few times over the past decade. Finally decided to write a review. Here's what I think- if you are coming for the scene and/or cocktails it's fine. If you want to get a good dinner - A-OK is all it is. I ordered a steak with salad on the side and both were extremely over-peppered and over-salted. At least it was medium-rare as I had wished. Â The prices are appropriate for the location, but honestly, you can get a better steak in a less well known joint. We also had oyster for an Appetizer. Overpriced! Also, hard to get a table, my friends were lucky to snag a booth up front for dinner on a Wed night.
