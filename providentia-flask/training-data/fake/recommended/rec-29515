This is the first time I order take out and had to eat left overs. After waiting about an hour for the food to be delivered, the shrimp in garlic sauce was cold, and my picadinho with shrimp had NO shrimp. They also forgot my two liter coke. Of course I called but was placed on hold twice. Needless to say, I will not order from this place again.
