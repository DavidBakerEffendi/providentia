What a great place!! We were renting a place on Dean St. and the owners recommended this place. It was a short walk for us and are we glad we went. We got there a little early on a Tuesday and glad we did because by the time we left, the place was packed. We were greeted by friendly people and seated promptly. Service was great. My wife started with the leek soup and I had the Olives and a cheese plate. We shared a bottle of wine that was recommended by the waitress and it was a home run. For our mains we both had Rigatoni and again, so good. Delicious. For desert we had a salted caramel apple pie which rivaled the best. This place is terrific and a must go. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because the tables are quite tight together.
