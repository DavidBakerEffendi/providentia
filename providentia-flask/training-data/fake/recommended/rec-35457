We did a take out on our way home from a day out.  Hubby had the Chicken Parm which was great.  Perfect thickness in the chicken and sauce was awesome.  I had the Meat Lasanga which was also very good.  I tried that on the reviews of many.  Thou it was good they used a spice that was a bit overwhelming for me.  Still trying to figure it out.  It had a very strong flavor.  Different I would say but all in all still very good.  We will back as wish to try the seafood and veal dishes.
