Back in the day, Americana was awesome. It was like your everyday normal diner. It was cheap, gave big portions and tasty. Now i feel like it's changed so much and unfortunately not for the better. As a local and many other locals, we don't go here anymore. It almost feels like a chain restaurant rather then a diner. The menu selection is very confusing and very pricey! It tries to be fancy (pairing wine?!) yet it's suppose to be a diner...hmmm =\ It's just not the same.
