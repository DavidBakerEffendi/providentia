We went here for the famous sandwich that we saw made on Vimeo once. When we arrived, we found out that the sandwich and the corn dog are only served after 11pm. We ended staying for the curry goat neck, and it was actually quite delicious. The meat was very tender, tasted like lamb (my first time ever had goat meat). Drinks are relatively affordable too. Good around!
