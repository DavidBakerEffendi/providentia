Beef brisket soup with fried egg. Delish! Lamb soup not as good. Lamb seemed frozen and it was tough with lots of big bones and less meat than the beef brisket. A huge bowl of delicious hand-cut noodle soup for only $5-$6, I don't think you can find a better deal in the city! The decor is very bare and school cafeteria-like, but that doesn't matter when the food is so cheap and delicious! I'll definitely be back!
