I absolutely love this place! I checked this place out after reading so many great reviews here. If you're in a small group, I'd recommend just sitting at the bar because the wait can be quite lengthy. I opted for the pad thai with chicken and it was really good and you can't go wrong with $11 - the portions are huge.
