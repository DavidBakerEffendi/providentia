Fantastic, except for the exceptionally long wait, not matter what time you go... The best ramen after Ippudo of course... The cooks a very nice. We had an interesting conversation with one of the cooks... trying to figure out if Uni was eggs or... male semen... or if Uni even had a gender... Â turns out Totto Ramen chefs are not specialized in Uni... so in case you still wonder, Uni are ovaries...
