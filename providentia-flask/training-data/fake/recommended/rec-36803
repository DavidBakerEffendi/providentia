Awesome place, awesome pizza. Pizza was very similar to Motorino (which is pretty much at the top of the pizza world right now). Crust was nice, very flavorful. Sauce was exceptional, possibly better than Motorino. Cheese was also very nice. Decor is really cool- feels like an old barn or something. Definitely go here if you want excellent pizza napoletana.
