I was in NY during the fall and it was an amazing trip.  We were told to try out Balthazar's (but we were told good luck getting in since it is a hot spot of the city).  We went a little after dinner time, but before after hours, and we were seated right away.  The place was beautiful.  The rustic old, almost old hollywood glam meets mob style gangster feel with a cozy hug of warn out wood frames.  It was beatiful. I had that Seared Organic Salmon and the Onion Soup.  Amazing flavors and it was the perfect amount of food - not too much and not too little.  The service was great but our waitress seemed a little disconnected with us, almost like she knew as soon as we got up our place was being filled.   Based off of food alone - I would recommend this place to anyone!
