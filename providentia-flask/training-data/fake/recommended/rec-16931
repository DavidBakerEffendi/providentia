Not really sure what the entire hype is. My brother loves it but to me the chicken tastes weird, really chewy. You can get better halal chicken platters with more juicy chicken, try naya express which isn't too far from halal guys. Also, i question the hygiene of this place. My friend ate here and was throwing up the entire night and got food poisoning.
