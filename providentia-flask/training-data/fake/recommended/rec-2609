Ravioli? Holy Cannoli! This place carries oives, fresh mozz, oive oil, bread, etc. but I recommend you get all that at Di Bruno's or Claudios. What you really come to Talluto's for is their fresh pasta. They have freezers that hold their freshly made ravioli, cavatellis, penne and sauces. Â  These are incredible. HINT: For the adventurous chefs, just ask for a sheet of pasta to bring home, and then cut/mold your own pasta at home! (It will make you feel more accomplished, trust me).
