I was dying for a burger the other day so my wife and I stumbled into this place.  It is a TINY hole in the wall, the menu has about 8 items on it, but so far everything we got was really good.  The atmosphere was very friendly and cozy. The burgers are a little non-traditional as they are served on ciabatta bread and they come with a small, kind of worthless, salad. Once I realized that these weren't typical burgers, I thought I would be brave so I tried the Bronte burger, which has sweet chili mixed in with the ground beef.  It was juicy and delicious and actually pretty big. When we go back, which I am sure we will, we plan on splitting a burger.
