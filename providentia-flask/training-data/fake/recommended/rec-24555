There are no words to describe the beauty of this restaurant. The ambiance coupled with the friendliness of the team is Â incomparable to any other place in the city. From the first step into the restaurant to the last step out my fiance and I were treated with utmost hospitality. Donald and his wife have created a gem in chelsea. We definitely will be back for the awesome drinks and AMAZING paella!!
