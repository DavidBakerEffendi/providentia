I have never had Thai food before, but I am a fan now. First of all, the restaurant has a great ambiance. The drinks are unique and tasty and the menu has plenty of options. I had the lunch special, got a small salad with yummy ginger dressing and a veggie spring roll, delicious. Then I had pad Thai with beef, a big portion and that was also very good. I ate the whole thing. My friend who took me there has spent time in Thailand and knows the cuisine. She approves of this place and also tried the iced Thai coffee. She told me how it's made in Thailand and after tasting it she said it was exactly how it should be. I am already looking forward to going back there.
