You know when you go to place, have an ok meal and then you forget it exists? That is Ants Pants Cafe: forgetable. I don't know why I forgot Ants Pants the first time. I think I enjoyed my food and the service was fine. I think it was that Ants Pants was merely unexceptional. Today, a friend suggested Ants Pants. I thought, "Oh yeah. That place." We wandered over from my job and had a very late brunch. I had two eggs and my friend had a salad. Both plates were good, but nothing struck a chord. There should be something you tell your friends with relish or with venom. There should be something that sticks out about a place. The atmosphere at Ants Pants wreaks of BLAH. I can say that whoever designed Ants Pants is a genius of spatial planning. For a place so small , they smanage to fit 24 seats well enough. But should seating charts spring to mind for where you go for brunch? No. Very Blah.
