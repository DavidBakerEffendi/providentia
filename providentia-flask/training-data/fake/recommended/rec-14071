Very solid restaurant that uses multiple ingredients and pleasurably treats diners to dishes with unique, thoughtful combinations and multilayered flavors. The Goat cheese gnocchi, cauliflower, sage, brussels sprouts, pancetta , Pecorino, Lemon zest had an excellent depth of flavor and was a real pleasure.  The other dishes were equally satisfying.  The Halibut and the Pork Chop were both cooked perfectly and seasoned nicely. The restaurant itself was a bit more casual than I thought from pictures and accounts.   The room is attached to the lobby of the hotel and has a bit of "budget hotel trying to be trendy feel"  to the interior.  It's actually fine but the quality of the food outstrips the decor. Overall, this place is definitely a winner and worth a try.
