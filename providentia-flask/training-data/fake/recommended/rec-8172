If you don't live or work near Old Nelson, you're missing out on an excellent lunchtime stop. Â The deli counter has a wide variety of delicious sandwiches and hoagies, so you can find something for even the pickiest eater, and their selection of drinks, chips, candies, and snacks is much better than a typical convenience store. Everyone there is friendly and welcoming, with none of the attitude you can find at some local eateries, and the service is very fast -- even with ten or twelve people waiting for sandwiches, it only takes a couple minutes. Sometimes I "forget" to pack a lunch, just so I can eat here.
