Not worth the money, I ordered a full order of ribs which should be a full rack-15 pieces. Received my order, I have 8 half pieces of rib not a full strip of rib a half strip- what a waste!!! Called to ask for the other half of my order and was told that is what 25 bucks get me half a rack. They just lost a customer!!!!!
