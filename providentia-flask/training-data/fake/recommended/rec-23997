I think is a really sweet place to see a band that you like. There's something I'm not really crazy about though as far as just hanging out and grabbing a drink with a friend. This will never really be one of my favorite bars to frequent unless I'm going to see music. I've been there a couple times now for shows and it's nice because it's small. I'm sick of going to big shows and concerts because it sucks standing elbow to elbow with thousands of sweaty annoying drunk kids. When a venue is too large sometimes you can't hear the sound very well and you're so far away and it quickly becomes impersonal and boring. I would recommend someone coming here for their first time to see a band they actually know and like so that they have a reason to stick around. Because I'm sure for a lot of people like myself, it's the kind of place where you might just get tired of all the cool kids and just go somewhere else. Mostly just that part of town harbors and annoying crowd so it's not Johnny brendas fault. Whoever that is.
