I went here for a friend's birthday a few weekends ago on a Saturday around 9. I love a cozy wine bar, and was excited to try this one, especially since the prices seemed so reasonable. I had the $9 Pinot Noir by the glass, and it was a really good Pinot, especially for the price, which I consider reasonable for Manhattan. My problem with the place was how crowded it was. There was a private party going on in the back, so the only area for non-party goers was the front. So it was PACKED. We started out standing in the only open area, which was by the bar, and also a well-travelled path to the back and bathroom. I seriously was on the verge of a nervous breakdown as every two minutes I had to flatten myself against the wall to allow someone to pass. That is not the relaxing experience one hopes for at a cozy wine bar. Our group got a table after an hour or so, and things improved after that. I'd go again because I think on a less crowded night, it would be a truly enjoyable experience. But if I try it again, and the atmosphere is the same, I'll probably cross this one off of my list.
