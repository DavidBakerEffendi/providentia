This is the first review that I have ever written. I have lived in the neighborhood for 4 years and have been waiting for a place like this to open up. If I wanted to stay local my options were either one of the many depressing Irish pubs, a lounge full of shiny t-shirts and blown out hair, or the beer garden. Sweet Afton is a place for the rest of us. The bartenders and servers make you feel like your at home and enjoy being there just as much as the patrons. if there was a recipe for a great bar Sweet Afton has the patent. First impression is that you are in a Brooklyn bar but after five minutes you realize that your in Astoria and its a place we can be proud to call our own. To the owners: Thank you. I hope you make a load of money and open up more places like this.
