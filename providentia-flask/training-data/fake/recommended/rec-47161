This place is awesome. . First off, the food is delicious. But What a friendly and warm italian cafe feel. The service was beyond nice. It was my girlfriend's bday, and they left her glass of wine off the bill. Then the delightful (read, tipsy and very happy) true italian (like, actually from italy) couple at the table next to us bought us a round of drinks. So we ending up getting an appetizer, tons of bread, Â two main courses and drinks for a grand total of... $39! That included tax. No joke, we felt like we robbed the place. what a great night!
