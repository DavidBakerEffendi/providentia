i'm a frou frou girly girl with a soft spot in me heart for cottages. penelope hit everything that i love about decor, girlieness-and having it be on murray hill so close to where iw as staying during nyc-it was the best brunch end to my stay in new york. i had the salmon egg dish. it was so yummy. our waitress was great, the food was quick and tasty-and the decor really made me happy. i enjoyed this place very much and it makes me wish for a new lacy frock to wear to it, if i get the chance to patronage it again during my next stay in manhattan.
