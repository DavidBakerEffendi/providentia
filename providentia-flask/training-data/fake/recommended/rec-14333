Good food for 6 bucks.  This is one of the places where I wonder how they make money.   But enjoy while they're cheap!  6 bucks gets you a good amount of rice, chicken, and uh, lamb? for the mix combo.  Then you get to put white sauce, red sauce, and some other red sauce on it.  And it's good. It's good even if you put a little too much red sauce on it and it burns.  But it's so good, you keep eating.  And it keeps burning, and you drink water to cut the burn, or try eating the pita.  And its good.  But it's still burning.  So you try to eat more, all the time tasting great food and feeling the burn in your throat.  Normally, this would end quickly, but they give out good portions, even if you're sharing.  So it keeps going and going.   And when it's over, you wish you had more. I wonder what kind of time-bomb chili they use for that red sauce.  It doesn't hit you like Sriracha or something, but it does creep up on you and burn.  It's good though...  just use with caution.
