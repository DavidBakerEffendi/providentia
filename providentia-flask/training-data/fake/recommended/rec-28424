I had always felt a bit uneasy about Vesta whenever I would go by it on 21st St.  Something about the orange awnings and such with graffiti on them.  Not that the graffiti was their fault, it's pretty shitty someone actually did that.  Poor Vesta can't even paint over that... Anyways, finally went for brunch and well, it was pretty damn spectacular.  Some of the reviews say it's got a Brooklyn pretentious feel.  I really did not get that at all.  If wooden tables, exposed brick and paintings on the walls is the equivalent of Brooklyn pretension then color me wrong, but I'd mark this place up to a cozy neighborhood restaurant.   I had the hangover pizza.  It was huge and delicious.  The crust was light and crispy and wonderful.  The toppings really made this a great pizza.  I had never had fried egg on a pizza before.  It was really eye opening.  I want to put it on every pizza now.  My girlfriend had their version of eggs benedict with poached eggs, soppresata, and ricotta.  It was amazing.  Literally amazing.  It was better than my pizza, and my pizza was great.   So I will need to go back for dinner and then perhaps this will become a 5 star review.
