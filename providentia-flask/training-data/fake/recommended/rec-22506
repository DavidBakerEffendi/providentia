The food and service were exceptional. The chicken rillette was exquisite along with the presentation. We ordered a variety of entrees from the fish and chips, Beef Wellington and the duck, everything was prepared so perfect. We truly enjoyed this dining experience. Â It's conveniently located by a couple of train stops. Put this on your list of places to go in Brooklyn. You will not be disappointed!
