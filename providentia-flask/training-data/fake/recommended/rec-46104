The Mill on the River is absolutely wonderful. My now-husband and I celebrated a beautiful Valentines Day dinner there a couple years ago and decided to use it as our location for our rehearsal dinner. They took the time to sit with myself and my Mother in Law beforehand to go over the menu and exactly what we wanted on our day. Everything was perfect. The weather was gorgeous and since there was no wedding booked that afternoon, they allowed us to use their gazebo to rehearse. The waitstaff was pleasant and helpful, it all looked and tasted wonderful. We cannot wait to go back and have another amazing experience!
