I got the all star burger that is the official burger of the Red Sox, the only downside of it was that it was super greasy and wish they had given my wet wipes to clean up my face and hands after eating it. It was a good burger, just really messy. My waitress never asked to refill my drink and all I got was water and I finished by drink before my meal even came. I did get the seafood chowder also, and that was pretty good.
