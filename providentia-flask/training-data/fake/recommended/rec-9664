Very cheap dumplings. 5 for $1 for fried, 5 for $2 for boiled. Only 5 seats in the shop. Some shaded benches to eat 1 block north and 1 block west. The food itself is very good with one caveat - Order which ever has just been cooked. If you arrive and the fried have been sitting, then order the boiled. I had both and the fired were not so great because there were sitting while we waited for the boiled to finish cooking.
