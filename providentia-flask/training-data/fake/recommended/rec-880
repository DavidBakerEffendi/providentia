I don't believe they do cocktails, I saw nothing but wine behind the bar. I did however have a nice glass of dry Chardonnay that was recommended by the waiter. The bread was kind of burnt and hard and the butter was too cold. The endive salad is literally the best thing I've had in awhile; roasted pears, Roquefort cheese, walnut, port vinaigrette... I almost ordered another one.The Escargots with herbs and garlic butter was good as well. I got the atlantic salmon with baby vegetable risotto and saffron sauce upon recommendation over the steak. The salmon was cooked perfectly as was the rice, however the vegetables were overdone and the sauce very nearly ruined the dish. It had this strange thick orange component, I couldn't really taste the saffron at all, I tried to scrap most of it off. Wish I'd gotten a different entree. Los profiteroles for dessert was solid, the chocolate was the right consistency as was the cream to puff ratio. Good experience, pricey though.
