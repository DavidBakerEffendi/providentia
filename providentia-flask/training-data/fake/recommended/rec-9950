Wow what a fresh idea. The food was tasty for lunch. And great for the salads and pastas. We were in town doing a show and went for lunch. We were pleasantly surprised that portions were not too big or heavy. Service was fast and efficient. Perfect for take away or a quiet dinner by yourself or a non date night. Went back for the Dusted Artichokes. Â Wow...Yummy and great take out food. Who knew.
