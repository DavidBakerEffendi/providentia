Atmosphere - no to my taste. A bit bright, kinda feels like a low-cost chain Service - at first, bad, then good. At first we had to actually get up to find a server after waiting maybe 15 minutes - and it was not full. We found a waitress who decided to take our table and she was great. Food - I was pleasantly surprised. crust was very good and ingredients seemed fresh and local. We had three kinds of pizza and they were all good. Â Caesar salad had too much dressing. Drinks - we had beer and there was more than enough to chose from. Many I had never heard of. Prices seemed fair. I would give 3.5 if I could.
