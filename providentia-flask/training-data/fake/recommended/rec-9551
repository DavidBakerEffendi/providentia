the decor and atmosphere is lovely. beautiful chandelier most people would compliment on the nicely dressed waitresses and staff. food though.. was a disappointment. PRETTY looking but that's about it. wished we ordered different food...... curry puffs: i love curry puffs so of course i'd love this one. mango chicken: the sauce was good.. chicken was not room service pad thai: looked beautiful. the first few bites tasted very good but then it started getting tiring and there's just way too much flavor. i had to keep drinking water. mixed seafood inside was...2 shrimps...5 squid things?...3 oyster meats..and 1/4 of a scallop..yay!...
