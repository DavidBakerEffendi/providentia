On a nondescript block toward the LIC end of Astoria, convenient to the Green Space Dance Studio, which brought me to the neighborhood, I was fortunate to find this tasty Brazilian restaurant.  The soup of the day, a fish chowder, was especially enjoyable with a few drops of the hot sauce, which created some potent high notes in a deep, rich broth.  Although the menu goes heavy on meat, the vegetarian plate was substantial and delicious.  A glass of sangria was bit pricey for the size and somewhat too sweet for my taste.  Service was largely attentive.  The crowd included families, local hipsters, and enough tables speaking Portuguese to convince me of the authenticity.
