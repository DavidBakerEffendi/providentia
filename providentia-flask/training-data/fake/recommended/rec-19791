Always the go-to place for late night food that satisfies the craving. Whenever I go, I always see people on one long line. I'm hoping that by now, ppl know that there are about 4 corners you can get gyro from...NOT ONE. I always laugh whenever I see that. Add the white sauce and BBQ sauce! It's the best.
