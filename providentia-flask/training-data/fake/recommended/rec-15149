This place is awesome!!!!   Five stars if you ask me.  Chrissy is awesome as well and always greats me with a smile on her face.  Whether it's the Bacon Blue Burger, or a Cheese Steak, there is nothing that does not taste fabulous here at Sonny's. The atmosphere is always pleasant and the shop is always clean. As far as I am concern, Sonny's has the best food made in Philly.
