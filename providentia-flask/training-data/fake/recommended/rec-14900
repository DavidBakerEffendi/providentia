Amazing flavors, great location and friendly service make this gem a 5 star experience. Having just returned to Philly after a few years away Khyber Pass ended up being my welcome home brunch and what a brunch it was! The place is designed with a nice hole in the wall pub look, but the tables are roomy and the decor fun and interesting. I especially appreciated how the dining area lacked any televisions, giving our meal the more classy and social vibe of a higher prices restaurant. Once we got down to eating the delicious American flavors never stopped coming. I had a Khyber burger and fries, my typical and admittedly boring go-to. The burger was bursting with great flavors though and easily became the best burger I have had in years. Barbecue onions, unique mustard and well cooked bacon topped the patty, while the bun was an exceedingly high quality potato bun. The burger itself tasted of high quality meat and freshness, cooked perfectly to a warm pink medium which is hard to get in restaurants. My girl had the brunch banana foster french toast and it was insanely good. Too sweet for my palette but the flavors were there in every way. She cleaned her plate and told me it was a five star experience, which I would agree on for my two bites. I would order it as a dessert after a meal! She also had praline bacon, which was also sinfully good. I had to steal at least two whole pieces from her because the mixture of bacon, pralines and syrup was to die for. Everything was topped off with the best homemade lemonade I've had in a while, strong in taste but not abrasive, and super nice and speedy service. The meal altogether was sit back and close your eyes good. I felt bad leaving and would go back tomorrow. I can't wait to try the Southern style BBQ and chicken in future trips. If you're downtown toward the river you have to go to Khyber Pass!
