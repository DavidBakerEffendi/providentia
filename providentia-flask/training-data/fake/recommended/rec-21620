We anxiously awaited the opening of this restaurant since it was a mere 2 blocks from our house.  Call us unprepared, but when we first went the prices were shocking.  I have never been to Vetri but Osteria was billed as the affordable little brother.  I guess I was expecting something actually affordable.  You can go in and get a pizza and some pasta and make it out for a reasonable amount.   But I dont want to pay $75 for pizza and an appetizer.   But the space is pretty cool, and the food is mostly house-made.  I was amazed when the waiter went over the list of what they made in-house.  They have a regular bar and a bar near the kitchen, but there's a big wall up that you stare at between you and the kitchen so its not really that cool.  I know they now have a patio between them and the church along Broad street which I haven't checked out but it looks neat.  There are plenty of potted plants to drown out Broad street.   Reservations are essential especially now that James Beard gave it best new restaurant.  Check it out for yourself, especially if you like authentic Italian but be prepared to spend a lot.
