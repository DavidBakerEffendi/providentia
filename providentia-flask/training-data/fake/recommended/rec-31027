This place first has a beautiful location right near the river on Kelly Dr. It was great. Second, the customer service was tremendous, I didn't feel weird being there and all the young ladies were pretty. Last but not least, the good was out of this world, would of been cool if I read Italian but loved the experience I had at this spot!
