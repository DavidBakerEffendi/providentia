I NEVER write reviews. NEVER. Buy I have to for this. I've been to The Pines twice in the last 2 months and can't get enough. The decor, the food and the people really make this Gowanus gem stand out. First, the decor reminds me of that house in Fight Club but in the best way possible. It's like Martha Stewart meets Gowanus or like a French bulldog in a puffy coat- Ugly Cute. It's equal parts homey and grungy. Pitch perfect BK ambience. Next, the food. TRY EVERYTHING, or at least as much as you can. It's some of the most interesting and equally delicious food you can find hands down. Duck confit muffins with foie-sting? Stop. They even made a plate of cabbage to die for. Definitely get the cabbage. Lastly, the people. I LOVED our servers when we went. They remembered our names, knew what they were talking about when it came to pairings and which cocktails fit our mood. And they were down right charming.
