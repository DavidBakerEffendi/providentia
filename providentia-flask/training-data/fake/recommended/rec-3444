I came here for brunch with some friends. Â Prepare to wait for seating when you come here, but it is well with it. I had the fried chicken and waffles which were like a heavenly party in my mouth. These were the best Belgian waffles I have ever tasted! Everyone in my party loved their food and the serving sizes are quite large, so prepare to eat. The staff was very friendly and kind. Will definitely be back her soon!
