Awesome Ramen place for Philly. Â Chewy noodles, good portions, yummy toppings and flavorful broth. The miso and the spicy miso are awesome. How do they make their eggs so awesome and soft in the middle- definitely worth the extra dollar. I love their fatty pork that comes with each bowl. Definitely get their pork bun (which is a cute white bun with salad and a slice of pork belly inside), or spider crab bun- delicious as well! I have to stop myself from coming everyday!
