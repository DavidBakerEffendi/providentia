This is a GREAT place to eat.   Their lasagnas are made to order in their own dish. I always get the same thing each time....the four cheese lasagna.  Best Bolognese lasagna too.    The atmosphere is great. We always try for the window table to watch people going by.  Good wine and dessert selection as well.
