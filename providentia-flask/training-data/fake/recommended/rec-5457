Went on a Friday during lunch hour and was not impressed.   I had the veggie burger that looked like it came straight from the box with a slice of government cheese on top. My sister had the curry naan that tasted nothing like curry though they had the color right *shrug* My nephew had the grilled cheese .... and... how do you mess up a grilled cheese sandwhich?!? Overpriced for subpar food.   The two stars are for the decor and the service
