I LOVE Iron Chef.  I was so sad when they closed their old location.  When Mei (the owner) called to tell them they open their current store front, I was so excited that I almost abandoned my half made dinner to go there to eat! The Taiwanese menu is very authentic - I took my parents who were visiting from Taiwan and they agreed as well!  My go to dish is the Noodle w. Meat Sauce (Ja Jang Mian - Taiwanese menu item T37 or A3).  I tried many of their dishes and none of them disappoint.  If you are looking for a rice dish to try, i recommend the Beef Stew Over Rice (item A16).  It is on the higher price point, but the flavor is amazing, IMHO.  And Chinese Meatball in Brown Sauce (A29) is my splurge. And don't overlook the appetizers!  If you like spicy food and don't mind trying something new, the Spicy Beef Tendons is really great.  Oh, and if you are not too hungry, and just want a little something to eat, the Taiwan Style Burger is really great (it comes with crushed peanut powders so don't get that if you are allergic!). During the week, it's only the Chef and Mei (husband and wife) so the food doesn't come out as fast, but I take it as a good thing - the food is always made fresh and they don't just use the same sauce for all the dishes!  On the weekend, they have a little help, but they also have more customers, so there may still be a wait.  But I promise, it's worth it! And don't forget, cash only!
