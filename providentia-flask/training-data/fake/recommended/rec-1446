I lived in Brooklyn my whole life and never even heard of this place until recently. The yuppies line up like loyal stooges for an "authentic new york pizza" and will wait around like masochists while old man di fara smears his olive oil all over his pizza...in SLOW MOTION. On my way back from a doctors appointment one night, I passed this place and decided to see what the big deal was. I was doing research on some of the great pizzarias of NYC and saw this place listed. The place was officially closed (rope across the doorway) but the window was still open and I asked if thier were any slices left. I was in luck, There was one left over, and seeing that I was outrageously handsome and burning with pure charisma; the lady worker rushed over and put the pizza in the oven for me. A minute later she slid the slice over to me and in a heavy new yawk accent told me it was gonna cost me 5 bucks. 5 bucks? for a slice?? do i look like a tourist to you? I said "what the hell" and paid it because NOW I was to damn curious to stop myself. After taking a couple of bites I have to admit..that it was a great slice. Even by NYC standards. Maybe a bit to much olive oil, but still one of the best slices I ever had. Worth 5 bucks? Nah. Worth a half hour/hour wait? nah. not in my opinion. While I believe that Pizza is a great part of NYC heritage, 5 bucks for a plain slice with an hour wait on top of it; sounds ridiculous to me. It prevents me from giving this place 5 stars. Ultimately if you are a out of towner who wants to see what the big deal is and are curious as to what OLD brooklyn pizza tasted like in another era, and you arent put off by the blatant over-charging and long waits, then a slice at DiFaras just might be an offer you can't refuse.
