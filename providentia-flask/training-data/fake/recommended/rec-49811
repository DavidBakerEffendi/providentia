What a great place. As a resident of Hell's Kitchen I am so glad that finally, on a street filled with Thai restaurants, there is finally an authentic Thai restaurant that is amazing. The decor is plain, but go for the food. The papaya salad with seafood was excellent as well as the mock duck in a spicy pepper sauce. Ginger rice was a great thing I have never seen before. The food here is not like the average Thai 9th ave fair. Really impressive and I will go back again and again
