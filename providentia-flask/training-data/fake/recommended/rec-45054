I wasn't hungry. I was soaking wet. I inhaled the mixed falafel platter in about five minutes -- it was that good. Staff remarkably friendly, considering the crowds and the close quarters. I grew up on Mamoun's, but Taim is... different. To me, it's worth the premium for the different flavors and the prospect of high-end (?) falafel. I like how the menu items complement each other. There's a lot of thought and a lot of care here. Very impressed!
