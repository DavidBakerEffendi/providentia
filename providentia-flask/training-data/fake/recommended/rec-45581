This place has always been good for a quality lunch or dinner on the cheap, and now we finally review it. We ordered a special egg and fish-chili sauce appetizer, the bbq cornish hen, and the red curry. The egg and chili appetizer was a thinly fried spiced egg served with a dish of chili sauce and rice, but the taste was really lovely. It was definitely an appetizing start to the evening. The bbq hen was a dry barbecue that came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. The hen itself was cooked very well. Finally, the curry was superb. The service is always reasonably good here, and even though they are popular for dinner, our table had enough room around it so we could relax.
