Out of this world amazing!!! Finally got the chance to go after having a delayed flight n having to cancel my one month in advance reservation. The staff here is hard to find now days they are sweet friendly and will do anything to accommodate you. I went in with hub and 2 little ones on a full Saturday night without a reservation because it was fully booked and had lost my Friday night reservation because of my flight delay. And they were so nice and helpful to arrange a table practically in the middle of the way to seat us THank u thank u Forgione's staff. Our server was sooooo helpful and informative. The food: Well I knew what I was getting into "is an Iron Chef people the best of the best and I always been a fan, he is so creative and smart. The chicken under the brick DIVINE with shaved truffles in top OMG Amazing!!! Â The chili lobster oh la la and everything here is delicious we had also a fish plate and the s'mores dessert and a couple of cocktails. Follow servers recommendations they know what they r doing!! Can't wait for my next trip to NYC defenetly will be back!!!
