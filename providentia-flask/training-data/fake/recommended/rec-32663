As long as one understands that this is not the place to go for dining, and goes to just experience a taste of the various aspects of Italian food, products, etc., particularly the marketplace, then this is an absolute treat to have in New York.  Batali knows what he is doing and usually does it to perfection.  He's got a winner here.  Not everyone will be impressed, because they will come with different expectations, but if you pick a time that is in-betweeen meals, and avoid busy holiday times of the year, then you can browse, sample a few bites here and there, and really enjoy the experience.  Buon Appetito.
