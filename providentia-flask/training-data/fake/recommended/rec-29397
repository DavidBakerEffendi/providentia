Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. And yes. This is the kind of place I have been searching for.  It is simple, chill, unique, and fun.  That Steven Starr seriously knows what he is doing. Frankford Hall is the perfect addition to the up-and-coming Fishtown neighborhood.  It fits perfectly and naturally onto the 1200 block of Frankford Ave... you'd think it had been there for years. Great beer selection served by the liter or 1/2 liter and lots of great German inspired food.  The soft pretzels are the size of my face and that cheese sauce... not sure what it is, besides amazing!  And the curry ketchup for the fries.  So simple, but so good. The pay-as-you-go style and seat-yourself picnic tables are perfect for large groups.  Honestly there is nothing I love more than sitting outside on a warm summer night having some beers and BSing with my friends.  Frankford Hall attracts a great crowd so you will probably have made some new friends by the end of the night as well. And the best part?  Yeah, I haven't gotten there yet.  The best part is the fire pit where you can purchase $1 make-your-own s'mores packets.  My life is complete.
