Came here with a friend because he heard great things about this restaurant. It was also during NBA Finals and they had a TV so why not... hah. We ordered the Kaki Fri (Fried Oysters and Lettuce), Karai Kaibashira, and the Ise Ibi Sashimi (Whole Maine Lobster Sashimi) which are all House Specialities. They were all very delicious and fresh - I usually have a very bad allergic reaction to bad seafood, but the lobster was very fresh. The wait for the food was painfully long though and the portions were very small. Definitely not the place to go if you are starving. I would come again and try the other specialities!
