Can you say Tostones!!!!!!! I have to say this place is very good. Pork Chops in Red Sauce, Â w/ Rice/beans, a side of Tostones, and they have this "Special Green Sauce" on the table its outstanding its got a little kick but so very tasty!! Put it on everything..............I been here a few times, food is always consisitant, and ill be back. This place is nothing fancy, a quick lunch in and out.
