Well I think it's all about the atmosphere here.  I was referred to this place by the lady in a nearby shoe store.  She said it's a good place to people watch.  It was a tiny little place that resembled a diner inside.  It was sort of cute, but cramped.  Some of the food looked wonderful, but my choice was probably not the best choice in a Cuban restaurant.  I had a salad with grilled chicken and corn.  It had tortilla strips in it, which I did not know about, and they pretty much consumed the entire salad.  It took me about 20 minutes to pick them all out.  They were in a pile on the side of my plate, and there wasn't much else to the salad.  Very little chicken and a small amount of lettuce. Alot of people were ordering the grilled corn on the cob, which looked great, but I would not have eaten it since it was slathered with mayonaise and then sprinkled with grated cheese of some kind and then a line of some type of hot sauce.  I did have a side of black beans.  Those were good.  Anyway, not really my cup of tea, but I think the locals like it.
