This was actually a surprising find for me.  Shame on me for not trying this place sooner! The ramen was very authentic.  It brought back memories of my ramen-eating experiences in Japan.  The base broth was well-seasoned and fortunately neither too salty nor oily.  If I can enjoy a wonderful bowl of ramen during a hot summer day, it must really be one excellent ramen! I had the opportunity to only try 1 type of sushi (tekka maki) so I can't say that my opinion would be too accurate.  However, the fish was definitely fresh.  I just wish they used better quality ginger and wasabi for their sides but given the pricing of the food, I can't really complain.  At least the sushi itself is actually fresh so I am happy. Service was very good.  The server was polite, attentive, and efficient.  The place was clean and pleasantly quiet.  This is my new favorite place in Burlington and would be a fantastic place to go to in the winter!
