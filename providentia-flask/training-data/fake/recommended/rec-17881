This could be one of the grossest diners Ive had the displeasure to eat in. Under the table was a nice little collection of napkins and assorted junk. We ordered dinner specials. I was served london boil, no not london broil, but london boil. This meat was basically boiled and was incredibly under seasoned. This was hands down the worst london broil Ive ever been served. The coffee after tasted old and stale, but it couldve been the machine was just poorly maintained but regardless it was vile. When paying the bill I consider myself lucky I got a grunted thank you from the woman behind the counter. Overall like many other Bayonne dining establishments its just terrible.
