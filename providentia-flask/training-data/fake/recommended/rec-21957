Luigi's is not too bad.  Service is decent (depending on which day) and the food is decent (depending on which day).  I like the seafood salad and pasta dishes.  Other cooked food (such as chicken or fish dishes) can be better.  Somehow the tap water tastes bad here.     The atmosphere is very business like.
