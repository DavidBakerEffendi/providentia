Sunday brunch was perfection. I've been meaning to come here for years, and finally did. It was a crisp, early fall day, and we ate outside (the inside was smokey). I had the autumn vegetable omelet (with squash, corn, and kale). The sweetness of the squash paired incredibly with the eggs. There was also cheddar in the omelet, and it probably would have benefitted from a stronger kind. My girlfriend had the steak and eggs, which was cooked perfectly medium and delicious. We both opted for the creamy grits and flakey yet crisp biscuit as sides. We asked for a side of butter, which was pale, whipped, and rich, and amazing with the strawberry jam (loaded with whole berries). They were out of bacon (!!!), so we had a sausage patty: a fat, delicious, peppery, herbaceous, meaty orb. The mimosa was fruity and light, almost like an Orangina (not a bad thing). And the bloody Mary was one of the best I've ever had, spicy and flavorful, served with a beer back. The server was charming and attentive. We lost track of time and stayed past closing, and he was great. The coffee was okay-- nothing stellar-- and the chamomile tea was just a pot with a Stash tea bag (for $5).
