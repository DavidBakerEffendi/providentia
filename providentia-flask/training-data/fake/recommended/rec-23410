It has been 3yrs since I last visited NY, during which time I ate here. The "fresh" homemade tofu really sets them apart. I've had Korean food all over WA, in Cali, and even Vancouver B.C. so I'm confident when I say their soon doo boo here is damn good. I'll have to go back someday and try their other dishes, but on the day I visited, that hot soup totally cured my hangover from the night before!
