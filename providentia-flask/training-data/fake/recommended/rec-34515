I have no #$%#$% clue why people venture out in the freezing cold, balls-sweating humidity, mud-butt haziness, flu-epidemic season to see this place. I went to Baruch adn this place JUST OPENED back in the day. The MSA (Muslim Student Association) and I were their biggest customers before the long lines and such. They had basmati rice with actual spices and the chicken was amazing. But then they became assembly lined and everything went down hill. Absolutely disgusting and I despise cart food to begin with, I went there for nostalgic purposes on Dec 26 with friends of mine who never had it. The gyro lamb sandwich I had, tasted extremely plain even with extra sauces. People need to experience real 'halal' food. Head down to Yemen Cafe and have yourself a feast.
