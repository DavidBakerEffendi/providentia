I tried the brisket and the pork ribs tonight. These were a little drier than I expected. You have to eat it with the BBQ sauce and hot sauce for it to be enjoyable. However, the mac n cheese and corn bread were delicious. It's worth checking out, but not worth the cost. Maybe they will get better in time.
