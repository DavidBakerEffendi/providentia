Lovely little spot in Nolita. We stumbled upon it by chance and really enjoyed the food. Everything in the menu looked so good that it took us a while to decide what to order. We ended up with really fresh salads and delicious pasta. We didn't order the burger though it's supposed to be very tasty (they have an award for it). The place seems to be a spot for the models working in the studios nearby so it makes it quite an experience.
