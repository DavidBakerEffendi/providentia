I live in Astoria so this is a wonderful hidden gem. Worth the trip if you don't live in the neighborhood. This is a family-run business so service is always good and personable. Food is consistently good after a few visits - national steak, shrimp stew, corvina (pollack), and the duck were all fantastic. A decent selection of drinks and you never have to wait to be seated. Definitely check it out!
