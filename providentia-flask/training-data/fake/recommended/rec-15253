Long lines, bad service, too expensive. I could barely finish my cheesesteak because it didn't taste good at all. There were only 3 people working there on a busy afternoon (including a kid who looked like he was underage!) This place is a tourist trap! Cheesesteak is not good at all especially for the price you pay.. Skip this place!
