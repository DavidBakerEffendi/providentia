Absolutely delicious. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and the gf got the pancakes. The EB was fantastic. The pancakes were fluffy and the syrup was the best I've ever tasted. The wait can be really long on weekends. i believe I waited a full hour before getting seated. Food comes out relatively fast once you order. The place isn't that big, so you might bump elbows with the people next to you. Overall, I'd highly recommend this place.
