I love Tabaré. It't not a crush. It;s not a summer fling. It's IT. I want to marry Tabaré. Because everything about it is perfect. Here's how: The food: everything from indulgent to healthy...The mussels put any French bistro to shame...The steak with chimichurri will make you cry...The empanadas will make you want to be a stoner every day...the fresh made pastas will make you want to ditch your mom's Italian cooking... The ambiance: *beautifully* lit (makes your worry about the whole light-bulb efficiency 2012 thing), intimate but lively, cutest little garden.. The service: It doesn't get better than Ramiro, Diego, and Bruno - These three boys will make you feel right at home - always smiley, sweet, attentive.. I want to keep Tabaré to myself but it deserves the credit...
