Why or why do I keep coming back to this place. Every 6 months I give this place another try but nothing ever chances and tonight was no exception. 2 hours later my husband and I and two kids were done with our entrees and on the way out. The service is SOOOO painfully slow it is insane. We needed to ask the waitress for everything twice. Each of the entrees came out individually about 10 minutes apart - so much for eatting together as a family. The list goes on and on. I continue to go back every 6 months thinking management must of changed and things must have improved (mainly the speed and accuracy of the service) but no nothing ever changes. Â I am now done with visiting Fridays. This was their last chance.
