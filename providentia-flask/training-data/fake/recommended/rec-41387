i have been anticipating chuko's opening for months and was thrilled to find it open upon returning from travelling. once i saw it open, i went the very next day. i like the casual environment and the nice wait staff. note to not wear the most comfortable v-neck grey american apparel t-shirt (if you own it) as that seems to be the current uniform for the staff. the menu is simple with just a few appetizer options and 4 different ramen broths with an additional special ramen. you can choose between pork or chicken as protein with your broths. i went with pork and pork ramen and the creamy yumminess was amazing. presentation was beautiful and the homemade chilli paste made the ramen more perfect than it already was. the dessert was great as well using ample hills ice cream sandwiched between a meringue-y macaron cookie. i am so thrilled to invite chuko to our neighborhood and am committing to weekly visits. THANK YOU!
