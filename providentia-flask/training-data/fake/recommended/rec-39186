A great find.  Reminds me of an old work lunch favorite in Boston.  Anyway- I had a tuna pocket with feta and spinach, delicious.  Matt had a speciality sandwich with chicken and hot sauce that he loved.  The only thing  we didn't like, the fries, and the rest of the food well made up for that.  I will definitely be back for more!
