This is the ONLY place in ALL of NYC that I am willing to put up with a douchey crowd to revel in the glory of it's beer selection!! Any beer snob would agree: having the ability to choose between all of what they have on tap as well as all of their bottled beers - featuring some of the most fantastic microbrews America has to offer- is worth tolerating collegiate-style sports fans drinking their jeagerbombs til they clear out and you're left among others who truly enjoy and appreciate the brews only Rattle N Hum provide. When they have special events (such as the wonderful Cask Festival last fall, or Cigar City Night just this past week), you're going to be dealing with big annoying crowds for the 'rush hour' portion of the night. But by 11:00pm, I've found those pilsner-pounders will have left in pursuit of drunken-club-grinding and you'll be able to really get your beer-snobbery on . The bartenders show gratitude if you are tolerant during the rush of people and are clearly there for the unique beer experience they can provide - if you treat them nicely and convey patience, don't be surprised if free shots come your way later in the night.
