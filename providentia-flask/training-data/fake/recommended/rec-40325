After seeing Jose Garces on Iron Chef America recently, I was psyched to visit Philly for a business trip this week.  Amada was not around when I lived in Philly, so it was new to me, and I was very impressed with the first visit.  The menu looks intimidating at first with many categories - chaucuterie and cheese, traditional tapas, salads, grilled items, and cosas or flatbread.  A good strategy is to try something from each category.  We started with chaucuterie and ordered a large plate of lomo, which was a generous portion for $9.  The ensalada de jamon was another winner -  a fig and cabrales cheese salad wrapped in serrano ham, which was very flavorful and also generous in portion.  For some reason, some of the traditional tapas fell short, like the gambas al ajillo, which was not very flavorful.  But the octopus with potato was incredibly flavorful and tender.  Also not to be missed are the cocas (flatbread) and the version we liked best included duck confit, cabrales, Serrano ham and a date glaze.  Like the salad, just an incredible combination of flavors.  We somehow managed to save room for dessert, and the special was an item that the chef prepared on Iron Chef America, which included small cubes of various melon glazed with sugar (like crème burlee) accompanied by crème fraiche ice cream, which was a lighter and perfect ending to a glorious meal.  Overall, Amada is refreshing new take on an old formula with many surprises.  Highly recommended!
