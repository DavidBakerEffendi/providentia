This is a hidden gem! I am a huge diner fan .. This one is excellent! Everything in home made on the premises and the food tastes like it. Portions are generous and you get a lot of extras, like a cup of home made soup or a fresh salad. Service is friendly and fast. Prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend the detour on your way to or from Princeton or if you are in the area. The apple pie is worth it alone!
