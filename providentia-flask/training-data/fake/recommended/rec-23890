It's Stephen Starr...so of course the atmosphere is spot-on. He made it trendy without looking pretentious, and easy-going without being forced. I have a love/hate feeling about that, but I think most Philadelphians have that same feeling for him. Anyway, as much as I would like to hate this place (the aforementioned Starr reference), I can't. It's cool, and fun and a great place to hang out and sit by a fire and have drinks (not sure many places in the city offer that- or any at all?). The food is overpriced, and the wine (I'm an idiot that got wine at a German beer place) is served in the smallest of glasses. But you don't go there to really eat or get hammered. You go there to mingle and play ping pong. And that's fine by me.
