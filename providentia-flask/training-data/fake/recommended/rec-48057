I love Kabob Shack! I can't vouch for the meat, but the hummus and falafel sandwiches rock (I get them without cabbage and with lots of hot sauce), the fries are completely addicting, and the people who work here are great. I live right around the corner, and this has become one of my favorite spots- Inexpensive, delicious and quick.
