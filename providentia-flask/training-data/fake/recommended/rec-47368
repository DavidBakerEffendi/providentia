The food was good.  For a couple of drinks a salad and a main course, at $80 it was perhaps a bit over priced. My main hang out was the staff.  Our host told us 45 minutes and it was easily just under two hours.  They openly admitted to seating others in front of us.  It was cramped, the staff was rude.  At 8:30 on a Friday night at the village, what else were we supposed to do?  We had to suffer their abuse I hope you have a better experience, I just think there are so many good ones out there, why bother risking it - it was nothing special.
