Ok, so cash only. i HATE when places are cash only and have an ATM inside, how pretentious is that? I HATE that! so i ordered my shrimp crepe for take out and the guy forgot my order! i was kind of starving, so i reminded him and try to smile with the last hint of patience i had left. So the food came and i forgive them. They are pretentious and the cash thing is awful, but god that was the best crepe of my life! so i forgive them, go there and prepare yourself for the ray ban convention.
