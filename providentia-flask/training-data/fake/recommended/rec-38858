It is so nice to find a Chinese Restaurant that isn't just a typical delivery service with paper menus and light-up menu boards and the exact same food as every other Chinese delivery place in the world. THIS IS A SIT DOWN RESTAURANT. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? Not only is it a sit-down restaurant, it's a good one.  It's usually not too busy, we've never had to wait.  All the food is cooked fresh and to order.  The menu is pretty extensive, with a good combination of typical American Chinese dishes, authentic Chinese dishes, and house specialties.   Portions are generous but not ridiculous.  Veggies are never overcooked, nor are the shrimp.  The service is pretty fast but not rushed.  The only downside is trying to pick from so many items on the menu!
