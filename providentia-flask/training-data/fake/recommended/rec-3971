It's been sad to witness this business bloom from a cozy restaurant with good food into a large overcrowded bar, where the food has gotten consistently worse. During your visit, you may question: How little chicken can one put in a chicken enchilada? How much space do I actually need to eat comfortably? Is every dish chipped? I used to rave about this restaurant, but no longer. Â Now, each time I leave Chavela's I have a list of rants. Goodbye Chavela's.
