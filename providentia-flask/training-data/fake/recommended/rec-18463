Brand new, but food is great! I've eaten here several times now and Â everything I've had is excellent. And very healthy. The service is fast and friendly. I highly recommend the place. It's not a "dinner" place as far as ambiance and there's only a few tables. It's lunch-y in design, but the meals are good for lunch or dinner.
