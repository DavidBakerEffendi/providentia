The menu is all comfort food and retro.  The decor is typical Steve Starr.  Very modern with retro touches.  However, we sat in the balcony and it was super loud.  We had the mac and cheese and chicken nachos for appetizers.  The Mac and Cheese was very good.  Creamy, cheesy with a taste of maybe blue cheese in it that gave it a nice more dimensional flavor.   I got chicken and waffles.  The chicken was perfect.  Crispy, flavorful skin and moist, tender chicken.  Waffles had a sweet touch to them and were very light.  I was surprised that we didnt' receive brown gravy or syrup for the waffles.  We got a white chicken gravy.  It was good, just very unexpected for me. Friend had london broil with twice baked potato and garlic drenched spinach.  The plate looked like it had just stepped out of the 70s- as designed.  Spinach was a bit over whelming w/ all the garlic but everything else was very good. I also had Tang for a drink. LOL Prices were reasonable.  Food was good, not outstanding but good.  I've been before and I'd go again but only if my other top 3 choices were unavailable.
