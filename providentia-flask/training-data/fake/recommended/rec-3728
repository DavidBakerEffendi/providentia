This review is only for their Happy Hour.  2 for 1 cocktails!  Now, I'm not a fan of cocktails usually because they tend to be too sweet for my taste.  But their "medicinal" cocktails have a wide variety of options, including several non-sweet ones.  My standout was the pepperonici martini.  It's basically a dirty martini but with pepperonici juice instead!  My friend got a couple of sweet ones which she thoroughly enjoyed.   Foodwise, the wings were recommended and pretty tasty.  I love buffalo wings and tend to be hesitant to order other types, but the Persian wings had really great flavor.  I would probably order them again.  The heirloom tomato salad was really fresh, and we also enjoyed the yogurt/herb mezze with their flatbread.   Started to get busy later on in the evening, but not too crowded even on a Friday night.  Definitely will be going there again after work for another Happy Hour.
