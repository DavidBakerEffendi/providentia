Wait was a bit annoying, but I had high hopes... I opted for the lamb, and when asked if I wanted hot sauce, I of course said yes.  Big mistake.  The sauce was so spicy as to make it inedible... and I love spicy food.  A few hours later, it hit me and I ended up sitting on the toilet for quite some time.  I don't know if it's just the spice or the quality of the street meat, but I don't care to know... I will not put myself through that again.  2 stars only because the non-spicy parts were tasty going into my belly.
