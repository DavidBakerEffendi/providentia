Words can not describe the fun we had at Do or Dine.  The food was amazing, the 5 of us split almost everything on the menu, appetizers, small plates and 3 of the large plates.  Steak Tartar was unbelievably tasty.  Deep fried deviled eggs and Fawn-tons ran a close second.  The staff was friendly and Justin came to the table several times to just BS with us.  If you are willing to try incredible food, this is the place.   To get even more variety, try the house drinks, though they can be a bit hearty on the bit.   Either get there when they open, or expect to wait on a weekend night.  Only seats about 35 people.
