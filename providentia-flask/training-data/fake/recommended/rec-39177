I'm a huge Top Chef fan...and was amazed by the food that was put out on Friday night. The restaurant was packed, and we didn't even wait long for our table. I was a bit in awe in seeing Harold in person...it must be that celebrity-ism that he now carries. As for the dining experience....5 Stars. An unlikely thing that I will give unless I was truly amazed. And Friday night, my gf and I were amazed. We started off the night with a glass of Pinot Noir...ordered two apps...the Duck Meatballs were fantastic! A very nice treat, that gave a nice little kick in the back of my mouth due to its heat. We also had the sea diver scallops...but I think what made it interesting was the pairing of the blood oranges. Overall, a well cooked starter. The entree, was a toss up...meaning, we couldn't decide what to get. I knew that I was going for the duckling...but I also had the Tuna in mind...then again, the gf opted for the Tuna special...so of course, it made it a whole lot easier to order. Â We also threw in a side of the Faro Risotto. We ordered the duck, MR, and the Tuna, rare. Both came out to our delight as it sure as hell looks like Harold is manning the pass to perfection. Dessert...we got the doughnuts...a nice sweet treat. And the chocolate tart...which was good...and not overwhelming. I highly recommend Perilla...as I plan on returning with a few friends for some really good food.
