Okay I don't give bad reviews. Infact I have never done that but my experience was so horrible that I have to write one. I used to go here when I used to live in Philadelphia and I always thought their food was decent. I live in Chicago now and went there during a conference and was horrified at how bad the food is. The lobster mac and cheese is really not mac and cheese it has no macaroni in it. Very few tiny pieces of lobster and woww 18 dollars for that???? The cappuccino was beyond horrible with extremely bitter taste. We literally had to go to max brenners and have the rest of the meal there including cappuccino. The basket chairs are extremely uncomfortable so don't sit in them. Your legs will be exhausted by the time you will be done.
