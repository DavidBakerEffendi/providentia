My son and I were in the area and was told to check out Prince Street Pizza.  We arrived last night around 9:30 pm and boy are we glad we did.  The pizza was OUTSTANDING and the owner and employees were extremely friendly.  I will recommend this plasce to anyone when in the area.  Thanks for possibly the best pizza ever!
