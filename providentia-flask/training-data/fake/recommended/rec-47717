This restaurant is unique and amazing! I recently came here with my boyfriend who also wrote a review about a month ago (Kyle W, he should be right below me!) We sat outside because it was a nice summer day. Our server was so pleasant and very insightful. Every question I had about the food, she had an answer. She would come fill our water glasses constantly and asked us how we were doing after each dish was brought out. I loved the attentiveness! Â  We also found out it was restaurant week in Hartford so we did the 3 course meal deal. We both started off with the calamari which was delicious! Crispy and lightly fried, the dipping sauce was also fantastic. We both ordered the salmon as our entree which literally melted in your mouth. The produce that they use in their dishes are grown locally (which I love!) I just can't get over how delicious the salmon was. We ordered the blueberry shortcake and chocolate cake for desert, which of course was delicious as well! Overall, our experience at Dish was amazing. Service was phenomenal, food was fresh and delicious and the company was great :) We will be coming back to Dish very soon!
