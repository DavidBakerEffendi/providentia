I had high hopes for this restaurant. When I first walked in, I noticed that the decor was nice and casual with a rustic feel. However, my hopes were soon shattered by the service and the food. Our waiter seemed to be in a bad mood at first, dismissing our questions and generally setting a poor tone for the evening. While the waiter's spirits seemed to improve when we engaged him in conversation, the overly salty food continued to ruin the experience. I ordered the kale and pancetta pizza and it was the most salty pizza I've ever had. The cheese had enough salt in it already, and with no tomato sauce to cut the salty flavor, the pizza was barely edible. It tasted terrible. I do have to say that the shrimp pizza appetizer was not bad, although my boyfriend's branzino was salty as well. Lay off the salt, Salute!
