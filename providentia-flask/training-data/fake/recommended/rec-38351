I had been to the Farmhouse once before, for late-night only and was not impressed. I went Sunday night and was blown away. I had a poached pear salad to begin, which was lightly dressed with a delicious dressing. The salad was huge as an appetizer however, and I recommend splitting it for two. For dinner, I had a lamb burger which was delicious. It was perfectly cooked medium rare and very juicy. The french fries were delicious, perfectly salted. Just enough to keep you eating them. One of my dining companions ordered the Nitty Gritty Corn Cakes, which was delicious as well. They made a very bland-sounding dish extraordinary. She also ordered the Glean Salad, which was nice, but ask for only a bit of feta, unless you want the salad drowned out by the feta. I would highly recommend going here any night. We went early on a Sunday evening and were able to be seated right away. But at the end of our meal there was quite a wait for a table however. Also, for the beers: they get their beer on Monday, so the selection is not as great on a Sunday night. I had the Trapp Lodge Vienna, which was hoppy, but really good. Overall, I had a great experience.
