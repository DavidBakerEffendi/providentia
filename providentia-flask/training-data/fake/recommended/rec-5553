Horrible. It's been a week and I still refuse to eat meat because of Fogo de Chao. The place was crowded and loud and the servers kept taking and throwing away the sides we were still eating. Wasteful! The meat isn't special, either. I had the beef and lamb before I flipped my card on its "stop giving me meat" side. The one star is for the delicious Malbec.
