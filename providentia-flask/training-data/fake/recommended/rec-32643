I finally tried Totto. After hearing of this place from multiple sources it was time to go. I've hit all the main ramen spots around town (Ippudo, Hide Chan, Minca, Momofuku, etc..) and now I feel this is the last of the known "greats" in NYC. I was happy that I didn't wait that long. My friend and I arrived early on to catch a play nearby. Fearing we would be late, getting there at 6pm only showed a 20min wait time.  Not too shabby. I ordered the main chicken broth ramen. I mean... its why you go there, right?  To say the least, it was very good. My socks were not knocked off in any way, but I did enjoy it quite a bit. I much would prefer a pork-based broth like you would find elsewhere, but Totto's was very flavorful and not too heavy.  The service was quick and friendly and in the end, we had plenty of time left over to catch our play and enjoy the night. I'd go back for sure, but its obvious this will always have a very long wait.  So if you go... put your name down early and go have a drink around the corner at Bamboo 52.
