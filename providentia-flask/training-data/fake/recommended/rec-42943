Came here today for brunch and I LOOOOVED my brunch! I definitely want to come back here for any type of breakfasty, brunchy type yummy meal. I had the 'Eggs Blackstone' and I got perfectly poached eggs, bacon, yummy toast and delicious potatoes. It was fantastic. I was sad to see it disappearing off my plate! My friend suggested this place and she got some type of middle eastern hummous, felafel plate thing which she enjoyed too. I ordered a mimosa on a whim and it was pretty blah and also, they brought me my earl grey tea with no lid on the pot, so the pot of water got cold while I drank my first cup and I had to ask for milk. I am definitely coming back and I will adjust up or down based on subsequent experience. if the breakfast is as great a second and third time, I'll almost certainly give them 5 stars! Our waitress was pretty nice, efficient, unpretentious, i liked her too.
