This is a serious sandwich shop and if I'm visiting Philadelphia I try to stop by to pickup a sandwich. I get the Jewish Hoagie with the works. I am never able to completely finish the sandwich and always eat the rest later. It does take awhile to get a sandwich made but if you've got time to kill and aren't too hungry to be impatient it's worth it. If you're there on a good day there will be free samples of random deli meats and cheeses you'd normally never get (pepperoni cheese anyone?).
