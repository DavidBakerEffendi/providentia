Being from south philly really really really wanted to LOVE this place. I used to order belly busters all the time from the other location. Â I dunno maybe it's because they got my order wrong but I really didn't care for what I ordered. Forgot my cheese on my chicken cutlet sandwich (huge let down) and there was a shell in my better then Petes fries. Listen don't get me wrong I mean I ate it because I was hungry but ehhh not what i wanted, but the wings looked good Maybe I'll try again!
