After seeing Corner Bistro on many Food TV Shows, I have wanted to check out this place....today was the day. Â I got in around 4 and got a lucky seat by the bar where I could check out the HUGE crowd, watch the Michigan football game on TV and eat one the best Burgers........in NY. I ordered the Bistro Burger...a Burger with a huge Beef Patty, Bacon, Cheese and a Soft Bun.......OUTSTANDING!! I know now why this place as been a NY favorite for so long.
