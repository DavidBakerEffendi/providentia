One of the better Banh Mi establishments I've eaten at. As a Vietnamese-American, Banh Mi for me has always been a basic meal that is supposed to be quick, cheap, and tasty. Though their price is a bit on the steeper side in comparison to other places, I still recommend Xe May for the overall quality of their sandwiches. There's lots of flavor, and the bread is crunchy but not rock hard. That in itself already beats out many other Banh Mi places who offer their sandwiches for cheaper.
