Banana Leaf is my first Malaysian restaurant I've attended. With group of friends, I went to this resturant in a late evening. First off, it was very crowded so I highly recommend reserving a seat beforhand. Roti Canai was served as an apetizer and it was actually really good. I don't like anything that has to do with coconut and I could tell that it had coconut milk in it but the taste actually didn't bother me because of their unique soup base. I ordered mango chicken and my friends ordered curry, noodles, soup, etc. They all tasted very unique and the food was not bad at all. But from my friend's point of view, she said that their food was not as spicy as it should be compared to other Malaysian restaurants. We wanted some spicy kick to our foods but none of them seemed quite spicy. Than for dessert, red bean soup was served. It was sweet and hot and I just loved it- perfect in a cold weather! The place was decorated with very interesting theme. It kind of feels like we are in a jungle. But I personally think it was too dark to eat food and the place was way too loud; I couldn't even hear my friend who was sitting two seats beside me. But it's a very friendly atmosphere!
