DELICIOUS!! A must try for New York pizza! One of the best I've had in the city (so far)! You can tell the place is family-owned and operated - with the head of the family there to greet you at the door. The place itself is pretty big with two floors of seating, but it gets packed pretty fast! If you get there right when they open at noon, there's no line. The place is cash only and they don't serve by the slice (pies only). Decent price for what you get! Bottom line: If you just walked across the Brooklyn Bridge or are wandering around DUMBO looking for something to eat, give it a try!
