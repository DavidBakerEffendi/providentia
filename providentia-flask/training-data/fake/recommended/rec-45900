This venerable Italian restaurant deep in the industrial heart if Newark is now closed and converted into a Latin lounge. It marks the end of an era for the old guard Italians "down neck". Â  Everything ends, how long can these old style joints hold on ANYWHERE. At least Newark is getting new Italian restaurants like Monk Room with better ingredients to replace it. Still a major loss... emotionally speaking.
