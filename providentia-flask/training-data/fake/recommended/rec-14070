I love empanadas and this place gets it right.  Lots of choices of yummy fillings inside a flaky-crunchy shell.  You can even try to be healthier by choosing the whole wheat shell, but you can tell it's the healthier version when you eat it.  Also I think the whole wheat one is smaller so just go for the classic corn empanadas.
