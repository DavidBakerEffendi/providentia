Brahaus wins on the beer side, which is kind of a big deal if this places wants to be taken seriously as a beer hall. Stoudts APA and Yards IPA should not be on this list, I understand that they are locally beers and all, but neither of these beers are lagers, so therefore under the German beer law Reinheitsgebot, they are not pure and should not occupy a GERMAN BEER hall. However, the ambiance of this place is fantastic, perfectly set in a 1 story renovated warehouse with outdoor fire pits. I went yesterday when it was snowing, it was the weirdest sensation I have ever felt. As the snow feel on my face and wind blow through my clothes I had the sudden sensation of coldness and shivers run through my body, but then, like a switch, the warm tender flames from the fires leapt playfully ever so close to my trousers enveloping me in a warm cocoon. Fire and ice, this must be what the ky jelly of the same name feels like. On the food note, pretzels were a-okay, the horseradish mustard was great however and the sausages did not leave me wanting, they do have to fix the red cabbage however, as it was rather bland.
