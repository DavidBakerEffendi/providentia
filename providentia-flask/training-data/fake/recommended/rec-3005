Not the best of neighborhoods but worth taking a cab over to check it out. What to expect - - Picnic-style tables. Good for groups and meeting new people. - Liters of German beer.. order from the bar because there's no waiter service - German food including giant pretzels, bratwurst, and jagerschnitzel - Games.. our table had Jenga on it but I also saw people playing cards We also tried the spicy bauernwurst (sausage served on a roll) and roasted half-chicken with spatzle. I didn't think the bauernwurst was spicy at all but still good. The chicken and spatzle was a lot of food but it was delicious. It was 100 degrees the day we went so I want to go back and check out the outdoor area.
