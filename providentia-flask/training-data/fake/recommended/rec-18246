Now this is what I am talking about. Way more casual than Ginger Man, but more my type of beer.  Great selection of American craft beer.  The staff was very helpful and gave tastings without asking. The staff all seemed to be attractive young ladies-Hey Now!   They had Green Flash West Coast IPA on tap. So hoppy!  I love those west coast hops.  I was bummed to see 3 day prior to my visit  it was Bear Republic night.  I shall be back!
