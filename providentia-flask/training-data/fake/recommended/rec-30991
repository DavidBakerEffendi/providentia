This cozy place is a great place to grab breakfast. Moderately priced for fresh made, high quality food. We ordered the Moroccan scramble and the ricotta pancakes. Both were delicious. It can get crowded as the place is small, but the food and atmosphere is cute and fitting for the neighborhood. Would definitely come back again.
