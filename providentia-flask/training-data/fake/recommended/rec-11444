This place is fantastic. I have been going to Melograno since before the move and it has never let me down (except for the whole move thing...)  And while the fact that it was BYO brought me to the door, the food keeps me coming back over and over again. I frequently get the Penne (spicy red sauce with pancetta) which has never failed me.  The other big winners have always been the papperdelle with truffle infused mushroom sauce and the beet ravioli (which a friend describes as "unique to the world").   And sure. Its hard to get in because they don't take reservations and you have to wait.  But the food is worth it, which is more than I can say for a LOT of restaurants I have waited longer to get a table at!  So get here early and bring a second bottle of wine (to drink on the street while your waiting for table). And eat the best byo italian in the city.
