Last week while visiting New York on vacation I decided to try a place a good friend recommended.  Throughout the years, I have tried many places trying to find the best breakfast in NYC. The search is finally over! I walked into this place and the first things I noticed was that the staff was very attentive and eager to serve.  The place was super clean, the seating arrangement was just enough, and it felt pretty cozy too. Let's talk food.  The menu had a wide selection of choices for both breakfast & lunch. I was in a breakfast mood and I brought my appetite ready to party.  I ordered the fluffy blueberry pancakes and they were so yummy that I felt as if they just melted in my mouth with each bite.  And that was without the syrup. As I said before I was hungry so I also ordered the buttermilk biscuit, bacon, & egg sandwich. What made this sandwich complete was the marinara sauce. By the way, it also included breakfast potatoes which had the perfect crunchy topping. I (we) did not stop there.  My significant other ordered a fried chicken sandwich. Now I am not a mayo fan, but what made this was the lemon-pepper mayo and the pickled green tomatoes. This best part is that we walked out not feeling super full, but very satisfied.  So when visiting NYC, make it a point to stop by this place in the lower east side part of Manhattan. I know from now on that this will be a routine stop for me every time I am in NYC. By the way, the also serve a variety of some tasty beers.
