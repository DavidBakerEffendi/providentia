The restaurant itself is very cute and the food was amazing.  We came for drinks and dessert and our ice cream cup and crepe were delicious.  The chocolate and caramel are homemade and definitely worth trying.  The service was exceptional and the staff was very informative and nice.  This is definitely a place to try!
