Love the food here! In summer it is quite a rush here. Long queues but food is worth the wait.The pondicherry dosa and the idli lunch box are my favorites! The stock for idli lunch box finishes very rapidly as he carrieslimited number of idli lunch boxes. The location is Â very refreshing.The man making the dosas, Thiru is a super multi tasker and very considerate. He keeps his twitter account of nyc dosas updated if he is not planing to come to the park someday.Check it before you go to this place.Although its a cart, you can call him and place your order for certain meals.I would give four stars just for the long queues/ waiting time.
