Brunch here -- though a complete shitshow -- is SILLY good. Just wow. With a free Saturday morning and hangover to cure, my bf and I headed here upon the review of fellow yelpers. The hostess signed our name on the clipboard for a 45 minute wait. We waited for 80 minutes. So worth it. The manager, genuinely distressed, ameliorated our frustrations with a delicious apple doughnut ball, compliments of the kitchen. We tried and LOVED the pork chops/waffles and eggs huntington. The eggs huntington is basically their signature eggs benedict -- the biscuits are light and fluffy and obviously homemade. The hollandaise tastes buttery with subtle notes of lemon. A poached egg and ham harmoniously complete each bite. The pork chop is HUGE and breaded to perfection; maple syrup and a cheese waffle accompany it. The portions are mammoth but finger licking good and can thus be tackled, irregardless of hangovers. Though Manhattanites like myself come to Buttermilk Channel, its crowd and space emanate "classic" Brookyln.
