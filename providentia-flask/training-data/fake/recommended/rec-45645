Found this place while in Windsor on business, and was glad I did.   When I travel alone, my MO is to order many things and then take my leftovers back to the hotel for later noshing.  So... I first ordered Tom Kha Gai; I can't go to a Thai place and not.  It was not a very sweet or thick soup (not necessarily a bad thing); more on the salty side.  Slightly lacking in galangal flavor, but it was still tasty.  Good quality chicken in there, along with red peppers and mushrooms.  I couldn't find any chunks of galangal or lemongrass in there, and the broth wasn't too heavy on those flavors.  (Many places pick those out of the broth for you; I'm a freak who likes to nosh on them.)   Next, I ordered the Som Tom, which had terriic flavor, but more lettuce than green papaya.  Also came with lots of beautiful shrimp on top.  I would get this again. The Thai Iced Tea was kinda meh; I've had better.   (But mediocre Thai Iced Tea is still better than most things in the universe...) For my entree, I ordered a chicken and peanut sauce, which was a refreshingly human-portion and priced accordingly.  It was satisfying, but not life-changing.   I didn't order dessert, but with the check they offered a small plate of fresh pineapple and melon; very delightful. All this food was about $25.   Best of all: They didn't make me feel like a doofus for eating alone.
