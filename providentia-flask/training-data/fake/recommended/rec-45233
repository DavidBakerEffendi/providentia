Authentic Greek food, TO DIE for crepes especially the Neo Nutter Butter. Â Coffee and tea selection is top quality, lounge feel where u can take a table w laptop and do work or grab a sofa and personal LCD TV - feel right at home and they even have live music on some nights...place makes Starbucks look like Micky Ds.
