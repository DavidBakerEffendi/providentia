As a student once more, it is of utmost importance to find a local dig that serves up good food for cheap. Vermont Pub & Brewery fits that category despite its long wait for both table and food. For the beer connoisseurs, they have a large selection of award-winning house beers to choose from. The beer can be accompanied with classic English pub grub such as shepherd's pie, banger's 'n mash, and fish 'n chips or a selection of delicious hot sandwiches. While the burgers and hot sandwiches are not too big in size, they are bold in flavor and a pretty good bang for your buck. All of the sandwiches are $5.99 or less. I tried to the chicken Victoria, which sandwiches the char-grilled chicken with smoked cheddar and apple chutney. The breast was tender and the chutney was the perfect tangy sauce to bring it all together. We also ordered up a side of gravy and cheese fries to share. I think this was my first time having that combination on fries and it was fantastic. How could I ever eat fries again without gravy or cheese? I love that they have a big menu to satisfy all your pub cravings. The only thing that was remiss was the excessively long wait times. I'm guessing they were short-handed on the day we went since there were plenty of empty tables inside.
