What's the line from the shark group in Finding Nemo? Oh yes, "Fish are our friends, not food". Well that's b.s. fish and aquatic life is damn good. And this is coming from someone who has a natural aversion to slimy sea creatures. This summer has now been minted the summer of fish and it all started with my obsession at RHLB. Had the CT style and a little tear formed in my eyeduct, had I been richer I would have offered to buy the joint. But alas my selfish need to eat lobster all the time is kept at bay, you too can enjoy the wonderful and juicy lobster rolls that BK offers.
