I'm all about the beer!!!! Love Naughty Nurse and love trying different beers. Been there a couple of times and lucky for me I have gotten the best service, even got the manager to convince the chef to make me a fruit salad which was not on the menu. Appetizers were good but the buffalo chicken nachos have a place in my heart, it was amazing. They def did not skimp on the meat and they were full of flavor.
