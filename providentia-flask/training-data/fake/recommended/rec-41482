Stopped by on a whim and there was a table waiting for us! Our server greeted us promptly and offered drinks. We opted for some wine and appetizers. Loved the dumplings! Had some great ba-mee. I enjoyed my entr√©e moreso than my colleague, but the ambiance was nice and cozy! Service was spot on. We will definitely return!
