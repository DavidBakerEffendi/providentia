Passed this place on the way to kid's soccer a hundred times and decided to stop in. Huge interior, great service, decent food. I had meatloaf and it was a trifle too hard and a little overpowering with gorganzola cooked right in. Not bad, though. The rest of the menu is varied, if not on the slightly over-priced side. Nice patio for warm weather, noisy and family-oriented inside. Would definitely come here to watch a game.
