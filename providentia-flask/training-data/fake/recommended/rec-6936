We were visiting a friend in Upper Montclair and he took us here. What this little place lacks in curb appeal it fully makes up for in flavor! We ordered an assortment of the menu and were not disappointed in any of our choices. Â We were all very impressed with the quality of the food and the attentiveness of the chef. Mahalo Mancinni's!
