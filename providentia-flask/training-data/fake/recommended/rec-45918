I've been wanting to go here for the past 2 months and finally made it. I bought 2 donuts (coconut and gingerbread) as well as a butternut squash ravioli package. I really like that they have gluten free pasta options as well as baked goods. The donuts were AMAZING, very moist and the frosting was perfect. The pasta was good too (I've gotten used to gluten free pasta, so I might be biased). I've heard mixed reviews on the cakes, but I can only speak for what I've tried.
