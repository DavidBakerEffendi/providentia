This is Chinese buffet at its most average.  Average to terrible food served in large quantities with sodas served in pitchers.  It's perfect for people who like to sit down and get fat.  It's imperfect for people who would rather just eat less and well. Memorable items: - Peking duck - not bad actually although some of my family reported it too greasy for their taste - Sushi bar - I did not taste this and it looked pretty terrible.   - Mongolian BBQ - My friend said that the cook's face just made her not want to eat.  He looked like a slave.  (Maybe he was!)   - Fried frog legs - Interesting except that it tasted like...chicken.   I went with about 15 people so it really wasn't a terrible idea.  However, never again would I ever go to this kind of a place for dinner.  I am someone who values all 365 times a year I get to eat dinner and I refuse to waste even one more on places like this.
