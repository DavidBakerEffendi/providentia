Came here for dinner during the past weekend. The service was very good. I must say the food was not as great as I thought it would be. The glazed pork ribs was not good. I feel that it is an acquired taste.. But the lasagna was very good. I've been to a lot of Italian restaurants and I must say this place was okay. It's a small and cozy place and it's good for date night.
