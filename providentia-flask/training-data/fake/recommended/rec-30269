We had a late weekday brunch reservation this past summer (in August).  The restaurant was nearly empty, service was good, and so was the food.  I chose the Cookshop Breakfast, which is a lot of food, my wife ordered the whitefish salad.  My food was definitely better, but both dishes were fine.  This is a place where most people will find something that interests them, and the food will be good.
