Definitely one of my favorite places. I live walking distance and frequently visit this place. Anytime I have family over this is the place we go! I went for my grandma's birthday we had a party of 10 and the staff was very attentive. We ordered several kinds of thin crusted pies, mussels and a few pitchers of sangria. They stored the cake for us in the fridge and helped cut and serve the pieces! I also like to come here to hang in the bar area with friends. When the weather is nice I take advantage of the gorgeous outside patio. It makes me feel like I'm not in bayonne when I sit back there. Also the chopped antipasto salad is the best i have ever had, I actually have cravings for it!! Â Yum Yum Yum
