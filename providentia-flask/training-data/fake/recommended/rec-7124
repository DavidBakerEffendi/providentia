I've walked by this alley hundreds of times but never bothered to try the place until yesterday. I never knew what I was missing out on. First off, the decor is beautiful on the inside. Probably the best I've seen. Very dim lighting, lots of wood and candles. Very rustic, perfect ambiance (especially in the winter)! Also, there were two bars so there was ample room (at least around 7PM). It's deceptively small and has multiple floors to accomodate walk-ins. Staff and bartenders were very friendly; I left my umbrella there and they were helping me find it. Most importantly, the food was top notch. Shared the Artichoke Dip and bread as a starter and it was hot and pasty. I'm not the biggest meat eater so I ordered the Pan-Fried Gnocchi as my entree (they lacked vegetarian entrees, but that's completely understandable - they offered lots of side dishes and starters could be a meal). The Gnocchi was very tender and melty (without overdoing it on the sheeps' milk cheese) and just melted as you take a bite. I personally hate cheese without tomatoes but loved the dish so that shows how exceptional it was. The brussel sprouts were also on point. Overall, everything was amazing from the decor, to the food, to the drinks (friend ordered a hot drink with gin and I gave it a try; perfect for a blizzard and better than any hot toddy I've ever had). I don't really enjoy American food (and usually find it bland) but I must say this is the exception.
