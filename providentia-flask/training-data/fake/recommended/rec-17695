Came here for dinner and sat in the garden area. Super cute and atmospheric. The inside was dark with lots of candles, perfect for a date evening or just a nice evening with close friends. I had the veggie burger which was delicious and my husband had the salmon which he raved about. It came with beets and some other side vegetables which were delicious. Our waiter was attentive and sweet. They had a nice little bar inside as well that would be nice for a drink one evening. All in all it was a great little place and I would def. go back.
