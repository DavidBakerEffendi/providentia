I would be giving this 1 star if not the fact that they do have some of the best korean food in the area. That being said, everything else about this place sucks. The service is disgusting. They make you wait and wait and wait. The food takes forever to cook even when there's only 1 or 2 people in the restaurant. Once, I ordered a pancake, and I had already finished my main course before the pancake arrived. I told the waitress that I don't want it anymore, and they gave me a cheque with the pancake on it... I've only been here twice and twice the service was simply disgusting. If you just want good food, feel free to come here, but don't expect any good service.
