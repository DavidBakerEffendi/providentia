Awesome restaurant for those on a gluten free diet. They have gluten free bread for the table which is extremely rare. They have gluten free appetizers, entrees, pastas (stuffed pastas too), and desserts. The gluten free pizette was amazing! The gluten free tortellini was great too, and the sauce was so delicious. They have several sauces to chose from. It's nice to be able to have a full gluten free meal out. It's such a treat to find stuffed gluten free pastas. I didn't have dessert but I will definitely try one next time I go. I look forward to dining there again in the near future!
