Absolute worst meal ever!  After taking or drink orders our ultra too cool for us waitress disappeared for about 30 minutes.....when our drinks arrived we were so relieved and ready to order we hoped things would get better.  We started w the melon baller soup and the steak tartare.......the soup was thick as baby food and had the distinguished flavor of asafetida...the mound of white chocolate and peanuts in the middle just didn't mesh..all four of us gave fingers down to this mind boggling stew.....the Tartare!! one of my favorites (when done right) and Ive had it many times over in many different styles . Here the portion was large...but the grind was so chunky and stringy it stuck in our teeth and the texture was more chewing gum than the smoothness I'm used to.....not to mention it came w the tiniest single crustini Ive ever seen.  the whole fried snapper was skinny, so over cooked the meat was literally gone..the onion relish was the best part of our entire meal....we also had the Asian bbq....which its rare to see pork so rare ( and I'm no scaredy cat) most people may balk...it was the simplest plate we had and it was just ok...although we ate it all since we were so hungry.  long story short..i wont be going here again. the over-thought trying-to-hard presentation and style was unsettling and unappetizing
