As soon as I walked into Heavy Woods I was at easy, comfortable being there, the atmosphere was beyond inviting. The service was flawless with nothing but attentive and personable service. I left feeling that I want to go back. I will. Often. With an enticing menu and quality beer list, I have no doubt I'll be a regular at this place. I suggest you all stop by, often. Don't take my word, take the vibe. Stop by.
