I had to see what all the hype was about... and I'm glad I did.  Umami ranks high in my book. I first tried Umami at the Great Googa Mooga festival back in May and fell in love.  After it opened recently, I decided to brave the summer heat and long lines to try.  After reading fellow Yelpers' reviews, I realized that the best time to go was around 3pm.  Good Call! I was told it would be an hour wait, but to check back in 30 mins, and we only ended up waiting about 35-40 mins.  Not bad.   Umami Truffle Burger and Truffle Fries.   Absolutely delicious.  The burger was a little greasier than expected but the flavors were so on point that the greasiness is easily overlooked.  The fries were also good, mine had a little too much cheese on them and got cold quickly.  Made for a messy experience. We ordered peach margaritas.  Apparently the bar was backed up so our waitress gave us the drinks on the house. I was not a fan of the fried pickles and I LOVE pickles.  Way too greasy and tart. Oh well. For dessert, I had the ginger cookie ice cream sandwich.  Very sweet and the perfect ending to a meal. I'm a huge fan of Umami and will return in a few months after the excitement and long lines have died down.
