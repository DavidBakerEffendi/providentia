On Saturday I finally got to try this place out. Thank god though I had read the other reviews because if I hadn't we would probably not have found the entrance, which is this mysterious door without any indication it's leading to the restaurant. You definitely need a reservation because the place was packed when we got there at 9pm. We were greeted by a super friendly host and got seated immediately. The interior is fantastic; it's cozy and intimate yet has an openness to it, and the style is a mix of modern and rustic. Within a minute after we were seated, we had the menus and water on our table. I had the Grilled Scallops (they were a special for the day) as my appetizer and they were DIVINE, just perfectly cooked and seasoned. For my entree I had the Black Sea bass and a side of the Brussels Sprouts, which both were phenomenal as well + great prices!!! This place is perfect for going out with your friends, dates, or taking people out for work. It's a bummer I live on opposite side of the city, otherwise I'd be coming here all the time!
