When you see 9 Asian ladies working shoulder to shoulder in a kitchen the size of a cardboard box, you know there is something wonderful going on. I decided to stop by for breakfast. They serve dumplings, potstickers, noodle soups for cheap. We had some wonton noodle soup, 8 potstickers and extra wontons. Total cost for one of the best meals I had in NYC, $9 for 2 people. This place is an incredible value. There are a few small plastic chairs lined up against the wall to use if you decide to have your meal there. However, if I were to do it again, I would probably opt for takeout to eat in a more civil environment.
