The best thing going for this place is the beer selection, and the atmosphere is nice. But when you look at the menu, it sounds good, but almost comes off like it's poking fun of the Brooklyn culinary scene rather than catering to it. The menu looks like someone took every possible trendy ingredient in this neighborhood and tried to combine it into every dish.  Burgers with pork belly and a FRIED quail egg on top?  Poutine topped with duck?  A lot of the ingredients seem like overkill and an after thought. I got the Baja salad which was pretty underwhelming for $11 - lettuce, tomato, corn and black beans - no cheese or meat, or an option to add any, and the tortilla "strips" were 5 or 6 tortilla chips thrown on top.  It was appetizer size.  They were also out of several other dishes on a Saturday night. We also tried the chicken with noodles - the chicken resembled, and tasted, like terriyaki beef, which was kind of odd, and while the noodles were excellent, they were swimming in a pool of cream and oil.  Also, it took a good half hour plus for our food to come out. It just seemed like the menu was unnecessarily unhealthy - half the items had something fried, and given that they're a craft beer bar, the dishes are way too heavy to pair with beer, unless you have an iron stomach.  I think the food was decent, and the beer selection was good, but if I eat here more than once a month, I'm going to have coronary artery disease by the time I'm 40.
