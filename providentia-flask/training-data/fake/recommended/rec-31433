I am a very picky eater and have NEVER been disappointed by this restaurant. I am a regular here and can't get enough of the curry dishes. I have tried many other things on the menu and they are wonderful as well. Everything is always fresh, the portion sizes are just right (at least i think so...i hate getting a gigantic mound of food when I go out to eat, it makes me feel like things are prepared way in advance then just thrown on a plate). It is a nice cozy restaurant. Great for date night or a group of friends. Nice decor, nice ambiance and much better than any other thai restaurant in the area. The wait staff if very nice and welcoming. If I want thai i never even bother going to downtown New Haven anymore, this place is much better.
