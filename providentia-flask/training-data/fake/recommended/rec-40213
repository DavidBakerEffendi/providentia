Great place!  We went here after attending  the phillies baseball game (they won!). The CrabFries are perfectly seasoned and crispy and come with 2 cups of the awesome white cheese. The lobster sandwich was very good- a good amount of lobster and delicious bread.  Hamburgers were good too and medium rare was perfect.  Tons of screens to watch the games and a Deejay. We will definitely return.
