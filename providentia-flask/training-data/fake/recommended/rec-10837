I've walked past this place far too many times, and finally stopped by for after dinner cocktails. The decor is really cozy, and I'm pretty sure my mouth watered when I smelled truffle oil french fries (and to think, I JUST finished dinner). We sat by the bar and I had a jalapeno magarita on the rocks, and it was phenomenal. I followed that with a vodka soda, also lovely. Must come back for food!!
