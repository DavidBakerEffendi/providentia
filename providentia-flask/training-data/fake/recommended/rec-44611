Yeah, it's a little overrated, but they do make a damn good hamburger. It's always crowded, it's fairly dirty, and the servers can be downright rude. But one ought not expect white-glove service when their grub is a humble-but-tasty hamburger, right? Oh, and a few words of caution: If your religion forbids you to eat pork, do NOT order their French fries. My buddy loved their fries and then one day I saw them frying the bacon in same deep-fryer. I told him and he didn't believe me, so I said, "See how the bacon on my hamburger is all curled up? They deep-fry it." So he peered over into their galley, which is in plain sight of the bar, and sure enough, he saw the cook tossing bacon strips into the fryer as if the guy was practicing free-throws. My buddy's expression was priceless. If only he knew (well, he knows but refuses to acknowledge) what else was in his food when he eats out. Ach. Just get a hamburger here. With bacon if it doesn't offend you.
