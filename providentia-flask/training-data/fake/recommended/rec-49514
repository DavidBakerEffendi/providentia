A great find on a cold spring evening! Though the place was packed, we were led to the wine cellar in the basement and treated to a wondrous thin crust pizza. Flavor is earthy from the coal fire, and the menu is not overwhelming nor bare-boned. Staff was polite and helpful, not to mention cleanly dressed for handling things like red sauce. The smell is inviting, and despite the nook location, the atmosphere is cozy and steeped in history.
