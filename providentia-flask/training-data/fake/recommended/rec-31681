Excellent!!! I have been a loyal customer for over 30 years. The food is fresh and delicious on a daily basis. Â Mozzarella is closest I've had since being in Italy and if you get there early, you can see it being made fresh daily. Michael's is my go to when I do not feel like cooking or have a special catering order. Michael' s is iconic in Lyndhurst, NJ..-- Nicole B.
