Pretty decent place. Nice decor, good drinks, decent food, good atmosphere. When friends from out of town come visit I've taken them here and they've enjoyed it. The hostess is a bit ridiculous about reservations though. As a previous reviewer said, the place can be empty but they'll give you a hard time about not having a reservation.
