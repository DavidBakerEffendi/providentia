Cash only.  Is it like that all the time. Oh well. It's highly rated. Who doesn't love a good diner?  This is a good diner.  Two things turned me off and 1 turned me on. The cooks were great.  My food was good and we sat at the bar and could see how systematized they were. They have a short but divers menu.  Not just run of the mill diner items and it really was quite tasty. My issues.  There was a lady on the patio waiting area that told a story and it was like she had to make the story sound more urban just because we were black and I can't stand it when people do that. Also, inside one of the waiters, who had a boogie in his nose, would plate food without gloves and I saw him occasionally brush his finger across his nostrils.  That's nasty.
