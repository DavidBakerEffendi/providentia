Sorry but when you say half a chicken on your menu I expect half a chicken!  Not a thigh leg and wing!  And not served on a side plate for over $20 for dinner.  Very very disappointed, will not eat here again, $100 for 1 starter 2 glasses of wine and 2 entres is just over priced even if I'd actually got the half chicken and it had been served on a dinner plate!
