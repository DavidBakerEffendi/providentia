This is the cutest coffee spot ever! The atmosphere is so cozy and relaxing. I love the couches and all of the art work on the wall. They have a million coffee and tea drinks and some good breakfast and lunch options. They also offer a large variety of gluten free options. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area.
