Let me preface this by saying, I am a fried chicken connoisseur. Fried chicken is my life, and I'm constantly on the search for better fried chicken. I definitely found it in BedStuy this weekend. You have to be looking for this place to find it, as there is no flashy sign on the building. This tiny little corner restaurant has very little seating and an informal vibe. You write your own name on a white board, and wait for a table to get up. I came with a group of 5 and we were lucky enough to snag 5 seats at the bar. The bartender was friendly and funny, and had plenty of recommendations. He obviously knew the menu. When the waitress walked out holding a plate of blackened catfish, I was actually tempted to change up my order... but I just couldn't do it. Hot Chicken Platter with a side of mashed potatoes. The potatoes didn't come with gravy, but I asked, and I received. I feel a hug part of fried chicken comes from the seasoning and this was seasoned just right. It was actually spicier than I expected, but the bartender warned me it would be. It wasn't too hot to eat, and I found that if I actually calmed down, and let my food cool off a little before I dug in, I would have been just fine. The chicken was juicy and crispy, cooked perfectly, with amazing seasoning. The cornbread was just as delicious. I asked for an unsweetened iced tea, which they didn't have, but luckily their sweet tea was not as sweet as you'll find it down south, and I was just fine. Overall this place was a real gem, and now that I know how to find it, I imagine I'll be taking short little subway trips to eat there often. *side note, my friend did order the blackened catfish, and said it was delicious, and cooked perfectly. Easily my new favorite spot.
