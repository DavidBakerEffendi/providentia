We went on a Saturday night (had reservations) and got seated at a nice table outside with good views of interesting people walking by. The restaurant has a laid back, rustic vibe and menus printed on cardboard and paper on wooden planks. Excellent grilled calamari. The pasta is good. Service is warm and friendly. Note: cash only
