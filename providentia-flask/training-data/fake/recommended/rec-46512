I've been here for dinner and for brunch.  Despite the fact that they were quite busy (as we all know by now), things moved efficiently and the service was quite pleasant.   Orders were taken, drinks arrived, drinks were proclaimed delicious, food arrived, and happy tummies ensued.  Seriously, their food is incredible.  If I could have those cheddar curds every day I'd be in heaven.
