on the corner of waverly and grove - did you know there were 2 waverly's?! confusing. anyhoo - dropped into this restaurant for brunch on a sunday round 12:30. cozy cute inside, definitely expect to wait. I ended up getting seated for 3 at the bar round 1-1:15, didn't get food for another half hour. I WAS STARVING. whenever I'm starving I need to take a step back and not thing all food is good. I had an egg, swiss croissant sandwich with added bacon. I don't think it's that hard to make a croissant sandwich, so I'd say good, but nothing special. the side of shredded brussel sprouts; however, were banging! but then again, drizzle sriracha on anything and it'll be banging. solid food. nothing mind blowing. must say my favorite part was the switch up on music it was memorable because all of a sudden it got super hood, and the clientele in mainly white. love it. also, the bathroom has products! tampons, cotton balls, swabs, even altoids!
