Nothing better than Sunday brunch! Fantastic food selection, reasonably priced, awesome mimosas.. need I say more? Well if you insist, their cappuccinos are fantastic and their service is exceptional. Cafe Henri provides a relaxed atmosphere to chat with friends over coffee and a well balanced meal. Their ingredients are very fresh and organic. If you are a health nut, or are watching what you are eating, no worries, you can make safe eating decisions with out feeling guilty - although so yummy you almost think twice :) Â Please visit and enjoy!
