Went there for dinner and started off the night having a drink at the bar before we went in. I had the New Amsterdam which was a bourbon infused with a pair, fig and some spices. It was pretty interesting. Never had a bourbon drink like that before. I would recommend it.  I was seated right next to the fireplace which was a huge plus.  Decided to try a lot of Tapas to really get a good sample of their food instead of getting an entree and the food was just fantastic. Overall the ambiance was fantastic, the service was excellent and their food was outstanding. I remember the short ribs standing out as being really good. Would highly recommend this spot.
