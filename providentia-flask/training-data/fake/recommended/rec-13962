This will definitely not be on my list. I probably won't be back. While I must give its props for a fun, trendy atmosphere and awesomely, unnecessarily decadent decor, I found the over all experience lacking, especially considering the price. I brought my family that was visiting from out of town here to show them a fun nyc restaurant. They were excited about the decorations etc. But, despite the fact that I had already lowered my expectations for the food, and the fact that my family are definitely not thai food connoisseurs, we were all disappointed in the food. Do not get any duck dishes. We had two at out table, and yuck. It had a very squishy texture which was not pleasant. The tamarind, more spice than taste. The shrimp pad thai - maybe four shrimp in there and it was overly greasy with overcooked noodles. The best dish was the pork chops - we alll cleaned the plate since my sisters dish was the only one we liked. pretty yummy. If I ever come back, i'll get that. The bill was about $70 for four people. Not really a value for thai food, but then again we got duck dishes and two drinks. It is what it is. I've experienced better.
