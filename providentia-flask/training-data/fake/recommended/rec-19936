My husband and I had a visitor staying with us from New Zealand and his cousin wanted to meet for brunch. They wanted somewhere trendy. I left the selection to his cousin and she suggested Buttermilk Channel.  I had been to Buttermilk Channel for dinner before and thought it was ok. I had the fried chicken and waffles. We sat at the bar and my friend and his cousin and friend sat at a table because they only have a few tables which will accommodate 5.  I ordered the hash and my husband ordered the eggs benedict. The eggs were so small that they must have come from pigeons. Portions were tiny and plates filled out with greens. The hash looked good but when I took a bite of what I assumed was potato, it was a huge hunk of fat. I couldn't believe they would serve such a mess. I complained to the waitress and she also was in disbelief, but hers because she couldn't believe I didn't like it. After consulting the manger, she offered to bring me something else. When we finished our $50.00 brunch w/out alcohol, we caught up with our friends. The cousin had also ordered the hash and all of the fat was piled up on her plate. Ick! never again.
