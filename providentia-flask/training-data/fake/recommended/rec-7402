really great local spot.  the female bartender is a NOT friendly, but the wait staff is absolutely amazing and completely makes up for it.  the bread in clay pots is out of this world, as is the lamb papperdale, and gnocchi.  i realize the menu changes seasonally so those items are likely not available, however considering how delicious they were, i wld guess anything from that kitchen would be amazing.
