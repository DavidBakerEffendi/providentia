I love Mexican food.  Nothing fancy needed...  as long as the salsa is fresh, the chips are crunchy and the beans are creamy, I'm a happy girl.  I don't base my opinions on fancypants garnishes or how nice the meal looks upon arrival at my table.  I want simple, good food...  and I want it to involve cheese.   With this said, I have to say that I wasn't impressed with the meal I had at Jose Pistola's, but I was a tiny bit obsessed with the salsa.  They have an amazing salsa verde (that even my self-admittedly-salsa-hating-friend loved) and the pico de gallo was fresh and yummy.  The chips were fresh and salty, which is always a plus in my sodium-loving world.   I ordered a chicken burrito and found it to be just...  well...  eh.  I also recall biting into the aforementioned chicken and having to deal with a bone in my mouth.  That's never a graceful move.  First, you're scared to death as to why something is SO hard in your mouth.  Then, you realize it shouldn't be in your mouth and you awkwardly try to spit it out without looking like a child spitting out something they don't like.  Eww.   Either way, I'd go back for snacks and drinks.  Probably wouldn't have dinner there again, unless someone highly recommended something.
