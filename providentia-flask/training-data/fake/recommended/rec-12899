Totally loved this place! The place is nice in terms of decor and ambience, but even better, the food and service were both great at an affordable price! My boyfriend and I went on a Sunday night around 7:30 p.m., and to our surprise, the place was pretty packed. We had to wait around 15 minutes, but we got seated as soon as the table was ready. I ordered their calamari and shrimp risotto. I made the mistake of eating a bit too much bread before our entrees came (sue me, I was starving), and when my risotto came out, I was surprised to see how big the portion was. Not only was it a great portion size, but the food was nice and hot AND they were NOT stingy with the calamari and shrimp; I got at least 8 pieces of shrimp and 10 pieces of calamari in there. DELICIOUS!!! I love risotto, and I only managed to eat about 1/3 of the dish. I had the rest of it packed up and had it for lunch the next day, and it was still delicious even after being nuked in the microwave. My boyfriend got the lobster ravioli, which he saw got rave reviews from other Yelpers. Our server also said she liked that dish, and he was not disappointed. I had a bite too, and it was AWESOME. The creamy sauce they use is a bit rich, so I don't know if I'd order this dish all for myself. I'd recommend maybe splitting this dish and another one with someone else to balance it out. Still, totally delicious, and I think my boyfriend would order it again. He cleaned that dish up. Since Sanford's is just down the street from us, we'll be back! Thanks for a lovely dinner!
