We checked this out for lunch and for the price, it exceeded our expectations. There was fish and cheap sushi. For similar rolls at Sushi Village for lunch for almost half the price, it's pretty good. The rest of the food was what you'd expect from a chinese buffet. They also had a hibachi station that cooks up whatever you put on a plate. Overall, pretty good for the price.
