I went here when in NYC and I thought this place was awesome! Thanks PC W., you're the best! I went in and got the Oxtail Noodle Soup and a dozen Pan Fried Dumplings for a measley 8 or 9 bucks, they were so great. Half the thrill of it was watching the guy make my noodles, it was about then that my mouth began to water. I'd gotten it to go, so they packed it up for me and I hopped on the train back to the Hilton and when I got to my room everything was piping hot and delicious. I will definitely return here when I'm back in NYC. For lunch or dinner on a budget this is like THE perfect place.
