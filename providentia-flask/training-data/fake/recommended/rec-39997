BEST. CULINARY. EXPERIENCE. EVER. I dined here with a group of 9. From start to finish, we experienced multiple emotions: amazed, giddy, supremely happy. The oohs and ahhs were bountiful as this was our best culinary experience to date. We were served 5 amuse bouches before our 5 course meal. We finished 5 bottles of champagne and along the way. And I will never forget the bread service and the best butter in the world! For a visual and flavorful culinary experience with Â impeccable service in a beautiful setting, visit Bouley. You won't be sorry. but your expectations will be higher in life from now on!
