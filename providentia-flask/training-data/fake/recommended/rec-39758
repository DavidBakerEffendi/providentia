Brunch only: Truffled eggs benedict, fabulous.  Beignets with Lebanese clotted cream, soaked with orange blossom syrup; fabulous.  Hummus side order, pretty darn good.  Honestly, this brunch was a combination of some of my favorite things, and I couldn't have been happier with the food. But! $4 6oz. coffee with no free refills... super lame.  The brunch pre-fixe is a pretty good deal, but again- $4 refill? Really.  Especially after a fly landed in my first cup and I had to have it replaced (the coffee, not the fly).  As much as I liked the food, I really would have liked better, more attentive service.  Oh, also, my server didn't know the menu very well and I had to question her explanation of the dish I wanted... which was slightly embarrassing for both of us!  Maybe she didn't usually work the brunch shift? Regardless, I intend to return because the food was so good.  Next time though, I'll skip the coffee.
