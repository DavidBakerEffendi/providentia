We come here at least once a month and we have nothing but a great experience. From the food, drinks, atmosphere, staff and just the overall feel of being welcomed. My husband and I are always up to trying new things. We've tried the pork & beans, steamed brown rice, grillef corn (which is beyond amazing) and the guac...all delish and amazing!  We usually just get the tacos but we had the pleasure of trying the rotisserie chicken since we got a free one and hands down delicious!!! We've tried almost ever taco except a few but our favorites are the curry shrimp, baja fish, and the ribye. We've had the chicken and chorizo which are great.  The only one we weren't fans of was the pork belly. Melanie the bartender is very sweet and explained how to order and such. Prices are inexpensive and readonable! Definitely a place to stop if ur in the area. We love going and will continue to do so!!
