I have to say, the food was amazing. Great calamari, and we also had the mussels in garlic white wine sauce. Entrees were the arugula salad with steak, and the steak and fries. Excellent flavors and well done. The complaint is with the service. Our server was rude, barely spoke to us, and it almost felt like we were inconveniencing him by even dining there. When he took our dinner order, he didn't even speak. He just stood over us and seemed annoyed to have to take our order. The food came promptly, and was delicious. The cocktails were good. Everything was fine. When we got the bill, however, we noticed that the 20% we saved from Groupon was added back on as gratuity. Normally, I would be taken aback, thinking I'm more that responsible enough to provide my own gratuity, but now with the BAD service we received I was even more peeved that they included a whopping 20% on our bill! I don't think our server deserved 20% because of his poor attitude , and it seemed like we were being punished for using the Groupon reserve feature. Won't be back to this restaurant because of this. Feel insulted.
