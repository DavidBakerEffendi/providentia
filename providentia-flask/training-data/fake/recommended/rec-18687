Came here with my friends to watch the World Cup.  Food and ambiance were ideal.  the chef is really sweet and accommodating,  it was a pleasure interacting with him regarding my food order .  I felt that my dish was prepared with love and it certainly tasted amazing.  (I talked directly with the chef because I places a special request, but the server was great as well.)
