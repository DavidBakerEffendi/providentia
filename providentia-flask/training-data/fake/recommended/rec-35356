While sightseeing around Times Square (yes, I was THAT type of tourist that evening), I checked Yelp trying to find a really good pizza place nearby.  I mean, hello. New York City, pizza, duh. This place popped up, so we walked over to grab a slice.   This is truly a small hole in the wall spot, where you can fit in maybe 5 people sitting at a tiny counter along the back wall. Did I care? No. Because there was a large rack of pizzas on the counter and the visual and olfactory senses were going on high alert. They serve true NY style pizza - large, thin crust where your order is heated up in the oven until the crust just SNAPS when you bite into it.  They had a wide variety of styles, and  the best garlic knots in town (according to the owner that was there). The flavor was really good, and the prices are reasonable.  I wouldn't call it the best pizza ever in the city, just because there are way too many pizza places offering up some delicious pie. However, its a perfect example of how you don't need to go to the "big name" places and wait hours to get good pizza.
