I came here for brunch and had the soft eggs with a mimosa. The food was pretty underwhelming, the eggs came out soggy and the home fries were cold. I didn't get a sense of freshness from the meal. That said, the place is cute and the service was good. I wouldn't come back for breakfast but would definitely Â give lunch a shot.
