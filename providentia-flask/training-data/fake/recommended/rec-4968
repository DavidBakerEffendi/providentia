This is like Chipotle but not a chain. The food is fresh and definitely worth a try. They speak Spanish and English. I don't consider a place authentic unless they are speaking in Spanish. They are friendly and willing to accommodate. The burritos are large and you get to choose what to include. I selected pork and it was very tender.
