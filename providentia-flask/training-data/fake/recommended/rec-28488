dba (both Williamsburg and East village locations) have a very good array of craft beer on tap and their bottle selections are awesome. dba Williamsburg is also home to the Tchoup Shop, which is hosted by Simon Glenn, a chef who has had culinary expertise in New Orleans. He sets up barbecue grills in dba's backyard and he has a menu that boasts delicious food. I've eaten the duck gumbo which is phenomenal, the burgers and the pork po' boys are equally as good and I've also had the beet salad. Simon's buttermilk buscuits melt in your mouth. Now that the summer is here, I would suggest a visit to dba Williamsburg for a couple of pints of good craft beer paired with some delicious offerings from Simon's grill
