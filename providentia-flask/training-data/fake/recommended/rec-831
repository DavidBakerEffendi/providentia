I just visited this Cavanaugh's, and was really happily surprised by what they did with the recent renovations from the old Dark Horse into the 4th Cav's in the city. This location meets their need to spread out one more time too - from University City to Rittenhouse to Penn's Landing and now to Headhouse. They've managed to preserve the old, dark, wooden, cozy feel of the historic pub(s) prior and update it with some modern touches. On the night I visited, there was even a bonfire out front on the side walk - welcoming guests into the watering hole. The upstairs area seems like a maze - you can hop from bar to bar and experience a different feel in each spot. In usual Cav's style - there are plenty of TV's all over so you can still catch any of your favorite sporting events. I think they have good drink specials on most days - so it's not too pricy to eat/drink here. Â Finally, the servers and management were all really friendly and accomodating and made you feel like a respected guest in their establishment.
