Really cute seating and decor, but the food is just alright.  Not bad, but not great either.   A friend and I went here last night and I got the grilled octopus and she got the lamb dish, and both dishes were fine, but not amazing.  Their wine selection is not bad either, but again - nothing spectacular. Same with the service - not bad, but not wonderful either.  Have had better, have had worse.
