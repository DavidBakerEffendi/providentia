Reviews say 4.5 stars. I'm going to have to disagree. When I walked in to the restaurant I almost thought about going back out, but then I thought maybe the food will be better. First off, I don't like how the menu is on the walls. Depending on where you sit, it can be difficult to see it. Is it that hard to print out some menus. Second, don't like that they have so many tables for a small restaurant. You are going to get cramped in if the place gets crowded and you will have a hard time maneuvering out of your seat since every table is literally almost together. Â Almost sitting on top of each other. Now to the food. I got the seafood chowder as an appetizer and the pan seared tilapia. I got really nothing to say about those two dishes. As they were both ok, nothing special. Probably the seafood chowder was the better tasting of the two. They didn't offer much on desserts either. It's either tarts or flourless chocolate cake. I think this place is popular for its BYOB. Other than that nothing spectacular about this place. Definitely had better experiences at other places. This time my gut instincts were wrong. My streak of picking out great restaurant has ended here. Oh well, time to start a new one. FYI. Cash Only.
