Yucca Bar is great! The food is okay but the drinks are amazing! On top of that the custom service is beyond  fantastic!  Whenever I go  there (Wednesday - Saturday nights) the  hostess is so warm and approachable. She is super accommodating and makes sure I have a great night! Her friendly, open manner is comforting in a place like NYC. Definitely a great place to bring friends and have a good start to your weekend!
