This place reminds of the food I used to have in Dhabas in India. These brothers have been around for a long time and they haven't changed their food quality or quantity. Everything is really good here especially in "dhaba special". Highly recommended. Better than those 'rasois' or 'moghuls', who have been getting passed off as authentic Indian cuisine and aren't even that great.
