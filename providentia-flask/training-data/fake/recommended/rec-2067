PAT'S vs. geno's I was sooo excited to FINALLY be in Philly for the first time because I wanted to try the Cheese Steaks. Being that I was only out there for 1 night I had to get one from each of the most well known spots, so that I could do the compare and contrast between the two. I had heard so many times that Geno's was great and how many celebs go there and blah blah blah...and all I can say is FAIL!!!!!! The sandwich was dry, the meat had no flavor and the onions were so raw that I had that annoying onion taste in my mouth for a while until I got back to the hotel and brushed my teeth...UGHHH...DON'T WASTE UR MONEY HERE...I've tasted better in NYC...don't be fooled by the celeb hype and the BRIGHT lights... Then, I quickly made my way across the street. I order one from Pat's and I could tell just by watching them make it that it as going to taste WAY BETTER. The Bread was soft, the steak chopped up and JUICY, the onions and peppers COOKED and the cheese was regular American cheese, but good non the less... LADIES AND GENTS WE HAVE A WINNER...PAT'S HANDS DOWN...
