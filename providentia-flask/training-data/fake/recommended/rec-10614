We walked 3 miles out of our way to come here while spending the weekend in Philly, and it was completely worth it. Fresh, hand drawn noodles in a delicious broth. I got the egg and vegetable, husband got the duck. I'm pretty sure he had a spiritual awakening over the whole thing. It was aromatic and so yummy. Not to mention the huge portions for the reasonable price. Cannot go wrong. We also had the peanut noodles, which were equally plentiful and cheap, along with the marinated beef. Everything was so wonderful. I really had to struggle to make myself stop eating. There's soy and rooster sauce on the table along with a delicious black sesame and chili oil. I'm legit salivating just thinking about it. The restaurant is small with no frills, and busy - we popped in a little before 3pm and we got the last table available. I don't even want to think about how it must be during actual meal times. The staff was friendly and the food came out quick. I know this will become a must-go place every time we visit the city from now on.
