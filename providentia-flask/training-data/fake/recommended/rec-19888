My husband and I have been here a few times.  Our first two visits were five-star all the way.  The food here is fresh and well-prepared.  We like that it is Bring Your Own Wine.  Unfortunately, our last visit was a two and a half star experience.  First of all, they cram way too many tables into a small space that it is nearly impossible to move about.  We went on a rather cold night, and with everyone's coats on the backs of the chairs, the back room became claustrophobic.  The waiter (and several other patrons) kept on hitting into my husband's arm.  It was very difficult to carry on a conversation, as the tables on either side of us were practically on top of us.  They took the bottle of wine that we had brought with us, and kept it on ice behind the counter.  There were two times when we couldn't get anyone's attention to refill our glasses.  We went through almost our entire main course without any wine.  The food was overly garlicky this last time, as well.  I don't think we'll be back any time soon.
