great food. the tasting menu (think its the same menu they use for restaurant week). gives a decent portions of a few things u'd like to try on the menu. if you go with a friend or 2, you get to try almost everything on the menu. selection of wines were also wonderful. they give you free tastings of there featured wine as well. overall, great service, great atomsphere, awesome FOOD.
