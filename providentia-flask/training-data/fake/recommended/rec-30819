I love grits. These grits are amazing!!! Definitely go with the soft egg when making your order. I really liked their jalepeno sauce too. So good. Their OJ was awesome, as was the pecan bread that they had (a very good combo of salty and sweet). Next time I'm in NYC, I'm definitely making another spot here. It's just a sidewalk window with no seating, but then again, it kinda adds to the charm.
