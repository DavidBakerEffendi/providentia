I love how a sales associate from Swarovski recommended this place to Jessica C. Makes perfect sense - there's a very pretty chandelier smack dab in the middle of the restaurant and crystal lamps hanging from the ceiling. My friend says it reminds her of Forever 21 - in the glitzed out, tacky kind of sense. Aside from it's uber trendy appearance, Room Service offers your usual Thai pickings along with some unique entrees (they have a section in their menu that's titled "Eat Like A Bangkokian"). I'd come back for their lunch specials, which are very reasonably priced. I did hear though that it's branch in Chelsea was recently closed by the Board of Health though (eep!) - which is somewhat disconcerting.
