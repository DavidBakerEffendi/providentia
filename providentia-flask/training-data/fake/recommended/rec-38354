Okay, truly mixed feelings about ilili. I think I've been planning to come to this restaurant for at least 6 months now. We decided to try it out on New Years eve with another couple. I think ilili has been sippin' off the douchebag draank at 235th because there were some pretentious moments that just shouldn't be at a Lebanese restaurant. Firstly starting with the blatantly false advertising on the website. We booked 7:45pm reservations which bumped us up into the $75 prix fixe menu. Website had promises of belly dancer, DJ, and complimentary champagne but didn't specify this was only for the 9:30pm to Midnight reservations. When I pointed this out I was not greeted with any explanation. The food was very good, some dishes standing out particularly better than others. The lamb sausage was delectable as was the cauliflower and the eggplant appetizers. The duck egg was delicious but way too heavy to the point where I felt the oil content of the dish overwhelmed it. As an entree I was the only of my party to order the pulled lamb while everyone else got the beef kebab. Bad choice on my part. The pulled lamb was very dry. The beef kebab, however was delicious. Desert was the beignets in an orange dipping glaze. Awesomely good. I tried the candy bar too and for a chocolate dish, very yummy. The drinks here were also of note. The fresh meadow and from Beiruit with Passion was nice. Service was okay. Atmosphere was great--very beautifully decorated and maintained. Coed bathrooms too--fun?!
