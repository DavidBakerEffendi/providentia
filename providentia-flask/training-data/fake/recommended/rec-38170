My family and I used to go to the old Reno's all the time when I was younger, and we loved it. We hadn't been in since they moved to their new location, so we decided to give it a try. The staff is composed entirely of high schoolers, which wouldn't be an issue if there was some sort of supervisor on hand, but there wasn't. The place felt like a high school hangout with the staff completely disregarding my family and I, swearing and screaming at one another. Our food took forever to come out because the guy making pizzas was too busy flirting and joking around with the waitresses. If that wasn't bad enough, the food was mediocre at best. I don't know what happened to all the old Reno's recipes, but clearly training a bunch of teenagers to cook is not working out. The pizza was sloppy, and while we asked for basil as a topping (and were charged for it!) there was almost no basil to be found. We will not be coming back here.
