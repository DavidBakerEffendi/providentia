For a restaurant with a high reputation, Fountain did not live up to the hype. The wine I selected was out and they recommended a horrible bottle. It took them about 20 mins to let me know the Pinot I selected was out. There was a table next to us who selected wine and they had their bottle within 5 mins. The wine came AFTER we finished the first course. I also had to pour my own wine and water. They were slow in clearing our table after each course. Not that we were in a hurry, but it was a 3 hour dinner. Lots of sitting and waiting. The food was quite good though. A forward thinking menu, but it was not over the edge of comfort. Would I go back? Don't think so, not for those prices.....
