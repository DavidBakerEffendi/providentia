Went here on cinco de mayo, that being said I assumed it was going to be madness, but not pure chaos. It took us over an hour to get a table while they were sitting people who arrived after us, we had to go up to the host atleast 4 times and there was nothing but confusion. 45 min to get a margarita (9.00)!!!! Then by the time we sat down and ordered our food we have been there for an hour and a half. After another 30 min of waiting for food to arrive we considered canceling, then miraculously our food came out 3 min later... Cold and soggy. Chipotle for us next time!!!
