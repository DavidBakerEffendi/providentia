My fiancé and I went back for the second time today and we were not disappointed.  It was as good as we remembered.  Absolutely superfresh seafood.  They don't have a freezer- 'nuff said.   We enjoyed 6 assorted oysters ($2.5/2.75 per piece), the house special fettuccine with clams ($15?), the diver scallop special ($18) and the scallop ceviche with an amazingly silken basil/arugula/tofu sauce ($11).  The oysters were expertly cleaned, and we were hungry, so were very happy the dishes were coursed quickly.  All were truly excellent- tasty and fresh, and by the looks at other tables, the food was great all-around.  The meal ended with their complimentary fab whiskey cake and half-glasses of a lovely rose muscato.   The best thing for me was that the service matched the food- our waitress was super nice, as was the hostess (we ended up waiting for a table only 25 min, half her original quoted time) and the awesome owner chatted us up again.  He thought he remembered us and while I don't think he did (it was almost a year we last visited), he made us feel special and appreciated.  All of the people who work there make you feel welcome and "at home" (sans all of the ubiquitous snotty Manhattan nonsense where as a patron, you are made to feel as though you must accommodate the restaurant, rather than the other way around...). We can't wait to go back again for their happy hour ($12 half-dozen oysters and a beer) and, just because it's that great.
