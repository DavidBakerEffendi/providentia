Best burger in the city?  People must be yelping immediately upon downing their sixth or seventh McSorley's dark. Look, this place is cool, laid back, nice character, inexpensive, and an institution / tradition for many.  I get that.  But the burger was dry, overcooked, and under-seasoned - each significantly so.  And since my tongue can't taste a restaurant's character or vibe, it was pretty disappointed. If you just want an informal cool place to hang out, go.  If you are searching for a great burger, go elsewhere.
