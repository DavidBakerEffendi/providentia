I love the Dutch Eating Place.  I always seem to gravitate here when the Dutch Corner is open, because of the home cooked feel of the food. The Chicken Pot Pie is wonderful along with the sweet tea that tastes just like the kind my mom used to make.  By far the best part of the Dutch Eating Place is the Corn Nuggets.  Go here soon and often for very yummy inexpensive food!
