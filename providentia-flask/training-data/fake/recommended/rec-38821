I came here for lunch by myself the other day and I just absolutely have to give this place 5 stars. Mook's is simply fantastic. The service was amazing (they bring your food out to you) and the workers were super polite and welcoming. And the food. Wow. I ordered the half-size PBLT, and if you're on a perpetual diet like me, the half-size is more than enough. My sandwich was delicious- flavorful, warm, toasty, and fulfilling. I purchased this half-sandwich and was given a free iced tea from this Yelp deal, and the total came just under $7. A gem among the exorbitantly high lunch cuisines of NYC. The atmosphere of Mook's was warm and inviting, with a row of bar stools and sit-down table settings as well. I wish Mook's all the best in their business, because they truly deserve the daily love of city folks. I will definitely be back to try their tuna sandwich next :)
