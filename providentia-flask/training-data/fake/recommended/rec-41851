Living with Texans for the past 2 years, all I've heard was that no true tex-mex exists in NYC. So when we found about Gueros, we trekked to Brooklyn to see if it was legit. The food was great and it's the closest thing you can get to true tex-mex in NYC. The queso actually felt like normal, Texas queso. BUT the service was a mess. I went on a Sunday afternoon, so the place was packed. The cashier at the front who was taking orders was definitely overwhealmed by the line out the door and could barely keep up. You could even tell he would space out while taking orders.  My friends and I placed our orders and my friends received their orders after about 15 minutes or so. After patiently waiting for 30 minutes while my friends finished their meals, I asked the cashier what the hold up with my 2 taco order was. He gave me a confused and dazed look and said the cooks would get to it whenever they did. Another 20 minutes later (50 min at this point), I went back up to ask for a refund as waiting 50 minutes for 2 tacos is insane when people who just came in 10 minutes before were already eating. The cashier finally moved my ticket up and my 2 tacos came out an hour after I ordered. Turns out I wasn't the only irrirated person, as they had also completely forgotten about the order before me and that dude was pretty pissed too. As this place grows and gets more popular, they really need to think about who they put at  the counter to man orders. They have to figure out how to streamline their orders so things don't get lost in the chaos. Plus, it's a tiny spot so don't expect to find a table or seating easily. You gotta stake out your spot and stalk people as they get up.
