Gross food. Gross people. Gross attitude. I wouldn't feed that "Philly" to a trash can. I wish I could have thrown it in the Skinny-Pete-wannabe's face. And the kid with the bowl cut (cool, bro) at the fry window was too busy screaming at a suspected hot pepper thief (gasp) to get our order in. Just to clarify, she had indeed purchased a Philly from Geno's, but had taken it out of the wrapper already. Our first and HOPE TO GOD ONLY visit to the laughably self proclaimed "city of brotherly love" was miserable all-around, with Geno's being the ultimate low. The only time I've ever wanted to cry while ordering food. Good riddance.
