Our first visit to Philadelphia and we visited this Philly cheesesteak joint based on an online review by GQ magazine. We were not disappointed. Not a place to go to if you want spacious, convenient seating, but if you want a GREAT Philly cheesesteak this is the place to go. Had both cheese wiz and provolone and I actually like the way the cheese wiz melted down into the meat better. If you go, you MUST get the bacon cheese fries! Amazing!
