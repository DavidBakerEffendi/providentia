Uva was awesome. It didn't look like much from the outside but as soon as you step through the door you understand why the ratings are so high. The staff was great and the place was sizzling on an extremely snowy night. I am glad we got there early or we would have been waiting a long time for a table. The food was out of this world - even the cappuccino was good! Can't say enough good things. Make sure you go hungry - you won't be disappointed.
