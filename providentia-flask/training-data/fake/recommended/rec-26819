my relatives brought me here for dinner, since i'm from out of town. from looking on the outside, you wouldn't know that it was huge on the inside. the ceilings are very high, and we were brought into the second room, where there were large posters of ancient kings and queens hung on the walls. the food was good. this was one of the better chinese restaurants i had while visiting (where i'm from, there's a huge population of asians, so no place really beats restaurants at home). the service was good. the food came really fast and within 20 min, the waiters somehow made all ten dishes we ordered fit on the lazy susan - might i add, without spilling any food/sauces. one place to visit again!
