This place is unique, swanky, phenomenal food, great atmosphere -- it has a LOT going for it. The only downside is you will wait a substantial amount of time if you are dining later in the evening on a weekend. The cool part, they have multiple bars you can hang out at while you wait. Another plus (or tip) -- on saturdays especially, if you dine a bit later, and stay until 10, the back room turns into a club which gets packed and is an absolute blast. A lot of people from the area come to this club. If you want to have the best experience: order their salad, mashed potato pizza, and a cheese pizza. All three are out of the world and the mashed potato pizza is so unique. You will LOVE this place. I recommend it constantly.
