The food is tasty. The 3 course for $30 option is worth it. BYOB with a $10 corking fee is not too terrible. The service is AWFUL. Sat down with our own bottle of wine and was told twice by the waitress that she would be over with glasses to take care of the wine. It took her 20 minutes from the time we sat down to open the wine. It also took a solid 10 minutes to get menus because they didn't have enough for the number of patrons. I just think this is weird, not necessarily bad (maybe they change the menu so often it isn't cost effective to make 30 per night?), but really weird.  We both chose the 3 course for $30 option. The first course came without issue (chicken satay and fried portobello mushroom sticks were really good). Then came the next course. We had ordered 2 salads and then a sandwich and tuna as our 2nd and 3rd courses. The waitress brought the sandwich I ordered and a meat plate as our 2nd course.  We didn't complain because my date was happy with the meat plate too and didn't want to inconvenience the girl who was having a problem keeping up as it was. Turns out the entire course was meant for another table. How was this handled? The waitress blamed us for not telling her she messed up. I explained later in the evening that we didn't say anything because we deduced that she just messed up 1/2 of 1 course, not an entire course for our table and another table (excuse us for not thinking you were a moron).  Her attitude left a bad taste in my mouth.
