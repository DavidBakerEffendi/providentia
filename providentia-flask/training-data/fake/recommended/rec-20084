Friggin' good.  We lucked out with getting our own table, but there is a communal table in the middle if you're in a pinch.  We ordered the chicken and waffles and the special of the day which included lobster.  I would skip the special next time and go for the jugular and get the chicken/waffles.  Going back soon!
