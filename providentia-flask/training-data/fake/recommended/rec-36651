For all its hype and fame, Gramercy Tavern is like someone with Old Money - -classy, relaxed, gracious with a "been-there, done-that" attitude in a very self-effacing, secure way.  Not snobby or pretentious, with a warm, friendly staff, easy-going bartenders and some really great chow and shockingly reasonable prices, I see Gramercy Tavern as a place where you could comfortably come alone and feel right at home.   Later in the evening, there was a "wait" for a seat at the bar, but that's only because our group was hogging up like 1/2 the place (sorry, people waiting).  One guy seemed to be visibly annoyed that one of us was in what he considered "his" seat.  Clearly, a regular who sees Gramercy Tavern as an extention of his own home, and I can see from being there just one night how you could easily get that feeling. My husband and I had an assorted cheees plate, which had a very thoughtful and interesting cheese selection and a pork shoulder soup/stew something-er-other which had a mega-tender pork shoulder bathing in a fragrant and fantastic broth, happily cavorting with a some of the most unsung heros of the winter vegetable world (sweet potato, brussel spouts, leeks). We're going back.  Hope no one is in my seat.
