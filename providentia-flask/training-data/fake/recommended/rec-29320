DELISH! Wasn't sure how it was going to be because when we called to make a reservation, the person on the phone laughed because no one does that. My family of four got enough food for about eight people, and we enjoyed every bit of it. From the Bacon Cakes to the Jalapeno Tots to the Special Artichoke Burrito, it was all scrumptious. Our waitress Susan had a dry sense of humor which was entertaining, although I think she was more entertained by us. I would definitely go back the next time I'm in Philadelphia!
