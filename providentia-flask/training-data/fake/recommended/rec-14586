You'd almost miss the entrance if you weren't looking for it- but you'll know it by the drawings in the windows and the logo on the cement in front of the door. We arrived really early- and the first batch of biscuits weren't quite ready yet, but that also meant a hot and moist biscuit full of buttery flavor.  I opted for the egg & cheese, the man went for fried chicken. Normally a biscuit sandwich feels more like a snack- but not here- even the egg & cheese biscuit felt like a meal onto itself.  I loved the little sprinkle of Hot sauce on the biscuit- it was a nice little surprise of spice to bring in that New Orleans heat, but no so much it took over the basic flavors.  Add chicory coffee and you have yourself a perfect breakfast.  The fried chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and super moist on the inside as well. The only thing that wasn't up to standard on our visit were the Ben-yays.  Perhaps my standards are skewed by the real deal in Nola at Cafe du Monde, but I think the cook knew it as well because he didn't charge us for them.  I'd still go back and try ordering them again to make sure it was just a fluke.
