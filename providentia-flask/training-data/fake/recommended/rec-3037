Rudy's is a decent place to grab a beer and some pub food. They have a solid draft beer selection and very good happy hour specials. Their fries are excellent, even without the fun dipping sauce options that they are known for. I think the food itself is decent but nothing to go out of the way for. Â The burgers are good but can't compete with places such as Prime 16 or Plan B. The flatbread I tried was a bit dry and forgettable. The server was extremely friendly, competent and attentive. It's a nice, spacious place but there isn't a ton of atmosphere and the seating is kind of awkward. Overall, Rudy's is good, it just doesn't approach great.
