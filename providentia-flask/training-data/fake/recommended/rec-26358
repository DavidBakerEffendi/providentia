I've tried most popular world cuisines but this was the first time I've ever had Tibetan food, but I must say.. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here. I had the pan fried chicken dumplings, the texture was good but not seasoned well enough- I wish they gave me some black vinegar with my dipping sauce to give it that extra oomph. My favorite dish of the night was the chili dofu (tofu)- super flavorful with fresh spinach. I'll definitely be back to try other dishes! Pleasant first time experience with Himalayan food.
