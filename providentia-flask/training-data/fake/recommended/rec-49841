My wife is Turkish, so I have been exposed to the food culture for a long time now. Place was packed which is always a good sign. I had beyti kebab which was as good as any I've eaten in Istanbul when we go to visit family. Our 6 year old loved the kofte ( meatballs) too and he's a fussy eater. We ordered to go lahmacun ( Turkish pizza, don't laugh, it's AMAZINGLY good and not what you'd expect either! Just try it ! ) and again, and to my considerable surprise, as good as any I've eaten in Turkey. This place is a real gem! Waitress was very pleasant too and maybe the fact that my wife ordered in her native tongue helped? :)
