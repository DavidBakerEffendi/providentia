Strange reservation operation they have. Made me feel as though I I was on a waiting list. I called on a Thursday and was told I'd be called back within 24 hours. Friday they called and said I was all set with a table. Ok. Not a big deal. The service was very good and I was looking forward to an impressive dinner. We ordered 6 dishes between the two of us. It turned out 5 would have been plenty. Ok maybe my expectations were high but after reviewing the whole experience in hindsight, I felt like it didn't leave feeling fulfilled. I'm sorry Traif, but you were just ok. I may return for another try.
