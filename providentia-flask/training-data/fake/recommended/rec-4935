While the food is good the service was horrible They blamed us for ordering a satay which took 45 minutes for the delay They said we wanted a bigger portion for our second appetizer for more delay but they never increased the size Then of course they rushed into the main courses The food was not hot and we needed to ask for more rice The waiter and owner were clueless why we were upset that our meal took 2 hours while other tables were served in half the time Will head back to Thai Kitchen 3
