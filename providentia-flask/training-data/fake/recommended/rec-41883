This is one of my favorite restaurants in NL. atmosphere is intimate, price is very reasonable for the prix fixe menu, and I always have fun with my friends here. service is great too. one time I realized at the restaurant that I lost my cellphone, but the waitress was so nice and lend me her phone. i've been there many times, and I'll go back there for more!
