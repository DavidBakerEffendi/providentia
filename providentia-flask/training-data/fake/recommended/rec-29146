This was a really great spot I enjoyed my brunch. I ordered the famous stuffed cannoli pancakes the first time with a side of eggs and it was delicious! I got it without pistachios the first time, but I definitely recommend getting it. The eggs were great as well and portions were large. I have two complains though their large "fresh squeezed" orange juice was not large nor freshly squeezed. The service was painfully slow, especially considering both times I went there was during a weekday and not during their typical crowded weekend brunches! I'd hate to see the service during the weekend. That was a major turn off for me!
