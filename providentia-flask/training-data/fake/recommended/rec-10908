The pizza is drop dead delicious. The service is really friendly. We got there a little on the late side, but it was still busting at the bar. We came through the kitchen entrance and several people checked to make sure we were being taken care of. Our waitress was lovely, helpful, and didn't mind us chatting with her. The decor is so lovely, earthy and woody, it's just chic enough without sacrificing its cozy feel. And that pizza...just wow! Cheese has never tasted so good.
