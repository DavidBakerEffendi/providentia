An awesome place to hang out in right in the middle of the time square area.  It's got a great atmosphere and is not touristy since it's so hidden away.  You'll most likely have to deal with a wait, but you can give them your phone number and they will give you a call when your table is ready.  So you can get in when you need to if you do a little bit of planning. Now on to the food they have a variety of all kinds of Japanese food since it's izakaya style restaurant and you can get your fix all tons of different sakes.   There's no excuse to make it out to this place since it's open late so in case you already have dinner plans you should make plans to have another dinner around 12 or 1am. =)
