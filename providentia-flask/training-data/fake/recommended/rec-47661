I can't even muster one star for the miserable meal I had at this restaurant.  The meal started with one basket of cold bread with two small dishes of garlic and one very small dish of what I believe the be tomato sauce, but can't tell for sure as it was so far from my end of our rectangular table that passing it around would have been a chore and disruptive to the conversation.  When it came time to be served our main course, only four out of the six in Our party received their meals.  After waiting with meals in front if us for the missing two meals, a hostess came over to apologise for the wait, took the four meals, to put under food-drying heat lamps I would imagine, and returned five minutes later with the six meals, without the aide dish that I had ordered.  The food was bland , device was hectic to say the least and at $100 per couple, overpriced.  I would not choose to come back.
