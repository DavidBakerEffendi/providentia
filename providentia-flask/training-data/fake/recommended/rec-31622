It was my first time there on 1/2/15 for lunch with my wife and daughter. We started off with the Cuban sandwich bite sized appetizer.......Great!!! The pollo "Chicharron" was fantastic with the sweet plaintains, rice and beans. My wife had the sirloin steak which was cooked to perfection! My daughter had the " Mambo" eggplant platter which she enjoyed very much. Service is great, our server Pedro was very polite and took his time to explain the menu thoroughly, being that it was our first time there. The decor is cool, comfortable and the music was great. Would definitely recommend the Mambo tea house to all my friends.
