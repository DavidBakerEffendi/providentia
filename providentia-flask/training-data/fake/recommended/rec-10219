I stopped in here for lunch on a weekday and it was quiet, quick and had a nice vintage saloon feel.... dark but airy too, good service. I had Cary's Salad with a seltzer w. bitters, lime & a dash of simple syrup and it was pretty perfect. I like the vibe here, I'd come back for late night cocktails or draft beer as well.
