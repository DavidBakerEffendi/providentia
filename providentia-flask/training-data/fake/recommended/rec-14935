I feel like based on the other reviews, I might just not be cool enough to see the allure of this place. The good: Cocktails were spectacular. Mac and cheese is delicious (and has breadcrumbs, which for me is a requirement). The bad: The service was glacially slow, and it wasn't an extra busy night. The menu was also a bit prohibitive to people who don't eat anything under the sun. I'd probably rather go to Supper if I was in the mood for similar cuisine, but I didn't hate my meal by any means.
