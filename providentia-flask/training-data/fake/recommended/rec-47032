An absolute must while in Philadelphia. This small, laid back and unassuming little restaurant has become a staple of regional foodies and won recognition from the local and national press. Their brunch/ breakfast has been the foundation of their popularity. Weekend wait times can exceed 2 hours but it's well worth it. Their stuffed French toast is simply amazing as is their breakfast burritos. Aside of a few items which are always offered, the majority of the items are made up of fresh seasonal ingredients from the Italian market around the corner. Often looking at the menu can be a little frightening as specials are often made up of combinations you would never of considered but somehow they always are incredible. The secret, even for many brunch loyalists, is their dinner. Like the breakfast menus, the dinner offerings are all made from what's fresh and seasonal. Some mainstays like their mussels, hummus, salads and meatloaf are Â great. it is a BYOB so bring a couple of bottles and enjoy the evening with friends. Deserts are fantastic as well and consist of homemade stars like bread pudding, chocolate layer cake, etc. This restaurant is the best comfort food in the city. It has become my friends and family's "goto" place for birthdays, celebrations and just a night out.
