Some days you just in the mood for a no nonsense hot dog well I found myself in that mood yesterday. In fact I was feeling a bit piggish I usually when i want a hot dog I'll just go to any Ole stand but i figured oh what the heck live and go well it was terrific I started with Mac and cheese with Bacon and keys face facts bacon and mac and cheese is just a win win and followed it with a chilli dog and a kraut dog and both had amazing flavor and nice texture I chose to wash it down with a black cherry soda. the staff was great the young man was very honest when i asked if ordering the clam chowder would be to much food and he said probably and If i want it after it's there which I always appreciate. needless to say I was full. and very happy
