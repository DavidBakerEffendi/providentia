Came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. We got the carpaccio and oysters as appetizers. Both were delicious! I got the spinach ravioli for my entree and he got the lobster special. Everything was very yummy and the presentation was great too! The portions were just right and prices are very reasonable for Williamsburg. The service was quick and very pleasant. They picked out the perfect wine for us and even brought out my boyfriend's dessert with a candle. They also treated us to homemade limoncello. We'll definitely go back, soon! Thank you for a great night!
