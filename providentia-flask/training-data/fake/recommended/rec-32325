After walking by this place a ton of times Â I finally stopped in to see what it was all about. I ordered their Roast Beef on Rye sandwich that I think they call a Colorado. Honestly I don't think it was worth the almost $7 price tag. There was a measly amount of roast beef in the sandwich and it was kind of dry. I'd compare it to the sandwiches my mom used to make me for elementary school. Nothing more nothing less. Maybe I'd have better luck with something else off the menu but I'm not sure I'm willing to drop more money to find out. I'm giving an extra star because the girl who served me was super nice and had a great smile and the staff seemed pleasant and I guess Rybread is a cool place to "be seen" in Fairmount this fall.
