I really wanted to like Joya and unfortunately will not be returning anytime soon.  The layout of the restaurant couldn't be more chaotic in that it's completely crowded with no designated host area to check in at.  It doesn't help that the host is completely rude and is chatting with friends ad nauseum as you stand there, practically tripping over other diners, waiting to be acknowledged.  He finally said "yeah?" to us rudely after ignoring us for a solid few minutes and then told us it would be a 25-minute wait.  It was a 40-minute wait.  We were lucky to get seats at the bar -- every single tap was empty except for ONE -- else we would have been trapped in the bizarre layout with all the other people being ignored by the host or bartender. Once we were finally seated, our appetizers arrived immediately and our beers took a ton of time while mixed drinks were served to people next to us who had been seated after us.  The calamari was okay, but batter-heavy to the point where many pieces didn't even have ANY meat in them.  It was really just a plate of batter.  The vegetable spring rolls had some strange, unidentifiable flavor that dominated the entire roll (something mushroomy, maybe?).  The beef with garlic sauce was a plate of brown water that had no flavor.  The beef with red curry was decent, but not beyond anything at a standard Thai place. Overall, the experience was strange -- as if the only people actually served and treated well were friends with the host.  Won't be going back.
