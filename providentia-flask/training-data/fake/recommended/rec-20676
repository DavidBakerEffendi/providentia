Penang - you are a godsend, and even more so in the culinary desert that is central Jersey. The roti canai is crisp, yet chewy, with a very well-seasoned curry sauce on the side. It is a bellwether for a restaurant's authenticity. The pad thai had a lot of flavor and taste, and this is something that is hard to get right. The balance of all the elements have to be just right and work well together -- and it does here. The green curry was food of richness and flavor. Each tofu cube was fried to a perfect crisp. So it might be a little pricey, but it is much better than most other restaurants in the area.
