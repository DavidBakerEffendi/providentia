ok.  it's good.  i get that.  but are our standards that low that we have to hold this up as the best pizza in new york? in my opinion the customer service is pretty bad.   you walk in, there's no one to greet you, you don't know where to go.   once i walked up to the register to get helped, and after waiting thru three orders, i was finally told to get in line outside if i want to be seated.  how was i gonna know that?  and then outside there was no actual line, just people mulling, confused, hoping that no one claims there spot when the guy comes out and calls 'next!'. in my opinion, if you are fortunate enough to be as successful as grimaldi's, then you should hire enough help so that you have a host, your staff doesn't have to be short and impatient with people, and none of your customers feel like they are invisible. that being said, congratulations to them for having great pizza and a great place to kick it near the brooklyn bridge.   recently i went on a date that was just grabbing a pizza here and taking it to brklyn bridge park.  couldn't have been nicer...
