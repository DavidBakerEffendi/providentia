Well I hate to admit it, but I've done the yelp world a disservice. I've eaten at The Saint Austere close to 20 times now, and have yet to let the world know how absurdly amazing this place is. (No exaggeration on the 20 visits) Every item on their menu is cooked to perfection, and I promise you that they have yet to serve a dish that I didn't absolutely love. If you think I'm being extreme, try the polenta, which they apparently slow cook for 3 hours. (Just had to ask) Try the broccoli rabe. Try ANY of their pastas. (Chef Sam Diaz is a magician back there). Try ANY of their cocktails or their beautiful wine list. But most importantly, support a family owned business that's run by a brother/sister whose passion for their restaurant is unmatched. One of their main focuses is providing 5 star service (which I think most of you will agree is getting harder and harder to find these days), and I've always left feeling I received exactly that. Do yourself a favor and at least try this place for yourself. I can guarantee it won't be the last time you're there...or your money back! Well, not exactly, but you get the point :)
