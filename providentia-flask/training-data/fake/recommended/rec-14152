Wow! Can i just say amazing food.  I got the banana walnut pancakes with the maple butter syrup.  Unlike most syrups where you just get tired of after 3 bites, it had the perfect consistency and sweetness.   The scones were huge.  I wish they were more fresh and buttery.  The raspberry jam was very fresh though.   I came here on Monday morning at around 11a and it was still busy.  We were able to get a table after 5 minutes.  I can't imagine what it is like on the weekends. This is a must if you come to Manhattan!
