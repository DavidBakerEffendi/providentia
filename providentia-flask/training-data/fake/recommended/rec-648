I was really upset when Floridita Tapas closed in West Harlem, but cheered by the fact that they moved downtown into the former Xunta on First Ave near 11th.  This place is so welcoming, so wonderful, and such an improvement on the scurvy Xunta.  Food is excellent, music is real Spanish, and the nights they have live flamenco are amazing - make reservations.  Viva Nai!
