I think this place is popular because of the herd mentality - "oh, there is a line, it must be good."  Of course, I'm totally guilty of this too.  If Dan and I are up before 10 am and want brunch, this is the first place that we suggest.  In reality, the food is just okay, they only take cash and if you aren't there by 10:05 the wait is out-of-control.  I know its cute inside, but are we really that starved for cute places in Murray Hill?
