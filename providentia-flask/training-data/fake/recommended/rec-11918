My dining nirvana began upon entering the restaurant. It is an impressive, classy dining room with all manners of little endearing details, such as floral arrangements and a little squash gourd on each table. I ordered the prix-fixe lunch, and was elevated by the aromas and tastes of each dish. Like the changing of the guards, every plate came with the changing of the highly polished proper silverware. They served freshly baked bread from their bakery and I couldn't resist the saffron-walnut bread, which had the slightest hint of sweetness. I savored the signature appetizer, a very generous dungeness crab and porcini flan with a truffle dashi salt. Â My table staff were very but not annoyingly attentive and friendly. This has renewed my love affair with the Bouley brand.
