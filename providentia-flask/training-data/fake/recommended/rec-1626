The sandwhich was good.  I came in with high expectations, but left with the realization that we are talking cheesesteak, not exactly the holy grail of ingrediants for an over the top sandwich.  I enjoyed it.  Service was friendly and fast.  Would I take the time to drive and park in this neighborhood again, probably not.  Nuff Said.  Ate a cheesesteak from Geno's and left with the same impression.
