Very small bar/restaurant that serves up the best burger and fries I have ever tasted. The burgers are grond on site and cooked exactly as ordered. There is a wide variety of toppings available (including foie gras) but I recommend the cheddar and bacon toppings and getting the burger medium rare! The duck fat cooked fries served with optional sly fox cheddar fries and short ribs are a highlight as well. A well stocked bar including some nice beer selections round out the experience. Some advice - be prepared to wait - it is a small place and the food is all prepared fresh. The wait staff is efficient but the hostesses can be a bit abrasive and unwelcoming - my only complaint.
