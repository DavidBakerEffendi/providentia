Always a good bet. Fast, fresh, healthful, generous. And yummy. A take-out experience begins with the phone call. Â I don't want to hear cacophony in the background or a harried voice right off the bat. "Kate," as I call her in my head, is calm, cool and collected. So what if today she heard "tuna" for "tofu." First mistake in maybe 8 years! Note: remember to enunciate. Tomorrow's lunch: gently seared slices of tuna on... a perfect bed of greens. My salmon salad was, as always, really good: two succulent grape tomatoes (I could use two more), good mix of greens and always delectable, decent portion of miso-glazed salmon. Note: no worries here about over-dressing... Someone mentioned less-than-delicately-sliced cucumbers. Yes. That's an issue. And if that's the most negative thing one can come up with in a restaurant review, well, hell. Can also highly recommend the tuna burger. And the fish taco. Echoing the dismay re: not open on Sunday and no CCs. Minor nitpicks that pale in comparison to the consistent quality of this long-established local favorite.
