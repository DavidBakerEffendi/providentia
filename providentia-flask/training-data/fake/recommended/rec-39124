I prefer this place over Shake Shack, but they're really two different places. One is outdoor in a park, while Corner Bistro's more like the neighborhood dive bar from eons ago. Love it. The menu's super simple - burgers and fries pretty much. And they taste great. The service is, well, serviceable. It's the burger that matters. The wait can take forever if you don't time it right, so go before the rush is on.
