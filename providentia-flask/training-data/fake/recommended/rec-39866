Please note that I've only given 5 stars to two food institutions: Lupa and Pommes Frites. I am addicted to these things late night. They must roll them in crack, because if I'm anywhere in the East Village vicinity past midnight, I start recruiting people to get a bag of these bad boys. They have a menu full of dipping sauces, but my all time fav is pomegranate teriyaki. Mango chutney is also pretty great. This is not much of a secret, because there is always a line out the door late night. I promise it's worth it though! Stick it out and make some fellow fries-loving friends while you wait. The fries live up to their rating.
