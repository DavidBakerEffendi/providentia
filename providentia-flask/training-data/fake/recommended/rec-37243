Food was good. Service for large table was sluggish.  Uneducated on gluten free accommodations but willing to bring out multiple dressing until I picked a safe one. Friendly server and manager. Scary crowd hanging out smoking out the back door wafting cig smell in each time the door opened. Good burger.  Crayons for kids.
