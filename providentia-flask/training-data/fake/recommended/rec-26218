My friends and I had plans to eat dinner at Momofukus, but little did we know about the wait.  So, here we are..totally not from NYC and wasn't quite sure on where to go.  So, of course...Yelp helped us out. We decided to go to Cha-An because of the great ratings and we're not really sure what we were getting ourselves into.  I knew it was a Japanese restaurant, but I wasn't aware that there were set courses. I was a little hesitant at the beginning with the set menu, but decided to go with the Cha-An Set B.  I was super grateful when the waitress even asked if any of us had any food allergies.  I'm allergic to shellfish and I was very pleased to hear someone asking. When my little tray came out..my first thought was...."THAT'S IT?", but as I started eating my food, I was pleasantly surprised how delicious and filling the meal was.  I LOVED, LOVED the soup that they had that day. I know that this place is famous for their desserts, but we were completely full and couldn't really eat any.  However, next time I'm back in town...I'm heading here for desserts! The staff was really pleasant and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Oh, they only accept CASH, so make sure to stop by the ATM before you go there.
