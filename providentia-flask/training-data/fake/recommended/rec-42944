I heard this place was great, but as a foodie I found the menu lacking in imagination.  The place was teeming with self proclaimed beautiful people and it was hard to hear.   We ordered gnocchi and duck pate for starters and two salads for mains.  The forgot the gnocchi and brought a salad which we sent back.  The pate was a duck liver but he prune compote took on the test and the croutons under the spread were over done.  They apologized for the mistake and brought salads next.  Duck confit not theat impressive and arugula and fennel good.   Spend less time on seating pretty people and more time on pretty food.
