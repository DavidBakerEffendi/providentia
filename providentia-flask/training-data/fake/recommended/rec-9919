false advertisement came here yesterday night with a group of 4 , around 1:00 the place was kinda empty and the tables were clear ..and was told the kitchen was closed ....  Really?? we were then told we can sit at the bar which but that closes in a half an hour ...SERIOUSLY??  "but when we called earlier in the night we were told the kitchen closed at 2 and the bar closed at 230....we got there at 1:00 plus yelp says they close at 2:30 ...not cool to be turning down people an whole hour before closing ! plan on going back next week (at an earlier time!) to try the sangria
