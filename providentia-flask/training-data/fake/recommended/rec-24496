Came here for a friend's birthday. Loved the ambiance and the natural light that shined in. This place is perfect to go with your girls or a date. We did the 'not so classic' brunch special - $39. I had the jumbo lump crab scramble, grilled skirt steak hash and fennel sausage. Lump crab scramble - interesting, scrambled eggs with crab mixed in. You can definitely taste the crab. Grilled skirt steak - best part of the meal. Steak was cooked to perfection, medium rare just how I had asked for it and there was an over easy egg on top. Fennel sausage - small bite sized sausages with grilled onions, yum Our waiter was very attentive and seated us even though our whole part wasn't there yet. We also ordered the DIY Prosecco Bar. It comes with blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, apple juice, blood orange puree, mango puree and 2 sweetened vodkas. It was my first time mixing up my own brunch cocktails. Overall, a fun and unique experience would recommend this.
