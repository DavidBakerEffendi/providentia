I would give them 5 stars if they offered take out. I just don't get it. Anywho, get the Brussel sprouts! Woo chile. Deliciousness. The chicken is also amazing. My husband ordered the burger and enjoyed it. Last but certainly not least get the bone marrow. YUM. I am a sucker for marrow so pardon me. I love the seating out doors on a warm summer night. It gets insanely popular at night. The food here does not disappoint!
