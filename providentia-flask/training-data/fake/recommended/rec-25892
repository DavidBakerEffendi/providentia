I just had the best asparagus ravioli I've ever had in my life. My boyfriend got us reservations for a pre-Valentine's dinner (V-day was all booked up) and we were seated almost exactly at our reservation time. The owner is HYSTERICAL- he is all business, no nonsense but obviously loves his restaurant. The waiters and waitresses had a funny banter going that kept the mood lively. Every table was either full or being cleaned for the next party. The food arrived only 10 minutes after we ordered, but apparently 10 minutes is all they need to cook up a bit of heaven. I had the special, and my boyfriend had the arrabiata. Now he's a picky Italian, and has judged every other arrabiata in New York to be moderate to poor. This one? He LOVED. We will, without question, be going back as often as we can get reservations. If you want quiet, boring sub-par food, please go somewhere else. Piccolo Angolo is only for serious food lovers.
