I have been to bar Bruno twice now in a week. The frozen margaritas definitely brought me back. I crave them now....especially now that it's spring and summer is on the horizon. The kale salad is AMAZING fish tacos are good. Plantains are really good almost feel guilty eating them, it's like dessert in a good way. I also became addicted to the chips and need to learn how not to eat them all before my meal! Will be back and will bring a round of friends for sure. Looking forward to warmth and margs at bar Bruno!
