Came here for NYe dinner. It was okay food. Had the pad kee Mao. Â It was pretty good flavor. Friend had the salmon but it was too sweet and sent it back. They till charged her even though she did not eat any of it. Half the price at least. They could have waived it. Not sure if I would come back here.
