I'm thinking coming here on a thursday afternoon was a great choice. No wait and possibly one of the BEST BURGERS I've ever had? Plus and plus, plus, plus. Happy girl right here. Am i the only one who hates when burgers are overstuffed with toppings to the point that you cant even understand what you're eating. You've got mayo and lettuce flyin' all over the place as soon as you take it into your hands.Then trying to figure out how to take a bite out of it while still tasting everything becomes another debacle. Well, no burger at Umami makes you deal with these dreaded problems. The burger are packed tightly into the fluffiest brioche bun, no toppings are going anywhere but where they belong...in your mouth.The truffle and original burger are simple, perfect sized yet both have really unique qualities that will make you coming back for more. I'm not a shitake mushroom fan so i was skeptical about the original burger when i read the ingredients. Guess what? You don't take any mushrooms at all but you do taste the sharpness of the parmesan crisp. SO good. That along with the roasted tomato make for a really great combination. Matt tried the Truffle burger and i ofcourse tried a bite.This burger is oozing truffle cheese! mmmmmm! Possibly the best tasting burger ive had in NYC. Needless to say, we both loved it. One thing i would say to SKIP are the fried pickles. These were more like tempura battered pickle spears. The batter falls right off the luke warm pickles which still tasted like they were out of the jar. NOT fried pickles and not worth ordering.
