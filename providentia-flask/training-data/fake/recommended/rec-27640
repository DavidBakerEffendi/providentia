Went here for lunch the other week and boy did that broiled burger hit the spot.  It had been so long since I visited I almost forgot how juicy and flavorful it is.  The place is old and it looks every bit its age, but who cares when the food and drinks are good. For lunch and just before dinner seem to be the best times to go.  I've went at night before and had to wait pushed up against the door.  The guys who serve you are good they try to keep things flowing.  Sooooo glad I saw this on the Food Network a few years back.
