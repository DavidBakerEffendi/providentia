This place serves absolutely phenomenal Italian cuisine. Every appetizer and entree that I've tried has been absolutely delicious. You can taste all the fresh and delicious flavors with every bite. The gnocci is particularly amazing... light and fluffy! The staff is incredible friendly, professional and knowledgeable. There are generally well over 40 daily specials and the waiters have them memorized and are ready to list them off to your table in great detail. The wine list is also impressive and the waiters know which ones will pair best with whatever dishes you may have ordered. Love love love.
