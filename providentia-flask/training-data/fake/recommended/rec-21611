Food was allright - not the best fish tacos I've ever had, but also not the worst.  The service was really bad - the waitress could not hear a thing and went out to smoke after we ordered drinks (and did not return until the cook went out and yelled at her).  Radio Mexico was much better when it was in this spot.
