Cocktails are good but being in the industry and a neighbor I feel like a buyback after six manhattan is a nice gesture.  Not here.  Good food yes. But food and drinks totaling near 250 dollars with no buyback and coming home virtually sober because they aren't that large.... We will be drinking at junction down the street more often.
