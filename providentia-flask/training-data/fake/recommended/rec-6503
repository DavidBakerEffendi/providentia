Excellent espresso and the best tiramisu I have ever had. These two are so good that I always end up ordering nothing else, so I can't really comment on their sandwiches or food :) The crowd is as upper east as it can get. My only complains about this place: 1) It gets extremely crowded and uncomfortable. 2) The staff are more than eager to bring you the check, tell you goodbye and seat the next customer.
