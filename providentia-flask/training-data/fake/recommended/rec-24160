I came back with two friends, and I got the dessert this time! We had the Banana Split Waffle and the Churros Fondue. The waffles were great, but I found the churros to be a little too sweet. They were served with too much sugar! The service I had last time was marvelous. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here last time. However, this time was absolutely terrible. My friend and I arrived here before our other friend, so we decided to sit down first. Within the first minute, our server came up and asked if we were ready to order. Our third person wasn't even with us yet, and we barely had time to look at our menus. I felt rushed. She didn't even offer to bring over water or any drinks while we waited. After our friend arrived, our server came over a few more times, and I really couldn't help but feel like she was hovering. Though following the arrival of our food, she seemed to disappear. Seriously, where did she go? She didn't come to check up on us regularly or anything. My friends finished their food, and I wanted to pack mine up. We waited for a good 30 minutes or so before she decided to clear our plates. Same thing happened after we finished our desserts, as well as after she planted the check down. I'm a server myself, so I would understand if she were busy with serving tables, but being a Wednesday night, she only had four other tables to tend to. Disappointing.
