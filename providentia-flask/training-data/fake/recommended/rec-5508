I've walked by this place a few times and always wanted to try it. One of my coworkers brought me a menu and had positive things to say about her dining experience. I decided to finally give it a try. I like to support small establishments and really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, I have to convince myself to return to try something else. So, I ordered the chicken melt, which is a grilled chicken sandwich with provolone and sauteed spinach on their homemade buns. The best thing about the sandwich was the bread. The chicken was dry and tasteless and I think the spinach was cooked in butter. I was so disappointed. They serve breakfast/brunch and challah french toast is on the menu. I love challah french toast, but I'm a little skeptical considering they spelled it "hallah". If you can't make a decent grilled chicken sandwich and spell challah correctly, should you be trusted? Given the location, they really need to market themselves more and improve the quality of the food. The great tasting bun is enough for me to give them another try.
