We ended up at this restaurant cos the one we wanted to go to was closed on a Monday. And boy were we delighted. Unlike most indian restaurants, where the food is laden with baking soda, this place has great quality, no soda and excellent variety. We ate the lunch buffet, and I actually tried everything on offer, cos it all tasted wonderful. Food tastes very much like fresh home cooked food, and it doesnt feel like it's gonna make you feel uncomfortable later. if you're around this restaurant, I highly recommend stopping by for a meal. I know Im gonna go again. Word of Caution - The place isnt the cleanest, but it isnt filthy either.
