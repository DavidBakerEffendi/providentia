Found this place three years ago when I moved back to New Haven. Family run and very friendly. As far as Americanized Chinese food goes, You will not find better. I've had Chinese all over New haven county these guys smoke every hole in the wall out there. My favorite, the sweet and sour chicken is far superior to Great Wall, Szechuan Delight, House of China and the rest. Recently moved to Fairfield county and miss them soooooo much. Try the chicken terryaki sticks. Slamming! Not only that- the delivery hasn't missed a single item, sauce side or request.
