This is probably one of my favorite izakaya, shabu-shabus in the village.  I like the quaint more sedated manner of hakata vs. east village counterparts and being able to talk to the people at my table without shouting.  In a city with so many choices for japanese, I would return to Hakata for a solid dining experience. The food here is superior and quite reasonable for the quality, most dishes are between $7-$14... I liked all their fish (tuna or kanpachi) carpaccio appetizers, okonomiyake is much better than Otafuku, served piping hot, slightly too saucy.   I don't like pig's feet so on the one occasion that I had it, it left a squishy uninviting taste in my mouth.  For dessert have the special mochi.   I agree on the times that I've been, wait staff was slowish and looked overwhelmed.  That being said they were always polite.   Overall, we left with a full tummy, and not too big a dent on the wallet ($80, incl gratuity, 5 dishes + carafe of wine)
