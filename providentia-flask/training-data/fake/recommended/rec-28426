Silent Date Auction, 2008. The effort it took to get here seemed enormous, but actually was quite quick, despite the F train running on the G track , police activity on the A line, and all sorts of other chaos. It must have been fate, because Norm and I walked in 5 minutes before closing. Beeline to the bar. The bartender looked exhausted, but let us order anyway. Thanks, man. You rock. The Notorious F.I.G. ain't nothin to mess with. It makes me want to go home and make my own fig brandy, except the figs in the back yard aren't ripe yet. The bread was fantastic, two kinds plus a garlic mousse. Anything with garlic is good in my book. Sweet cream butter. Something pesto-y. And then came our little plates, the sea scallops with gooseberries and salted arctic char. Norm mentioned the char tasted....Jewish. I was inclined to agree. Jewish tastes good though. The scallops were, in a word, phenomenal. The bartender asked if we wanted to order dessert. Wow, really? We thought the kitchen was closed! Blueberry rhubarb crisp. Amazing vanilla ice cream melted into the hot crisp, and it was heaven. Kind of hot for heaven, but heaven nonetheless. Later that night, I decided to move to Park Slope. To be close to Applewood. And because I love Park Slope. But Applewood (via Norm) opened my eyes and my stomach even more towards the Â Slizzope. Brooklyn, and Applewood, ready or not, here I come!
