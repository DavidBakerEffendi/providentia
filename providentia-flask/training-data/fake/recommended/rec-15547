Looking for good veggie options, we decided to hit this place last night.  Great ambiance and excellent vibe for a Tuesday night.  We had a reservation and were promptly seated.  Our server was nice, quick and efficient.  The prices are steep for traditional Lebanese fare - you can get the same menu items at other places.  But the food had a touch of difference.  We got the Baba Ganouj,  Melted Halloumi, Roasted Cauliflower, Batata Harra (was okay, nothing special).  Wine was good too. You are essentially paying for the ambiance.
