The food here is fresh which is important for a Japanese restaurant.  They have a lunch menu that is reasonably priced.  I ordered the sushi/sashimi combo.  It came with a soup or salad.  The sashimi was a good size cut,  not too small.  The Fire Island roll was nice. Salmon that is deep fried with cucumbers and what looks like imitation crab. The decor was nice.  Good to bring a date to.  =) First review on this restaurant. Woohoo!!!
