A Wonderful place. if you go with a date sit out side. the restaurant is very trendy but when you sit outside it is very relaxing and really creates an atmosphere for great conversation. The food is good. sometimes the burgers can be a little dry but nothing a little ketchup or bbq sauce cant cure.
