We had high expectations for this place, not just because of the reviews, but because we had such fabulous food everywhere we went on our NYC vacation, concentrating on the Village and lower downtown this trip. The Little Owl was the least fabulous. We were over the worst of our sticker shock by the time we got there, but I guess the bottom line is that the food was good but didn't match the prices. I was expecting a neighborhood place, which in my mind meant more modest in cost and that wasn't the case. I had the chicken dish, OK, not an exciting choice, and it was fine. My husband was warned that the special fish of the day had a lot of bones; he decided he wanted the other fish, which was served whole, not filleted and had lots and lots of bones. He's a expert filleter himself, so no problems,  but it's odd they didn't mention it.  We were going to a play and wanted to get out quick once we were through eating but had a hard time getting the check. So...a few service problems, good but not wonderful food, and a mighty big bill.
