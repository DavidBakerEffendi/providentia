Average and uninspired, which was a disappointment for an out-of-town birthday dinner. Friendly help, and service was good. We sat upstairs, which was fine except we were right next to speaker playing pop, not Thai, music. I had the Beef Luclak, supposedly a specialty. Just not that special. Food was served promptly.
