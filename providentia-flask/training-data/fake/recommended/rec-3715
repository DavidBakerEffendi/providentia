I went early Saturday morning and it was full inside, but we were seated right away.  I ordered pancakes and my bf ordered omelet, hashbrowns and toast.  The fluffy pancakes were delicious!! I was expecting the worse.  I couldn't finish all but we definitely agreed were going back for breakfast again.
