I've been to Golden Dawn many times and it always seems to be the best place to go when you are feeling frumpy and don't know where else to go out to eat. For a diner, the menu is a bit limited and the prices are a bit high for what you get. The food they serve is not glamorous so don't expect the food to look good because it rarely does. When I feel like eating my feelings, I usually get the buffalo chicken wrap. For a more authentic and better diner experience, go to Mastoris.
