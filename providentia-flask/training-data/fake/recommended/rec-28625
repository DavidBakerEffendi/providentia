Before 6pm, they offer a prix fixe dinner menu for $17 which includes an app, entree and dessert. The two of us ordered mussels, meatball, branzino (+5 extra charge), pork medallions, walnut cake and rice pudding from the prix fixe and selection of spreads to start with. Everything was perfectly cooked but the selection of spreads and branzino definitely stood out. They also have a three-course chef tasting menu for $35, on top of which you can add a pasta course for an extra $7.
