Sorry, but I'm not feeling it. The ambiance in this place is pathetico (unless maybe you get to sit outside in the summer), the service unprofessional, the prices too high for Queens and the food, well, it's not great. Their fish seems to be the only thing they can really get right and, damn it, they did. Everything else was passable, but nothing worth the money. If you want good greek, walk the extra few blocks and go to Agnanti at 19th and Ditmars. That place knows how to make a salad (and, no, that does NOT mean watery feta and some barely chopped cucumber).
