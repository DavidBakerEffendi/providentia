LOVE this place. Food is incredible, and you can't beat their beer selection. My favorite thing is going after 10:30 and eating their SUPER cheap late night menu. On Thursday nights they also have a fun DJ spinning while you eat. Pig's head bruschetta, warm pretzels, kale salad, and oyster mushrooms are some of my favorites on the menu. And the flemish sour from Monk's is an amazing beer, they almost always have it on tap.
