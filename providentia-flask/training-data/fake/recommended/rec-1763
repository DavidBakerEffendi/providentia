On my trip to Philly I decided to try the Geno's and Pat's battle of the cheesesteak.  The neighborhood its in is adorable.  Now this is coming from a Southern Belle.  Pat's menu is simple: cheesesteak (no chicken), fries and drinks.  You order your cheesesteak at one window and your drink and fries at the other window.   Pat's Cheesesteak is chopped, not sliced like the competitor across the street.  I didn't find the bun full of meat like the competitor.  I have to say their cheese fries are decent and should be shared. There is only outdoor seating and a condiment stand outside.
