Both of my parents grew up in chinatown in Bangkok, and so Ba Mee is a dish near and dear to my heart. Ba Mee is a Chinese egg noodle dish that's done Thai style with lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, soy sauce, chili, garlic, and then some kind of protein and vegetable toppings. Larb Ubol serves their ba mee hang with Chinese bbq-style roast pork, yu choy, and crab meat. While their ba mee hang is not the best I've ever had (or Larb Ubol's best dish), it definitely hits the spot. Some of my favorite dishes from Larb Ubol: - Pad Ped Moo Krob (super cripsy pork - like cracklins) Â  - Pad Kra Prao (juicy as hell ground pork with chili, thai basil, and garlic over rice) - Som Tum Avocado (a classic but the avocado really makes it special) - Ped Larb Salad (gotta try the larb, as it's in their name) To all the uneducated / untrained people reviewing Larb Ubol who think they had "food poisoning," I'm sorry your stomach can't handle the spice. Please come back again when you've trained your stomach to handle real Thai spice. This place is NOT for the weak of stomach. Even level 3 spiciness (out of 5 levels) was almost too much for me. I love spice, and I have to go with level 2 spiciness if I'm going to be able to eat the whole dish.
