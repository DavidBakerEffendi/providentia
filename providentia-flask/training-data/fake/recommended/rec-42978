I have this thing where I think any bar or lounge with the name "Whiskey' in it is bound to be good. I dragged my friends here on this assumption and POW! I was spot on! The atmosphere was inviting and staff was friendly. I'm actually not even a fan of Whiskey although if I were I would have been in heaven. They have quite an extensive Whiskey menu. They also offer food which is a huge bonus! I didn't order food but if I did I would have gone with one of their meat & cheese platters to pair with the Whiskey. I just ordered a dark beer on tap, I don't even recall the name but it was delicious. My friend ordered some fancy Vermont Martini and it was amazing! I loved the dark, quaint atmosphere. Favorite part of all, it's attached to an Irish Pub with live music! Cha Ching! SOLD. I will definitely be back!
