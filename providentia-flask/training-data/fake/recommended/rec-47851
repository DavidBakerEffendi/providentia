I'm sorry to see so many negative reviews for Claire's... I have always had very positive experiences there! It is a vegetarian restaurant, so I typically favored their soup du jour, which was served with a little loaf of their yummy homemade bread. However, their menu goes well beyond your basic bean or veggie soup, as they have quesadillas, specialty salads, and many other items. My favorite thing to get is Claire's special cakes--with extra frosting (ask if you want more). The Lithuanian Coffee Cake is satisfyingly dense and not overly sweet--the sweetness mainly comes from the frosting. Their chocolate and other cakes are also good and dense--perfect for sharing.
