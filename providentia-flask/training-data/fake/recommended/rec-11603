Northern Spy Food Co has become my favorite restaurant in the east village. Came here a couple of times with the girlfriend once for brunch and twice for dinner. I highly recommend this place for both. I recommend trying one of the specials...both times I've been for dinner all the options sounded good. Had the special whitefish with butternut squash and veggies for dinner. I gambled on this - I normally do not eat fish but I figured I'd give it a shot at this place. My gamble played off and it was amazing! The blueberry crumble that was a perfect end to the meal if it's on the desserts I that night.
