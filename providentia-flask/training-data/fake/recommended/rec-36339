Restaurant Review: Poor service but great food Pros: Busy but not too loud.  Cool and slick atmosphere.  Neat and modern menu.  Tricked out yummy starters.  Not a huge selection ( 8 ) but very strong entrees including vegan and gluten free (if that is a concern.)   Cons: Basic server training required.  Long wait to be seated, poor initial greeting, lost revenue due to servers in ability to follow-upon empty drinks.  We were managing our server's attention. Beer selection ( a big deal in New Haven ) was a bit odd.
