This is one of my favorite restaurants in the 'burg. Hands down everything is good. The food is local, so the menu is never the same. There's always Â great seasonal veggies accompanying all dishes. The fettuccine is out of this world, very rich and creamy. The mushroom crostini is a great starter, and their fish is prepared excellently. They have outdoor seating in the summer, and if you can try to guess the name of the movie that's playing in the apt. across the street you win free shot. This is def. my favorite BK joint to meet friends and have a nice, low key dinner (although an occasional celeb will waltz in and land the hidden booth in the back). Pfffft!
