This place is really, really easy to forget. The only thing it has going for it is that it has a pretty choice jukebox. Well, I'm partial to jukeboxes with Dinosaur Jr. on them. But, in other news, I've recently heard that this place has opened themselves up to having live local and national acts on the second floor courtesy of r5. I think the only reason that Sean wants to have shows there is so that the cash cow keeps getting bigger and he doesn't know where else to stick those bands that the local "tastemakers" haven't read about yet. But no, I'm not bitter...
