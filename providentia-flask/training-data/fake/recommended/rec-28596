I'm obsessed. Bring lactose intolerant and health conscious it's nice to find a place Where I can eat anything. It's a bit pricier than your average deli but it's delicious and worth it. Â Get the coconut cacao crunch kale chips. Avocado shake, almond butter puffed quinoa chocolate bars. I plan my days around trying to eat here!
