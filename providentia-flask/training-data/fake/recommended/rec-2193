Fare has a nice atmosphere and prompt service but food is just OK. My bacon dressing kale salad was basically a bowl of fried kale, I couldn't taste any bacon, just heavy oil not balanced with acid. A vinaigrette dressing would have been nicer. I did squeeze lemon on it and it was tasty, but without it it just doesn't taste right. May go back and try something else...
