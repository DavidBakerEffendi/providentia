A NYC trip wouldn't be complete without the obligatory visit to the Halal Cart.  The food is pretty much the same as I remember it to be, but I made the mistake of going overboard with the red sauce in my inebriated state.  It was not the best decision I ever made in my life, to say the least.  These guys must be doing real well as they expanded and even took over the drink cart that's nearby.
