It's a good local neighborhood restaurant. Great for sitting outside during the warmer seasons & cozy to sit inside for the colder seasons. I have been here a few times and my fav meal here is brunch. PROS- outdoor sitting! Service is good & attentive.Tasty brunch menu (the lobster w.sriracha sauce brunch special is amazing & the eggs benny is good). I had a bloody maria & really enjoyed it. Dinner was good (my BF had swordfish w.eggplant ratatouille & liked it). Desserts were interesting (we tried the tattoos & strawberries). CONS- starter = crab & watermelon was under-seasoned The service is very attentive and you feel it from the moment you arrive until you leave.
