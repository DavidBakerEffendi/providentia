Oui! J'ai mangé la crèpe Parisienne.. and I loved it!  That crepe has swiss, ham, mushrooms, and an egg with the perfectly cooked yolk.  All on a buckwheat crepe, which for you gluten-free people, is not actually wheat at all. The last time I loved crepes this much was Juliette & Chocolate  when I was living in Montreal. I took my parents here when they were visiting me... the walk from the Lower East Side is only about 45 min. And totally worth it. The service was good, the room cozy but not crowded, perfect ambience, French accents, what's not to love?  The only thing was, it was a little loud... lots going on in one room, but not enough to keep me from enjoying it. We got here on a Sunday at 11:30 - it started filling up quickly after that, and then there was a line... so make that the latest you get there if you don't want to wait.
