Any place that gives me warm cinnamon-sugar coated donut balls while I wait for my breakfast is a friend of mine. The friendliness of the staff and the cozy diner feel make this place worth visiting.  The food won't blow you away but it's decent and relatively inexpensive (if you're like me and have come to view $8 as inexpensive for a couple of eggs and sides). The cornbread and homefries were great, but my eggs were overdone and the turkey sausage was just gross.   As for service, I don't think I've ever had such a friendly waiter at 11am on a Sunday morning. He actually seemed to be enjoying himself. I've also been once for dinner and was surprised at how tasty the  Billsburg Chopped Salad was considering its simplicity.
