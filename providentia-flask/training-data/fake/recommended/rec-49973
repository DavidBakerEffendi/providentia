I went here last night with a friend. Haven't been here in almost a year. Looks like new ownership. We ordered a chicken and goat dish with some rice. Food came in very late. The waitress brought the wrong food. She said here is your halim and the goat is to go. I said that's not what we ordered and she insisted we ordered that. Immediately started speaking Urdu or Hindi with me assuming I know how to speak because I am brown. Went back and spoke to the guy who took our order and he said they will bring the right order out shortly never apologizing for the mix up and serious delay. Food was average. I am thinking for $20 bucks together it was not bad. When we went to go pay, he rings us up for $42. He is charging $12 bucks for plain rice for two. I had a lacci that was like $4.99 and my friend had a soda, God only knows what they charged for that soda. Folks, it was a caricature circumstances. No way what we ate worth $42 bucks. On a good day $18 at tops and I am being generous. Service sucked. Attitude was the worst of it. I am on a mission now to make sure no one I know ever will visit this place. I know I won't.
