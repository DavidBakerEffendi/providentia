The food quality is very good and ingredients are fresh. The pumpkin soup and parafit were very good. We also ordered the egg in a hole and French toast and both were excellent. The Parmesan fries are out of this world and they are a must-to-order. I gave it only 4 stars because the service was a bit slow and somehow the nearby table got their food before us although they came 30 min after us.
