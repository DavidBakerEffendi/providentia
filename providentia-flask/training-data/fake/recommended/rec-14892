we loved this great find in philadelphia! you head into a narrow entrance and once past the bar and into this small restaurant, it feels like a special place. it's a fun and quirky atmosphere. it's hard to find great vegetarian food and it's also difficult to find a place that serves both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. add in the fact that there's cajun food and really interesting fake meats like pulled pork and sausages that you almost never find and this place stands out. we both had delicious comfort food, and i'd highly recommend it!
