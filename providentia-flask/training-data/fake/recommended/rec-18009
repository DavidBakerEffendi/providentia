Welcome back (and better than ever) Shaun Hergatt! The 10 course (really 11 -- that amuse was far more than a prelude) dinner was spectacular! I have a rating system that is based on how many courses make me swoon -- this was an easy count as they all did... and each dish was my favorite until the next came along. Â I love when a chef makes their food the star and lets fantastic ingredients speak for and amongst themselves in a new way that pleasantly surprises me... I also love the concept of the "best in season" menu which will keep it interesting and provide healthy dining that I can enjoy as often as I want... and I so want it often! :)
