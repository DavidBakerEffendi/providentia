On a whim while out for a walk with our 4 month old, my husband and I decided to see if we could get a table at Roberto Cafe on a Friday night at 7:30. Amazingly, they accommodated us at a 4 top, to fit our stroller, with no wait! We ordered the special, which was a pasta with assorted mushrooms and the fusilli with crab in a pink sauce. Both were delicious and portion size was perfect. My pink sauce was expertly prepared with a great harmony of cream to tomato sauce and there were some good chunks of lump crab meat (didn't taste fishy at all!) The mushroom pasta had a really nice mushroom flavor and the mix of mushrooms included porcini and shiitake, my fave. It was busy, but they were very attentive. I can't wait to return!
