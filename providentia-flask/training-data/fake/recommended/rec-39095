Dropped in this past weekend for a snack Â around mid afternoon, and boy, was I in for a treat! This place is usually crowded whenever I'm in the area, so never got the chance to test it out. Finally, we see a couple walk out, and my friend and I jumped in to grab that table. I tried the spicy chicken empanada, as well as the oven-baked mushrooms & onions. Both were divine, but I must say, the spicy chicken was my favorite! For less than $3 each, it's a nice snack, either sitting in or on the go. Definitely will drop in again when I'm in the area to try the other 50 or so empanadas/entrees.
