I love the look of this place and their presentation of food.  The chefs (you can see them working) really prepare it with art and care.  I go here often for lunch--I love their bento box.  The prices are very reasonable.  Food always looks and tastes great, servers are really nice, and the chefs are kind and smile when you connect with them.  Make sure to tip the chefs when you go--they have their own tip jar. I actually had a small bridal shower here too because I love it so much, and I was trying to stay healthy and eat sushi!  We had a nice sunny corner to enjoy and a very warm supportive staff who let us do our thing. The menu has many options.  We often order take out from here on weekday evenings.  It is such a great healthy option.  Love this place.
