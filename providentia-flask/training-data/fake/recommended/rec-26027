I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewers on this place- it's a gem!  I was most recently here with some friends for an early Saturday night dinner, but have also eaten here on weeknights, afternoons, and in all seasons.  Outdoor seating is cute in the summer, but I really love the cozy vibe here in the winter months.  Something about being surrounded by crazy amounts of kitsch (thanks to the awesomely kooky decor) just makes me want to settle in with a bottle of wine and some french fare and escape the winter weather. The crepes here are all delightful- the hearty buckwheat flavor stands up well to a variety of savory fillings- both classic and creative combinations.  But the pasta is also unexpectedly good.  The mustard chicken penne is a solid choice. Beyond the food, the number one reason I keep returning back here is the lovely staff. Everyone here is so consistently friendly and laid-back- something very pleasant to find in Williamsburg, especially when combined with a menu full of comforting and delicious dishes.
