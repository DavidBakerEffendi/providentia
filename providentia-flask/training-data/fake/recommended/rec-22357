My first meal during my recent visit to New Haven was pizza.  Not just pizza, but pizza from Pepe's.  The wait outside on a Friday night at around 8:30 pm was about 30 minutes and once we were seated, we ordered and got our pizza fairly quickly.  Of course we went with their signature WHITE CLAM PIZZA, made with fresh clams.  It was quite good, though the saltiness built up for us.  I loved the crust! When we were ready to pay the bill, our server realized that she accidentally closed out our bill.  Not sure why that was an issue, but she was very apologetic and offered us a glass of wine or beer.  We declined...but she wouldn't take no for an answer so we gave me a bottle of root beer for the road!  I love root beer. Looking around the restaurant, I would definitely like to try more pizzas from here!  Great start to my trip!
