We were looking for somewhere new to eat on Saturday evening and while going thru the Yelp reviews we saw this place with 4+ stars staring back at us. This was where we were going to go and away we went!. After a long an tenuous drive to Queens Blvd in Saturday traffic we finally exited on Queens Blvd and followed the service road with all its double parked cars and bus stops to 69th St where we made a quick right to Woodside Ave and a quick left a few blocks and we were there. Getting there may have been a challenge but finding a parking spot in this residential neighborhood was near impossible. After 20 minutes of up and back and almost ready to throw in the towel we found a spot!! They take rezzys and we arrived 5 minutes past 9 which was amazing. This little Gem of a spot is really Quaint...no, REALLY TINY!. When we walked thru the door we were kinda shocked by just how small this place is...maybe 5 table max. We were greeted by a really sweet daughter of Papa who was a pleasure. People were singing Karioke and we finally acquiesced and took part...The kitchen is a shoebox but they put out nice fixings. We started with Lechon Kawali which is Deep Fried Pork Belly and followed by Caldereta Goat, a stew and also a Fried Pompano...delicious and meaty! I brought 2 bottles of wine and they supplied plastic water cups to drink from. They use plastic dinnerware to eat with which was ok. We capped the meal with Halu halo PK style; a Filipino dessert with shaved ice, milk, beans, flan and iced cream...very refreshing. Was this a worthwhile experience...answer YES. You wont find another place like this anywhere. Be aware that this is a cash only establishment and BYOB. To our surprise, even though they serve no alcholic beverages, they charge $10/bottle corkage...a little unreasonable considering...This addition of $20 to the bill took it from reasonable to high reasonable. It was a surprise due to no posting of this policy.
