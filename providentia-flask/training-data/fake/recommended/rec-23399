Great food and clean atmosphere at this BYO.  There is a romantic story behind the husband (chef) and wife (hostess) who own the place, which I don't quite remember... anyway this is a really nice place to enjoy a meal with a date or with a small group of friends.  As others have said, no reservations so the earlier the better.
