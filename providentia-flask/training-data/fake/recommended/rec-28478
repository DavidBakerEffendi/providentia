Yelp has made the food cart famous.  Yelp and location.  In a midtown wasteland where no food establishments are open for the I-have-no-life-except-my-job, get out at midnight office folk, Halal is a Godsend.  I have never seen a line for a food cart like Halal's.  It's ridiculous.  I went there at 12 midnight on a Wednesday morn and the line was as long as the crack in the Liberty Bell.   The food is tasty, I'll give it that, and the white sauce is delicious.  I'd like the chicken sandwich better if they wouldn't pile on so much chicken.  I end up with half of it down my shirt anyway.  If I were a midnight office drone, this would be my dinner destination.  But I really don't see the point of going out of your way for it.  It's not all that.  Yeah, I said it.  And what?
