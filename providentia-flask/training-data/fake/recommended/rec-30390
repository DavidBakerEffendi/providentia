The food is SO good "it makes you wanna slap your Mama!!!". Seriously! Please open one in Courthouse Arlington, VA next to Sushi Rock. You guys will make a killing! The morning 80's mix is a great addition to the meal. Thanks to Erica for the great service and Cookshop for the mind blowing meal :) This experience has made my top five...
