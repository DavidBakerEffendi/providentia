650+ Yelp reviews - some say the best burger in NYC... that was enough to tempt this san diego kid to partake. the GRUB: - Bistro burger. no other way. im thinking 1/2 pound hand molded burger "ball" (cant really be called a patty) ... medium, with a little pink... finished under the broiler - add cheese and bacon. condiments available: lettuce, tomato, onion, mustard and ketchup. i wont lie, it was the best burger ive had in NYC. delicious and plenty filling. - Fries were standard fare... ok, but ive had better - they were served skinny with salt out of the fryer. - Its a bar, order a beer. the JOINT: - its a bar. so theres... a bar. and then theres a few tables to accomodate. but its nut sacks to butt cracks up in there when it gets busy, so be ready for the typical nyc shoulder to shoulder environment. - its kinda dark, and old englishy... its a bar. - they got tvs showing the soccer matches, just like a bar. - its in a residential, right on the corner - just like the neighborhood bar. - did i mention its a bar? the SQUEEZE: - $8 for the burger another $4 for the beer. - cash. - one bar keep, one food server/host, one busboy, one cook. FINAL SAY: "Bistro" is a stretch... but as a "bar", its the best hamburger ive had in the city outside of eating at a nyc/nj "diner".
