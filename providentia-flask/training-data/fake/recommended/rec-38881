This place is my savior when i forget to pack my lunch...  Which is probably 4 days out of the 5 that i work.  HAhhh!!! Favorites include: the salads!! the soups!! the chip and beverage selection!   the SERVICE!! - saved the best for last becuase it really is a well organized fast paced mecca of lunch items.
