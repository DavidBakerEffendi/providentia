Woow!       Been to Philly for cheese steak and actually like this better!    Like homemade.   The gravy is soooo good.....tastes like it's full of gravy master......if you don't mind a your sandwich a little soggy I would definitely suggest telling them to saturate it because it's that good!  Messy though...that's why they give you paper towels with it.....I don't suggest trying to eat it in the car on the go....The shrinp parm is excellent also...very fresh,they are constantly frying fresh things....not something I would normally order from a deli, but the quality here is amazing!    Of course I save this place for a special treat because if you eat this stuff to often I'm sure it would kill you.....you'd go happy though!
