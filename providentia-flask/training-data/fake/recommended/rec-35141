The place was pretty empty for brunch on a Saturday. The staff was very friendly, checking to see if we needed anything and asking how the food was. The food was good. I originally ordered the waffle with fried chicken cutlet (I'm from the south) and the owner came back a saying that their waffle iron was new and it wasn't ready to be used yet. So I got the pancakes. They were good, I could tell the batter was from scratch. The chicken had been fresh fried in a light seasoned batter. Together it was comfort food. $12 for the pancakes and coffee (or tea) plus $4 for the cutlet. Expensive in my opinion but it's Manhattan and it was tasty. The friendly service was icing on the cake. I will likely come back if I'm ever in the area again.
