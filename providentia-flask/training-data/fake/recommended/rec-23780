I hope to update this review in the near future as I didn't get an opportunity to try anything on the menu. Jake's advertised their grand reopening with cheap sandwiches and free beer. I should have known better, but I slipped up and let my stomach and wallet do the thinking for me. The promotion was supposed to be all day, but by 5pm they ran out of beer and food. On a day where you showcase your establishment, surely you would have made sure that there was enough food to handle the added demand, right? In the wise words of chuck testa, that turned out to be a big NOPE!
