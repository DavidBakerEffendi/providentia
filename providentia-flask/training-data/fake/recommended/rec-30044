What to add to nearly 1,000 reviews? I have to tell you that I can't stop thinking about the pork sausage and rice balls. Reviews were mixed so I wasn't convinced we had to order it but I'm SO glad we did. Mouthwatering flavors combined with unusual/awesome texture made this the most memorable dish for me. Pork buns (we got both kinds) ROCK. To me the apple dish was only fine, didn't love it as much as other reviewers. Chanterelles were a sleeper, truly great mushrooms augmented by the briny pickled quail egg. Start with the mango Sriracha cocktail and all will be right with the world. Allow yourself to be talked into the sparkling rose to finish off the meal. You will be glad you did!
