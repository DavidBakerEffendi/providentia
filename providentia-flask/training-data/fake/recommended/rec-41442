Happened by this place while strolling down Berry St. The inside is tiny and the white walls kinda freaked me out, but the artwork is cool and the super antique cash register is intriguing. I got the steak and cheese sandwich which was essentially a Philly cheesesteak on a brioche bun--not what I was expecting but omfg delicious. My bf's bacon cheeseburger was so juicy and both of our spicy & sweet potato fries were yummy. The staff (the like 2 of them) seems very nice and we waited hardly 10 mins for our food (on a Friday night!). Come here.
