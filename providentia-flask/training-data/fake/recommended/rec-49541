I LOVE this place. Went there for the first time tonight. There were 4 of us and we ordered the green machine, la fiesta, sweet tree, the roll of the month, spicy mang, and the nutty buddy. It was the perfect amount for us and it was all delicious. I think my favorite was the green machine. The people who work there were super nice too. The only thing that wasn't perfect was the space... we waited for 20 minutes on an early thursday evening and had to claim the open table quickly. There are only 3 tables available and each table has the capacity to seat 4. Nevertheless I am most definitely returning for more. I'm hooked!
