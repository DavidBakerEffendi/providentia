One of the worst services I have had in NYC.  Really disappointed to see all of the great reviews and we had such a bad time. Came in as my friend and I were walking by on our way to a different restaurant for her birthday lunch.  We were drawn in by the warm feel and the thought of delicious Italian food and red wine.  Just our luck, it was restaurant week and there was a prix fixe lunch menu.  My poor review is about the service, so I will press on.  We were doing ok until the waiter poured our wine.  He missed both glasses and spilled a large portion down the side of mine.  Fine, you're human... but he simply muttered an apology and walked away.  Didn't bother to help clean it up or bring back a napkin to wipe my glass, so I had to use the one on my lap.  We didn't see him again until the end of the meal and only because he forgot which dessert we ordered.  in the meantime, the busser brought out the food (which took a long time).  My friend asked for some grated cheese on top (recommended by the waiter).  He replied that there was plenty in there and walked away.  Our waiter finally stopped by to get our dessert orders, we asked him to bring the check with the desserts.  He did, but never came back to retrieve it and just hid by the bar until I brought it to him.  The restaurant was not that full and there was no excuse for the poor service. Such a disappointment for a restaurant that had so much promise.  The food was...just ok.  The veal ragu was like an expensive version of hamburger helper and the appetizers and dessert were middle of the road.  Definitely will not be back or recommend this place to anyone.
