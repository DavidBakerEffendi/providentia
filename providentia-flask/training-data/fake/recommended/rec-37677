I love Ippudo!  They always have a wait and I was reluctant to try at first, but finally did for a friend's bday dinner treat. We grabbed beers at the bar (have Kirin and Sapporo on tap) at $6 bucks a piece.  Chatted for the hour wait and between the people watching, good company, and vibe, the wait went by quickly. We were seated at a large communal table in the middle of the restaurant.  We ordered a special appetizer and the Miso Ramen and Tori Ramen. I love that you have options to add either a poached egg or hard boiled egg on top.  The best part is the "Kae-dama" that allows you to add an extra ball of noodles for only $2 bucks.   The only potential con I can mention is that the ramen is a bit pricey (it's only noodles afterall) and again, there are always LONG waits, but it's worth it and I still give 5 stars because the food and atmosphere are that good. Yum!  I"m a fan.  I'll be back.
