Get the Nutella French Toast, you will not regret! Nice and fluffy on the inside and won't make you feel like you completely stuffed yourself when you're done, because it's not dense. Tip to save money on coffee: Get in line, grab a complimentary cup of coffee as you wait, and remember to refill before you proceed to sit at your designated table. Tip to save time: Get your ass there before 10. I came at 9.30am on a Sunday and had to wait 25 minutes. So you can imagine how long the line is after 10/11.
