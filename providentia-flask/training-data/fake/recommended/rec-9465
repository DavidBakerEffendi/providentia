I've tried Ippudo's pork buns and Momofuku's Noodle Shop and this one as well, and I have to say, the steamed pork buns at any Momofuku's restaurant beats them all. It is like you are biting into pure butter until you taste it and realize it's the pork melting in your mouth. If nothing else on the menu appeals to you here at Momofuku Ssam Bar, just get a whole bunch of pork buns and you're good to go. I came here for dinner with a friend and in addition to the pork buns, we got the Beef Offal Stew and the Spicy Pork with Rice Cakes. Both are basically some sort of fusion rendition off of a korean dish. The Beef Offal Stew was kind of a strange taste initially, it's only because of the green onions and the gochujang flavor that started to make the stew taste more appealing and familiar, but it had a lot of tendons, beef intestines, and personally that didn't suit my taste. Basically it's a soup for $20+. The rice cake dish was a rendition of dukkboki, which was good and definitely tasted familiar but I don't know how I felt about the crispiness of the rice cake on the outside with the gooeyness of the rice cake itself. I think the purpose of that was to add texture to a dish that could come off as very mushy overall, however, I think there could've been other ways to add texture to the dish. For instance, maybe using larger pieces of pork instead of ground pork etc. I did appreciate that both entrees had a lot of greens to balance the heaviness of the entrees. Overall, the experience was pleasant. The wait wasn't too long (i think we got lucky though), but they do text you when your table is ready so you can go wander around East Village as you're waiting. I definitely would come back for the pork buns alone and want to try the "ssam" menu soon!
