Probably the best falafel sandwich I've had in my life. This place is consistently good too, and I should know, coming from someone who comes 1-2 times a week. I always get the falafel sandwich special which comes with fries and dipping sauce of your choice. The jalape√±o sauce is amazing! The fries here are damn good too. They have a subtle sweetness to them. I don't know how to describe them, but they're great. Expect a 5-10 min wait for your food, since it's made to order. And be thankful for that - it makes the food taste much better.
