Place Was amazing.. FOOD Was Excellent,  Ambiance Was to Die For. I was surprised with a Birthday party,  25 people on the pre-fix menu. Arepas were perfect,  rice, bean, pork, salmon, macaroni and drinks (sangritas) were all soo good. I have nothing bad to say about this place.  Even the staff was amazing.
