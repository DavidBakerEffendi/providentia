Love this place! Very casual feel but the sushi makes up for it. The place has an interesting menu that includes sushi, chinese american, japanese, and a touch of Thai. And yes BYOB - they have an ice bucket if you need it chilled! The pyramid roll is my pick here, followed by C-4 roll. These are beautifully crafted and taste as good as they look!
