This place is garbage and it starts with the staff. I wish I could like this place (as I'm sure other Old City residents do) because it is close to home but they do nothing right. Not true, they can pour beer, but do not eat here. Wings, burger, fries, salad, all the simple things you would think most places would get right - but they don't....'
