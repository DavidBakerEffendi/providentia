Disappointed is all I have to say. This place used to be one of my favorite places to grab a bite. Not the case after my last visit. The nachos that were once the best in the neighborhood have certainly lost their appeal (and their title to the short-rib nachos at La Calaca Feliz). The Italian Pork sandwich (which was not what I ordered, but what I got) was dry and bland. The fries were the saving grace of the meal, but not good enough to bring me back to eat! The beer selection was still great and I will return to imbibe, but it was the consensus of our group that the food quality has slipped into the inconsistent category. Oh, and the service could be a little friendlier too. Step up your game Bishop's, I know you have it in you.
