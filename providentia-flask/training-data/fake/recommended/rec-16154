I've been to Uva twice now; once for a birthday party in the room downstairs, and once for dinner with my sister.   Dishes I ate: Assorted bruschetta: all the bruschetta are delicious, but particularly the Sheep's Ricotta Cheese And Black Truffle Honey bruschetta. It's sweet, but grounded by the bread, so it isn't overwhelming or desserty. Cheese plate for 2: we had the Taleggio (soft and mild) and the Pecora Nera (crumbly--or even shardy--and tart). Our plate came with large, surprisingly seedless black grapes. Pesce Persico Alla Lagunare: this perch, in white wine with asparagus and tomatoes, was heavenly.  Very flavorful, and with a delicious sauce, it nevertheless seemed light and flaky. This is what I'll get the next time I go. Coste Di Manzo Brasate: these braised short ribs and the accompanying rosemary potato pancake weren't as dazzling as the perch, but they were also quite good. Tender and well sauced. I'll definitely be returning; this is likely to become my go-to restaurant for that neighborhood.
