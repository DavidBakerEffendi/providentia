Damn fine burger.  I felt as though I was at a classic barbecue from my childhood: big meaty burger, no frills bun, tomato, lettuce, pickles, and onions - all freshly cut.  I asked for Medium Rare, and it came Medium Rare.  I tossed on some mustard (in a handy squeeze bottle) and some ketchup and chowed down.  The topper?  Paper plates, baby! Burger + McSorley's Dark + shoestring fries = happiness Best burger I have had in recent memory, and they only charged me $5.50 for it!  Rock on! Warning: If you go medium rare - use a napkin - they are JUICY!
