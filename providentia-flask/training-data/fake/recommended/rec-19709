Mmmm solid solid. For chicken nugget lovers, fried chicken lovers this is your new spot! Sticky's offers chicken in 4 different styles (fingers, poppers, in a salad or in a sandwich) and can be prepared two separate ways - naked (grilled) or breaded and fried. The classic is simply that, either grilled or fried. Should you choose to step on the wild side, and I suggest that you do their handcrafted fingers come in a variety of flavors ranging ranging from wasabi to salted caramel (I'm told this is similar to chicken and waffles) to flaming curry. If these flavors don't tickle your fancy, no worries, they have an array of homemade sauces at your disposal. In addition to chicken goodness they have flavored french fries and veggie fries. The staff at Sticky's was great! The guy at the front saw us scanning through their menu and asked if it was our first time. He then went on to explain the different options they had as well as popular choices and combos. With his help, we decided on the fiesta and buffalo balsamic maple fingers (both naked), alongside an order of Cajun fries and green bean fries. Â  The fiesta fingers were smothered in a delicious Tex Mex mixture. The buffalo fingers were served on a bed of shredded carrots drenched in the buffalo sauce. Both sauces were flavorful and delicious, however I think I would have enjoyed them much more if they had been breaded and deep fried. Grilled chicken just screams healthy in my mind and the sauces/flavorings clearly are not - not a good combo for me. French fries were amazing. The Cajun seasoning was salty and flavorful. The green bean fries were great, they were lightly coated and deep fried with a tad bit of sea salt sprinkled on top. They were great alone and needed no additional sauce on the side. Overall Sticky's was a solid choice for an early dinner at an affordable price. Do keep in mind of the time that you visit, chicken is cooked to order and it does get quite crowded at times.
