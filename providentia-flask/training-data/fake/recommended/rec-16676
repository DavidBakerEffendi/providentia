Horrid service, mediocre overpriced food. Went in on a Friday afternoon around 3 p.m.: the place was empty except for one guy at the bar yet the female bartender couldn't bother to stop her conversation with the male patron to greet me and seat me. I had to go up to her to ask if they were still serving food. She answered in such a stuck-up snooty manner, I felt I was bothering her. The waitress came around and was a tad friendlier, though also had a bit of the I'm-too-pretty-to-be-doing this job attitude. She served me the food--bland and dry, not worth $20 for a lunch entree--but never came back to check on me, to refill water, etc. Maybe because the restaurant is so near the Tribeca Film Festival, these women thought they are movie stars and shouldn't be working in a restaurant?? Â I will definitely NOT be going back.
