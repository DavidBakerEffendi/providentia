Quiet little restaurant with excellent service. The chicken Katsu curry udon was very good. The udon tasted fresh, the curry was sweat inducing but I slurped up every bit. The chicken was very well cooked, moist, great crunch, and soaked up the curry perfectly. Not unreasonably priced, but by no means cheap. I'm not running to come back but I most likely will return!
