The chicken wings and service were pretty good, but my brother in law hated his pork loin entree which was recommended by the server.  It was a disappointment that not everyone enjoyed their meal.  My steak was really good though and my sister's filet was good too.  Kind of a shame that they couldn't be consistent in the entrees.  Probably wouldn't eat here again.
