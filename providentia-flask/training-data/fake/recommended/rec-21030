Honestly, this has to be the most bizarre experience I've had at a restaurant. Let's just go down the list here: 1) Sebastian is our waiter in the beginning and gets us our drinks 2) Suzy comes over and asks us if anyone got us anything. Yes. And then she forces us to order. 3) Sebastian comes back and Suzy yells at him for not getting our order. And then is like ARE YOU READY YET? 4) Another waitress, Jenefer, swoops in to take our orders and becomes our waitress for the night. 5) She holds our food against her body. Yummy for dishes that were underneath and touching her boobs. 6) She couldn't figure out if anyone ordered half a chicken. Um yes...and then she couldn't tell that chopped pork was chopped pork and not brisket. WTF? 7) She asks us to be her reference cause we work at the hospital she's applying to. What?! Do I even know you?! 8) Suzy makes a surprise appearance and asks if we need anything. Scary aggressiveness. 9) Jenefer tells us that gratuity is added, but we should tip more if we feel like it. Ok miss, you'll know if I want to tip more 10) She takes the change from our bills. For example, the bill is 12.50 and someone pays 13...we get no change back. That happened to 3 people. In no way was a lot of money taken, but come on, I'm pretty sure that's illegal or something. 11) The waiters seem confused all the time. I don't know. It was just bizarre events after another. The food was fine. Wasn't amazing and didn't blow me out of the water. The 1/2 chicken was definitely really tender. All the sauces sucked and couldn't even make it out of the bottle. The sides are huge. A good value for the money, but really not worth the headache of service here.
