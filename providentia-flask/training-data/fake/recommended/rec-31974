This place is great. I've been here a few times during the week and it wasn't too crowded, almost dead. However on the weekends it is packed out, I was even surprised. During that weekend night my friend was a little weary about the crowd and the wait, but we toughed it out and she loved the food. I've had a few of their schnitzels so far and they are great. The last time I was there I tried the Wiener Rahmgulasch and it was amazing, absolutely my favorite dish there. The waitress are also very helpfully and friendly. One was even was nice enough to help my friend and I pair beers with our meals.
