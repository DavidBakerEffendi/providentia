My girlfriend and I were driving up to Vermont and lucked out in finding Cisco's. We were treated to a wonderful breakfast! I had the enchiladas with eggs and my girlfriend had scrambled eggs with chorizo. Both meals were fantastic, and the staff was absolutely wonderful. Would definitely revisit there again.
