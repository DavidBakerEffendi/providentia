I'm on a quest for awesome burgers.  I've heard this place was good. So I decided to give it a try.  Well I must say...it's decent. Not the best but it's quality meat. With very little frills and you HAVE to love burgers to appreciate the no frills of the seasoning on the meat. Just pure beefiness.  The meat was cooked to order. A medium rare. For the price, it's not bad at all. And they serve McSorley's dark ale. So that's what should be paired with your burger!!
