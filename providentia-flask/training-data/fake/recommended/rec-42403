Got hooked on the Pizza Stone when it was in cramped quarters on Main St.  It has since moved to far more spacious digs on Pleasant St.  The new location has something of a hippy-vibe-meets-dorm-room feeling with prayer flags, posters, mismatched furniture and plates.  Come as you are, leave your attitude at home. There is a good-sized bar area with an excellent selection of beer on tap.  The only thing which disappointed me was that they do not have a growler tap.  One of the employees explained that the growlers require a tap set at a different pressure.  Oh well -- no taking a growler home with my pizza. On the few occasions we've sat down at the new location, the service was fair -- the waitress was OK, but last time she left to run an errand in the middle of our meal.  One of the counter guys took over. We typically order the everything and one additional pie.  Cheezum Crow (a variety of cheeses one would not expect on a pizza) was delicious.  The Baked Potato was a hit with all of us.  All pies are served on an impossibly thin, delicious crust.  Never once has it been burned, but always baked to perfection. If you're a NY pizza snob -- this is nothing like what you're going to find in NYC.  Born in NYC and raised on LI, I first entered the Pizza Stone with a slight air of contempt -- after all, how good could VT pizza be? Like Vermont itself, Pizza Stone pizza is a true original not bowing to convention.
