We've been here 4+ times and only had one item which wasn't top notch (an overcoooked squid platter).  I've seen the 1/2 price thing at other sushi places, so while stupid, it's not uncommon.  The $9.95 bento is a great deal.  Individual sushi starts at 1.50; ikura, my personal fave, is 1.75.  There are days where the little eggies practically sparkle from being so fresh - other days not so much.  My bro had a green tea tempura icecream which he claimed was fantastic, being severely allergic to dairy I couldn't try it but it looked really good.  There is one bathroom in the back, large and fairly clean.  The one bad thing:  the waitresses seem to be witches with a B.  The never great me and always throw my dishes on the table.  It's not just disinterest, they're actually smiling and happy when we leave. No more 20% tips from me, no siree.  Despite the attitude, the food's good and priced well so I keep going back. Note: they're closed 3-5.
