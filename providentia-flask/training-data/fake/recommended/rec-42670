My friend did not have to drag me to the food carts. All he had to say was Thai, Indian, Chinese, Mexican, Middle eastern, and Japanese food all on one street for lunch. Ok let's hit 'em all! POOR Friend! Never park on Cedar Street during lunch time. It is like 20 min. limited parking and he went over by a few minutes and was handed a $30 ticket! He was engrossed with the fried squid balls (delicious warm!) (from Peking Edo), garden rice (Taiwanese) (from Peking Edo) and chicken penang (nice and spicy) (Thai food cart). It was only about $5 per dish. The woman at the Peking Edo cart was very friendly and she explained all the dishes. Some were taiwanese dishes like the garden rice which was different tasting from the regular fried rice in Chinese restaurants. She said the owners are from Taiwan and they always throw out the leftover food after 2pm when they close. They don't want to reuse the food at the restaurant because it has been sitting out all day. Oh, I wish they only served Taiwanese food and hot pot (shabu shabu) at Peking Edo Restaurant. It was worth parking on that street nevertheless. He reparked and we continued on...
