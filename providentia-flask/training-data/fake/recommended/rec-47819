York St. Noodle House is a diamond in the rough. Nothing hits the spot on a cold day like a big bowl Asian noodle soup. I haven't had it this good since I traveled to Asia. If you like spicy - try the seafood coconut curry noodle soup. It's a lot like Singaporean Laksa. Add a little hot chili oil to kick it up a notch. Or if you're more in the mood for stir fry, try the spicy basil wok noodles.  Homemade extra wide noodles. Doesn't get any better than that! They also have dumplings (steamed or fried). Try the kimchi dumplings. And don't forget the bubble tea. I prefer the non-fruit ones like red bean. And the icing on the cake - you can easily leave spending only $6 or $7 per person, or perhaps $10 if you go all out with the bubble tea. Can't beat that !  If you live in the area, definitely give this place a try!
