Enjoyed this place with another couple on Saturday night, we were able to sit outside and that ws nice. Ordered muscles and they were really good, not Brussels goodbut good. Beer selection was ok, I have seen better. Service was bit spotty, sometimes they were quick sometimes it took them a long time to come back. I would drop if I am in the area but would not go out of my way for it
