I have to admit, I go here more for the food than the beer. The burger is perfect and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. One of the best parts is the bun. The bun is highly underestimated when it comes to judging a burger. It's a little sweet just the way I like it. Overall, I would compare this burger to a better version of the oh so famous Spotted Pig burger (without all the bullshit crap on it). It tries hard to impress, but not too hard, which is a common mistake in NYC. I don't need a pound of cheese and fifty condiments on my burger. What are you trying to hide anyway? The burger at Sweet Afton is basic, straight forward and delicious. A side of pickle chips with that finger licking good sauce never hurts either. While I love the food here, I definitely think this meal is perfectly washed down with a good draft beer too. Yum!
