I would def recommend this place but only once to see what the freaking hype is about, but it is not worth the wait especially if you have to deal with a bitchy hostess with a power trip.  The service is barely average, the hostess was not nice ( excuse my language but she was just awful, miserable and not pleasant).  As a hostess, you the first impression people have about the restaurant, you should make the feel welcomed since they are spending their hard earned money to eat there my money is paying your bills. It was so bad, people did not want to go up and ask her how much longer. Got there at 10.40 ( restaurant opens at 10) i still had to wait 2 hours, plus she got mad because i asked her for a menu and asked how much longer while we were waiting.  She basically told me with the biggest attitude i just told you 15 minutes ago, it would be an hour and a half, next thing she starts seating others that came after me.  I was ready to leave but the people i came with were dying to eat here based on the reviews.  Even the bartender came by and said you have been here forever, the lovely guy offered carrot cake while we waited and checked to see how much longer.  He was the only nice thing about the place.   Do not get me wrong, the food is pretty good but you can find places that serve brunch that just as good.  Try it once but get there at 9.30.  If you are hungry def, don't go there.  The food is def not worth the attitude and the wait.  If you must have it, go on a weekday.  Food is meant to be enjoyed especially if i am spending my cash there, and the hostess left a very poor taste in my mouth.   I will never ever go back there.  there are tons of restaurant in that area that are just as nice.  I worked hard all week and i just want to enjoy a meal and not feel rushed after waiting 2 hours to eat.
