I used to come to this place and love it but the past few times I've been here the experience has been less than desirable...the last time I was there their credit card machine wasn't working and he didn't tell me until after I put my order in, also the past few times I've been there the food has been subpar...disappointing, but now I'll just go to Otto's Tacos a block away
