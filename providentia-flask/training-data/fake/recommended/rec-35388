Food is good and seems like a trendy place. The various tapas dishes are tasty. However, in the middle of our meal, we suddenly noticed little mice running around and the workers there did little about it except to allow you to go sit upstairs. That's a quick way to ruin your appetite and end a meal. Why would I ever go back after an experience like that? I hope they have dealt with this issue since then.
