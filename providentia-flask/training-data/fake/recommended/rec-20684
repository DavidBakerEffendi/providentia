Came here for a late-night meal and ordered the Pan Fried Shrimp Noodle ($8). Food was delicious and portion size was huge. Each dish can be ordered with your choice of noodle: hand pulled, knife peeled, or rice. I would strongly recommend the knife-peeled noodles, which are wide, slippery and a mix between soft and al-dente. The restaurant seats around 15-20 people and ambience is lacking (re fluorescent lighting), so it's great for a quick meal. Will definitely return.
