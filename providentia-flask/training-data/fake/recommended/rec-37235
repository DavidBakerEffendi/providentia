We ordered delivery this weekend and it was the first time ordering from Fortissimo. Everything was awful. Their "famous" penne vodka had no flavor and the calamari smelled so bad that we were afraid to eat it. The pizza was ok, but I could have microwaved a frozen pizza with more flavor. With so many italian restaurants in the area, I suggest that you choose another one. Don't choose Fortissimo.
