Lunch; roast beef sandwich and a chicken salad.  Did not eat the chicken salad....too dark, looked and tasted old.  Roast beef poor to fair, I've had better frozen Banquet roast beef.  French descriptions do not improve quality.  It's been twenty years since I used to frequent this place.  I suppose nothing stays the same.  Dusty wall hangings, dirty floor.  What once was quaint is now just nasty.
