GREAT burger for 7.50 served on a paper plate with lettuce, good thick tomato slice, and onions on a simple but delicious bun cooked to medium rare perfection. It's in a part of the West Village no one can afford rent on streets populated by adorable eateries and bars and adjacent brownstone streets. There is no menu. They have a board with the various burgers (Bistro burger, with bacon, is 8.50). The fries are like the old McDonald's fries I remember from childhood in the late 1970s and early 1980s when Mom and I would go alone without Dad for shakes and fries only on weekends. It's not as air-conditioned as some stores and cafes but the ceiling fans blow hard and I was not uncomfortable. The bar is sunken in a cool way but I could take no pictures as my battery was deader than dead. If you don't want beer, drink soda. The iced tea is awful and sweet and they do not serve unsweetened iced tea. My burger was quite juice and flavorful. I disagree with Jonathan M: this is not a regular dive bar burger at all. It's not the David Burke kitchen or Waverly Inn 16 buck burger but it's really good and I though as good as Burger Heaven which is a lot more expensive. It also wasn't exceedingly greasy. NOTE: CASH ONLY.
