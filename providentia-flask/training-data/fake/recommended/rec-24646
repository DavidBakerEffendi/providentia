I like this place a lot: Nice, friendly service, very good food, especially recommend the babaganoush and the Lebanese red wine.  I thought the moussaka appetizer was OK (small, cold, and unspectacular), the beef shawarma entree was good (tasty, slightly dry).  Not a spectacular restaurant, but a safe bet for a good meal.
