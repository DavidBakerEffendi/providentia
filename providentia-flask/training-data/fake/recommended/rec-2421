I make better vegetarian cheese steaks than Geno's makes with meat.  Although my claim is not unique to Geno's because I find that most cheese steak places make a pretty bland product.  It is like they never heard of seasonings.  But I would never go to Geno's again simply because Joey Vento is such a bigot.  What a hypocrite.  The son of immigrants who is now against immigrants.  The influx of Mexicans, though, means there are a lot more choices for where to eat in the 9th Street vicinity anyway, and the Mexicans season their food so it tastes good.
