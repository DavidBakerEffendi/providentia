Put some kimchi in a container. Realized while standing in line that they had prepackaged kimchi that was better value. I was nice enough to say at the register that I didn't want the little bit of kimchi I had placed in the container from the buffet. Women at the counter says "they don't do that" and charged me for that little but of kimchi ($3.75) when I had like 4-5 other items. I know this is a little petty on both sides, but that was a move that a lot of other businesses of this type wouldn't pull. 1 star for you.
