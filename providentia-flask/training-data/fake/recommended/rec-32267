I'm not too familiar with the Fort Greene/Clinton Hill area, so this place came as a very nice surprise. What I found was: great food, a great place to hang out, and good beer. Also, everything is reasonably priced. And eco-friendly. If you're a vegetarian, the guacamole/queso sandwich is a great option: flavorful and filling. Also, the corn and plantains were incredible. In sum: all smiles, no complaints.
