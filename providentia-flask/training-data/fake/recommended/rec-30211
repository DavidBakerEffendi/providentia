They offer great brunch selections at reasonable price.  They range from $13 to $15.  You can choose main entree from sashimi, assorted tempura, grilled cod or katsudon.  Each brunch comes with salad, miso soup, 2 chef's choice appetizers and rice.  They offer free unlimited boiled eggs, free extra bowl of rice and Japanese style pickles.  Also, if you order one of these brunch sets, you can order soft drinks or cold tea for $1.00 only.  (Their regular hot green tea is complimentary.) I ordered grilled cod and was impressed with both quality and generous portions.  Also, it looked like they used premium quality rice.  It was so delicious and fresh.  I finished the meal with their dessert special, lemon jelly.  I wish I could've taken the picture of this.  It was so refreshing and served in a real lemon skin!   Also, I have to stress that their service is consistently attentive and friendly.   I'm so glad that I found this jewel in East Village.
