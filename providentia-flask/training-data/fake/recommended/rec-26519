Not only a great bar and restaurant, but hands down my favorite music venue in Philadelphia. It's a perfect size, though on nights of sold out shows, I wish capacity was a smidge fewer people as it can be hard to navigate. While the balcony seems to often put musicians at an unease, it's a great alternative to being floor level without the restriction of being 21+ to get up there (as with some venues). Great lighting for photogs, great local brews on tap with an ever-rotating draft list, delish food (try the Cubano sandwich or grilled cheese/tomato soup combo), again with a rotating menu. Dishes tend to not be consistent from visit to visit as the night's chef(s) decide how to prepare each meal, but everything has always been great. I've never dared try to octopus (a JB's staple), but I've heard great things. Not my first choice when I'm trying to eat on the cheap, but the atmosphere is wonderful. A very relaxed place, often full of 'hipsters', due to its great daily line-ups and moderately priced alcohol fare. Never a disappointment any night of the week.
