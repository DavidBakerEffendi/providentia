Beana's Para Siempre is a relaxing enjoyable family place to eat Mexican food.  They have games on the tables and TVs to watch any shows. The food is prepared and cooked at Beana's. They provided big potions to eat which makes it wonderful.  Personally, I would rather eat at Beana's than at any Mexican fast food place it is simply healthier. They have different special menu listed on the table that changes biweekly.  The servers are kind and enjoyable to talk with. Beana's Para Siempre is filled with decorations that provide a soothing atmosphere to eat. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. I also have read the other reviews both positive and negative.  I really do not understand why anyone would rate this wonderful place negatively. Yes give your opinion on the place but after your try Beana's Para Siempre but do not tell people not to try this place because you do not like it.  To me that is selfish and deceiving. I personally would like to have my own opinion than take someone else word for it.  My reason is that if I read the negative opinions telling me to stay away from Beana's Para Siempre and do it. Than I would never have found out that, I like and enjoy Beana's Para Siempre because that person who wrote the negative view does not like it. So please try Beana's Para Siempre out for yourselves and judge it for yourself instead of taking someone else opinion.
