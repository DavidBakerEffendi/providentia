Delicious food, great atmosphere, and friendly waitstaff. Went here for our last dinner in Philly, and the pasta was amazing. For an appetizer, we were going to get mozzarella sticks (they were cheaper than the fried fresh mozzarella) but when we told our waiter he insisted we try the fresh mozzarella, and boy was he right! It was served with spinach and ham and it was DELICIOUS. I don't think I can ever go back to eating regular mozzarella sticks again. My mother's spaghetti with her Chicken Parmesan was cold, she said, but my pasta with arugula was hot and amazing. We were so full we had to get boxes after hardly making a dent in our dishes. Definitely will go back again.
