Well, the line of people says it all!  If you're ever in the city and want to eat "cart food," this is it! It's a large portion for a small price.  I usually get the lamb gyro (they also have a lamb and chicken) with rice and it's SO good. The chicken, in my opinion, is bland and tasteless, hence why I go for the lamb. The white sauce and hot sauce are delicious and bring all the tastes together.  YUMMY! I think they have three carts now and the food is pretty consistent at all of them, so choose the one with the smallest line :)
