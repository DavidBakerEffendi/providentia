While this part of West 4th Street is littered with halal trucks and "new american" charlatans trying to rip off privileged NYU kids (though I don't necessarily blame them on that endeavor), The Cambodian Food Truck is a diamond in a the rough. When you look into the eyes of this man, you can see the toils of 1,000 years of hardship. However, his still puts on a smile and is very attentive to your order. The food is out of this world, akin to Thai food but a little heartier. Also, you can't beat the prices which are super low. Expect to wait a little while, for the great meal that is about to be prepared for you can not be created in haste. There is true love put into this food.
