Best pasta I've ever had.  The all you can eat deal lets you get 3 of Becco's homemade pastas for a really reasonable price.  And it was delicious! Our table shared the meatball platter, the breaded shrimp, and the prosciutto plate, all of which was fantastic.  I don't know much about wine, but my dining companion, who knows more, said the selection was extensive and appreciated the bartender's helpfulness and showmanship. The service was great, the atmosphere was inviting, and the evening was perfect.  5 stars!
