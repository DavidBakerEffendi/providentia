The night we were there the place was overwhelmed. Every table was full and people were waiting to get in. We were lucky to (unfortunately) get a table right next to the kitchen entrance so it was very noisy. The waiter was harried but was still able to pay a lot of attention to us. The food came out quickly and was cooked just as we ordered. I would have to say that while this place is no Capital Grill or Smith and Wollensky, the food was good, including the steaks, the wine list was reasonably priced and had some decent wines and the service was good, at a fraction of the price of the previously mentioned steak houses.
