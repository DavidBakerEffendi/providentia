Stone Park Cafe has a very special place in my heart and it kills me to write this review but it just had to be said. I first went to Stone Park for brunch about 2 years ago after coming to brooklyn for the first time the night before and inevitably crashing at my friends apartment. We had such a fun night and the brunch was SO delicious and we just had such a great vibe. Ah but then it was back to NJ where I was living at the time and we often reminisced about the brunch at Stone Park. When we moved to Brooklyn we were so excited to be close enough to walk to stone park for lazy weekend brunches. Unfortunately the good vibes have faded, the past 3 or 4 times we have been back have just gotten worse and worse and this last time just completely ruined it. *one thing I did REALLY like was that you could give them your cell # when you were on the wait list and they would call you when your table was ready! The service was terrible, we sat at the table for 10 mins before we even got menus, our server was so not interested in us at all, never asked if we wanted cofffee, mimosas, bloody marys-nothing, water glasses were always empty even as he walked by several times, my husband asked for a biscuit on the side as listed on the "side items" on the menu and our server informed us they were "out"-but not out of biscuits just sides of them! what??? Asked for ketchup when our meals arrived and after waiting 10 mins and unable to get Â his attention went to the bartender to get it. The music was way too loud and we could barely hear each other! SO unfortunate, the food is great but it's just such a terrible customer experience and with all the restaurants in the area it will definitely be a while before I try it again!
