Excellent food, great prices. We had octopus, clams casino, grilled sardines and bluefish in a caper, lemon, butter sauce. The grilled sardines were not impeccably fresh, otherwise everything else was. The bluefish was particularly delicious. BYOB keeps cost down. I would just note, chopped peppers do not belong in clams casino. We would definitely go back.
