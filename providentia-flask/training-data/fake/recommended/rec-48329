Still, after all these years, my favorite neighborhood restaurant, even as the neighborhood itself becomes nearly unrecognizable.  Delicious Austrian (not German) food,  laid-back South Slope ambiance.     Favorites (among many) are the tomato soup, the meatloaf (minus the jalapenos, which are some sort of Euro-hipster thing), the vegetable plate.  Serious entrees have been a hit with family members (black pudding, sausages, salmon); in fact both parents -- serious eaters and cooks -- have asked to come here again on return visits, partly because it reminded them of Europe, but mostly because the food is heavenly.  The chocolate custard should be a controlled substance. Movie and election nights are fun; it's nice that they have live music; the annual party with "The Sound of Music" is a thing.
