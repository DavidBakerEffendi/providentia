I like the idea of this place and te atmosphere is great, but the food was awful,  it seemed like everything was fried, tasteless, overpriced, small.  I really hope they do a complete overhaul on this menu.  We just need some good solid American food in the neighborhood that isn't just burgers. Please please fix the menu and cooking staff, really hope this place can turn it around.
