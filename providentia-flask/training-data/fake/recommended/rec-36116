I couldn't agree more with Anthony M's review on 5/20 (Except I didn't get the shot, so I'll leave it at ONE star) His experience so closely mirrored my own from his description that I am going to quote some of his words directly. "... I couldn't order drinks from the slags that's only wanted to help their friends. I mean I was sitting right in front of the well..." "...They would take drink orders from their friends on either side of me and never acknowledge me..." "...I've never seen such crap service..." "...You don't need to work in fancy place to be a stuck up, you can work in a Â crap dive and be just as lousy..." Being familiar with the industry, this is not the first time I've been here and service in itself has always been very sub-par. But this last experience was particularly alarming. I'm not exactly sure what the rationale was either. When a bartender looks at the customer, with the customer having a clear intent to order (as the customer is staring at the bartender), and then ignores the customer to carry on moving stuff around behind the bar. And then does it again. and again. and again. For 9min36secs (Yes, I timed it). Meanwhile the other bartender is a few feet away refilling his friends and chatting. And the customer just stands there waiting... Why? If anyone would care to offer an explanation. It was also well within operating hours. For a place where the industry likes to hangout, the service is somewhat terribly shocking. Sometimes if perplexes my why a specific spot can get so much attention from the industry despite falling short in such key areas of industry fundamentals. But in all truth - when it comes to Mother's Ruin - I just don't think they care. I don't think they give a shit. ...And it's their right. If the customer is not happy: "Well then, fuck off somewhere else!".
