I would give this place a better review because I like the food, but the staff is so rude.  They seem to think that because it's a small chic restaurant in the Lower East Side that they can be rude, and slow.  I mean, when I walk in and ask to be seated, it's always mad attitude about the wait...  Then, it's like, will you please offer me a drink for my troubles?  Finally when I get to my seat I noticed that the table was still dirty.  Like the kind of dirt that is sticky.  I could scratch a layer off the table.  NASTY.  I ordered a spicy margherita which is actually really good, but it came with a spring of bitchy hammer pants.  The waitress actually was like, "UM, WE HAVE TWO KINDS... SO WHICH KIND DO YOU WANT?" Sadly, I don't want to ever return.  It was sort of a regular place for me.  But, I'm over it.  I could spend $80 at any restaurant in the LES.
