Nothing fancy here just well prepared good quality food. Service was great and drinks were just right. On a good day I recommend asking for out for seating. Outdoor seating is great especially for large parties and even if it rains the have a large tent. Seafood was good Drinks were strong. Service was good and friendly. Everything we tried was good :)
