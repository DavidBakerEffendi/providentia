Have been coming here for years and love it. Not so much an actual place for dim sum, but compared to other places in Chinatown (both philly and new york), the dumplings are fabulous. I can't honestly say I've had anything else off of the menu that was much to write home about, but stick with the dumplings and you'll be sure to enjoy.
