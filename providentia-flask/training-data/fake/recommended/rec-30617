Went here on a Sunday night with some friends, having heard about the quality burgers and not much else. Well everything else was great, but the burgers were pretty terrible. Ordered my burger medium rare, got it medium well - same thing with the other two people at my table who got burgers. Other than that, it was a good experience. Service was friendly and pretty quick. One person at our table got salmon, which was solid. Got a side of brussels sprouts, which were good. Beer selection isn't bad, and the Sunday night deal of a burger and beer for $15 is nice. We got an apple pie sundae for dessert, which was also great. The atmosphere is fun - albeit a bit young and kind of fratty - but if you stay away from the overcooked burgers, it's a good experience. Next time I'm trying the braised short ribs.
