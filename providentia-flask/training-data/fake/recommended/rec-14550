Hagi is an awesome hole-in-the-ground restaurant hidden just north of Times Square... who would have guessed?  The hours are also great, the site says open until 2am (and that's full menu!) but I swear I've been there much later than that. The food here is great, very authentic (according to many people I've gone there with whom can speak to this).  The atmosphere is always quick and slightly crowded with plates being constantly delivered and everyone wolfing down food.  Besides the food there is a long list of Saki, but most people just go for pitcher after pitcher of Sapporo. The menu is LONG but some of my favorites are: Yakitori plates, the combo sets are a good starting place.  Tempura, out of the many choices I have yet to risk it and try the Pizza tempura... maybe next time.  Beef tongue (though it's been chewier than it should be on occasion), tontro (fatty pork), beef short rib, wasabi pork shumai!!!, the japanese pancakes, yaki sobas.  There is so much good stuff there, I always discover something new every time I go, I can't wait to go find my next favorite thing.
