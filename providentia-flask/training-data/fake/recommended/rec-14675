I tried the Bunna Cafe at a vegan pop-up in Bushwick. I had been wanting to try them for SO freaking long, but there was always a huge line at other events where they were (vegan drinks, brooklyn bazaar, etc). As a New Yorker, a quarter of my life is spent waiting in lines, so I try to avoid them as much as possible. the pop-up had only been open for an hour or so, but they had sold out of almost everything. What I did get was okay, but cold. I don't use any salt at home, so I actually very much appreciated that it was kind of bland, but I would have loved some kind of spice. I believe in them, though! 100% vegan Ethiopian food is a stellar idea and I'd totally support a storefront. HIGHLIGHTS: The dude was friendly. BUZZKILLS: Cold food, Lacking flavor.
