My first Philly cheesesteak experience was... underwhelming. I ordered the whiz without and as I ate it, I could only think of the various sandwiches I've had in my life that taste better (nearly all of them). The bread is bland, the steak is bland and the Cheez Whiz is.. well... Cheez Whiz. Arby's is better.  Potbelly is way better.  Subway is better.  And after I walked across the street, even Geno's is better. It's worth swinging by Pat's just to see the weird collection of people there (girls in prom dresses, tourists, bikers, probable gang members), but your food is going to be a disaster.
