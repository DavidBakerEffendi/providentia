I have been wanting to try this spot for a while and I was super elated that I finally had the chance to go. It's a great find in an unexpected street corner. The hospitality was wonderful and the food was delish....the pepper sauce I give it 3 thumbs up! I am Trini and I love spicy and their pepper sauce was true spicy and flavorful. Even though the menu is not long, there's something on the menu for everyone. I will definitely go back!
