After that spectacular Yelp event I'd been dying to get back here. It did not disappoint. I had a whole complete croque monsieur sandwich to myself, and it was every ounce the gooey cheesy bread indulgence I'd been craving - with ham! Absolutely perfect. And bonus, it comes with a free salad! The place itself is cheery and cozy with impeccable service. I really wish I lived closer and could check this place out more often - but then again, maybe I'm better off!
