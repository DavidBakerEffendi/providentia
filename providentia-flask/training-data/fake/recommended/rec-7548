I think this place is amazing. I'm a vegetarian and, typically, at nicer restaurants vegetarian dishes are an afterthought at best and often there simply aren't any vegetarian options at all. PRO's Zahav makes you take your time, which could also be a con if you're not into a 2.5 hour seating. But I liked it. It allows you to really savor everything you're trying and focus on the food and company. Also the hummus is by far the best I've ever had. I usually don't really like hummus, but their hummus is so mild. Their salads are also great and, again, while many restaurants don't put much thought into their salads, Zahav clearly puts a lot of care into salads. They're fantastic. The desserts were also worth writing home about; they were very rich and creative. I also recommend the brussel sprouts (in the second course) and the eggplant (final course). The manager or owner (not sure which) also took the time to ask us what we liked and didn't like. He seemed legitimately interested in our experience, which we appreciated. CON's The cocktails don't seem to have the same level of creativity and care as the rest of the menu. They were fine, but I've had better. Also, some of the dishes we tried were just good, not amazing, like the artichokes and this cheese and dates dish. It's also a little loud in the restaurant...it was a little hard to hear my dinner date sometimes.
