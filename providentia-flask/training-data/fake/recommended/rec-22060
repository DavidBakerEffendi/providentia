yes! yes!! yes!!!  all the POSITIVE reviews are accurate.  food is so solid and consistant.  ive been there 2x for dinner and once for brunch. its nothing too outrageous or unfamiliar.. just prepared soo well.  u gotta try it and ull kno what i mean.  so for the reviewers who gave a 1 star review cuz they couldnt get dressing on the side cuz of "dietery restrictions"  (btw they specify no alteratons to the menu ON THE MENU!)  or the ignorant one who didnt know what amuse bouches are and refers to them as freebie soup shots...just stay home.
