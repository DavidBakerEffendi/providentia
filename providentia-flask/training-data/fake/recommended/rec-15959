I'm with (almost) everyone else here-- the food was great, the $5 happy hour sangria was delightful, and the service was friendly. I knew we'd made a wise choice when I arrived to meet my friend at 5:30 and the place was already packed.  Yes, it is small on the eat-in side, but they make the most of the space. Service lagged a little bit, but considering they had only two (super smiley) people handling all orders and clean up for a packed house, I think they did a great job.  Will very definitely be back.
