I have been here about a dozen times in the past year and finally feel compelled to write.  The lowest rating I give this establishment is the service time,  ironically the slow point is not the kitchen, it is the bar.  Recently on a Saturday evening, our party of 5 placed drink orders which took over 15 minutes with kids soda orders taking over 20-25 minutes.  The trend I have seen is the servers always apologizing for service. Once past the bar service, the food is typically very good, and came in under 15 minutes of ordering, pretty speedy.  The atmosphere is always nice, warm with a pleasant Irish/English feel.
