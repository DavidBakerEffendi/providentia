I love eating large pretzels, big like catcher's mitts and dipping them in mustards that make my nose run and drinking beer I can't pronounce the name of from a mug that would make a viking feel at home.  The vibe is relaxed, the music chill, so much so that I want to drunkenly urinate on the carpet of rocks that sit under picnic and ping pong tables but they have a trough in the men's bathroom for that.   I'm not being sarcastic.   They have fire pits in the winter where you can roast smore's above burning blocks of wood.  It's like like going camping in Germany if Germany was in a cleaned up, burnt down warehouse with windowed garage doors for walls and scattered games of Jenga.
