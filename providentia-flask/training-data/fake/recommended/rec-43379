I ordered the grilled chicken with lime and garlic sauce. The food was served fairly quick for a sit down restaurant, but wasn't worth it. Yes, this place is fairly inexpensive (with tip my meal was $11), but in this area there are MUCH better places that are far cheaper. The chicken was dry, it was some sort of unrecognizable dark meat that did not taste very good. I also tried some of the veggies and soup and those were disappointing as well. Definitely not of note. If you're in the area, skip Mooncake - there's better food close by.
