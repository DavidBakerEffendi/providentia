I had the original Hakata Ramen with added pork belly.  I really like the texture of the noodles, the broth was pretty good, and the pork belly was super fatty (YUM).  I really like the fact that they make their own noodles in house.  My friend and I only had to wait for about 10-15 minutes to be seated.  I'm not too sure I'd wait 45-60 minutes for a table.   I think I've also been spoiled with really really good ramen in LA.  The Torrance/Gardena/DTLA has amazing ramen.  Ippudo would probably be the only ramen place I'd stick with when I'm back in NY again; that is, if I can get a seat within 15 minutes.
