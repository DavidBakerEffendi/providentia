YUM! What was that? That smell? Delicious! Is that? No, it can not be, my favorite! Tacos! Watch how it oozes flavor! Dallops of sour cream! Carne Asada, the steak! Is Carne Asada another name for heaven? Lettuce! Fresh from Earth! The shell! Made from Maize by hand, is perfection! Ground chiles mixed with spices, for divine flavor. Are these pieces of heaven not the second coming a certain savior? No human concoction surpasses For the inventors are not from this dimension! Were tacos the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden? For Adam and Eve it was the ultimate guilty pleasure. So next time you are feeling down and depressed try a taco from Loco Pez.
