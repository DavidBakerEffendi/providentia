The interior is as colorful and eye-catching as the outside banner. This really is a place every vegetarian should check out. It's affordable and delicious. I'm all about "fake meats"... From veggie corn dogs, tacos, and cheese steaks, this place has it all! Plus, they have pear Woodchuck!! If you haven't gone for the food yet, trust me, it's in your best interest to try it out!!
