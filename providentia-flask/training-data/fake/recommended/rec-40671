Yum-may! Went here for dinner on a Saturday night. Reservation is definitely required. Expect to wait even if you have one. Don't fret though, the food is worth it! Oysters were fresh and delicious, and my pork chop was perfect. Satisfaction all around the table. The drinks are unique and are pretty enough that at least one in the group is going to bust out the phone and post one to Instagram. Despite the wait for the table, the service was excellent. Ambience is bustling, but cool rustic/hip decor. Saw everything from couples on dates, to families, to friends out to dinner. Overall a great grub spot when you are looking for something a little special.
