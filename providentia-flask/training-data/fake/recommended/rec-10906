Vacationing in my own backyard...ahhh what a pleasure!  The staff was great especially our waitress #12, Rebecca; she rocks!  I've heard from friends and read the reviews. So, that being said, I came expecting to wait a while for my order, but the wait was fair, actually pretty damn short!  I was absolutely shocked. Being shocked, I called over our super sweet waitress, #12, and shared my expectations. She knew right away that my expectations were due to Yelp. She continued to share that the restaurant, especially the kitchen staff, was working on putting some pep in their step! And, they sure did that afternoon!  The food was pretty good and the drinks were typical.  The view and the walk along the riverbank was super!! Boy do I love my NoViO just a wee bit more for suggesting this place despite the negative reviews!
