Amazing. Went on a Sunday night with a reservation, no wait. I almost placed a second order of the truffle tagliatelle appetizer, but restrained myself (I don't think I've ever had this inclination, even in Italy). Roasted chicken, fish (can't recall, was a white fish with root veg mash), brussel sprouts were all fantastic. Concord grape pie with sour cream gelato, insanely good (I scraped the plate and my husband searched for crumbs). Our server was great too, with crafted explanations, and giving us tastes to make sure we liked our glass orders (I don't understand why all places don't do this). My husband mentioned in passing conversation with the waitress that it was my birthday, and the dessert arrived with a candle; the waitress and busboy wished me a happy birthday when he brought it. Attentive services from waitress and support staff. Customers seem mostly regulars or Â in the neighborhood. Comfortable cozy environment, close tables, just above casual. Cannot wait to go back.
