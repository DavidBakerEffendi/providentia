Very cute spot to grab a bite for lunch. The owner was very friendly and even threw in a chocolate chip cookie with my order just to be nice. The avocado sandwich was very good- served on toast with chunks of avocado and veggies in a chipotle-esque dressing. Worth popping in if you're in that end of LIC!
