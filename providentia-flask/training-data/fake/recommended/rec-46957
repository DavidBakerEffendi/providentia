Had the halloween special Jennifer's Body, an omelet with goat cheese and an assortment of other delights. The omelet and home fries were delish, the service was friendly and the ambiance was a delight. Only complaint is that they find a jam or jelly that isn't smuckers, that would have taken this experience from a four star to a five star. Worth a stop by!
