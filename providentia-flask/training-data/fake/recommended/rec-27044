The host and our waiter were both friendly and accommodating. Intimate dining room with a fun feel. Was packed on a Saturday, however that did not seem to faze the efficient staff. My date and I split the little neck clams, "costanera" ceviche and roasted chicken w/salad. I would recommend all. I'm a sucker for ceviche and it did not disappoint.  Clams were fresh and tasty. Chicken was accompanied by two dipping sauces, however I didn't even use them because the salad paired perfectly.   Definitely would return to try different entrees and other ceviches.
