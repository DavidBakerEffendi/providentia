came here for dinner last night, and loved the experience. i think i was sold on the restaurant the second we walked in. next to the hostess' table, they had a living room type set up - couch, side tables, and coffee table, as a really cute little waiting area.   we were able to get a table outside, which was awesome, given the warm weather last night. our server recommended a local wine from long island, so we got a bottle.. which turned into two. pinot blanc. highly recommended! the food was superb. now that i think about it, we had a lot of variations of pasta: ravioli of goat's milk ricotta and swiss chard (i swear, that's how its written on the menu), polenta ravioli with sea scallops, and ricotta and spinach gnocchi.  we also had the mussels, and proceeded to ask for numerous rounds of bread (which came so warm and perfectly toasted) to soak up the yummy butter sauce. dessert... i had a pot of creme... with chocolate. and salty almonds. yum. will definitely make my way back here.  this could be a great lunch spot if you work in the area and the line for shake shack is too long.
