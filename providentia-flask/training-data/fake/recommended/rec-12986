Walked in stayed a few minutes, but had to leave, as the AC was not working.  Incredibly loud from happy hour crowd.  Small menu, could not really find anything we wanted to eat.  They have drinks on the menu that are not available, as they are "Winter drinks".  If that is the case, then change the menu.  It is late May.
