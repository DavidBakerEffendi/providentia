I came back today and loved the 'coffee smoke rub' on the short ribs. The squash adds a good sweet balance to the smoke on the meat. The service is awesome plus the atmosphere is super fun. It's definitely fun to listen to happy music while watching the movement on 6th Ave, and enjoying the smoked short rib tacos.
