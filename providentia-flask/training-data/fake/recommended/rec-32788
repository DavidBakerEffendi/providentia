Went for the drinks.  The bar area was uncomfortably crowded and so my group of friends and I went to a table.  I had never been anywhere that required us to give our cards to the waitress first before we were allowed to order (this included both those who were only getting drinks and those getting drinks and food).  It then took her over a half hour to get us our drinks.  Because she had some miscommunication with people siting at the other end of my table, those on my side could not leave when we were ready to since she would not give us our credit cards.  I would go again earlier to try the food one day but never again for drinks. Great music. Bad service. over priced drinks.
