To be fair, I have only been to Rose Water once, and this experience was well over one year ago.  So, the information that follows may or may not be reflective of the restaurant now, but this was my experience: I was excited to find a restaurant in Park Slope that reflects my beliefs of organic, local food, cooked with care for a limited number of tables.  That often produces the best and most honest food, and that's admirable. However, I can still remember what I ate - braised pork belly, which was truly awful.  Our food arrived at room temperature, and my impression was that the people cooking the menu were fresh out of cooking school.  That means while the food COULD have been good, inexperience was the kitchen's dominant flaw.   Perhaps this has changed.  But after spending $100 on a most mediocre meal, I'm not willing to find out.
