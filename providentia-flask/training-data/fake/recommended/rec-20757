Piccoli is officially my new favorite restaurant in Park Slope.  Came here for dinner last night and was completely blown away by their food.  A friend who lives in the neighborhood loves this place and recommended it, but I didn't think it would be this good.   The restaurant is small and intimate with a nice ambiance.  Once you walk in, the delicious smells from the kitchen make you automatically hungry.  My companion and I ordered the brussels sprout salad and the grilled calamari to start and both dishes were super yummy.  The salad had just the right amount of dressing and the almonds added a really nice texture.  The calamari was grilled to perfection and the portion was not skimpy at all.  I could have eaten the entire plate of calamari if I wasn't sharing it. For the entree, I had the seafood risotto and my companion had the mushroom fettuccine.  The seafood risotto was probably the best risotto I've ever had.  It was creamy and tasted of actual seafood.  It was cheesy without being overwhelmingly heavy.  My friend's pasta was good, but not even close to being as good as my risotto. To end our meal, we shared the tiramisu which was the perfect dessert to end a fabulous dinner.  The dessert was not too heavy and had the perfect amount of cream and coffee flavors. Piccoli Trattoria was near perfect in my book and I am craving the seafood risotto just writing this.  YUMMMMM!
