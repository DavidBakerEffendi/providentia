Watch-out!  There're a lot of imitation Halal Carts! On the way to this cart, one of the imitation carts called out to me saying they have the same food anyways, so why not eat their's?!  =) Just make sure to go to the one right in front of the Hilton! (or else ask the locals-they'll point you to the right one) I went after a Broadway show, around 11 pm, and there wasn't much of a line since it was starting to rain.  But a line usually forms for this cart around midnight. I got the chicken rice plate, which is $6.  Use lotsa white sauce!  The red sauce is soooooo hot, so use it sparingly! It's a pretty heavy meal, so I had to walk it off a little afterwards...
