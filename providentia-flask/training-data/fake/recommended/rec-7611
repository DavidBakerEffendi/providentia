Hey, we all need a place to take a discerning friend for a fancy coffee! The desserts are all perfectly good but honestly, the only only reason to visit the cafe is for the pseudo- European atmosphere. If a luxurious decor and snooty waiters enhance your enjoyment of a $9 coffee then this place is for you! The service is stern and efficient. Don't expect to linger over your drink - the waiter will slip the bill on your table the moment your plate is cleared. Â  Expect long waits during peak times. However, there are often free tables in the second cafe in the basement. While lacking the beautiful carved wood panels of the main cafe, this room as a cool early 20th century modernist vibe. Be warned: the chairs in the basement are small and confining. If you or your guest has a generous bottom, sit upstairs!
