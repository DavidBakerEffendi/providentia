I won't go into the play by play because the detail of the food has been covered very well here. I had the tasting menu Daniel M. had - his notes are spot on. What puts it over the top is the service - very attentive and well timed (who offers you pez after dinner?) and the price point. I love this type of regionally specific food you never find anywhere except in New York. Pig knuckle tasting menu indeed.
