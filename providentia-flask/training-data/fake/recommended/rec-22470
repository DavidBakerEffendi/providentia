Their German bier selection is vast.  Augustiner Edelstoff is my measure of a good baseline German bar and they have it and much more.  The atmosphere is comfortable with kind staff. The food is bar food -- don't mistake this for a high-end German restaurant.  Have some more Bier, now it's better.  Philadelphia, you don't know how lucky you are.
