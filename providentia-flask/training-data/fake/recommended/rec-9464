For the price, the variety and the portions this spot is tough to beat. I was so impressed with the variety of toppings, the freshness, the textures, the flavors. The falafel bowl with fried eggplant and Israeli salad was full of flavor and nice and juicy, just the way I like it. It easily could have (and probably should have...oops!) fed two.
