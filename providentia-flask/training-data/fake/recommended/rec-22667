On our quest to try one new place a week, we decided on BBC. Inside it's quite cozy and charming, so the atmosphere is actually quite nice. It's small, which is great, because it means it doesn't get too loud. We started with beers and dumplings. The beer was quite good and we thought the dumplings were very tasty---a little too greasy for the both of us---but flavor-wise, they were spot on. The burgers? Well, they were interesting. It was definitely nice to try something different and it tasted good. But for $15, the burger and a little salad made the plate a little sad. I actually didn't care for my burger so I ended up swapping the other half with my partner-in-crime, whose burger I preferred. I guess we're not beet lovers because neither of us cared for the ketchup. It was definitely worth the try but I'm not sure I'd return. Maybe, but not for a long time! (I'd go broke.)
