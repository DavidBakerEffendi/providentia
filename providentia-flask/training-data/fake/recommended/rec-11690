Great place for brunch. The only downside is they don't take rezzies and the wait is always long. My friend showed up around 11am to put our name in, and they were pretty spot on with telling us the wait would be 1.5 hours. We had no where to be and it was beautiful out, so we didn't mind waiting. Inside the decor is really cute, and the tables aren't scrunched together so you can actually hear yourself talk. If you get a table with a drawer... open it up! So many random notes inside. Our food came out SUPER fast. The pumpkin waffles with apple butter were amazing. Brunch also included a choice of an apple cider mimosa, which was so perfect for fall. I like that the menu caters to the current season. (Fall food is the best!!) I paid a little over $20 for my meal, which included a drink, plus coffee. Definitely reasonable, although if you order an alcoholic drink separate from your meal it's pricey at $10.00. Not my number one pick for boozey brunch but I'd definitely come back... if I could convince someone to show up early and put our names on the list! :)
