I sat at the bar tonight, nice service, reasonable wines by the glass. The bordeaux was good, the cava was average and expensive. Gnocci was amazing, fuffy clouds in a rich broth and the escarole in it was even still a little crunchy, perfect. Crab burger - killer. Bread must be home made, it was very light, almost like a fluffy dumpling. Lot's of crab and very good fries....almost triple fried if I had to guess. It's a great spot which will serve brunch soon too....
