We waited for two hours and it was worth it. We ordered chicken and pork steamed bun appetizers which were awesome. Very flavorful and nicely presented. The ramen was delicious. We will definitely return. The service was also just fine. We had seats near the kitchen and noticed most of the cooks were not Japanese, but they were clearly well trained. Recommended... Just, don't arrive at prime dinner time (e.g. 8pm) unless you bring a full case of patience with you.
