Soup dumplings in Philadelphia?  My how this city has changed.  And to see that this is the SECOND one!!!  I came here by myself one Saturday and was seated right away by the bar area where they make boba drinks.  The rest of the restaurant was packed to the gills with a line of people out the door.  I got the crab meat soup dumplings and the regular pork ones.  To be honest, they were not the best by any means but am just glad that there is a soup dumpling place in Philadelphia period.  There's definitely a huge increase in Chinese food options since when I lived here five years ago and it's awesome.  The food was cheap and service was friendly, especially for a Chinese restaurant.  They are cash only with a sketchy looking ATM conveniently located outside.
