Four stars because it is fun! I don't like beer, onions, or sauerkraut, so Frankford Hall is truly not my cup of tea. However, it is my bf's new obsession, so I find myself there often. The space is set up nicely, but it is bare bones inside, people. What makes this place fun is YOU. There is ping pong, UNO, Jenga, a fire pit for roasting s'mores and TV's for watching games. If you get more than four people it often turns into a party at your table and that seems to be celebrated here. If you do not drink beer you will have to suffer with $9 wine in a very small cups, while your friends walk around with extra large mugs of beer for $7. The veggie burger and fries are good. The hotdogs are meh. I am always amazed to see young children running around, but I think it is great because people with children can come out to an adult place and have a blast with children in tow.
