Went here for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend. Atmosphere and service are great. We were seated outside. The food was fresh but not up to our expectations given the reviews. The grilled octopus was a disappointment. There was no flavor and it was just greasy tasting. I am not even sure if they used the proper olive oil since it was lacking in all flavors. If you want to know what good grilled octopus is supposed to taste like..go to Varka restaurant in Ramsey. I suggest the chefs in Princeton make a reservation. Also, authentic calamari is floured not breaded. Overall it was a nice night but I wouldn't go here again.
