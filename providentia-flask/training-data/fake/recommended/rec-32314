I actually found this place because I was looking for a recent article listing two other joints' competition for "Best Burger in Philly". Instead of finding the article, I found Yelp, listing Sketch as #1 in the city, so I took it upon myself to find out how good they were. First thing I noticed was the family atmosphere. It was almost like being in a friend's kitchen for a meal. I was greeted warmly by both the female who took my order (based on conversations I overheard, I think she might be the owner) and the gentleman cooking. As far as the food goes, the fries were incredible, and though I'm not a fan of dipping sauses, I tried what the lady said was its most popular, and I was pleasantly surprised. That was the first time in my life I was tempted NOT to put ketchup on my fries. The burger was absolutely huge, and the mean was incredibly tasty and juicy. That thing definitely had to be over a half pound! For the quality and size of the burger, in my opinion, it is WAY underpriced! Sketch will definitely be part of my weekly "rotation", and next time I stop in I have to try the shakes, which I heard were outstanding as well. GREAT FOOD, GREAT PEOPLE, GREAT Â PRICE....This place is a MUST for burger lovers!
