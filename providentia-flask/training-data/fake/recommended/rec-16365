I came with my boyfriend and a friend - this place was great! My only detraction was the price - a little much for everything that we ordered. The wine selections were great, and everyone enjoyed what they ordered. I had the steak tartar which was delicious and deceptively large. The entrees are a la carte, so careful! My boyfriend had the ribs, and we ended up ordering a side of (truffle) fries to go along with it after our meal came out. To start we had the pate - enormous! There were three of us and we were almost full afterwards! The bread was, as everyone has noted, top notch. Decor and ambiance was great, and the service was friendly. Might come back if I'm in the area and in the mood for french.
