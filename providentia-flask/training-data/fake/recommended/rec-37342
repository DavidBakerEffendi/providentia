I've been living in the neighborhood for almost a year and finally decided to stop in for lunch with my brother. The food was good, but the service was AWFUL. To me good service and good food go hand in hand. Not happening in this case. These young girls were too busy talking about God knows what amongst themselves that tending to customers was not important. Actually a gentleman sitting at the table next to us told one of the girls that I had asked for my check and was still waiting. This place IS NOT worth the aggravation. No more Panino Rustico for me.
