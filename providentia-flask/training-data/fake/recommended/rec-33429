I've had four meals at Olea on three different trips to NYC and each one has been about the best meal of the trip. The wine list is fantastic, but every trip we find ourselves going back to the Lambrusco that's so much better than anything we can find anywhere else. The service, starting with the host, is top-notch and warm. They do everything they can to make your meal an A+. We especially like that when you ask for their suggestions or favorites, they always offer the perfect dish. They've never steered us wrong. I've had fish just about every way they do it and each one is damn near perfect....so it's hard not to get some for of fish each type I go. I've also been to Olea for a couple holidays (New Year's and Valentine's) and the chef's menu for each of those days was a great treat for the special occasion, so anytime I get the chance to put myself in their hands, I do it. It's damn near perfect...and when I go back to NYC in a couple months it's the only restaurant I can say with all certainty that I KNOW I'll be re-visiting.
