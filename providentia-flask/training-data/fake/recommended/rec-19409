I'm really torn between 3 and 4 stars because I had a nice time here but it's really not my scence. I went with 4 because my lemony gin drink was really good and the farm platter was yummy. It was on the menu under small plates but it was anything but. The bartender was friendly and knowldegable about the drink and food menus. Another reviewer called it pretentious. I don't think it's pretentious, it's just not a laid back type of place to the naked eye. Once you get in and chill though it's fine.
