Let me start out by saying I've had plenty of cheesesteaks during my college years at Drexel.  Shout out to Abners! Not sure why this place is getting such high reviews.  I will admit this place was busy on the Tuesday night I went. The place is very small with 9 or so counter seats and two or three outdoor tables . First the cheesesteaks. The bread was nice and soft, the sandwich was a nice portion as well.  However, meat was not seasoned at all.  Someone throw in some salt and pepper! The cheese was mixed into the beef. Sorry, i like to see my cheese, either spread onto the bread (Whiz) or slices on top of the meat. Bottom line, the sandwich was bland. They did have a nice offering of peppers, spicy cherry whole or chopped and sliced banana. Of all the reviews I've read no one mentioned that they do not sell fries! WTF? How hard is it to serve fries? That is a huge miss by these owners. Easy way to add another $2 to each order. The only reason I gave this place a three is because they do serve beer, the peppers made the sandwich acceptable, and the bread was good. Not slamming the joint, just telling it like I it was.
