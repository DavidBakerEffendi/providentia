Awesome, delicious brunch place! I finally had the opportunity to eat here, and it was an excellent decision. I was in a party of 4 on a Saturday afternoon at 1:45pm, and was seated at an outside table immediately. What! I easily expected to wait 20-30 minutes, so this was a pleasant surprise. I ordered the Eggs Benedict brunch special ($14), which comes with a small ~5oz glass of freshly squeeze OJ, and a choice of a cappuccino or tea. The eggs benedict was delicious! Two perfectly, neatly poached eggs, each resting on two(?) slices of canadian bacon, a smear of hollandaise sauce, and one half of a heated english muffin. It was served with a side of really tasty potatoes. The hollandaise sauce was simple, creamy, not too exciting, but still a perfect accent to the dish. Nothing here was too salty, and I found myself scraping every bit of food off my plate. Oh, and the OJ was delicious. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive, and the prices were moderate. Not cheap, but definitely reasonable. The brunch cocktails are $6 each, and before you ask what the "Sparkling Pomegranate" is, it's champagne with pomegranate juice and a whole fresh raspberry sitting inside. I would absolutely suggest Cafe Orlin for brunch, and their cappuccinos are great. Besides, who doesn't enjoy the St. Mark's area anyway?
