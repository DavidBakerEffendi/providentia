I went to school in Syracuse, so I was elated that a Dinosaur BBQ was coming to my neighborhood here in Brooklyn. I was not disappointed! The vibe is a bit different from the original in 'Cuse, but I still really liked it. The beer and drink selection is great and the food was amazing, as good as the original and some of the best 'cue in New York City. While I wouldn't say it's cheap, you get a good amount of food for your money. I was also very impressed with the service. Our server was very good and even split the check for our large group, a nice bonus you rarely find in NYC. I will be going back very soon.
