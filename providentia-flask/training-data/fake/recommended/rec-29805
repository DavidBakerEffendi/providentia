Hands down my favorite restaurant in the hood.  Heather is so wonderful when you walk in you feel like you're at home and Jason's cooking is out of this world.  Favorite dishes by far are the braised short-rib sliders, chicken wings and strawberry glazed shortribs.  served as small plates you can make a meal out of one these three paired with a smaller dish like the tuna tartar.  and leave room for desert - bacon doughnuts. full write-up at douginbrooklyn.com/words…
