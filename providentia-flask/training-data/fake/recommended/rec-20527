ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! I am on my honeymoon and a tourist here in NYC... I have been here 10 days so far and have bought produce from Eataly 3 times already! The selection of Cheese, cured meats (especially the prosciutto di parma) and the fresh pasta which they make on the premises is truly amazing! The gnocchi doesn't get any more fresh or better then that! and the ravioli Â is also amazing!!! Coffee is great too!!! I could spend hours in this place getting lost amongst the great selection of fresh italian produce!!! LOVE IT very much and it's a MUST VISIT for not only the locals but for the tourists in NYC too!!!
