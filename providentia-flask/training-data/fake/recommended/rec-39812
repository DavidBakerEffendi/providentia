I've died and gone to heaven. Whatever the breakfast special with grits, sausage, eggs, and cheese...oh my gosh my stomach is growling just thinking about it (and I've been gorging on Thanksgiving leftovers all day!). Their tater tots...will blow...your mind. Unlike any tots I've tried, and they by far take the cake. Small, low key ambiance. I want to eat breakfast here every day. (And I just might.)
