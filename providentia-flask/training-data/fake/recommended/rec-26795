Sorry, Woorijip owner and Yelpers. This review is about one dish only and is baed on the sample Woorijip proved in the street. It is does not reflect the entire Woorijip. I was too busy to enter the place and have dinner. I was just passing by, on my way to the train station, and sampled the Teriyaki Chicken they gave in the street. There was little chicken flavor in the beginning, instead, I tasted intense spiciness, probably from over-used garlic and ginger. The saltness is overwhelming as well. About 20 seconds later, a hell-rising bitterness started to torture my tongue, which lasted about 20 min before I found some water to wash it away. I wouldn't consider this Teriyaki Chicken safe to eat. Com'on guys, what did you put in there? Next time, I will try their food inside, cautiously.
