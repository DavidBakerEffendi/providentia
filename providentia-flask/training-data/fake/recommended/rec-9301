I wasn't that impressed by the Spotted Pig given the rave revenues I've heard. I had shoestring fries, which while tasty, weren't incredible and fairly expensive for what they were. Beer selection was fairly good. The restaurant was noisy enough that I had trouble hearing my friend over the background noise - more of a hang out spot after work than someplace I'd go with a date or to have a serious conversation. Didn't have any trouble getting a table on a Monday night, though I've seen lines other times.
