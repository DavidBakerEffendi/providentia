A good attempt at Korean fusion. One or two dishes were quite successful at it (the most memorable being the potato soup in the amuse douche), but the majority were just good attempts. They veered either too much towards Korean or towards Mediterranean, and the philosophy of a new kind of Korean food wasn't presented well at all. I'd prefer to take the amount I spent for the 5-course to eat 2 separate meals of traditional Korean, and Mediterranean cuisine.
