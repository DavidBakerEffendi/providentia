One Liner: Typical Buffet Food: (scale of 0-4) 1 My colleague and I got really hungry when we were driving through the state. We decided to exit the parkway and hit this place. The food was below average to decent for a buffet place. It fixed the hunger. That was about it. Extras: (Scale of 0-1)  0.4 Service 0.2: Service was good for a buffet Decor 0: I sneezed 5 times in the restroom. It was worst than the public toilet. Speed 0.1:   Dessert 0: Horrible dessert even for a buffet Prices 0: For what you get....it's quite expensive. 17 bucks for dinner buffet. It'd be fine for 7 bucks. My score for this experience is 1.4 stars. I only upgrade it to 2 stars because it fixed my hunger, fast.
