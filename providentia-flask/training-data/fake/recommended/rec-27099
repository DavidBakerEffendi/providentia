GHETTO! We arrived to the store, ready to place our order and the person taking the orders started to talk in great lenghts about different topics, eventually my sister randomly just burted out our order and then it was processed. The worst part was when it was time to pay. There were two cashiers on one register, then one just walked away. I asked the other girl the price of a bag a chips and she said "I dont know, you have to wait for the other cashier to return, she went to get a hair net". We waited another 5/6 minutes before can pay for the food. The food is good but definitely overpriced!!!!
