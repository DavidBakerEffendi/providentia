Rye is my favorite restaurant in Williamsburg. The food is consistently delicious, inventive, and reasonably priced. The staff is super nice. My husband and I had our wedding reception here - Cal (the chef) and Shevaun (host) went above and beyond in helping us have a wonderful day. Everyone loved the food, too. I find myself coming back here again and again, sometimes for a simple old fashioned (that the bartenders are expert at), other times for a full meal. Highly recommend.
