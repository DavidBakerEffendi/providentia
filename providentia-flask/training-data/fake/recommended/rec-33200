I lived around the corner from this place for 3 years and never went for no particular reason.  I think I saw the menu having just mostly paninis and couldn't figure out what I really like when it comes to paninis.  That problem has since been solved as everything on Il Bambino's menu is delicious! I went for the first time last week, had it again the next day, and took my wife for the first time today.  The mortadella panini is may be my favorite of the 4 I have tried (halfsies with the wife) out of the two diff prosciuttos and the soprasetta with red onions.... but rest assured, all were out of this world!  Had the brownie once too... DO IT!
