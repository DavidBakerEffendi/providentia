Awesome brunch place! Yummy warm Â atmosphere. The Barking Chihuahua was so deliciously creative. The crunchy tortilla topping was just a nice touch of texture that made me just want more. However, the dish that was cream of the crop was the French Toast. Ohh yumm. The filling in the toast was everything.
