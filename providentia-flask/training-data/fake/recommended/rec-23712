Oh wow, this is an amazing restaurant! I have to say, the grub and grog here is superb. So many beer and ale selections. You can order small amounts of the drinks so you can try several of them in one night. The pizza is quite good too. Standard east coast obsession with the flatbread, but it certainly tastes far better here.
