So the plan was to document my first ramen experience with pics and a short video but as soon as the bowls it the table and I took my first sip of broth....it was all over. It was hands down the best thing ive tasted ever!!!! I mean...I went with a friend and we shared no words at all until our bowls were empty! We ordered the vegetable ramen and salt and pepper wings! Â Both were excellent!!! The salt and pepper wings were $8 and they only gave 4 winglets so I wont order that again but the ramen!!! I had dreams about it last nite omg! The broth was excellent the noodles cooked perfectly I added a lil chili oil and there was a party in my tummy! Nice small spot...there was about 6 parties waiting to b seated about an hr b4 closing and I was told the wait would b 45mins but we only waited about 10-15mins. We sat at the "bar" which was fine and everyone sitting there was eatting ramen but there no place to hang ur purse they should invest in those lil hooks under the bar! I saw a coat rack near the bathroom but no1 used it I ate with my jacket on Sorry theres no pics of the food...but u will totally understand why...when u visit!
