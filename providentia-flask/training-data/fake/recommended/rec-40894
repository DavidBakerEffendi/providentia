This place might hit a sweet spot for some but is frankly overpriced for food quality, which can be hit-or-miss, and service, which is stoner-esque. On one recent visit they took my order and my name. After a while, I noticed a server wandering around from table to table with what looked to be my order. In her wanderings the server approached another couple, who arrived well after us; they said they had ordered it, but also another sandwich. Then the server wander over to us; Â when I asked if the order was for Amelia she said she didn't know -- why bother?
