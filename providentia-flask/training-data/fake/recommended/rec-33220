Generally have enjoyed our meals at Olea which means everyone else has too, so they've become too busy for a last minute meal. Unfortunately they aren't worth the long wait, and the last time we went charged us extra for seconds on endive leaf to use as a dip which we had substituted for bread with the dips. Come on people, how much is endive leaf!
