Many four star ratings are ones that could easily tilt toward five.  This one is clearly not on the cusp. What a great menu and environment.  Simple, refined, quality.  The flavor combinations are simply outstanding. Moussaka, fried artichokes with shaved manchego, ceviche, merguez sausage were all good individually.  Just like a holiday meal, they all blended well with each other as well.  Wine list had a reasonably priced rioja that was easy to drink. This is not a loud and active dining room but, it is comfortably social.  High ceiling.  Decor is simple and accented with a display over the bar of pitchers and vases from another era.  Background music was soft jazz on an excellent sound system. Excellent server.  Like the rest of the experience, she was simple, refined, and friendly.
