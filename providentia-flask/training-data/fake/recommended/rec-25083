The way the arcade is advertised on the website is exaggerated, there are about eight racing games, some shooting games, skeeball, and a bunch of token games that barely award tickets.  The majority of the games were "out of order" or did not produce the right amount of tickets which is really frustrating for kids that are trying to earn prizes.  Laser tag only runs once every two hours and it Is Saturday!  A little army man that you can get a bag of at the dollar store requires winning 100 tickets and most games only award you two!  My suggestion is print out some coupons at Chuck E Cheese and have a better time!!
