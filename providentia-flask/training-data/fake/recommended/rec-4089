This was the weirdest dining experience I've had in a long time. I was going to order the "Royal Flush" combo, until I found out the cheesesteak, Mozzarella sticks, chicken fingers, French fries and Bacon with sauce all came together,...on the same roll!! But that's not the weirdart. I asked the teenage cashier with glasses, tattoos, and hat on backwards if I could get the mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers placed on the dish, but not on the cheesesteak roll,.. and he said "Not really" So that makes NO sense! I was paying the same price, but I would have to take them off myself, after the chicken fingers were smothered in the cheese and sauce??? It's just funny, because I would have saved the kid "cooking" a step! I can tell the owner is not very hands on,...the floors were so sticky that pieces of toilet paper were all over the floors in the bathroom area, stuck there for eternity,....or at least until someone decides to mop. I watched the teenage cashier come around and wipe the tables with a dirty dry rag, not moving the salt, pepper, ketchup or napkin holder to do so, and just pushing all the crumbs onto the chairs. He didn't really care to use a spray or disinfectant, or a damp soapy rag, and did not bother to straighten any of the now filthy chairs. I never understand what makes someone gamble on a new business, after seeing a much better concept fail immediately in the exact same location. A shame too, because the cheesesteak and roll was actually quite good. Even if I did have to take the fries off of it myself. So weird....
