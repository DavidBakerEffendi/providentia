Absolutely amazing is the phrase which comes to mind when i have chicken with rice here... Try the chicken and rice combo with White and hot sauce (Hot Sauce is unbelievably hot... I am from India and its too hot for me even) The queue tends to be pretty long here between 12 - 1 so be prepared to stand for 15 minutes before you are served... but the food is worth the wait...
