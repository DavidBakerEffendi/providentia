I used to live in SF, and this is by far the closest to SF-style Mexican food as I've ever had in NYC. This might be sacrilege, but their al pastor might even be a smidge better than the famous El Farolito in the Mission. Reasonable prices (oh how I miss $2 tacos), amazing guac, and very solid tacos. I think I'll be back often.
