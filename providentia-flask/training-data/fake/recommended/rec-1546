Every time I ventured around this place, there was always a long line outside. After so many attempts at eating there, it was eventually decided to order it to go, the wait was about a half hr or so. The pizza smelled sooo delicious, I couldn't wait to get home to eat it. The drive was about 20 minutes, but by the time it got home, the pizza was already cold (it was around winter time) and had to be reheated in the oven. Although the pizza was good, it could have been better. I had high expectations considering how famous Grimaldi's is and also due to the pizza's initial tantalizing scent. I suspect it's better to eat the pizza right there and then at the restaurant. I had a much better experience at Lombardi's.
