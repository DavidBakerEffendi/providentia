there aren't that many vegetarian options, which is a big bummer from the start. the menu seems a little on the pricey side, too. we ordered the mac and cheese, which sounds great, but wasn't even as good as my mom makes. it came in this little dutch oven, which looked nice, but just make the mac taste like iron, and was really small for $9. gross. our server was very friendly but never followed through on bringing us water or lighting our fire pit after offering both things. we each ordered some flights of beer, which were pretty reasonably priced ($10 for 4 six-ounce glasses) but i'm pretty sure they got the order of the samples mixed up. i got the "hopper" flight since i'm a huge fan of hoppy beers, but 2 of the 4 were actually terrible. not sure if it was my personal taste or just a bad combination of the beers with each other and the macaroni's bbq sauce. anyway, to summarize, i'd go again for an individually selected beer on the patio, but not for the food, and only if i was feeling too lazy to walk to Local 44.
