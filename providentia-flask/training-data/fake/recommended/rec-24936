One of my favorite restaurants by far with Beso being the only exception. The bartender Charlene, the manager, the Wait staff is always polite and engaging. We often sit at the bar with intentions to eat in the dining room, but with the cozy yet modern ambiance of the bar area, we end up staying at the bay for a full meal. Love it here! Tuna appetizer, clams, mussels, you can't go wrong.
