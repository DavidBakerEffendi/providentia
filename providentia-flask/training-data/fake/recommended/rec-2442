Pat's or Geno's, I found out that you have to make a choice! I did. I went with what I saw, I bigger line and happy people eating there Philly across the street. I looked on the Pat's side and I saw committed people, angrily shoving down their Philly sandwich. Looked across the street and they were all dancing with color! Looked at the Pat's side everyone was stiff and colorless. What I'm saying is that Pat's is a good place for a Philly, it beats anything outside of Philadelphia or PA perhaps. I ate my Philly at Pats but then I went across the street and had a Philly at Geno's. I went back and had another Pat's Philly (so freakin what!), but once I had my second Philly at Pat's I was wishin I stayed across the street. I don't know the politics, and I don't wanna know, outside opinion, Geno's all the way. There is nothing wrong with Pat's AOK!
