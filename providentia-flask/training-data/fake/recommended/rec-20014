I visited this restaurant on the last day of Brooklyn Restaurant week. I thought that because it was a Thursday night the wait would not be long. I was wrong. I was told it would be 1hr and a half. The wait was well worth it. The food was great, my waiter attentive and informative, the atmosphere was cozy and nice. I highly recommend this place and you should try the buttermilk chicken. Just prepare yourself for the wait.
