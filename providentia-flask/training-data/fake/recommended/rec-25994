I've been here twice for brunch and I have to say it's pretty damn good. For only $16 you get any coffee you like, an alcoholic drink, and an entree. I highly recommend the bloody mary, it's truly the best I've ever had. It's very strong and spicy! The winning dish here is the bife a cavalo, which is: steak, eggs any style, tomato salsa, rice, and beans. I want to eat another plate of it just thinking about it. Finally, my favorite Brazilian staple is pao de quiejo (cheesy bread). Takes a little longer to make it but it's worth it. Will definitely be returning for brunch here soon!
