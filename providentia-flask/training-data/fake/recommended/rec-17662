I'm really thinking 4.5 stars here. Definitely a place I will go back again and try different dishes. Started with a glass of Morroccon Red and later switched to Washington State Pinot Noir, both very good.  If you're with another wine drinker, order a bottle, as 'by the glass' was adding up real fast! The restaurant and bar are small, yet the layout has a cozy, homy feel. The food is all freshly prepared with a wide variety. I recommend the grilled octopus and fried artichoke tapas. The owner was very cordial and friendly and made sure everything was flowing smoothly. He brought over a courtesy appetizer and also visited us mid-meal. Nice to not-be-rushed! especially in a small place where table turnover is an issue. Hopefully, I can control myself next visit, as my casual dinner came to about $150!  If you go Tapas, consider everything is about $11, including a glass of wine, so you should be able to get 3 tapas, 4 glasses of wine for 77$, and that is a nice little dinner. See you again, Meme.
