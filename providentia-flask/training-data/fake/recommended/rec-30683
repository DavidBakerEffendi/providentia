A friend brought me here for my birthday and what a wonderful treat it was!  Beautiful little place.  We shared a bottle of wine from the nice menu of options.  Beautiful food!  The special was a sunchoke soup which was smooth and creamy topped with toasted pine nuts, which gave it a nice balance of texture.  The Pan Crisped chicken was delicious!  The flavors in the crunch came through, the moisture of the chicken made me wipe my mouth constantly and it sat over sweet potatoes and bok choy.  The nutty brown butter gave another level of flavor that brought the whole thing together.  Who knew?  Great meal, great company, attentive service...and heck, since when doesn't a bottle of wine just throw it over the top?  Ready to return!
