Sonny's was hands down the best cheese steak! We ordered wit whiz shrooms onions. The steak was flavorful and tender and oh so juicy. Required several napkins to complete. The gentleman taking order was friendly. There are several tables inside. They stayed busy the entire time we visited on Friday afternoon after visiting the Liberty Tourist area & it was only a short walk down Market St. We would definetly eat here anytime while in Philly. Â We also tried 1@Campos & were very disappointed with Campos. Stick with Sonny' s you will be glad you did.
