Yay NY Yelpers! I would have never guessed to eat here but it was DELISH! Thank you! We got the Combo plate with the spice and the white sauce and it was a marvelously cheap and delicious lunch! The manfriend and I shared it overlooking a pond in Central Park under the bright yellow fall trees. Swooon. Â These damn NY moments have my heart!
