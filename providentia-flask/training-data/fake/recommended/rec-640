Went for dinner. Got 2 apps: The fried vegetables (less than $10) were pretty good. Fried calamari ($10) was nothing to write home about. Got the Kyclades special as the entree, which had sole, stuffed calms, stuffed shrimp, scallops, and a lobster tail ($40). EVERYTHING WAS OVERCOOKED AND UNDERSEASONED. The scallops had sand in every bite - so bad that we had to send it back. The stuffing of the clams and the shrimp was the same no-flavor seafood mush. It's such a shame to ruin beautiful seafood like that. I really cannot understand why all the reviews are so positive. Even reading through some of the very positive reviews, they mention food tasting bland. I will not go back again.
