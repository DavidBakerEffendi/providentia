I haven't been to Jose Tejas in over 10 years and decided I was due for a visit. Got there and was greeted to the usual line of customers waiting to get in. Doesn't matter what time you get there, there's always a wait. Makes sense when you are dealing with one of the best Tex-Mex/Cajun restaurants in the area. Got seated in 20 minutes and was pleased to see the items on the menu haven't changed since my last visit. The food here is excellent and much like the menu, the flavors remain just as I remember them. The food is as fresh as you can get and you get your plates delivered quickly upon ordering. Their plates are always delicious and the portions very generous. If you happen to pass this place on Rt. 1 and notice a crowd outside waiting to get in, don't be discouraged, the food is worth the wait!
