This diner is fantastic. It's been in operation since the 1930s, and the hand-painted signs, the beautiful tile flooring, and the unpretentious yet welcoming ambiance make that fact immediately apparent. My girlfriend and I were seated promptly on a weekday morning although nearly all of the booths were full. Our server was expedient, courteous, and jovial. He immediately offered us coffee and brought us glasses of water. As others have noted, this is a cash-only establishment (as is to be expected in New York). I opted for a bacon and cheese omelette; it was served with a hearty portion of homefries (one can also choose from grits or regular fries, too), along with two pieces of toast--replete with grape jam. Our bill came to less than $25, and I look forward to coming back again for another excellent, quintessential diner-style breakfast. Tom's isn't the best diner in the world, but it's a modestly-priced gem with good food and great service. A beautiful greasy spoon, indeed. I highly recommend having a meal here if you are in the area.
