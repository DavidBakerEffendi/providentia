I was recently in town for a conference and happened upon McGillin's Olde Ale House.  My companion (who had been here before) and I enjoyed this establishment so much we visited for three nights in a row.  Cheap beer ($5 pitchers of PBR until 7:00PM I believe), decent pub fare and a fun atmosphere.  We enjoyed the karaoke and the mixed crowd.  If you're looking for something other than macro-brews, the 1860 IPA was enjoyable and there seemed to be a selection of other micro-brews from the region.  Next time I'm in Philly, I'll make an effort to stop back in.
