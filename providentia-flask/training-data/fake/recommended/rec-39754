ive walked by this restaurant numerous times while going to eat at the chinese restaurant next door with my family. but this time, my friend wanted to have some singapore laksa. and this place...taste good malaysian cuisine...was recommended on yelp. reason? THE FOOD IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. ignore the super-ghetto exterior that only says 'taste good.' ignore the fact that it is the size of your living room inside (and yet it's always full and people seem to be enjoying their meals). the waitresses were lovely to me and my friends. very helpful and attentive even at 7PM on a friday nite. i had the roti cani and it was the best ive had. the roti was hot! perfect mix of chewy and crispy. not paper thin. which is fine. and the curry chicken dipping sauce? delicious. more creamy than ive had before but it tastes even better. i had the sizzling tofu which came out...sizzling! fried tofu bathed and surrounded by a minced pork, shrimp, peas brown sauce with a layer of egg on the bottom. it was perfection. so comforting and delicious. my friend had the singapore laksa which was very tasty as well. im in love with this little hole-in-the-wall and will definitely go back for some real south east asian cooking.
