Found myself in Midtown last week for a two day meeting.  While Yelping for lunch options, I realized we were only a block south of this landmark vending cart.  I dragged all of my co-workers here with me and I don't think any of them were disappointed.  In fact they were more than eager to return the 2nd day.  The first day we went it was raining a little bit so the line was short and moved quickly.  Not so the second day, there were maybe 15-20 people in line in front of us and the line seemed to crawl.  In fact it took a little more than half an hour for us to finally get our grub.  This just isn't satisfactory, esp considering all of the food is already prepared and they just have to dole it into a tin for you to take with you. The food is super tasty and just about worth the wait.  I had the lamb platter both days (minus salad).  This has to be the best meal that $5 can buy, esp in Manhattan.  Rice, ground lamb and some pita smothered in white sauce.  Go easy with the red sauce it's super hot and you'll pay for it later.
