Uh, whiskey. Lots of it. In an authentic Irish pub that's been relocated from across the pond. In an idyllic college town. What's not too like? Service was a tad slow at first but friendly Manager Mike happened along, chatted me up and then made a great recommendation after hearing of my love of Lagavulin 16 yr. Prices are on the steep side but only from a VT perspective. You'd pay more in a big city or even a kitschy hotel bar in a medium sized city. I'll be sure to find my way here whenever I'm in sniffing distance.
