I am such a fan.  This is my tried and true comfort food when in NJ. I (and my colleagues) are pretty frequent visitors, and we've gotten to know the staff over the years.  They are ALWAYS welcoming.  Whether it's setting us up at a high top with an outlet for our laptops during working dinners (don't judge), or settling us in the dining room on those nights we need a break, Metro is always attentive to our needs.  The waitstaff are amazing. Their specialties rotate on what seems like a nightly basis, so you always have options, but I am partial to the Penne Alfredo with jumbo lump crab meat (no it's not on the menu, it's a combination of two of their dishes, & yes they are more than willing to accommodate special requests). House salad is super good - the dressing totally nails it.  The pork chop, gnocchi, steak, and sea bass are all excellent & highly recommended.
