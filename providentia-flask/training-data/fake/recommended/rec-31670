Haven't been to Ilili in about a year, but I'm seriously thinking of taking a trip into the city for it. Hands down the best Brussels sprouts I've ever had! Ive actually tried to recreate the dish a couple of times but it just never comes out the same. Never had a bad dish there, strongly recommend it (and keep in mind that this type of food is out of the ordinary for me)
