What can I say?  This burger joint (not to be confused with 'Burger Joint') supposedly has a great rep, but I probably would've enjoyed it more had I not known, since that got me actually expecting something good, whereas it's mostly just decent.  Well cooked burger & McDonald's-quality fries, and no shakes on the menu.  Tasty but not filling enough, and certainly not worth the 1/2+ average wait time out the door, but if you can slip in during off-hours, go at it hoss.
