I can't believe I've lived 5 minutes from this place for 2 years and didn't know it was there.  The service was on point and the manager was really nice.  I had a coupon for $25 off, but, really, it wasn't needed.  The food was very reasonably priced and the portions were huge.  We had calamari, a turkey club (which I brought the other half for lunch today) and the steak skewers.  Everything tasted great and our server was so helpful.  They had a happy hour for $4 cocktails which was a plus.  I will definitely be back.  They finally gave me a reason to hang out on Roosevelt Island.
