EXCELLENT! This has quickly become one of our favoite places to grab a bite to eat! The food is inexpensive, tastes great, cooked up quickly and made to order. Infact, you can walk over and watch your food be cooked over the fire pit if you like! I love that the owners are always there! They are extremely friendly and really want your feedback. The staff is very friendly as well and goes above and beyond to make sure that you have a great experience there! We had to run in there the other day Â for a quick bite in between thing but didnt have much time to eat. We were able to place the order by phone, arrived ten minutes later, sat down and the food was done and ready for us to eat! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! They are opening another location as well, but I can't remember the name of the town. I would definately encourge you to eat there!
