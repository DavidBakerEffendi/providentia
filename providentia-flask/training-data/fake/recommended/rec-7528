We came here for brunch this past Saturday. The wait was about 40 minutes, but we left our name and number with the host in case and took a walk around the area to work up an appetite. Of note, Anthony was our server and took great care of us. We got the soup and sandwich combo (soup of the day was chicken and vegetables), a side of candied bacon, and the red eye hash. I got a dirty chai as well since it was recommended across numerous reviews. Soup and sandwich combo: 3/5. I wasn't a huge fan of the soup (I felt that there are a couple local diners we go to whose homemade soups have more flavor), but since I was coming off of a cold, it worked okay enough. The grilled cheese with onion jam was really good and hit the spot; I'm a huge sucker for grilled cheese in general but I thought the flavors worked well and it tasted good. Red eye hash: 5/5 from the hubby. Good sized chunks of flavorful meat, well seasoned potatoes, and he felt the gravy tied the dish together well. Dirty chai: 4/5. It was different, tasty, and did the trick for a coffee fiend like myself! I think worth trying if you're there and enjoy coffee-like beverages at all. Next time if we come back, I might just try the regular coffee Candied bacon: 5/5. If I come back, I would definitely order this again if nothing else. Thick pieces of bacon and the sweet/salty combination was great! I'm glad we decided to add it on as a side. All in all, a decent experience, and I wouldn't mind if we had to come back.
