Lively atmosphere at the bar, no reservations required, and playful mixologists who are obviously as competent as they are naturals.  By naturals, I mean individuals who have fun while they're mixing.  Marked difference from the almost academic/bookish atmosphere created by the mixologists at Death & Co.  The Amelia is a smooth and fruity, but not overly sweet vodka-based sophisticated drink, and truly delicious (off menu).  If you're female, the making of it might require you to slap a mint sprig resting peacefully on the palm of one of those mixologists...
