My second time here and it was just as good. Consistency is important. Started with the Tasting Board and Vegetable Plate. Both were outstanding. Our group finished off with pizzas, the real attraction for me, and they were delicious and perfectly cooked. Seating is a little tight. We had a group of 6 so took the tables at the back by the pizza oven, was a little warm. Not bad now, but would not want to sit there in the summer! Service was excellent both times.
