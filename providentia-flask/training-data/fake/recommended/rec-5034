Hey, people, I'm a vegetarian and this place is Grrrrrrrrrreat!  Hanging out in New York for a week and wanting my husband to enjoy some culinary pleasure, we slipped out of the hot sun and into Morgan's. We were immediately welcomed and began exploring the do-it-yerself menu. A cook stretching his legs recommended the fatty brisket, not ironically. There are 10 kinds of mac and cheese. 10!  I ordered the Big Ole Salad, which was perfectly fresh, lightly dressed with a unique pickled peanut sauce, and a baked potato. My husband almost cried when he bit into the brisket, which he confirms is from heaven. Our waitress, who was friendly and attentive, laughed when he ordered a second round of brisket, and acknowledged that she is an angel from heaven bringing him the food of the gods. Get a jalapeño niño or two like me! But definitely go. Vegetarians, do not be dismayed: you will find deliciousness and your meat-eating friends will praise your name.
