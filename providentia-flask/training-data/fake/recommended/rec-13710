I have been going quite a bit lately. It is really good and a lot of food for 6 bucks. Try the BBQ sauce with the white sauce. The line around 1ish had not been that bad...maybe only 20 min wait. It is kinda nasty to see these guys making the food on a hot night. Although they all seem nice enough, I have not seen any of them wearing plastic gloves. The last few times I have gone it was really warm out and they were all sweating quite a bit...rubbing their faces off and then moving the pittas around. I guess that adds a little salt to the bread. Kinda nasty if you allow yourself to think about it. Would it kill them to put some gloves on?? The truth is if I'm really concerned about food safety and Â hygiene I should probably not be eating at a cart. Well, that may be a bit too strong a statement as I have been impressed with how clean and hygienic some other carts in the city look. Whatever...suck it up and go enjoy. If people were getting sick from this cart you would hear about it on yelp and that does not seem to be the case!
