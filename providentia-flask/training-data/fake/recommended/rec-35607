Doc Magrogan's has an extensive menu, but all three times I've dined there, it fell short of meeting my expectations. Either the dishes were cold, the salad was too dry/tasteless, or there was just something missing... I know I will go back there just because it's a block away from where I live and provides a unique dining option, but I probably wouldn't come here out of all the places in Philly if I were craving seafood.
