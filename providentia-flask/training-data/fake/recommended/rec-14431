Being Argentinean, I had to see if this place passed the test - Â I was pleasantly surprised! I walked by on whim after work during their happy hour and stopped by to enjoy a glass of Malbec. We then tried their empanadas and a steak! All of which was delicious, especially with the chimichurri sauce! The only thing I would change is the portion sizes, their plates ran a bit small. It was not ideal to split. Typically a friend and I are able to go to an Argentinean restaurant and split a meal together. This is a type of place that you could also go for a romantic date.
