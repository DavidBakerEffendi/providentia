I was really disappointed about my experience. I had high hopes but pretty much everything was terrible. We were greeted and seated in a friendly manner, and our server came over and seemed helpful and nice. We ordered drinks and appetizers and the drinks were good. We received one of our appetizers, 4 oysters, after a short while and also after we were told pretty much every other kind we wanted they were out of. We ordered a tuna appetizer as well but it never came. During our meal when she came to check on us, after we were halfway done, we asked her to please remove the tuna from the check and she said "oh we are out of that, didn't I tell you?" Um no, you didn't. Our meals were subpar. My boyfriend got surf n turf- his steak was chewy, his lobster was only partially cooked and it didn't come with anything it said it would on the menu. I got the seafood pasta dish, which was completely flavorless. The seafood in it was good, but the pasta and broth were completely bland- I don't think even salt and pepper were used. We didn't want to bother with dessert, so we asked for the check and handed the waitress our groupon (I always wait until the end in case the fact I got a lot of food for half the price makes the server half ass it). She came back with the new check and took my boyfriend's card for the balance. She came back and dropped it on the table and didn't say thank you at all, just walked away. That was probably the second time we saw her anyway, since she pretty much forgot about us the whole meal. Our reservation was 7:00 on a Friday- it wasn't packed, there was no wait, so there was no reason for any of that. We might return for happy hour and an appetizer but never, never again for dinner. Especially not for that price! The prices are insane for the quality.
