Over Rated!! After reading some of the reviews I went to Ippudo with very high expectations. The only thing I loved about this place was the happy hour special of 2 draft Sapporos for $6. Everything else was a disappointment. I went with three friends and we all ordered a different ramen, so I tried four ramens, and none of them were stellar. If we hadn't had to wait for an hour it might have been worth it. But given the price and the wait, it just isn't worth your time or money. I could only eat a third of mine and was going to take the rest home to my hungry and very unpicky boyfriend, but was told I wasn't allowed to! $14 for a big bowl of soup and I can't take it home? I'm sorry, but wtf? I also did not like their sake selection. Too limited. No sparkling sake? Really? There are so many great places to eat, avoid the hype and go somewhere else.
