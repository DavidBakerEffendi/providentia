Luckily, me and my three other friends got here a few minutes before it opened. Around 5:15 because the wait was already an hour for the four of us. I know that around 6pm groups were being told that there was a 3 hour wait. I liked the texting system because we didn't have to stand out in the cold like we would have had to for some other popular restaurants. You can walk around the area to kill some time. St. Marks is nearby and there is a big Starbucks in front of the Cooper Union Square cube, so we waited in there. I actually liked the appetizers a lot more than the ramen. To be honest, Mitsuwa's Santoka's ramen is still my favorite out of all japanese ramens that I have tried. I got the Shiromaru Hakata Classic which I heard was the most popular. It was a little too greasy and I did not think it was worth the 21 dollars it ended up being when I added an egg and the pork strips. Other ramen places normally have these items already in the bowl. The appetizers on the other hand were fantastic! We got the Gindara Saikyo Yaki, Pork Buns, and the Tori Shio Yaki. I loved the Tori Shio Yaki. It was the perfect texture and crispiness. The pork buns were excellent as well, and I thought the fish was cooked well, but it wasn't something that left lingering thoughts. Def am still thinking about the Tori Shio and the Pork Buns. I loved the ambiance of this place, I was sad that we didn't get to sit in the main circular area of the restaurant because that is where the most hustle and bustle is. I was in the far back next to a wall, which blocked out that half of the restaurant. There is a lot of random Japanese yelling, which I haven't figured out yet, but it was fun to listen to. The service was great, the waiters and waitresses are very attentive!
