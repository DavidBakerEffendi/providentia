Excellent food and service! I am a big fan of Kittichai in Manhattan and was delighted to find that this place houses the same chef. The food is a very interesting and tasty fusion of American, Mexican and Asian. My favorites are the corn soup, short ribs and lollipop chicken. The thai tea has thai tea ice cubes so your tea never gets watered down! Love it!
