why this place isn't as packed as pepe's/sally's i'll never understand, but i'm glad that's the case. when i think of modern, i think simple.  no ridiculous crowd.  no fancy decor.  hell, i don't even bother with toppings. get a tomato pie, or maybe a tomato and mozzarella, and leave it at that.  pause for a moment to admire the amazing crust, with patches of char all around.  then just shove your face into it and die a happy man.   you know how sometimes the simplest things are the best, often for reasons that you can't really describe?  this is modern.  a front runner for the best pizza i've had.
