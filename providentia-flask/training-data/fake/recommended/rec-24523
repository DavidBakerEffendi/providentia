Was surprised to find so many clean flavors at Momofuku.   I was expecting everything to be crazy flavors that blow your head off.   But, it was a really good meal that ended with the best dish ever!   The spicy pork sausage dish was sooooo good and spicy with awesome blow your head off flavor!  So that gave me the fix I was looking for.   Didn't quite understand the ham section, it just doesn't fit with the theme.  Curiously we tried the Wigwam ham to see if there was something that was different about this, but nope....it was just thinly sliced ham accompanied by some pickled veg and mustard.  Tasted like all Virginia hams that I grew up with.....   Highlights - Spicy pork sausage! Fuji apple kimchi Raw bar Mackeral Lobster Roll Steamed Buns - pork belly Loved the single art decoration of 80's John McEnroe.  Again, another thing that just just doesn't make sense, but this one actually works.   Will definitely be hitting up some other Momofuku bars on the next trip.
