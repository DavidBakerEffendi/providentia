I adore this place.  I must have eaten here 20+ times.  I keep thinking I will try new soups, but I just crave the Lobster, Salmon and Shrimp Bisque.  Amazing and I order it every time. You have to pick your times to come here as the line gets long.  I try to get a here right before noon or after 1:45pm.  Then you can usually be in and out in a couple minutes.  At lunch, the line moves pretty fast regardless, but for some people ordering soup is a confusing, time consuming process. BTW, Large soup for $5.50.  There is no dinner service, but the bar next door serves their soup in the evening.
