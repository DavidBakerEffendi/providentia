Decided to go here with a coworker who was in from Boston. We had a horrible lunch experience at work and were looking for something to make up for it. After being very indecisive, we decided to try Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. We both got the Harvest Salad... and it was probably one of the best salads I've ever had.. so tasty! I ordered the filet and she got lobster bisque. My steak was cooked a perfect Medium Rare and seasoned nicely... Love me a good steak :) My Coworker said her bisque was way to salty... and she didn't eat most of it. Our waitress was very nice and checked on us several times, water was always filled and everything was served in a timely manner. We even commented to ourselves about how attentive the staff was and how we were not use to being treated so well when out to eat. We each enjoyed a glass of wine but decided to pass on dessert. Though Ruth's Chris is a chain restaurant in some sense, it definitely did not feel like it. The decor inside was very nice and the staff was very welcoming.
