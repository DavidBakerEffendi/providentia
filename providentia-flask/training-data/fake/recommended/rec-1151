Any trip to Philadelphia would not be complete without at least eating one cheesesteak sandwich so on this occasion had a few hours before my flight I decided why not try both at once. I went with the cheese steak with onions, mushrooms and provolone cheese and have to say that Pats compared to Gino's had the upper hand on multiple levels as well as it seemed like it was a crowd favorite as the line that I had to wait in for Gino's was not as long is the line for Pats. Overall I think it is a good experience, but not necessarily worth five stars I think it's really merely a tourist adventure or way for people to feel as if it's the same place they can come back to you and know what you're going to get each time. The biggest thing that stands out to me is the steak quality and taste. It's good to see the steak being cooked right in front of you and then moments after that it being placed in the hoagie. The onions are cooked properly with the mushrooms and not just thrown in the mix. All this with some provolone and it is with the 10 bucks! My only real complaint about the cheesesteak was the bread I felt as if the bread was a little bit lacking, but the other items overshadowed it at the end of the day.
