Pancakes! Pancakes! Pancakes! Oh and them hash browns TOO! It's like your grandmother came to Brooklyn and was in the back with that old time cooking where people actually put some LOVE into their food. The wait isn't always favorable and the crowd can be a bit pretentious but who cares? Put your face into a plate and don't let that kill your good eating vibes!
