The xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) are fantastic.  A good contender for Shanghai Park.  It's a different style soup dumpling than Joe's Shanghai in NYC, but it actually reminds me of the little stalls that I used to get breakfast at in Shanghai.  Unfortunately the shenjianbao (fried pork buns?) and the guotie (fried dumplings) and some other shanghainese specialties are not quite shanghainese.  The shenjianbao tasted like a normal bun that was fried.  and the guotie skin wasn't thick enough and it wasn't juicy on the inside like it should be.  The wonton soup was good.  So was the drunken chicken.  The scallion pancakes are over-fried and the beef noodle soup had good beef but I think they were dried noodles.  All in all, I'm very glad that this place opened up around here.  If this place was in Edison, I might have given it 3 stars.  But since it's this far south and I'm rooting for them to get better, I'm giving them 4.
