In the beginning when the restaurant opened few months back the chats was amazing and today when I tried the same dishes they gave an uncooked rice as well as noodles. The samosa chat was good and the quantity Was more when it was opened but now when we ask the manager "why so less chat in plate" they say the plate is big , we couldn't say anything but eat and walk out of the restaurant ..
