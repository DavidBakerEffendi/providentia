I recently had dinner at Ilili during restaurant week and they had a pretty good offering of two appetizers, entree and dessert for $38. The restaurant itself is beautiful with a plush lounge area and nice warm wood accents throughout the dining areas.  The service is solid and our waiter was attentive and present whenever we needed something.  As for the food, we had for the appetizer the Moujadara (green lentil purée), Arnabeet Mekle (Cauliflower with the most amazing Tahini sauce), Moussaka (eggplant) and all were really good. My sister had the Branzino which was very tasty and well made and I had the Risotto which likewise was solid but as I watched plates go by I wished that I would have ordered the lamb as it looked and smelled delicious.  For dessert we had the cheese cake and chocolate bar which were both delicious.
