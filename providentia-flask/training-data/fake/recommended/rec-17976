Clean and cute atmosphere, and the menu is simple and to the point. Plus really excellent food! This place had high reviews, so I came with high expectations, and Cafe Condesa did not disappoint! I found the service to be very friendly and helpful, the place was tidy and clean. Food is amazing! 5 stars customer service & cozy + welcoming atmosphere. Thanks so much for opening this place!
