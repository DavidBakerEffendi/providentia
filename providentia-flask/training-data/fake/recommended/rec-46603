Beating a dead horse, writing about how good the sandwiches are, so I'll just add a few tips. Sit at the bar and add a ton of the peppers, absolutely delicious. Also, if you're taking one home and you live more than a block away, it'll get soggy. Ask for takeout and they'll pack everything separate so you can reassemble when you get home. Also, avoid on Saturdays unless you love being smushed by huge crowds.
