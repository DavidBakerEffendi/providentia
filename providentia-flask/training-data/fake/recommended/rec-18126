Amazing. My boyfriend just moved deeper into West Philly and we were looking to explore the neighborhood a bit. This place had the highest reviews, and I'd never tried chaat or lassie before. This is my new favorite West Philly joint. The flavors are phenomenal. We ordered 3 items (which was actually a little too much for us, but it was so good that we just HAD to finish it). We ordered the shahi, the chicken, and the fresh salad chaat. I highly recommend going in before you order, though, if you are a first timer. The owner told us next time to come right in so we can try out the flavors before he adds the different grains, sauces, etc to the food. We were very happy with our order and the Mango lassie we tried was delicious. I will definitely be returning sooner rather than later!
