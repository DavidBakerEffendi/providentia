This place is my go-to whenever I want a giant & comforting bowl of beef noodle soup, and after 5-6 times, it's still never disappointed me. I always start with the spicy pig ears (if you're skeptical - just try it!!) and then a beef brisket with shaved noodles. The noodles are very fresh/chewy and the soup is not too oily, like a lot of other places in the area. The best part is each meal is under $10 and there is never a wait! Will definitely come back whenever I'm in Philly. Remember it's cash only!!
