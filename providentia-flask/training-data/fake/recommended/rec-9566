My husband and I came to this place for my birthday; he had looked in yelp and found it as a romantic place. In my opinion it is a bit crowded and noisy to be called romantic, but great for any other occasion. The food is so fresh and delicious, the wine is good and the price/quality/quantity/service are great as well. I loved this place but it is not for a quite romantic night.
