Fantastic sushi! DEFINITELY the best in Montclair; hands down winner. Much better than Yoshi (restaurant that it replaced). Absolutely fantastic food, just a classic, no nonsense great sushi restaurant. Service was wonderful - the staff was accommodating, friendly and attentive. I asked for one of my rolls with no avocado, and our waiter informed us that he wouldn't charge us as much, as he was concerned that the roll wouldn't be as big without the avocado. In addition, we weren't charged for our miso soups, and at the end of the meal, were provided with a complimentary beverage - a delicious cinnamon spice cold tea. Absolutely delightful! Will return for sure!
