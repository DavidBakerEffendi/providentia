How have I not reviewed this restaurant sooner? This is my favorite restaurant in New York, hands down. Read: FAVORITE. The menu is simple, but everything is so detail-oriented--from the charming menu design to a drawing of France's wine regions on the wall to the hospitality. I can't help but return again and again and again. I find a way to reference Buvette often and recommend Buvette to everyone. The wine list is perfect--I usually aim for a mid-priced Bordeaux and have always been overwhelmingly satisfied. On the menu, nothing has disappointed, but some special attention needs to be brought to the Brandade de Morue (salted cod spread), Pesto di Parma and the Terrine de Campagne.
