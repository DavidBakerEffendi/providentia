For a first date, Perilla is the perfect choice. The dimly lit restaurant gives off a warm romantic vibe that couples will appreciate and the food... oh, the food. My date perused the wine list before assertively settling on the Antica Terra pinot noir which was light enough to go well with everything on our 6 course tasting menu but medium bodied enough to suit my taste. The amuse bouche was the crudo of Fluke. Our waiter poured a tomato-yuzu broth over the concoction of delicate fish, avocado and cucumber. It was larger than any amuse bouche I had ever had but it was light enough to open the taste buds and build up the anticipation for the next few courses. Next up, the warm lobster salad topped with fish roe. My plate was perfectly clean after this particular dish, not a single roe in sight. What can I say, Perilla does a fabulous lobster. Previously, the waiter had asked us if there was anything in particular we would like to try and their daily special of red snapper was right up my alley so that was what I requested and my date and I were both extremely glad that I did. The fish was cooked to perfection and coupled with the myer lemon gnocchi, simply amazing. By this point, I was getting a little full... but I had to try their famous farro risotto which was creamy and nutty, topped with a few slices of red grapes, and unlike anything I'd ever eaten before. The trio of pork (roast pork loin, chorizo and pork butt flauta) were decent but maybe it was because I was so full, not as great as the previous dishes. The key lime gelato was extremely tart so my date couldn't even have a bite but I quite liked it, especially because it has some toasted coconut on the bottom and the chocolate souffle at the end of the meal was brilliant. Hail to the Top Chef.
