This place is wonderful - especially for ex-pat New Orleanians  (like us) and New Orleans aficionados/wannabes who are craving a taste of home!  The first thing you notice upon walking in (after the tasteful, warm and stylish decor) is the friendliness of the staff. The owner immediately connects and makes you feel welcome (on our first return visit, she remembered our names and what we ate for our previous meal!)  A New Orleanian herself, she has put her heart and soul into every detail, which is what makes the food, the ambiance, the whole dining experience so delightful.  There is a community table (though most tables seat two or four)  that makes group dining fun - and power plugs at every table so you can use your laptop, phone, etc.  Also noteworthy for groups is that everyone is already accommodated on the menu - carnivores can dine with vegans, gluten-free with carb lovers - and all dishes use only fresh, organic and natural ingredients.  Note: the wine alone is worth the trip!  This place is a neighborhood treasure - where everyone - no matter what your actual neighborhood - will feel welcome and well-fed.  Let the good times roll!
