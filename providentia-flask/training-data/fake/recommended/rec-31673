They have some damn fine wood fired pizza here. Very tasty. A tad expensive but well worth it to me. Real firewood is actually used to cook this pizza unlike others where they use gas and have 1 log in the oven. The couple who own the place are very nice people. The place is small and a wait can be expected on the normal busy nights. They have specials every day which are usually pretty good.
