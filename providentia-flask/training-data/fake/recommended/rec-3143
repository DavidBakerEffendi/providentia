I was supposed to meet a friend for dinner here before we headed to Shecky's Girls night out but was stood up. I was pissed since I was waiting in this cute chic restaurant for over a damn hour. While waiting, I people watched on one of Â the little ottomans by the window. Most people who walked by, stopped and peeped in the restaurant or stopped to read the menu. This place seems very popular. The hostess, servers and bartenders were all Asian women dressed in all black with either mini skirts or short shorts, looking a bit too gothic to me. After I learned my friend called and said she couldnt make it I ordered my food and just sat at the bar. I was too hungry to order a cocktail after inhaling all those delicious plates during my wait. I ordered the lychee siam duck (in red curry) and it came fairly quick. That duck was delicious with the vegetables and fruit in a curry sauce. I was a bit worried because it didnt appear to be a lot of food but it was just enough. I ate every bit of my meal and was completely satisfied. Staff were friendly but most importantly the prices were very affordable. The bathrooms were as clean as they could have been and they were way too dark. Despite this, I will definitely return.
