from soup to nuts this was one of my favorite restaurant experiences in NYC. The food was top notch! Highly Recommend: Escargot Risotto App Steak and Frites Short RIbs (Saturday Special) Mussels and Frites The bread was amazing and wish the bakery next door didnt close so early......But what made this experience so great was our server. Â When you go to a relatively expensive restaurant and get great food and even better service it just makes the experience unforgettable. i can not wait to go back for a special occasion.
