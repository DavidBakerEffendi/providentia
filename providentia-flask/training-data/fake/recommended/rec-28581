I have been Paleo for about two years and traveling has been a HUGE obstacle for me. Finding Hu Kitchen was a big win. Grains make me feel bloated, dairy makes me nauseous, and my body hates all processed foods. It's so nice to know that there is a CLEAN (meant in more ways than one) place I can go to and enjoy a meal out with friends. I will absolutely be back. This is my new go-to when I'm in the city.
