Best Chinese food in the area.  Love their egg rolls and they do a good job with my garlic chicken.  Fried dumplings are sooo good.  Prices for lunch are excellent.  Definitely not an eat in place though, really takeout only.  Make sure if you order on Friday night for delivery that you give them an hour (super busy)!
