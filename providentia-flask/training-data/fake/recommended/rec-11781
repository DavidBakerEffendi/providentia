Where do I begin?? I live in the neighborhood.. go there for take out at least once a week.. I went in there around 12:45PM on Wednesday.. it was crowded. A few minutes later a table was available... a couple that came in behind me was given that table..they were TWO I was ONE!!! I decided to get take out  NOT AVAILABLE!! I said .. dude.. I live in the neighborhood, I can't get a seat because I am by myself and I can't get take out??? Does customer service exist for those eating alone????  not here..never going back.. will tell everyone about the horrible service!!
