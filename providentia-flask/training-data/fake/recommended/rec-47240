I can't say enough about my meal here last Sunday night. From the cosmos my friend and I had to start, to the INSANELY amazing farro risotto we shared as an appetizer, to the Tennessee catfish gumbo (on special) I enjoyed as my main course, the meal was flawless. And that's not even touching on the citrus panna cotta we tried for dessert--wow! Â I hope to come back soon!
