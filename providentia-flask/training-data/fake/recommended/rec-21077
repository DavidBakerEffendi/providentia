Came here for the first time and I loved it.  Everything is very fresh and the staff is very nice.   I had one of the many choices of savory crepes that they offer - chicken, pine nuts, tomatoes and pesto.  The portion was a good size, very tasty and filling.  The crepe came with a side salad of mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumbers topped with balsamic dressing and a large slice of fresh pineapple.   I also ordered one of the sweet crepe with choice of 2 fillings for my 2 yr old. Bananas and berries.   Delicious!   I would definitely recommend this place.
