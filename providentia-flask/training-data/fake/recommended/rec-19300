Based on the reviews here I thought: "Oh! this won't be typical hotel food" WRONG luckily I was there for a meeting and had a drink and a small plate (bacon egg and cheese flatbread) this was a frozen pizza with an egg on it... it sounded like a good idea but I should have known better. I blame myself mostly for even showing up here knowing full well midtown is the WORST place for food and that eating at a hotel is very rarely a good idea... Don't make the same mistake people. I would like to end on a positive note and say the staff/service was great.
