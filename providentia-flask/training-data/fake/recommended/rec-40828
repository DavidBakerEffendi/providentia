I am Sri Lankan born there and was raise there so I always look for good Sri Lankan food. In NYC there is not a lot of good Sri Lankan places. This place has the best Sri Lankan food and every time I order food, takes me back to Sri Lanka. They have the best food ever and the best dish I would say is crab curry. You have to order in advance but it's the best. also deviled shrimp, koththu roti and many other dishes that they make taste real good. this place is like traveling to Sri Lanka to eat it's that good.
