I love this place and have been here several times now and it still continues to impress me.  So upping my review to 5 stars.  Everything I've had here over multiple visits has been amazing.  Soba, lunch sets, sushi/sashimi.  It's all so good. Soba-ya is a pretty small space given it's popularity though.  So if you're coming with a big group (larger than 6) come early.  You'll notice people starting to stand outside and line up before the place opens.  So get in line and prepare yourself for a great meal.
