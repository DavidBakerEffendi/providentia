We were in Philly looking for a baby-friendly place to go and literally stumbled upon this place. It was great--a fun atmosphere, the whole chocolate theme--We loved it! We both had salads, they were delicious, and split an order of fries (dusted with chili & cocoa powder) and they were awesome. The churros w/dipping sauces for dessert were absolutely amazing! The only odd part was that our table was so close to the one next to it that we felt like we had planted ourselves right in the middle of an awkward date. However, I would definitely come back!
