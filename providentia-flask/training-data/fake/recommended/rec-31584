This place is mediocre to me. I have definitely had better tacos than this place. First off, it was hard for me to place an order because they fluff the titles for these tacos. Can we keep it simple people? After all, you are located in the ghetto where the surrounding population is not the most literate. Call a pork taco, Carnitas; not some fancy name you made up. Second, I think if you're an employee here, especially the cashier, it would behoove you to know the exact prices on the menu. The cashier was overcharging us for 3 tacos. The only reason my fiancée noticed was because we were low on cash and had just enough for only 3 tacos. We didn't know this place was cash only prior to walking in. Third and lastly, the tacos had no flavor. They were so bland. I had such high expectations because of all the reviews. Yea, these tacos did not live up to some of these raving reviews on here. I had a pork taco and my fiancée had a chicken. Both were bland. Maybe if we would've gotten a bigger piece of lime we could've added some flavor to these tacos. I barely got 3 drops out of the tiny piece of lime I was given. So first you overcharge me and then you're stingy with your lime? Yea I'm not impressed by this place. Also, in regards to the chicken taco, the chicken had a lot of fat in it. I got annoyed by having to pick out the fat that I didn't even finish the taco. I left here very unsatisfied and hungry. As far as the service, the cashier was nice. The wait wasn't too long. There were some college guys eating when we got there. There was one guy in front of us doing take out and one couple that came in after us. It was worth a shot trying it out but I would not recommend this place to other and I will not be going back.
