"Bring a suit" is what I was told a few days before I arrived in NYC to meet my girlfriend. It was a birthday dinner for me, and while she wouldn't tell me where we were going, I was told it would require a suit and I'd enjoy it. She was, as much as it pains me to admit such things, completely right about both. I am, as many people who may be on Yelp or even reading about this restaurant may be, a bit of a foodie. I've had the chance to eat at some truly amazing restaurants in my limited time, be it Michelin 3-stars, or needing Michelin off-roads to get to (see what I did there). Bouley is, in my opinion, one of the very best. From the foyer lined with apples, to the cart and waitstaff dedicated exclusively to artisan made breads, the service, food, and atmosphere were all exceptional. Everything was cooked to perfection, and in typical French cuisine fashion. There was never an empty plate in front of us, be it a main course or complimentary Â amuse bouche from the chef. Atmosphere is definitely dressy, jacket required, and reservations are a must. It isn't a bargin basement meal, but without a doubt worth it for a special night or occasion.
