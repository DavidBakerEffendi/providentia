I went here on a Saturday night. This place is great for people in their 30s and it has a pretty attractive, laid back crowd for the most part. I had one of the ciders (the name is failing me) and it was probably one of the best beers I've ever had. Definitely a place to go if you're a beer drinker and want to hang out with some friends without drama.
