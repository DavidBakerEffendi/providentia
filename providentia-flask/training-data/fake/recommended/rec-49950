This has no effect on my star review of this place. I have a pet peeve when it comes to my napkin. I keep it on my lap after the first portion of my foot from the chef's preference the server took the napkin I was using and re folded and placed it back on the table AFTER cleaning up a table by me. Please just don't touch my napkin. Now to the food! I don't know specifically what I had but I shared a plate that was wrapped in what I believe was pastrami, following by a sauce covered by peppers. Both where fantastic and had my pallet all over the place.  However it cane with this portion of two cheeses and sliced apples. They came with with sauces that didn't mesh well. There was to much contrast of sweet with the cheese. Next we got a mushroom and artichoke on flat bread and I ate it with one bite. It was awesome, I wish it was bigger. We got these little pieces of that looked like mozzarella sticks but it was ham.  When they were hot I kinda enjoyed them but they cooled down too fast by the second bite. We got garlic shrimp where I was forewarned it was very spicy. To me it wasn't. And I don't think they were too good.  Putting the garlic on the side made the shrimp better. At this point I'm not enjoying myself too much on the second round. Other than the quick mushroom and artichoke I'm disappointed on round two. Grilled asparagus with a poached egg. I don't think you can mess this up. Grilled scallops. As I'm eating this I feel like the combination of the food is upsetting my stomach. I can't even get to the NY strip steak and I love steak. I'm sure the place has great food but I'm have a bad experience. For the price I have to give one star but because of the service I will give two. The service was great.
