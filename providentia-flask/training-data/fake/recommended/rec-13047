A 2.5hr wait will get anyone hungry, however I have to say, maybe it was an off day, but the food here was subpar.  In fact, I didn't finish mine nor even come close.  It's not that the food was terrible, it just was blah.  The bacon was cold and overdone.  Tasted like it had been in a holding unit for way too long.  The biscuit and jam were good.  Solid but not great.  Would only go again if there was not wait. Also, to sit a party of three they simply turn a two-top (that's the restaurant name for a table that sits two) sideways to make it an additional 5 inches wider but shorter???  Not sure as I haven't taken geometry in awhile but that doesn't increase the space on the table top.  Anyways, beyond cramped and overall a very disappointing experience.
