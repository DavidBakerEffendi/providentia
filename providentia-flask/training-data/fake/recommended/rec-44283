Very good, albeit overpriced. I had the boom box sandwich which comes with your choice of meat and sauce, coleslaw, mac and cheese, and french fries all served on Texas toast with choice of side for $13. Really delicious, although I wish it had more sauce and BBQ taste to it. Will have to try something different when I go back next time. The interior of this place is lacking and ambiance is nonexistent, but the food is worth it.
