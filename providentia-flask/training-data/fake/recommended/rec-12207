From NOLA and in town for a convention.  Didn't know what I was getting into when I went hunting for a grilled cheese sandwich, but man did this place impress.  As a straight female I was wary that I wouldn't be welcome in what is obviously a gay establishment, but once I walked in I felt completely accepted.   My grilled cheese didn't disappoint, but what was more impressive was the live entertainment.  It was piano sing-along night on the second floor,  which was an absolutely fantastic accompaniment to my meal!   If I'm ever in Philly again I'll definitely be back.
