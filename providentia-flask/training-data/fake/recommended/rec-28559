Since recently going paleo, I've heard of Hu Kitchen and was itching to try it... Then one day as I was wandering around nyc, I happened to stumble upon it! I was a little uncertain of where exactly I was supposed to go at first but the place isn't very big or difficult to figure out; On the back wall is their hot food (rotisserie chicken, meatloaf, roasted broccoli, etc). They also have a build-your-own-bowl station and a case of (cold?) food for purchase by the pound (meatballs, chicken tenders, fish sticks). I probably would have preferred some of the food in this case but was unsure if that was only take-home-and-heat-up food or if the staff could heat it for you. I got the 1/4 rotisserie chicken, roasted sweet potatoes and roasted broccoli. All was what I expected, but it's just so nice to go out and not worry about ingredients! I wish I lived closer so I could come back and try some different options.
