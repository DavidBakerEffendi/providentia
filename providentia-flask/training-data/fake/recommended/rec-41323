Yerba Buena has the sort of name that makes you think you've heard of it before, even if you haven't heard of the restaurant.  Well, that's what happened when I went there the first time.   After walking around the EV and LES on a weekend afternoon, we happen upon YB and decide we want to check it out (because we both think we heard of it before).  We're greeted by a very friendly host who pulls out the table for my date, compliments her dress, seats us, and promptly gives us water and menus.   The waiter comes over, informs us of unlimited brunch cocktails, and gives us the specials.  Ummm, did you say unlimited cocktails?  Bring it!  I tried all 4 of their cocktail specials, and while a couple were a little sweet for my liking, they certainly helped change my outlook of the afternoon.   My date and I order: 1. Tres Arepas - short ribs, pork belly and chicken deliciousness.  Very well done! 2. Sandwich Cubano - this ain't your over-the-counter Cubano.  Their version is really delicious and awesome! 3. Ceviche Limeno - not the best, but well done and I would definitely eat it again.   The interior of the place is nice, vibey and sophisticated without being stuffy.  Good place to go for dinner with friends and also on a date.   I'm not exactly sure why, maybe because I was dating this girl for awhile at the time, but I decided to drink as many of their cocktails as possible.  I even asked for more booze in the sweet cocktail, but my waiter told me it was pre-mixed and not possible.  When the brunch special was ending, I asked for two more drinks to round out the afternoon.  He obliged my request with a look of surprise and no attitude.  At the end of the day, I think I probably drank like 8-10 drinks with brunch (I mean mimosas are easy to drink and refreshing) but fear not, my review nor palate were swayed by all the drinks ;p
