Might be the best truck on Temple's campus! I've never had a crepe until I came here my freshman year. My friend who was at Temple before me said I had to try this place when I finally got here. It's been 5 years, 10 semester and I still love this place. For $5 you can get a savory crepe totally worth it! You can ask them to change the dressing or what veggies you want in it whenever and they are really open to that. My favor is the dozer. BBQ and ribs! Cannot go wrong! I will miss this truck when I graduate!
