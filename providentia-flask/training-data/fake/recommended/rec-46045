Sorry to say what I ate was tasty. But comm'on, everything is tiny. Chips tiny, salsa tiny, good, but tiny. Tacos tiny. Charge a fortune for teenie tacos . I want to double my order but it's not a good value. So why throw money at something that insults my sense of logic. ( drive up the road to chipotle ) I like Spanish food. ( it's the food of my peeps) so when I ask for rice and beans and charge me five dollars, shouldn't it be more than a cup (combined). It doesn't make sense to my Latino side. Sorry. I'm not a dope that buys into the hipster small plates thing. Charge me 15 00 for a plate if food   But I'm not paying 15 bucks for  two tacos the size if silver dollar pancakes and rice and beans in the amount that is normally left on a serving spoon in any kitchen who claims to serve Mexican food. I won't be back. No mas.
