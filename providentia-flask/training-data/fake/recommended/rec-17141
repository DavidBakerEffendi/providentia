#Glutenfree My lovely sister is a newly diagnosed celiac so for her birthday her wonderful man scouted out this celiac-friendly Italian joint. We made a reservation about an hour beforehand late on a Saturday night. the restaurant was full but not too crazy. It is dark and has various items on the wall including photos of Venice and a weird spacey light fixture. It was a little warm inside, and that was before we started eating. Upon being seated the waitress immediately asked if there were any food allergies. The menu is clearly labeled for people with gluten intolerance, with offerings of gluten free pasta, pizza, bread, beer, and dessert. That takes some of the stress out of dining and allows for more enjoyment, of which there was plenty. We started with the Roman Artichokes (very good, especially considering we recently returned from Rome), Burrata (so creamy) and eggplant (didn't try). We all enjoyed. Then we had the chicken entree x 2 (one with added pasta, one without), gluten free penne with broccoli rabe and sausage, and steak. We all enjoyed our entrees except the steak, but I think that was a matter of personal preference as it had a balsamic sauce and avocado on it and the diner expected something more traditional. The only point I will deduct on is the dessert. Everyone knows chocolate lava cake is the best option but they didn't have a gluten free version. That is just a huge tease. There are GF options so we had the crime brûlée and gelato. Molto bene!
