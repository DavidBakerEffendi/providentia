Marc Forgione was everything. Everyone was so inviting, and the food was astounding. Don't even think about skipping dessert though! That PB&J panna cotta was too good. The only con I can think of was that the margarita was a little tangy for my taste, and a little delay with the check, but nothing that'll keep me from coming back
