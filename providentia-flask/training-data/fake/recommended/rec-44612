The first japanese tea room I tried in NY and was pretty pleased. The tea selection is vast with traditional leaf teas and also a nice selection of herbal teas. The highlight of this tea house however is the exquisite desserts they prepare to compliment your teas. We had the black sesame creme brulee and an unforgettable toast dish with whip cream and ice cream over it (with hints of sake and a citrus flavor added to the mix). Both were excellent and light.
