One of my longtime favorites... I went Saturday night, my first time in almost two years. So much in New York changes in the blink of an eye -- it's so comforting to find a place that stays so good for so long. Same strong and excellent margaritas, same friendly service, same killer micheladas, same perfect chunky guacamole. One new thing (to me, at least)? The barbacoa. I was hesitant to veer from my usual order (enchiladas verdes). But curiosity got the better of me and I went for it: a huge bowl of shredded lamb in a red chile sauce with rice and pickled onions. Sorry, enchiladas, but now you have some real competition. Yes, the place is tiny and the wait can be long. The best way to pass the time? Put in your name, then head a few doors down and have a glass of wine at The Ten Bells. You may be really hungry by the time your table is ready but that just means there's room for even MORE guac.
