We went here recently for dinner.  The food was good but underwhelming. The service was superb, hence the two stars.  The ambience is low key, no fuss. Spicy duck meatballs - very good dish. The surprise was in the duck meat. Very unexpected flavor due to the quail egg. 4 Hake - the waitress recommended this. It was very much like cod, like she suggested. I specifically chose this dish because I love fish and veggies. The dish lacked flavor and IMO it was mediocre.  2 Pork chop - another dish that I thought was okay. My bf is an easy eater and he even said the pork chop wasn't as good as the other popular restaurants we've tried in the past. He did say at least the pork chop was cooked right. The fig compote was a nice addition but something about the dish that just didn't work. 2 Soufflé - dark chocolate is my favorite kind of chocolate. You cannot go wrong with a dark chocolate soufflés with coffee syrup. 3 1/2 I read on the reviews that they're known for their hanger steak. The problem is I've tried 2 dishes out of 8 and both weren't as good as I was expecting from a top chef restaurant, I don't know if ill come back only for the service.  I've tried quite a few restaurants here in New York and this restaurant was one of my least favorite.
