Was here for a friend's birthday. The owners are really Italians. I speak Italian myself and visit a lot. Always was looking for a restaurant in NYC that has authentic Italian food and there were none found until I came across this one. A little bit pricey but it's totally worth it. I rarely have enough courage for a 4 course meal but felt like I really need to try everything. And I wasn't disappointed.
