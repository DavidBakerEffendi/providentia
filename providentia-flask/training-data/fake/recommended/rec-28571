It hurts a little bit to give Cafe Henri only three stars because I'm a foodie and Cafe Henri has great food.  There are enough reasons for me to not be able to give it four stars, though, that I have to.  Despite really yummy brunch, including Nutella Crepes, I've next to stopped visiting Cafe Henri because: 1. The waitstaff is pretentious and slooow.  If they were one or the other, I'd be able to understand.  "Sure, they're rude, but they're busy,"  or "They're taking forever to do anything, but at least she's friendly." Nope.  Neither.  I've had to beg and plead for water and wine more than once.  At least booze me up if you're going to take forever to do anything! 2. I would define the ambiance as French Trashy.  I understand they're trying to obtain a French bistro feel, but they do it by making you sit in lawn chairs and painting a perfectly nice exposed brick wall yellow.  Boo.  Their bathroom is strangely darling and slightly psycho-killer-creepy at the same time.  I do love that.   3. I understand that the French eat high calorie foods in small quantities, whereas us Americans just eat a shit-ton.  I know it's a French restaurant, and it's logical for there to be butter and eggs in everything, but as one of many health-conscious New Yorkers trying to fit in her clothing, it'd be nice to have an option or two on the menu that didn't make my jeans pop just thinking about them.
