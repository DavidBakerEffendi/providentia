This place is great. Popped in for lunch and had the chicken sandwich, fries, and an iced coffee. The chicken sandwich was cooked perfectly and the bread was amazing.  I really like how they put the right amount of sauce on it to not overwhelm the taste of the chicken and bread.  The fries were lightly cheesed just enough.  Everything was super fresh. Can't wait to come back.
