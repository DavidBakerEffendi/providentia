Consider me a new fan of Hot Diggity.  I stumbled upon this place last night in a desperate rush to get a quick dinner before a Fringe Festival show (stupid 2-hour traffic jam on 76 left me with 10 minutes to grab a bite before curtain).  Wow, am I glad I did!   First, let's talk about the dogs.  They are as darn close to perfect as you can get.  The dog casing has that classic "snap" when you bite into it, and their rolls are chewy, slightly crusty, flavorful ones instead of the typical bland fluffy little things you get at other places.  I had to go with a classic, the Windy City, and it was delicious -- Chicago-style presentation with sliced tomatoes, pickles, red onion, relish, mustard and celery salt.  NOM.  Let me also say that I'm not a huge relish person, but Hot Diggity's relish has converted me -- it's fresh-tasting, bright beautiful green, little bit of a tang.  I will never eat that grayish soupy slop relish from the supermarket again. To top it off, the people working there couldn't have been nicer.  One guy (the owner?) even came over to my table to ask me how I liked the food.  He said they've been in business about 3 months, I really hope they're successful and stick around for a long time.   Extra bonus -- they don't force a minimum credit card charge.  It seems like every other place on South Street requires at least $10...  Hot Diggity doesn't mind credit cards at all.  So if you're like me, and rarely have actual cash in your wallet, you can grab a quick bite there without searching for an ATM.  High five.
