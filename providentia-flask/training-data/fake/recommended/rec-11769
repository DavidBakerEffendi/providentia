I have been to Beyoglu twice.  Both times, it was relatively easy to get a reservation, and they honored it - we were seated on time, if not early.  I also really appreciated that they sat our party of 6 when only 4 had arrived.   For food, the appetizer menu (hot and cold) is extensive!  Both times, I have really enjoyed the hummus, dolma, and taramah/ fish roe spread.  Others also really liked the Boreka (dough and cheese), too.  The dinner menu has fewer options than I expected, but the Iskander Kebab is good - it has pita on the bottom, which soaks up the delicious sauce.  If you have a potentially picky eater in your group, I recommend previewing the menu, or perhaps ordering a bunch of appetizers in place of an entree, given the selection. Aside from the limited entrees, the only other thing that led me to a 4 (rather than a 5) is the cake fee ($20) that we were charged for bringing in a birthday cake.  After 5 appetizers (for 6 people), a bottle of wine, and entrees, it seemed like nickel-and-diming for something that took little to no effort on their part.  My suggestion would be to waive the cake fee on checks over a certain amount of money, if not dropping it in general.
