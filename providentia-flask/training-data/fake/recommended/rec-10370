Very tasty, affordable Thai food in a very non-Thai uber-modern space (think clear plastic bar chairs and a giant chandelier in the middle as a focal point).  Loses stars for pedestrian drinks that cost more than the much higher quality dishes.  Some people love the variety of mojitos...but I personally thought they were too busy...especially the blueberry one which I saw at adjoining tables being put down after a few sips and never touched again.  There are better Thai options on 9th Ave.
