What a great addition to the neighborhood.  Beautifully decorated, simple (and affordably priced) wine list and terrific french leaning cuisine. The Mussels are one of the best that I have had in the city.  It's tough to find a place that actually makes mussels right but Chez Moi can pull it off.  I would recommend sharing the mussels as an entree and enjoying a few of the appetizers or soups between every two people.
