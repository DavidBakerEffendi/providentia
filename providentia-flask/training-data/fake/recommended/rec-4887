The beer selection on tap is fantastic at Good Dog, that and the sweet potato mixed with potato fries are the best reasons for going there. The signature stuffed burger was pretty good, a little dry, not the best I've had but has an interesting flavor. There is a good selection of entrees for vegetarians too which is a plus. It can get packed here, but has a great atmosphere and it can't get any cuter with all dog pics on the wall. The staff is attentive and friendly, it's a good place for an afternoon drink and snack.
