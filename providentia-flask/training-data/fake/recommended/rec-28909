Consistently wonderful, authentic Italian food and super-friendly service are the main hallmarks of Mannino's. Whether you're in the mood for a takeout New york style thin-crust pizza or a full sit-down Italian meal, this is the place! It's BYOB, which makes the already reasonable prices even more attractive. A really nice dinner out with all the trimmings can be had for under $50 for two. The ambiance of the back room is fantastic; perfect for a romantic dinner, while the front room is more casual if you're only in the mood for a quick slice and a soda. I've even popped in here to get take-out desserts on the way home. This is truly a hidden gem!
