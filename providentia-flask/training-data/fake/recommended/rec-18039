Visited here today, a rainy Wednesday morning before thanksgiving. There were about 3 tables seated when I walked in. I was greeted and told I could sit wherever I'd like. The waitress was at my table shortly after. She was very kind and polite. I ordered a cup of coffee, a water, and the chicken and waffles. The waitress brewed a fresh pot of coffee which was nice. Â I really enjoyed the chicken and waffles. It had a great outer coating of what seemed like corn flakes and spices, making it crispy on the outside and nice and juicy on the inside. The spices were very tasty in my opinion, however, if you are a person that cannot handle any spice, I would suggest you order something else (or perhaps they can leave the spices out). The waitress was kind and I never felt rushed. I was checked on throughout my meal, received a coffee refill when it was low, and my check was delivered in a timely manner. I enjoyed my visit here and will definitely be back.
