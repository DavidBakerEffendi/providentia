I really like it here. As a non hipster vegan, I find myself really out of place many places in Old City.  However, whenever I go to Khyber Pass I don't feel this way so thats a major plus.  I believe they have a pretty extensive beer menu. I've never drank here but everyone else seems to be drinking so that must mean something? The vegan popcorn is SOOOOO good. The vegan chocolate cake is good too but the vegan red velvet cupcake is literally amazing. The icing isn't that store bought hard crap, it is hot and gooey and amazing. One time I ordered one cupcake for pickup and they gave me 4 instead. I have no idea why- if they wanted to get rid of them or just messed up big time I'll never know- but opening the container and finding 4 cupcakes was like Christmas morning and they were still awesome the next day.  Overall, Khyber Pass is a win in my book!
