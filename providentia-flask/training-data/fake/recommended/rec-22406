Star of India is simply the best. I have been coming here at least once a week for over a year now. The food is superb! I've been to a few different Indian restaurants, but none have compared to Star of India. Besides the food, the staff is pretty awesome. They're always friendly and attentive. Everyone I bring here absolutely loves it!
