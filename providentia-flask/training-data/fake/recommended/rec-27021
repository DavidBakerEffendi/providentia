Food was delicious but you needed a flashlight to read the menu. Lighting was definitely a turn off. Â Our table of two was squeezed between two tables of four and trust me there is nothing more troubling then the backside of a waiter in your face....if we could have read the dessert menu (no flashlight) would have continued our dining with dessert and a cordial verses moving on to another establishment. Very unfortunate because the experience overshadowed wonderful starters & entrees. Perhaps the restaurant is better suited for groups then for parties of two. Expected more for the price point.
