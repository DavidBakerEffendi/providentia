The pastas were very flavorful. The stuffed whole calamari was fantastic. Best italian gravy. My cowoker had the fettucini filetto and I had the papardelle with tomato and basil in white wine sauce. Very very tasty. We topped off the meal with vanilla and Spimoni gelatto and le columbe coffee. The german reisling was one of the best reislings i've had, even though the waiter recommended an Italian red wine.  Make sure to request not to be placed in the bar the ambiance of the other rooms is much cozier.   All in all, it made me miss Italy.
