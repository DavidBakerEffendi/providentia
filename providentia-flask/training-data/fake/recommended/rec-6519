I love going out in the east village and places like this are the reason why.   It's small, it's cozy, it's casual, and the food is terrific.  It has the feel of authenticity and there were several people speaking Slavic languages all around me. My friends and I shared the several appetizers and the mixed-grill for two, which was as it sounds, a giant plate of delicious grilled meat. Try thePita Sa Visnjama (sour cherry pie); it was recommended to us by the incredibly helpful and nice wait-staff and it didn't disappoint.
