This place is quite nice.  The food is rock solid and speedy.  The staff is very accommodating as well as highly friendly without being annoying. But this is a parking-lot restaurant.  Once inside the place feels a little different, but it is still large and open.  Not the most cozy place to go.  I have sat in a few different places and each place still feels very open.  It may just be me, but it is worth a try for the food at least. For a dinner with multiple people and low care for quiet then definitely check this place out.  But for a low key dinner for two - look elsewhere.
