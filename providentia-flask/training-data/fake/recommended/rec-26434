First time eating sushi in brooklyn. It's my bf's fav place so of course he had to take me here. Cute small japanese place. We sat at the corner table for privacy and got hot sake since it was freezing outside. Started with 3 diff appetizers. I"m more of a sashimi person, but this place is def good for their rolls, we then went out to order 4 more rolls. By the end we were both extremely full and still couldn't finish the plate, and we both eat ALOT. Â We had another bottle of hot sake towards the end. Total bill he said was only 80 for the amt of food and alcohol we got. Pretty damn cheap. Love the waiters, very friendly and nice
