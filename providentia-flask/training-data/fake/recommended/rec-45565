We were forced to wait in the cold for about 20 min., my husband refused and put me inside to wait. The not so bright host told us we could not wait inside and then basically told us to leave, we asked to speak with the manager. She was accommodating and her customer service skills were 5 stars. However, I would not go back as the decent food quality did not outweigh the wait, rush to get you out, and poor service (with exception of the manager).
