Been meaning to get here for a while.  Noodles were delicious - nice texture, flavor and perfectly cooked.  The broth was not as rich as I expected it to be and a tiny bit greasy for my taste.  The duck in the soup was delicious.   I tried the pork dumplings and can say I have had better elsewhere.  The noodles are the star here and price for everything was right.   Would deffinitely go back and get the noodles and next time would like to just try those in a peanut sauce.
