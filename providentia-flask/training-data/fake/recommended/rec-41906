Wonderful as always. I have been here 3 times and the service is excellent.  The food is fabulous and perfectly cooked. I had the duck, medium-rare, and my boyfriend had the pork belly. We were both so in love with our dishes that we didn't even share, which we always do.  Loved the table side presentation of the mushroom soup. I must repeat: the service is perfection. Small and cozy atmosphere. Walking distance from my apartment...what more can a girl ask for?
