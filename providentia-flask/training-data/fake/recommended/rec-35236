I'm from Japan and I know good taste of ramen. This place is so far the best ramen in NYC. It's Kyushu (south side of japan) style which is pork bone taste and thin straight noodle. (I actually love Sapporo : northern island names Hokkaido) style ramen which is yellow lil thick noddle, and miso taste) Taste is the best but lil pricy.. In japan, ippudo ramen is about 7-9$ ...(but also taste not good as NYC one) But I love this place! Because of my rate is 4, it's always long line (wait for hour) and pricey.
