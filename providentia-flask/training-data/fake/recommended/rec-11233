This is by far my favorite sushi place in Philadelphia. We eat here at least once a week or get delivery through grub hub. The fish is extremely fresh. It is a BYOB and a great date spot. The environment is very relaxing and intimate with 6 table tops and a sushi bar. My favorites are the avocado salad and spicy scallop roll. It is a hidden gem!!
