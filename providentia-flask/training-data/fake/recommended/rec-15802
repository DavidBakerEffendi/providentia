What a fantastic place! As someone who used to live right near Greektown in Chicago, and has visited Greece, I am a bit picky about my Greek food. This place really does Greek food right- everything was delicious! The only reason they are getting four stars is that I wasn't wowed by the service. If they just take up the personality a nothc, I would give them five stars.
