Introduced to me as a "chefs' restaurant" because the food is that good and the kitchen closes at 4am Blue Ribbon is a great place to hit after a late night flight whence in search of good cooked meal. The problem with a chefs' restaurant, however, is the nepotism shown to those who are obviously in the food service industry; and I get that but that doesn't mean I subscribe. I ordered the Skate without the bacon for my entree but started with the Fried Oysters. I was not disappointed at all! The Fried Oysters were tasty and succulent! The condiment they were served with were the perfect accompaniment but I could have devoured them without. The skate was really good and the potatoes it was laid on were just as tasty! The food was great and the atmosphere was lively. The cost is pretty hefty and a two person meal can easily run you $100 plus. All in all my experience was pleasant but was told I should have gone to the Brooklyn location! I guess its now on the list...
