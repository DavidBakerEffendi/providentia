Visited for lunch the first time yesterday. Overall a very good experience. the manager made the rounds of each table and was very genuine. Made us feel like we were frequent visitors. Food was superbly cooked with the exception of the Calamari appetizer - the calamari was fresh and tasty but the breading was a little heavy (like you get at the steakhouses) and the marinara very bland. A nice touch was the white fish "spread" the put out with the bread. It was very good but let's call it what it was - whitefish salad like I put on my bagels - more Jewish than not! This restaurant being a sister to the Benjamin Steakhouse has service that is run very much like a steakhouse and I mean this in a very good way. Servers were attentive without being intrusive and had personality. Avra now has some strong competition.
