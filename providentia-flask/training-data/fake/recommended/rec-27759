The food was all right, but for the price they really could have done more.  The food wasn't even worth it. The main issue, however, was the staff. Our server was unbelievably unprofessional and had no understanding of personal boundaries. He also didn't listen at all to some of the things we asked for, such as not pouring too much of an expensive dessert wine at once as well as other requests. Moreover, by the end of the meal, no one could be found to deliver or take the check.  He and the rest were obviously under-trained in fine dining, which is fine at a diner or Cracker Barrel or something, but seriously if you're charging this much for food and atmosphere, you'd better make sure your patrons are getting what's appropriate for their money. I've been there twice and both times I was disappointed. I will not go back and, unless you want to throw away your money, neither should you.
