Loco Pez is my favorite place to go. It's better than work and closer than the beach. It's only a block from my house, actually. Which makes it extra good. All the food is delicious. Try their brunch, too! Â The only thing I've ever had there that I didn't like was a mescal drink that they promptly replaced after seeing my facial expression.
