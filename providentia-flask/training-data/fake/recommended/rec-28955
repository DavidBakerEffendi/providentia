My plus one and I, two years after our first excursion into Village Whiskey, ventured back on one of our rare "in the USA" moments. We had fond memories of Village Whiskey... not only did we have delicious drinks and fries the last time we'd visited, we'd also started what has become an epic romance. So believe me when I say... we wanted Village Whiskey to be as perfect as its supporters believe it to be. Alas. Look, Village Whiskey is good. We had the Ginger Rogers and the Fish House for that Philadelphian buzz and we have no complaints. The cheese puffs were good, though most of the flavor was in the shredded cheese topping. The deviled eggs were solid, if straightforward, and the tots... well... no offense to the chefs, but I've had better tots from the grocery store. The tots were crisp to the point of burned on the outside, while mushy in the middle. Napoleon Dynamite disapproves, and so do I. Ultimately, Village Whiskey falls into the unfortunate category of "overrated." The drinks are properly delicious and the appetizers are good... but ultimately, it isn't worth the rave reviews and the standard 45 minute wait time. If you can walk in for a couple of drinks and some cheese puffs, by all means... stop by. If you're told that there's that standard 45 minute wait, though... there are better options.
