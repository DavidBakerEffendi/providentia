I have to say that if you were to judge a book by the cover, then this is the place to be.  It has a great atmosphere.  I love the windows and the second level (it allows for an open breeze experience).   Overall, I will say that the service is the pits.  Maybe they are still getting the hang of things; however, my friend and I waited about 30 minutes for the waiter to bring our drink from the bar.  That was just crazy.   The wait staff is "too quick" to provide you with a good experience.   I may thy this place again; however, I will certainly wait until it has been open for a few months and their service improves.
