This is one of my favorite burgers in the city.  Their blend of meat, coupled with the cheese and onions is absolutely delicious.  I am also a big fan of the bacon option, and love that they mix it right in with the meat.  Their sauce options are also stellar, especially the jalapeno sauce.  The fries are a little dry but the burgers more than make up for it.
