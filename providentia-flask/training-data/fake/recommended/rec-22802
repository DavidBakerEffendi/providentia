What a place! Recently I have been on a Portuguese food kick. Having a great section in Hartford to go visit and eat, I decided to check this place out. Â I was welcomed by a friendly woman who asked if I needed any help. I told her I was looking to make salt cod. She was gracious and helped me with cooking tips and ideas for my salt cod. They have all sorts of sausage, fresh fish, canned and dry goods. Overall friendly, are willing to answer any questions for the uninitiated or unfamiliar.
