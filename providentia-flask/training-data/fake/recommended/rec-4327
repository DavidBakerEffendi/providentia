Full disclosure: I've grown up eating chaat and other tea time snacks, and when we tried (and failed) to eat at Kilimindjaro for dinner last night, we ended up at Mood anticipating that we'd be leaving still wanting a full meal. How wrong we were. There's not much seating here, and parking's a bit of a pain. Once we had that sorted out, we ordered: fig lassi, rose lassi, bhel puri, and a lamb dish. We tried to order one more chaat, but Hassan assured us that he would put the lamb on a salad, making it one of his salad chaats, and that we would have more than enough food. He was right. I love rose flavored drinks and desserts, the boo does not however, as he finds the flavor to be overpowering. Not so with the rose lassi - just the right amount of that subtle hint of flavor. The fig was fantastic, too - and Hassan's blender makes more than what fits into the plastic smoothie glasses, so you'll get an extra plastic cup filled with bonus lassi. The bhel puri was unlike anything we've had before. Traditionally, it's a dish with puffed rice, sev (crunchy thin noodle-like), potatoes, chickpeas, coriander, and onions. You can top it off with either coriander based or tamarind based chutney. Hassan takes artistic license with his bhel puri chaat - in addition to all of the traditional components, there was some hot sauce, mango, fig, and yogurt. Looking at it, I was confused as to how all of those things would work together, but don't question the magic, it was absolutely delicious. Â  The lamb salad chaat was a similarly confusing, but ultimately delicious experience. The lamb had the right texture to hold together in a salad, and had a nice cumin flavor to it. As we were among the last customers, all of us in the restaurant got a free dessert. Folks, even if we had to pay for it, that rice pudding/khir was amazing - the rice was so tender, and the pudding perfectly sweet. Can't wait for our next adventure here!
