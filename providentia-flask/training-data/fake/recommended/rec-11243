I have been here twice for just beer but more recently we went for food. Every time I was here it smelled so good so I knew I had to come back. I had the salmon BLT. It was served on a multigrain focaccia type (the best way to describe it). The waiter did warn me that the salmon would be medium rare. It was the first time I have had seared salmon and I wasn't in love with it. I love raw salmon, smoked salmon and cooked salmon but I didn't love it medium rare on a sandwich. The fries are great, those homemade shoe string types. My boyfriend ordered the steak medium well. It was more like medium rare. The center was a dark red, and he was not happy with it at all. I have come to the conclusion that medium rare is the style of the this chef. It's not something I prefer but maybe others do.
