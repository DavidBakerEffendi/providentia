SPACE: beautiful and on the romantic side, the chandelier is really eye catching SERVICE: we couldn't decide if our hostess was female or female-female... it was the topic of conservation for the evening; waiter was very nice and helpful FOOD: Coconut Calamari Tempura (3 stars) Shrimp Parcels (3 stars) Room Service Tuna Tartar (4 stars) Room Service Pad Thai (3.5 stars) Having eaten at so many Thai restaurants, we opted to go for items we've never had before....or made in a different way.  There weren't too many options as the menu was the standard list of options.   The "Eat Like A Bangkokian" menu had one item that caught our attention: Room Service Pad Thai - sauteed glass vermicelli with shrimp, mixed seafood, mangoes, brown tofu, bean sprouts, scallions, crushed peanuts, tamarind juice & purple coconut milk beet sauce, wrapped in an egg white crepe.
