Casual place for dinner the hell over on the west side of Manhattan. The inside was cozy, it's a small place but it doesn't feel overly crowded. They have a neat little decor going on, what with the dark wood and red colors. The food is decent, but almost forgettable. I was there not too long ago, and the main thing I remember is the delicious salad with bacon and brie. I know I had a main course and dessert as well, but it's flying out of my mind. Obviously, it wasn't horrible either, but nothing that will stick with you in the future.
