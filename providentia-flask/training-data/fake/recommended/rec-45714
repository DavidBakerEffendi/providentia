Who said New Yorkers aren't friendly? I'm from out of town and the owners are the friendliest people! I came here because of the great reviews. We got the kale & corn salad and the vegetarian tamales. Â Loved them both! My friend and I shared so we can taste both. I am definitely coming back when I visit again!
