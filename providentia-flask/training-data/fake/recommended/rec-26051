New Year's Day brunch is something I take very seriously. There are few traditions I hold as dear as this one, so choosing Beco as this year's venue was no small thing, especially never having been. I'd walked by it a hundred times or more (probably way less though), and had heard great things from one of my roomiez. The prixe fixe brunch was what caught my eye initially, though. For like $15 you are allowed an entree, an espresso drank, and a boozier option--its like the management are writing prescriptions for hangovers back there. All this aside, the experience itself was lacking. We arrived just before the rush, and thank the good lord, because if I--like others after us--had waited around for a tepid cappuccino, pedestrian steak-and-eggs, and NO mimosa, there would have been a one-man riot on Richardson Street. As it turned out, we did wait an inordinate amount of time for those things to arrive to the table, and we almost missed the early closing of Graham Ave Meats and Deli because of it.* I feel a bit bad, though. It was our server's first day (really?? you're starting a new server for the brunch rush on New Year's Day??), and my girlfriend's french toast was actually pretty great. Neither of us got our booze, but it was taken off the bill, and we got some bloody's on our way home. I'll give this place another shot, but maybe just the one. *Not to worry, we got our sandwiches.
