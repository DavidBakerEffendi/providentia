This is a perfect place to stop after a night out bar hopping, but I would not recommend it on a daily basis. While the staff is knowledgeable about their menu, extremely friendly and not hesitant to strike up a conversation with their customers, the restaurant's namesake left something to be desired. The basic mac and cheese gives you the best idea of what the quality is, and unfortunately I was underwhelmed and was left unsatisfied. It seemed as if it needed sharper cheddar or additional flavors. Also, the breadcrumb topping seemed to just add to masking any flavor that may have come out of the dish originally. Also, while the decor was whimsical, I felt like I wasn't in a gourmet restaurant so much as a cartoon. The name and the decor did not match up at all and I wasn't left wanting to stick around and eat in the restaurant, particularly because of the bright colors and uninviting ambiance. As stated before, it's a great place to stop at the end of a night bar hopping, but I would not recommend it otherwise.
