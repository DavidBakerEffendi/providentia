A few girlfriends from work and I went to this place for a little New Year get together.  The vibe was just casual and trendy enough to be comfortable.  We had one pitcher of each of the sangria specials which were very good.  The food was excellent - there was almost too many choices, it was hard to decide what to get!  The wait staff was very attentive, but didnt rush us out even though the place was fairly crowded.  Would definitely go back.
