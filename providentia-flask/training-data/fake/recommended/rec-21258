Ippudo. You are great. Best ramen I've had in New York. I want to give you 5 stars, but you only get 4, and this is why: 1. You're expensive. Ramen's supposed to be cheap. Not $14/bowl. This ripoff would not work anywhere else on the planet. 2. If you were based in California, taste-wise you would be considered above average at best. 3. Your waits are comparable to Disneyland waits. 4. You have white employees screaming hello and goodbye in Japanese. Would you want Chinese people screaming hola at Rosa Mexicano? What about Black people screaming ni hao at Momofuku? I'm not trying to be racist, it's just weird. So that's why you get 4 stars. You'll get 5 if you get rid of the screaming white people.
