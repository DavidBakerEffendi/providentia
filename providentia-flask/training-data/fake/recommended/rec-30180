One of my favorite restaurants in NYC, I love that the menu is ever changing with seasonal ingredients. Great place for a late afternoon cocktail, brunch and dinner. My favorites are the fluke carpaccio, clam roast and pastas. The staff is so nice. When I brought my puppy here and the hostess rushed outside "to seat the puppy" and brought him dog biscuit made by the pastry chef!
