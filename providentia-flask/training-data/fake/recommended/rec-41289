Chuko is my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn! My boyfriend and I came here the second day it was open, and we make a point of going there at least monthly (although I could probably eat here every single day!) To me nothing is better than to sit at the bar and stuff my face with Brussel Sprouts, a shrimp bun, and a steaming hot bowl of miso ramen!I have never failed to enjoy a meal here, and pleasant conversations with the wait staff! Becky is especially delightful, and never fails to mention when we haven't been there for awhile! (I'm sorry Becky we will never stay away that long again!) Tonight I was especially inspired to write a review. Not only was their soundtrack spot on (always appreciated!) but the owner came out and gave us an extra shrimp bun because he feared that the one he originally gave us was too small for us to share!! It was sooo unnecessary, extremely kind, and very much delicious! I don't think I could have thanked him enough, so to show my appreciation I thought I'd finally write a review about my favorite restaurant in all of Brooklyn, or Manhattan for that matter! Ippudo and momofuko have NOTHING on Chuko!
