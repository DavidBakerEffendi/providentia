I'm going to have to echo the cries of lousy service and subpar food. I do not understand why this location underperforms so drastically. I've been to the Moorestown, NJ location and the food is always delicious and the service exceptional. I've given the Princeton location a handful of chances and each time I'm left disappointed. They really need to work on their process b/c two flustered cashiers, 1 table runner and 5 people in the kitchen (one crankily yelling 'that'll be out in 2 seconds!' every time someone asks where their order is) are not getting the job done. I felt bad for the cashiers today b/c there was literally nothing they can do b/c the food was just not coming out fast enough and when it did there was no rhyme or reason to the orders so they could assemble them quickly. I think out of the 5x I've been there I've actually had one god meal - the rest of the times something has been forgotten (today it was the dressing for my salad) or the food hasn't been prepared properly. Undercooked noodles, protein not seared properly, 'gloppy' sauces, etc. And it takes far too long - I hesitate to compare it to Chipotle next door b/c the food is prepared as it is ordered whereas Chipotle has a different menu model. But it is hard to ignore the fact that there are 5-ish people in line at Pei Wei and it takes 35 minutes for them to prepare my salad while the line is out the door at Chipotle and you can be in and out in 12 minutes (I timed it once). I certainly hope they improve, but I don't hold out much hope as they've been open for at least a year now (possibly longer?). Management really needs to think about restructuring the process and how to handle not only the lunch time rush but the overall service model.
