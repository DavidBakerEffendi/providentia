We're new to the Hanover area but I've had tapas at great places in Chicago. I'd say the menu options are more vast and accommodating in Chicago but, being Hanover, this place was a pleasant surprise.   We ordered a glass of Sangria (the owner let me try 3 different wines before I settled on the Sangria although one of the white wines was good too) and a glass of Sangrita.   My husband doesn't eat pork so we order 3 non-pork dishes (lamb, meatballs, and steak filled plantain cup) and 1 pork one (breaded sausages).   I loved all 4 but the lamb had some fatty parts I thought should have been trimmed and the sweet potatoes served with it was stringy.  In my culture, we remove the strings from sweet potatoes during prep and would never served them this way but...it's my culture and not their culture so I overlooked it.   Past reviewers have complained about noise.  Tapas restaurants in Chicago are always loud with conversation, laughter, and wine. If you're concerned with the noise then you're not drinking and eating enough.  Quiet restaurants are usually reserved for the uptight.   For 2 drinks and 4 tapas we paid about $60.  Not sure if that's expensive but we were happy with both the service and food.
