Pure Thai Cookhouse is by far the best Thai food I've ever ate in my entire life.  I went there again to make sure It wasn't just a good day I came across and this place is excellent.  Beautiful, clean restaurant that is small but cozy with great customer service every time.  Thai Iced tea mmM delicious and if you like spicy food, they are the spiciest I tried out of anywhere in NYC to upstate NY.  It's difficult to recommend a dish because this is one of those places that makes everything on their menu good.
