I have been to Salinas multiple times not only for the food, but for the shiek design and friendly staff. The menu is limited, but in my opinion I think this makes for a tastier meal. Their sangria is absolutely amazing and I have ordered the chicken on multiple occasions. Their tapas selections are nothing short but scrumptious. Let's face it though, their are many places in the city that can offer a lot of what I said, so here is why I go back. The owner/master chef always seems to take care of me when I go there. I have no relation with him and I am sure he doesn't remember me and postive that I'm not the only one he takes care. My first time there, my reservations was "missed" but he quickly compensated by sending some free treats and even a glass of wine for both me and my date on the house. How many places do you know that do that? The staff is just as friendly and they know the contents of the menu without hesitation. This is totally an awesome date spot whether first or fifthieth and I will continue to return there!
