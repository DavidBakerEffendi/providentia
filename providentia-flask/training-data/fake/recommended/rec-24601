Love love love The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because it is so small that if you come after 730 with no reservation good luck. Though I never felt truly rushed, they were on top of what we may have needed to keep along the process. Great wait staff, courteous and friendly and ready with explanations of the food. The scallops with Brussel sprouts were amazing. The squid in squid ink perfectly cooked. I love the small space but make a reservation or come before 7p. They have a nice wine by the glass selection.
