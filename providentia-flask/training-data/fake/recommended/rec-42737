Second day in Manhattan second great meal.  Everything about the pizza screamed authentic coal fire pie done to perfection.  There is a reason that everyone says this place is the best.  Trust them and trust me that the pepperoni with onions and olives was hands down amore like a big pizza pie.  No matter how far you search you will not find this in your neck of the woods.  For you 808's out there JJ's is great but as they say "it's the wata," and I say fugedaboudit!
