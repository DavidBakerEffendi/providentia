Our 40 min became 20 min. Yay! For NYC, this place is pretty spacious, yet still a decent wait. I have never tried the others in Cali, but I did fall in love with these burgers. Dishes: Truffle burger - YUMMY!! I had it medium rare, cooked to perfection! Although it was a small portion it was just the right size. The bun was cute with a U on it and soft and fluffy. It was well truffled not to strong, but potent enough to give it that truffle bite. Fried pickles- at first I was expecting the small little pickles (width cut), but to my surprise it was the long cut (length wise). Oh and don't forget to ask for the sauce tray!
