I liked this place a lot, and came to try it after seeing it is ranked one of the top ten diners in America, on this food series I saw on netflix. However, Philly does breakfast and brunch well, and I must say I think I like Honeys and the West Ave grill better. Not that the food was bad, but some of it just wasnt memorable or was forgettable...except for two things which will be the reason I return: MONKEY FRENCH TOAST and their BISCUITS. It's probably some of the best French toast I've ever had. Mango and banana and caramel.....to die for. The biscuits were definitely made in house and spectacular. Other than that, I had the eggs with Turkey bacon and potatoes.....meh. potatoes weren't seasoned in any way....Turkey bacon was just bacon, not bad or good... One of my friends ordered one of the frittatas and said it was amazing...but another ordered the pancakes and said they weren't good, and another had a vegetarian dish that she also said wasn't that good. Another interesting thing....they make their own in house ketchup, served in old wine bottles! Pretty cool, except it tasted like marinara sauce lol. They don't have Heinz, so bring your own if you need true ketchup with your eggs and potatoes!!! Other things to note: the place is extremely tiny, expect a wait,...and that means in the cold because there is no lobby area...when you are seated, it's cramped...for ppl to a 2-3 person booth. Ambiance: definitely a dive spot...hand written receipts, and don't expect restaurant service...it's a diner!! :-)
