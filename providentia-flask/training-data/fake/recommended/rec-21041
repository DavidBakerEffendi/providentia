Great food! I'll start with the Fantastic chocolate soufflé with chamborgue crème sauce on special (also came in vanilla) needs to be permanent menu item! We had sweet breads and the fois gras appetizers, both excellent. I had skate wing with couscous and mushrooms in balsamic reduction it was wonderful. My girlfriend have the venison cooked perfectly.  Overall wonderful experience, cute place inside, nice waitress, the only complaint would be that wait staff needs to be more attentive.  Had to ask for more coffee, waited long time then asked for check finally. Minor corrections could make this a top destination for us.  The food is worth it alone.
