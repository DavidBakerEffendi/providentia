I can't even tell you how good this place was! The service, the decor, and the food was wonderful. We went for lunch and had the pre fix. The Greek salad, the calamari and main entree-the shrimp pasta-was incredible. The tarama is incredible-not on the lunch menu sadly but worth the trip for dinner. We will be back. The experience was one we are still talking about it. One of the chefs is also a South Africa. Which is pretty cool!
