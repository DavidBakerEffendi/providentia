Delicious! I would recommend that everyone try this place. I agree that seating is a bit unusual. I did a double-take when I came in and saw my friend at a table with two other people. I thought perhaps she had invited others, and hadn't told me. The decor inside was also different than I was expecting. For some reason, I took the name literally, and expected the walls to be covered with graffiti, and graffiti art. Not the case. The decor is slightly Indian. The tables are high, and with non-matching chairs. Dinner is served on simple white plates and newspaper for place mats (which they also use to wrap your leftovers).  It's also INCREDIBLY small, so be prepared to be sharing your space with strangers! On to the food -- my friend and I shared everything, and it was the perfect portions. To start, we had the PICKLED GINGER SCALLOPS, CANDIED RED CHILI. It was incredible. Sweet, but not too sweet. The scallops were cooked perfectly and not grainy in the slightest. Next, we had CHICKPEA CRUSTED SKATE, MINT YOGURT SAUCE. SO interesting! The flavors were so complex, and it was just a wave after wave of interesting deliciousness. We then went on to the BRAISED PORK BUNS, APRICOT CHUTNEY. My only complaint is that they did not give you enough apricot chutney  -- its divine. So, so, so, good. I'm not sure what kind of bread or dough they use for the buns, but it was incredible. The best dish of the night. We finished off with the Hazelnut chocolate caviar cupcake. The best cupcake in NYC. Hands down. I really can't say enough about this place. We split a bottle of wine, and by the time our bill came (in a scrawled on old envelope, mind you), we each shelled out about $40 with tip. Not bad at all, for delicious food. GO HERE. Its awesome. I just wouldn't recommend a party of bigger than 2, and I would definitely make reservations.
