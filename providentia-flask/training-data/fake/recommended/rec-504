Definitely not the best burger... ok but not great by any means. You get what you pay for. The beef patties are pretty thick and decent, however the bread couldn't hold it all together. My burger totally crumbled after a couple bites. Fries are horrible. Frozen Ore Ida's are even better. Yes everything is served on paper plates - ok who cares. That's totally fine with me... but the quality of food is nothing to get excited about...
