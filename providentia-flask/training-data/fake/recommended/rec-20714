I came here solo just before they opened for a lunch last Saturday. So I was instantly seated at the bar. I just wanted to have a nice bowl of ramen before I headed up to catch a matinee Broadway show. I just have to say it was super tasty and I wish they would open up an Ippudo in southern California. Omg I am salivating just thinking of my ramen broth. I'll be back for more soon hopefully and be able to give a proper rating on other items on the menu.
