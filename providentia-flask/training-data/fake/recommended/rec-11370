El Camino Real offers unlimited chips and salsa for $1 per person. Need I say more? They also have $20 pitchers of margaritas, a little pricey considering how small the glasses are, but delicious nonetheless. The combination of cheap snacks and tasty drinks made for a great day drinking excursion with some friends last weekend. We got the deep fried pickles with some amazing spicy chipotle mayo. Yes, it sounds a little weird, but you won't be disappointed. Â  Our waiters were awesome and very friendly. I recommend El Camino Real for drinks and snacks. It seems like a fun place to be in the evening too, though I can't say I have been. The location is great- just doors down from all the shops and hang outs on 2nd street- but beware of parking! Those 50 dollar tickets will definitely put a damper on your experience, as I recently found out.
