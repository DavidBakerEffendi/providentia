Great tacos (chorizo&papas, cactus, mole chicken... the fish was good, but not my absolute favorite). Solid mole chicken enchiladas that come with a huge serving of rice and beans. The flor de calabaza quesadilla is tasty, but be forewarned that the quesadillas are on the petite side and should not be ordered an entire meal. But the best I've had there so far? The dish that REALLY wowed me, made my taste buds Â weep tears of ecstasy? The torrejas de rompope (basically, tres leches french toast) for brunch! The bread (pretty sure it's brioche) is SOAKED in those three lovely milks. So sweet, so moist. Luscious! Served with lovely berries. I HIGHLY recommend it. My second favorite french toast ever (beside the one from Cafe Melie in Montreal). Seriously, I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to order anything else for brunch there... The chorizo hash is a good side dish for brunch too if you split it (same chorizo and potato mixture used in the taco). All brunches are served with cinnamon-coated sweet bread to start (great to dip in coffee). Enjoy! Oh, and a wide selection of tequila. That's always nice.
