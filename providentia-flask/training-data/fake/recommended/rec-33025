I had been to this place 3 times with work friends. Out of 3 time i ordered shrimp related food items twice, both were disasters. The last time i ordered shrimp vindaloo. Shrimp was uncooked so i complained the same. Guy on the counter came to me and said "Shrimp is always served uncooked and if you cook it, it will become soggy" and added further "you are the only one who complains all the time". Well my response to that is "thanks for letting me know so i will avoid coming to your restaurant".
