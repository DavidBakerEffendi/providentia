This place Stinks.  Seriously this was the worst dining experience and The worst chinese food my husband and i have both ever had.. anywhere. The service was so deplorable my husband and I almost walked out.. we stayed because it was his birthday dinner and all of you crazies had given it good ratings. You all must be losing it. The waitress we had Has to be being forced to work here.. I can't think of any other explanation for the way that she behaves. She literally just grunted and never spoke a single word to us.. never asked us how our food was... literally ignored and/or got mad at any and every request we asked for (lemon with water resulted in water with lime.. extra fried dumplings came out literally RAW..tried to take food away i hadnt even yet touched... stood in the corner giving us the stink eye the whole time we ate.. it was actually laughable how pathetic the whole experience was.. and to top it all off, every single morsel of food we ordered was tasteless.  I regret even topping a single cent but, being a good human, i threw her a few bucks... but i still regret it... seriously, DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!
