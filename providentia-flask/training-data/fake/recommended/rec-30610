I ve walked by this place a bunch of times and finally realized there was a downstairs restaurant and upstairs place.  Its very japanese.  no sushi, but theres a few different sashimi options, theres ramen, katsu, an assortment of appetizers and plenty of tasty food to choose from. And lots of Sakes. And all very reasonably priced.  If you want to try something different and great.  Go, you will not be disappointed.
