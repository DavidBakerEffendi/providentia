I came with my parents about an hour after they opened, it was empty, so the staff was very attentive. The specials are written and shown on a blackboard with the actual prices, no surprises will be seen on the bill. The platter of meats was great and large in quantity for its price compared to most places. The pasta presentation in a pan is different and the homemade quality of the pasta is great. Lastly, the tiramisu was small but great too.
