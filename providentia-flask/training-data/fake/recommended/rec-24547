After reading about Drunken Munkey in WSJ I decided to give it a try.  Best decision I've made so far in 2014!   Sat at the very comfortable bar and took the advice of Brennan the bartender on appetizers and main courses.  Everything we ate- little okra fries, naan, chicken tikki masala- was amazing and I promise I will go back and try the highly recommended monkfish.  The gin punch we had after dinner was delicious.  BTW I never knew that punch was invented in India!   And thanks to the owner Arun for looking after us and being a great host.  I will definitely go back.
