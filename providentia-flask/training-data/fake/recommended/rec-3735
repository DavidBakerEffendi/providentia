We have been coming here for several years now, so I will offer a cumulative experience with Yak. We've often referred to Yak as "our favorite restaurant." It has never been superior in any one category but with repeated visits there has come a familiarity, a comfort, an "our place" kind of feel, despite being "foreigners" to this culture and cuisine. We had our experimental phase, even feeling obligated to try the Yak stew (we cannot disagree with the chewing on a leather purse comparison). We came to settle on four items: Shabalay (used to be spelled differently on the menu), pan fried chicken momo, and the very British chicken Tikka Masala, always with a couple of plain nan. Over the span of time Yak has had problems with consistency on all levels. Once, we ordered the chicken lollipop and it was raw on the inside. Our usual safe and boring order has varied in quality, but is usually what we hope for. Service is usually pretty good, but at times we've had to wait, too hungry for too long. The servers are usually pleasant, but some of our favorite people are long gone. What keeps us coming back? For me, beyond the comfort of the familiar, it is the green sauce. They provide all tables with three small bowls of sauce. One of them is just plain nasty, the other is GF's (she can have it), Mine and all mine is the green sauce. it is made with vinegar and avocado and maybe green tomatoes and assorted spices. The result of this deceptively simple concoction is an irresistible, addictive tangy effect. Â I slather everything with it and often beg for some to take home. If there was no green sauce which I have not been able to find anywhere else nor come close to creating myself, Yak would lose a star from my review and maybe a regular customer.
