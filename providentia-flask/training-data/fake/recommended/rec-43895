If I could give it 0 stars I would but that's not an option. The staff was so clueless they couldn't find a spoon in the god damn restaurant. Please protect yourselves from this shithole. There was no foam on the cappucino they couldn't tell coffee from the water sitting on the table next to me. Bloomberg should be ashamed this dump resides in his city.
