If I could give this place 0 stars I would.  We were visiting Staten Island and went out of our way to come to this place for lunch.  We were starving.  We got there, walked in and sat at the bar.  We are used to strange looks in local bars but this one was different, and from the bartender in paticular.  He did ask us if we'd like a drink and got one and was hoping it was a sign of him warming up to us.  Time went by and I finished my beer right as he was in front of us just hanging out!  No offer of another drink or menu.  Once again gave him the benefit of the doubt and he went down the bar to just hang out and talk to his locals.  He glanced at me several times and didn't even move or think to ask if I'd like another.  My wife finished hers and I told her I think it may be time to go.  I put a 20 on the counter and boy oh boy did he hurry himself over when he saw that.  Cashed us out without a word, slaped our money on the table and that was it!  How rude.  I would never reccomend this place to anyone.  Best Burgur?  HA!  We didn't even get to try it.  We left thirsty and very hungry.
