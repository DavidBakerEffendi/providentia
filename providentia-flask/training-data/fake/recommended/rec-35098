Everything was great. Loved the yogurt, tabbouleh, and spinach on the meze sampler. Iskander kebab was creamy and delicious. Rice pudding could serve 3, and has a wonderful aftertaste, cardamom, I believe. Parents were raving about their swordfish. Everyone loved the place and it is very reasonably priced, I would say. Go!
