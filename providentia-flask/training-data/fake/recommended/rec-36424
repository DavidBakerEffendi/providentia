My friend and I shared the goat cheese fritter salad, another app I am forgetting, tuna as the main, and a side dish of brussel sprout. I did not think the tuna was very flavorful or well cooked, kind of just sat on my plate. Brussel sprouts were yummy. Apps were small. I left feeling like I could have made most of the meal myself without paying such a price. The best part of the meal was the gelato that arrived our table in honor of my friend's birthday. I almost bumped this review up to a four just for the gelato.
