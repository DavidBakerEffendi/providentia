Came here with a friend and five of his friends. The food was average as best. I had high hopes for "The Chronic" (no pun intended) but my expectations for something as spectacular as Dr. Dre's album or West Coast weed were unmet. The sandwich consisted of dried, under-seasoned pulled pork on top of a soggy bun with mediocre mac n cheese. The fries were decent and I heard the margaritas were great as well but I can't comment on them. Our service was terrible, especially since it wasn't a busy night. My water wasn't filled once and nobody checked up on us to ask how the meal was going. Perhaps if I had some chronic prior, I may have been satisfied but I left all the good stuff in California.
