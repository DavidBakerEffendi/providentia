I was just in NYC this weekend and my native New Yorker friend said we had to go here! 1. Cheap! $6 combo! 2. Delicious! I have had some halal food in Philly but never tried it anywhere else, but this set my standards so high! 3. It's like they planned it and wanted to make sure there was seating for their customers. 4. Serve yourself sauces?! Brilliant. I put too much hot sauce and had to run back and get some more of their white sauce, so good! and on that note, I am about to go reheat the leftovers because it was so much food I couldn't finish it. The end.
