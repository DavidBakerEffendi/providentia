I'd give them a 3.5 or so stars, but egg-wrapped pad thai is one of my favorite things, but shrimp pad thai is not. They didn't taunt me at all for ordering with the substitution of chicken for shrimp, so they get an extra half-star for that. Our server was super-friendly, and somehow able to hear us over the noise of the restaurant. Four of us ordered a combo of meaty and veg foods, curries and noodles, and all were satisfied. Nothing super-special, but certainly worthwhile to jog over here before a show rather than staying in the chaos and overpricedness that is the theatre district.
