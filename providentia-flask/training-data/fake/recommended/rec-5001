The friendliest staff I've ever had the experience to meet at any restaurant.  The second we walked through the door, we were flanked by smiles and open arms, welcoming us inside.  I can see why the restaurant is listed as "American", but the food selection isn't described so simply.  I don't recall seeing anything out of the ordinary ont he menu, but i did notice that each dish has a little down under flair to it.  Either a spice, sauce or other ingredient sourced from New Zealand or Australia. The food is solid, the service excellent and the beer list filled with so many New Zealand beers, that i know i'll be returning to try them all in the future.  The only issue I would raise is the front door.  As people come in, it doesn't close automatically and someone has to manually close it to avoid unwanted breezes.  You can tell who the regulars are, because, coming or going, they always close the door behind them with a solid thump.
