Let's be honest. Nothing will touch an in-n-out double double animal style with added raw sliced onion. Nothing. And, that's ok. because, that's not why I come to corner bistro. If I wanted an In n out style burger, i'd hit up blue 9. Corner's burger tastes like what you'd grill in your backyard. And a grown man craves that, as well. Its like a different meal. Do I care to wait in line to eat a burger? Not really. But, think of it this way... You're in the west village. Have your girl hold the line while you go for a trek. Jk, ladies. I joke. Good burger. And, the line really isn't all that bad.
