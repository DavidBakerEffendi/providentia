I don't believe that this restaurant is interested in reading their reviews because everyone is complaining about the same thing. The food menu is short, awful and caters to those that lack taste buds. It truly tastes like hospital food. All of us locals were hoping this place would be better and have given it time to improve- the bottom line is the food is just bad bad bad and WAY overpriced. Their beer selection is good and since there aren't any bars nearby, even they are over priced. This place is always a disappointment. A simple menu can go a long way.. If the food is good.
