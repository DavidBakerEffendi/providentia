Really generous portions and fairly tasty . I have to agree with the other reviewers that the grilled corn is the scene-stealer. It's buttery, sweet and salty with that delicious grilled taste. The frozen mojito was pretty good but didn't pack much of a punch. I downed two really quickly and didn't experience much of a buzz (brain freeze, yes!).
