My boyfriend and I were super excited that there was going to be a new Italian restaurant in our neighborhood...even more excited that it is right around the corner from our apartment (or...staggering distance, as I like to call it). Despite its small space, and packed to the gills nature, we only had to wait 5 minutes for a table, which is a major plus. The food: delicious! I had the mussels with white wine, which was so yummy I could have drank the sauce (and almost did) and the house made tagliatelli al spinaci. The pasta was delicious and delicate, in a nice cream sauce with chicken and mushrooms. I ate it thoroughly, and completely. My boyfriend also thoroughly enjoyed his food...don't remember what he had for app, but his entree was the veal saltimbocca, which was really great. We finished off the meal with the mousse cake which was great! The prices were just right, and the portions were perfect. The service is one charming dude, running around, and being awesome. He wasn't too in-your-face about checking in, but we still had everything we needed. The only drawbacks: no cocktails and, as my boyfriend pointed out more than once, "we had to ask for water" Will totally go back!
