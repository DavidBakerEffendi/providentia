Mesob is amazing.  The owner and staff are extremely friendly, accommodating, and helpful.  I had been there once before for lunch, and the lunch prices are a great deal.  I spent around $14 with tip for a large portion that I ended up finishing for dinner.  When I returned last night, it was a last minute decision.  The restaurant was packed, but the owner greeted us and promised if the next reservation did not show up in 5 more minutes, we could have their table.  They did arrive, but we decided to go buy a bottle of wine (it's byo), and take our chances waiting on another table.  When we returned, the owner had a table waiting for us.  We ordered the sampler for 2 for $44, and had plenty of food to spare (though we were tempted to finish it all since it was delicious!).  It was a sampling of 5 meat dishes and 3 vegetarian sides and plenty injera.  Great food, great atmosphere, and great service, all for reasonable prices.  I highly recommend Mesob!
