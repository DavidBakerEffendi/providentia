This is a new place that just opened up in Princeton and is a LOVELY addition to the Princeton small business community.  First things first, I am NOT a tea drinker but i was blown away by the impressive selection of teas they had to offer.  The counter people were very helpful in finding the right tea for me I and was not disappointed.  The owners of the shop are completely wonderful and they made me feel very welcome.  I frequent this place on a daily basis now.  The environment is very inviting.  This place will be packed once they get more exposure.  Big pluses: Their Coconut Chai, Hibiscus-Berry Tea, Pistachio Muffins, reasonably priced ($5 for a pot of herbal teas!!!), free Wi-fi, and great ambiance.
