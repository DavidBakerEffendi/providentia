Fear not, savory-philes:  this is NOT just a bakery serving up cupcakes and croissants and the like. This IS an amazing little eatery serving up Central Asian (Uzbek!) fare like lamb pilaf, lamb or mushroom samosas, tiny veal dumplings with ginger scallion sauce and extra broth, and lagman. Now, it is a bit of a trek from Downtown. We drove in and entered the McGinley Square neighborhood, a veritable melting pot of so many cultures. I felt like I was in such a different Jersey City - one even more diverse if you can imagine it. Tucked in with neat rowhouses was Honey Bakery, a tiny little oasis of charm and delectable treats! There were only 3 tiny tables inside and 2 outside. The owner and chef rolled out a huge pumpkin samosa for us on the spot - flaky, crunchy crust (NOT fatty!) and savory pumpkin flavor inside. The lamb pilaf was TO DIE FOR - loaded with subtle roasted cumin flavor (studded with cumin seeds), succulent bits of lamb, carrots, onions, and simply amazing. This is the standout dish for sure.  We liked it so much we ended up trying the veggie pilaf too - which is great but not as flavorful as the lamb one. :) Lastly, we rounded out this adventure into Central Asia with the mini veal dumplings - 15 or 20 to an order, they were like little tortellini filled with meat, ginger, and subtle Asian spices. All of this for less than $20? We were bursting at the seams. As an added bonus, the fresh grocer nearby was selling AMAZING produce at even more amazing prices. I got 8 small nectarines for $1! And they were tart, sweet, juicy, and perfect.
