My favorite Italian restaurant in NYC. Best meatballs you will ever eat and the menu is perfect, traditional Italian food. The service is great and the staff is friendly. I brought my kids in one night and they were terribly busy, but spent a ton of time talking to my kids and making them feel at home. This is a family place and you can tell in everything they do.
