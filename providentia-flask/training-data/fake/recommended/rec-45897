The atmosphere was sort of like a cafe you might find in a foreign country. There was a TV playing a Lebanese soap opera. The food is all prepared fresh and the young lady who served us was attentive and pleasant. My daughter got the hummus which was an amazing serving with pita and olives for just $4. She told me it tasted very good. I got a Kefta kabob which came with flat bread, grilled vegetables and a tasty rice pilaf. The serving size was large enough for dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow. I am a fan of good Mediterranean food and I will definitely be coming back and bringing my wife with me.
