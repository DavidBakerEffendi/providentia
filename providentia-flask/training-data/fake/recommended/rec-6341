We had gone to see John Henry, the rescued pig and and got lost on a hot sunny Saturday...we were ambling back home when we came upon this place and went in for relief from the heat, a cool drink and lunch. Â While the place's decor is nothing to write home about we sat at the bar and the bartender was pleasant, the beer and soda were cold and we had the best BLT w/avocado sandwiches ever...the entire stop really was a pleasant surprise...the check being only $22 was a plus as well...we will definitely go back - I'd love to try some of the hungarian fare which was too heavy for lunch on a hot day.
