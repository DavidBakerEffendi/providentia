Update:  Bijan's came on the scene as a great local hangout, complete with revolving art displays (open until 4 am) and has since opened their kitchen, serving a range of plates that have a subtle Persian twist.  The Steak and truffle fries are really great, as is the cucumber salad with feta!  And the growing bar staff is great!  A true neighborhood hangout.
