I love this place! And now I love it even more that there are more vegetarian options available. I'm a pescatarian and they didn't even have fish on the menu before. This last weekend I found that they have so many different items to choose from. I can't wait to try them all. The beer has gotten better as well, I have tried a couple to flavors and they are quite tasty. Love the bubble squeak.
