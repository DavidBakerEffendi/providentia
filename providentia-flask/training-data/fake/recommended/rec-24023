Went here for lunch today with a friend, and it was amazing.  It would have been easy to fill up on the bread and olive oil they brought out while we waited. We started with the octopus appetizer.  I've only had octopus as sashimi before now, but I really liked the texture and the flavor.  Next we shared a pizza, which was good, the best thin crust I've had in a long time.  Then we shared the mushroom ravioli, which was my favorite dish of the meal.  So delicate, but such great flavor.  For dessert we shared the zabaione semifreddo.  Loved the flavor and the texture.  The service was excellent.  I would recommend that you bring a list of area parking lots, because if you don't luck into one of the meter spots in front, they are hard to find.  It appears that they have valet parking for dinner service, but not at lunch. This was a special treat to kick off the holiday weekend, and it was well worth the money.
