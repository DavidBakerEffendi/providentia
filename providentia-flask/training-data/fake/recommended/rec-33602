If you ate here everyday you'd have a heart attack but its great for a special treat. It's rich and heavy and so good. This is a busy place you should know what you want and order quickly. I get the idea that they wouldn't be happy if you didn't know what you wanted when you step up to order but I could be wrong. Fried eggplant is good, a bit soggy but very tasty I see why everyone loves it. It is a bit random of a location unless you are driving.
