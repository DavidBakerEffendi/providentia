Cool place for a late lunch. We had a fun time here and great service. Scott had the Deep Fried Twinkie Burger - a greasy delight. I had the Calibunga Veggie - famous white bean patty, avocado, PYT sauce, lettuce & tomato - really just ok because it was not served very hot. The roll was fabulous though. The pickle and waffle fries - delicious. Really good brews on tap, cans and bottles.
