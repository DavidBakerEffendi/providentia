Review of the Sunday All You Can Eat Snow Crab Legs I had high hopes for this seafood restaurant as I am originally from the Chesapeake Bay and would like to find a great seafood restaurant up here. My boyfriend and my girlfriend both ordered the snow crab legs. All their pots, the legs were watery and the shells too pliable. The culprit? Overcooked legs as per my girlfriend, who further went on to say is about the only way to ruin a good crab leg. Shame on you Doc's! Perhaps they are languishing in some pot waiting on an order instead of being dunked in boiling water a la minute? That's pure laziness in my book. I rather wisely ordered the grilled seafood Cobb salad which was wonderful. The only critique there is that I missed the chopped avocado. Not sure how you can call it a Cobb without the avocado, so I highly recommend adding this. Even so, I might be tempted to return based on the strength of this salad. Service was a little haphazard with our server but he admitted to a serious bicycle injury and may have been taking some strong pain killers. Even so, he was quick with a new pot when we requested them. It's a shame really. Just a few minor corrections and I would have given at least an extra star.
