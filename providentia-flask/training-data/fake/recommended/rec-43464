It can be tricky to find a nice place for lunch in NY. in the late afternoon, so I'd say the hours here are great. One star off for insufferable hipster hostess, but otherwise, a rowdy and delicious upscale cafe with a menu tending toward the adventurous. I loved the pork buns (after I pulled off the slabs of fat), though my vegetarian friend found next to nothing that looked appetizing. We went with the pickled veggies, which did not impress her, though I thought they were freakin amazing.
