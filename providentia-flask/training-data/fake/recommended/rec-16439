Really delicious food. We had the risotto, and they were awesome for splitting it for us. Really good consistency and nice flavor. The scallop crudo was very good as well. And to finish we had a sort of chocolate cake tart, whatever it was...it was delish! We didn't get a lot of food here, but from what we had it is clear that they know how to utilize ingredients and create amazing dishes. I love the atmosphere, it's got an open but cozy feel to it. Service is super friendly.
