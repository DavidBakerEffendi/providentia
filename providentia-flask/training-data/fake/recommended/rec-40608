I loved this place.  I found it through YELP and the description of the decor was the hook for me.  It IS like eating in the Brady Bunch living room, but I suspect their chefs cook an even better and more diverse menu than Alice did. The service was friendly, informative, and unhurried (in a good way) and we all enjoyed our meals. My only regret is that I did not have a milk shake.
