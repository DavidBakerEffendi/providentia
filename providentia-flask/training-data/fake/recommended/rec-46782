Love, love LOVE this location of go go curry. Our order is always prompt, as well as the staff brings the food to your table when it's done. The portions are huge and if you go for the Grand Slam you'd better bring a friend cause they are seriously huge. I can't even imagine the world championship, I might have to bring a group of us in for that one! Highly recommend go go curry, it tastes nothing like Indian curry or anything else, much more sweeter.
