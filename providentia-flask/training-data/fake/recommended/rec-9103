Went there a few months ago for a friends birthday dinner and I must say, I didn't think it was going to be as good as it actually was.   The server was really attentive and the food was really good!  It was fairly priced and even with drinks we only ended up paying around 60 each. I don't usually venture out into Times Square but all in all, I had a good experience here.
