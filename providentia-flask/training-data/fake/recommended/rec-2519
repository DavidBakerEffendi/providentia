It's open 24 hours, which is nice, and the novelty of going there is 1/2 the fun. You go because you've got to. It's a Philly tradition along with Geno's. My BF & I went and got a cheese steak from each, split 'em up and critiqued them. It was a fun exercise for his first Philly trip. After you do that once you can go down to Jim's and get a great cheesesteak.
