Incredibly Surprised!  Not only can you order online with a credit card which is extremely convenient but there is no surcharge for delivery!  Be sure to tip the delivery person cash! Can I say??..BEST IN BLOOMFIELD! Fried half chicken was seasoned and made incredible with a yellow pork fried rice in perfection! Chicken Lo Mein had a nice garlic taste and my toddler wanted MORE!!! Beef with Broccoli was well done!  You have to try this place! I will be ordering from here again and am singin' the Madonna tune... "You must be my Lucky Star 'Cause you shine on me wherever you are I just think of you and I start to glow And I need your light And baby you know..." This place rocks!  AND NOW EVERYONE CAN KNOW!
