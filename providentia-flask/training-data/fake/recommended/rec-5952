So imagine getting off the R5 in center city with a slight idea of where you're going, getting hollered by some curious looking men (read: sketchy), and then being followed by some strange man in a black car.  My typical night in Philly.  The area isn't too appealing.  But needless to say, once my friend and I reached Continental, it was like our safe haven.  We met our party of ...fifteen... for a close friend's birthday to discover that they had all started with appetizers (hummus/pita & fries) which were above average. For dinner, I shared a plate of the boneless duck breast.  It was absolutely delicious!!  But be warned, it's not fully cooked.  Even so, the tenderness of the meat and its interesting side dishes were pretty damn yummy.  As for the desserts, well, they just topped off the night.  Each of us got different pastries and passed it around the table (sharing is caring!)  Once again, absolutely delicious.  End of story. PS - The waitress was extremely attentive -- big plus!  But the hostess was rude - BIG minus!  & the drinks were pricey but good as well.
