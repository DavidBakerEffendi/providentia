I went to The Redhead for dinner last night with a friend. The spot is romantic with low light and dark wood walls but it was VERY cramped -- especially the row of tables for two. We were basically sitting on top of two couples on either side of us. I love my autumn drinks so I ordered the Harvest Sidecar to start (cognac, fresh lemon, laid's applejack, and all spice). It was FANTASTIC! Probably my favorite part of the meal. The food was good but to be honest not very memorable. I had heard from two people that the soft pretzels were overrated so we started with the homemade mozzarella instead. It was a very small portion. I had the shrimp-stuffed trout for my main dish. Again, it was tasty but not spectacular. The fish was slightly overcooked although the potato puree it came in was lovely. Maybe I ordered wrong -- I may have to try out The Redhead one more time to make sure.
