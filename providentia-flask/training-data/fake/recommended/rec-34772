You know, standing there (I mean sitting in my air conditioned apartment while my roommate stands on line) we weren't sure if Grimaldi's would be worth it.  Honestly - the people aren't that nice* - with that kind of line who has to be? They make you wait in the SAME LINE wether you are waiting for a table or taking out*.  But when the pizza got home - and was reheated, it was oh so tasty.  At first I didn't know, but around bite 5 I was smitten.  I don't think I'd wait in line to bring it up (unless above told roommate told me to) but I'd wait in line to eat it hot and fresh.  And that is how they keep that line long. Forget the bells and whistles - every last one of them. And just deliver good pizza. *All these details were provided by my loving, darling, and reliable roommate. :)
