My favorite food is ramen. Therefore my review will be a little biased, but also because it's my favorite food, this review will be very particular. Terakawa Ramen has allowed me to understand why ramen is Naruto's favorite food. In fact, if he were real, the hidden leaf ninja would definitely frequent this shop. Nom nom Ramen in Rittenhouse doesn't come close to Terakawa. The restaurant itself: beautifully furnished and clean. The food? Try it for yourself. I recommend the Mayu Ramen. The service is also great and altogether this establishment has earned five stars from me. D'attebayo!
