Dropped by here when shopping in the SoHo area. Surprised at how large it was from the outside coming in. Very busy but the two of us got a seat quickly. High ceilings, nicely lit. Dark wood bar. Great atmosphere as long as you don't despise crowds. The French Onion soup was great ($10). From their beer selection I opted for the Belgian Corsendonk. I didn't really need more than 16 ounces, but the other size was listed as "FORMIDABLE!" so how could I not order that?? (It's 23 oz.) Our server, Nadja (I think?), was stellar. She offered to hide away our bags for us. Always had a smile. Didn't hover but was easy to get ahold of. Didn't make our long time to decide seem like an irritation to her. When I was done and my plate was gone, I had some bite of my friend's roast lamb sandwich and about 10 seconds into it, she unnecessarily slipped a tiny plate under my hands, like it just appeared out of the woodwork. Love it. I was going to get some sort of "Citron" hot thing after the meal, asking Nadja what it was, and she also offered a Ginger-based hot tea with honey, as my throat was sore. Excellent too! Outside of the great food and service, the people watching was fun since the place is so busy. They have a huge selection of wine and brandies and some oddball digestifs.
