Absolutely the best place around.  You can go here for lunch, dinner and after drinking snack and its always bomb.  Any meal under $10 that will pack the container with food is a great deal.  The lines can get a bit long but it's 100% worth it as the line does move pretty long.  If you haven't tried this place, its a must try.  My favorite is the chicken/lamb combo and make sure to ask for extra sauce on the side.
