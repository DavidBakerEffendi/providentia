At first I was angry with the brunch wait, but they actually gave us complimentary dessert crepe. Now who can be mad after that? I thought that was very generous and apologetic. Overall, I can see why the wait is long and there are so many good reviews. The food is that good! Im still thinking of my dish as I write this review. I had the La Normande, with chicken, mushrooms, cheese, wine, and I added an egg to it. Amazing. The flavor! I cleaned my plate. Not one tiny spec of food to spare. My friends had the omelette, shrimp curry, and eggplant crepe. I tried them and they were just as delicious. Will come back!
