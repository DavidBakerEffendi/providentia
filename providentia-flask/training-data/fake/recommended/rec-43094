I love this place. The pizza is the best I have ever had. The price is high for the Pizza but I think its worth it if you want this pizza.  Its a five star pizza. as for the condition of the store - totally different. It needs some update, the old guy needs some help  so 1 star for this 5-1 = 4 stars.. still eatable - and a must have for those who did not try it yet.
