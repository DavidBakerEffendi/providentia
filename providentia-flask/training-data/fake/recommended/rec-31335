Went on a Friday night around 8PM while waiting for our table at a restaurant a block away.  Everything was good until we sat down at the bar.  Bartender provided awful service.  She just wasn't pleasant and quite rude. She clearly looked like she had somewhere else to be.  She stepped away at one point and the other bartender came to check up on us. The other bartender was so much more friendly and helpful.  I live 2 block away and there are literally hundreds of bars and restaurants to grab a drink. I'll pass on Ivy's next time and go somewhere else.
