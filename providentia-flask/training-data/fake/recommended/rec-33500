after about a year of coming to the neighborhood and looking for food worth eating, found this place alone. on a cold day, they gave me soup and a trio of portuegese anchovies (huge) grilled to perfection on a bed of greens and mild purple onions. the vegetable soup was perfect.  the fish marvelous.  truly a neighborhood restaurant worthy of any place on the planet. been back every time i go back for business to the area.  that's probably over fifty times.   as a frequent traveler, i revel in places like this.  sitting alone frequently for meals is not fun.  but places like this can salvage any day.
