Parisienne mussels were amazing!  My friend ordered the Thai and was equally impressed.  We had the ice cream puffs with warm chocolate sauce and muscat wine for dessert.  The ice cream was a nice change from the usual cream filling.  The bistro was cozy and really felt like you were no longer in nyc, let alone Murray Hill... =P  We plan to return for brunch.
