My husband and I went her coming back from the airport one night. We know it was on Triple D so we had to try it out. The place is small and there was a little wait. It seems like this is a hot spot in this part of town and is always busy. The food was amazing. Their meatloaf was to die for and their french fries with truffle oil.; Great. This is definitely a place I will go back to.
