I mostly go to this place because its in walking distance from my apartment and they have a decent bar that ive always been able to get a chair at even on busy weekends...oh and they happen to serve decent if not relatively over priced Vietnamese that caters to the well to do to folks at University of Penn...you rarely see actual Vietnamese eating here, though they do work here....which is reassuring.  I usually see the the staff eating actual non trendified Vietnamese food at the bar...I wanted to ask if i can I have what theyre having.  If you want authentic Vietnamese food go to one of my all time favorite restaurants (of any kind): Nam Phuong at 11th and Washington in Philly...actual Vietnamese eat there in troves...the extra large bowl of Pho will blow your mind.
