It is one of the best of its class.  Used to have a more amazing selection of food but I think the market was not there on a consistent basis to allow for the brilliant cooks to show their stuff.  I love it as a neighborhood bar with good beer, great staff, decent bar food and a clientele that is very diverse and friendly for the most part.
