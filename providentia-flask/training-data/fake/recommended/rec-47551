I don't think I have ever issued a one star review of any joint on Yelp.  But if any place deserves brutal feedback, it is First Wok. A friend of mine who LOVES food brought us here.  She is not a vegan and we are, so the only excuse I can make for the place is that perhaps their meat is WAY better than their vegan dishes. We sat down and within three minutes, a waiter came up and asked us if we were ready to order.  We apologized--we hadn't seen our friend in a while and we're chatting and catching up.  Could we have a few more minutes? Less than five minutes later, the waiter came back again, this time looking visibly annoyed.  No, we still needed a little more time. When the waiter came back again, he literally started yelling at us in the middle of us ordering.  He said, "Hurry up, hurry up!"  It was so weird I almost didn't understand what was going on.  I have been in the Mid-Atlantic for over four years and have never experienced such rude or discourteous service. We ordered their sesame noodles for an appetizer.  They were prepared the cheap way (made mostly with peanut butter instead of sesame oil), but they actually tasted pretty okay.  Our friend had the rib appetizer and enjoyed it. We ordered the schezuan tofu and the tofu with broccoli for our dishes.  The schezuan tofu was supposed to be one of the most spicy dishes on their menu.  Both dishes were completely tasteless.  And when I mean completely, I mean absolutely no taste.  It was like they opened packages of tofu and dumped colored tasteless sauce over it, microwaved it, and served it to us. The rude service continued.  We decided to take our bland leftovers home so we could save them with our own culinary remedies.  We asked for them to box up our leftovers and the server again acted like it was the biggest inconvenience he had ever experienced. I would not recommend First Wok to anyone for any reason.  Even if their meat dishes are better, their service is inexcusable.
