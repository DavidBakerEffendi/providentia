Came here on St. Patrick's Day while avoiding green beer but seeking out good beer.  Their beer flight is certainly worth a visit.  On top of that fun, there was pretzel bread (always a winner) and delicious sausages (even for those pesky vegetarians, like me).  The bartender was also extremely classy, not just informative about the beer selection but also about the establishment.  Top it off with a free shot, and I am indeed a fan.
