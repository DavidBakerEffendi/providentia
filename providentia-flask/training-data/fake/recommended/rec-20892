While I was there, I thought the food was interesting but when I think back on it, a few things stuck out that I mentioned to my company while we were at the restaurant.  First, the oxtail, while tasty, reminded me of charred short ribs.  I prefer soft and tender short ribs and probably wouldn't try oxtail again after that experience.  Second, the fried chicken had no particularly interesting flavor.  It was extremely tender but could've used a little something. I can't remember what else we ordered except the Kani Pizza which was delicious.  The service was great but the location and the fact that I can't remember what I ate besides what I didn't particularly care for (pizza aside) would keep me from going back if there was another option.
