I am so happy this place opened up for lunch in my neighborhood.  To say they are busy is an absolute understatement - I think they were not prepared for the terrific outpouring of support from the South Street West community.  It gives another terrific option for lunch, dinner and brunch in the neighborhood.  The food is great and the service was good.
