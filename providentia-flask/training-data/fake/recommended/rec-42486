One word: Excellent. Had a celebratory dinner bo ssam style for a group of 10. I was definitely skeptical, wondering how this lettuce wrap meal would accomodate such a large party. Let me just say I ended up packing up what felt like 3lbs of meat home after the meal. The meat was perfectly crispy on the top and buttery tender to the bone. Meat to bone ratio was 10:1 haha. Delish! We also ordered an extra 6 oysters and two of the steam pork buns definitely top notch not just all fat like most other places. (Though I can never mathematically justify $10+ pork buns) We opted not to get dessert since we were all focused on putting a dent into this pork so I can't comment on that. Price for bo ssam drinks and sides was $325 + tip -- not bad for 10 people in NYC Pros: portions, and preparation, price (for the large meals) Cons: small restaurant, you can't really tell who works there as the staff wears w/e they feel like (the hostess that night wore what my friend called a "mint chocolate chip" shirt-- literally looked like mint chocolate chip icecream) WE WILL BE BACK to try the duck.
