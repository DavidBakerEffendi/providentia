I came here on 01/11/13 and as soon as I went in I LOVED IT.  The atmosphere is great, the candles, the decor and the feel of the place.  The food was amazing.  I had the steak w onions and dominican style rice.  My husband had the salmon with yuca fries, my brother had the pernil with rice and his g/f had the shrimp mofongo.  Everything was soooo good.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are just perfect.  We had the red sangria and the picadera for apptizer.  It was delish.  It was my first time here but I will definitely come back.  The waiter was so friendly and attentive.  I really enjoyed this spot.
