I am hoping to make The Redhead one of my go to neighborhood spot. I have gone twice both times sitting at the bar and chatting with the very friendly bartender. My first time at The Redhead was a Monday night (I think it was MLK day) and the place was packed my roommate and I were waiting 40 mins for a seat when 2 spots opened up at the bar we jumped at the chance to sit down.  The bartender was helpful in guiding us through the menu. We had to try the much hyped bacon peanut brittle (which was more like peanut clumps than how you traditionally envision peanut brittle) It is true bacon does make everything taste better. My roommate ordered the sunchoke and sweet potato salad and I had the half portion Low Country Shrimp (aka shrimp,sausage and grits).  Both of us were very happy with our dinner and our pints of Allagash White. My next trip was also on a Monday of a long weekend (President's day) and my roommate and went for just drinks and we both agreed there is a great vibe here ( there is always great music playing). I know I will be back very soon for a drink, snack and to check out their themed monthly dinners.
