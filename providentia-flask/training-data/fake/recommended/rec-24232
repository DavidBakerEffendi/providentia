Not bad, but not necessarily worth the wait or the hype. Burgers and fries are greasy-good, but I think you get more for your money at somewhere like 500. The only thing worth the price is a Concrete milkshake, and you might almost be better served getting a gelato milkshake across the street at Capogiro.
