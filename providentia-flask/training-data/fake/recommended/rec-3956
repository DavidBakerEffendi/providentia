Do it. Do it now. I could have just ended my review there, but I figured some of you might want the juicy details. We arrived just after they opened on a humid Friday night to meet some friends. I started off with some house-made sparkling sangria as did the rest of my party. It was really refreshing and went nicely with the other flavors that came later, especially the pickles. Our party quickly decided that the nightly special was the way to go - St. Louis-style BBQ pork ribs (full rack), with bacon braised project EATS kale, creamed corn & lemon-cucumber pickle $50. That was meant to serve two so we also ordered all of the salads - a basic arugula, a very fresh tomato salad, a fried green tomatoes plate and an order of the house made pickles. Everything was served as fresh and ripe as possible. There is a huge difference between vegetables picked a month ago that came off a truck half-ripe and vegetables that taste like they'd just been basking in the sun. The tomatoes were heavenly and the pickles were a mix of rhubarb, turnips, fennel bulb, and other yummies. My husband said that the ribs were the best he's ever had. His mother is from North Carolina and takes great pride in her slow-cooked meats so we've had some stellar ribs. These ribs fell off the bone. They were outstanding. Everything, even the garnishes, was perfectly prepared and delicious. Everyone at our table admitted to eating a little too much because we couldn't help ourselves. We don't make it down to that area too much because it's a little out of the way, but we'll definitely pop in for the Sunday Supper very soon.
