My Dad grew up in Northern Jersey and talks about Rutts Hut to this day. He took me there when I was a little boy and I've been back 2 or 3 times as an adult. I don't know if it is the atmosphere or the hot dogs or the family history... maybe a combination of all three. But I really can't speak highly enough about Rutt's!
