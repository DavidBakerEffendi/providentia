I waited 1+ hour with some friends for way over-cooked eggs benedict. Needless to say, disappointing. (To be fair, the wait was expected on Saturday afternoon, but I therefore expected the food to be worth that wait.) Pros: My friend's blueberry pancakes were large and fluffy and quite excellent, but I am not terribly surprised that Bobby Flay won that throw-down. The sugar-coated bacon was a little on the sugary side, but should satisfy any grease addict with a sweet tooth. Portions look like they are designed for lumberjacks, even though most people in this restaurant can fit into a pair of 0 jeans...and incidentally, like to wear shades indoors for unexplainable reasons. Cons: My eggs benedict. Thumbs down. The eggs were completely cooked through and I probably should've complained, but I didn't want to soil a lovely little ladies' lunch by being an uptight little bitch. Eggs benedict is all about timing, and no matter how you dress up the rest of the dish, nothing can hide the fact that someone in the kitchen spent just a little too much time ignoring the fact that the egg yolks had already dried up and died on the large loaf-sized biscuits that had themselves outgrown the moist, buttery flavor that fresh, younger biscuits tend to have. Probably won't be heading back to this place next time I'm in the city, but I hope Clinton St. Baking Co patrons do get what they wait for.
