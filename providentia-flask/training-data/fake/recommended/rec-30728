After trying to snag a table here for 2 years and giving up every time, finally got to sit at the bar last night with the charming barmaid Emily at my service.  Better than average service, with knowledge of wine.  Better than average tapas staples like fried chickpeas, stuffed sweet peppers, (didn't have the croquetas, but they looked better than average) What was insanely delicious was the special roast suckling pig, the chorizo on bread with chocolate, and the blistered little peppers. Run don't walk.  Emily recommends coming for lunch when its not so crazy.
