Cheap. Delicious. Did I mention cheap? You can feed yourself two meals (portions are HUGE) for about $7 - I haven't seen those kinds of prices since I left North Carolina. The first time I came here I ordered the pita thinking I was going to be more carb conscious - wrong. GET THE ORANGE RICE. Just do it, and thank me later. And the white sauce is as good as they say. Tip: don't sit on the stairs to the CNN building or a very weary security guard will run you off. And get it to go so that you can pack up those leftovers and cart them off with no fuss.
