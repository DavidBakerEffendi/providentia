I really used to love Eulogy. A few weeks ago I would be raving about their french fries (the best in the city!) or gushing over the Dijon Mussels (they're so decadent!). Yes, until last Thursday. A couple of friends and I walked in, got a table, and were immediately shocked by the total menu overhaul. Of course, menus change just like seasons, or underwear, and the food was great before so we were sure it would be just as wonderful now. They had kept the dijon mussels on the menu, we happily ordered them with another mussel variety and french fries. When we got our food it was nowhere near what we expected. The sauces for the mussels were bland and the fries were soggy. Bite after bite was worse and worse. The worst part is that when we asked our waiter what happened to the great food, he informed us that a new chef had taken over and changed the menu. I emailed the restaurant the next day to let them know that we were disappointed in the food. I was met with excuse after excuse--including the worst excuse of all, "You dined her eon a Thursday. It's not as if you were here on Saturday." So apparently Eulogy is fantastic, but only on Saturdays.
