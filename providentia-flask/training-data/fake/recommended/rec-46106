Nothing really has changed here.  This is my lunch spot.  We take clients here, and the food is always good.  Just a note, always go with the smaller pizza.  The larger one seems oily.  Other than that, the place is a great stop for lunch.   4 stars for a quick lunch.  3 stars for a date.  I should have mentioned that in my first review.  I still love this place though.
