It was just OK. The bulgogi was a bit sweet and had no charred bits and no garlic. I am kinda glad because although I love garlic all this food was Americanized and had no garlic. The blaring rap and disco music was a sure giveaway that they were trying to cater to Americans but I am not coming back.
