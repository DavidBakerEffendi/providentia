It's 10 pm and why is this diner still packed?! Because it's AMAZING! Possibly the best diner I've been to. This place is very neat, has the very old school retro vibe with still a diner feel. Portions here are huge, so order sparingly. Service can be a bit slow since there are so many people, but the food came out average time and was great. Had the New Orleans Shrimp, while my family ordered an omelet, burger, and peach smoothie. I really enjoyed my dish. I got the salad that comes with it and it was great! I haven't had a complimentary salad filled with so many good vegetables asides from the usual bed of spinach or lettuce. My shrimp dish equally amazing too. Shrimps were a little overdone, but they were fresh. I loved the sauce, vegetables, and rice; they were light and flavorful. Tasted the omelet and it was more on the plain side, the hash browns tasted amazing though. The potato was more chunky instead of shredded. Also, the burger tasted fine, but the peach smoothie was a hit. Maybe it was a bit too sweet, but it was packed full of peach flavor. I'm not sure if they used a peach syrup with it. Prices are fair and affordable. Meals generously portioned. Great service. Unique vibe. Hope to be back soon!
