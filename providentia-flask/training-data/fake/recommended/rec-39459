The caipirinha drink was amazing. The arepa with shredded pork was delicious, I am definitely going back for that. The burger on the other hand was not at all good would not recommend it to anyone. Great ambiance. Server was not as attentive, seemed bored with her life but hey everyone has their bad day. Overall a nice place to stop by for a drink or two and appetizers.
