Boqueria is far from a traditional Spanish tapas place.  The croquettes look more like cheese balls and the tortilla is drizzled with what tastes like lemon-infused mayonnaise.  Nonetheless, my family and I were pleased with the food, especially the Pata Negra serrano ham - YUM!  What ultimately tarnished our experience was the terrible service.  The waitress failed to explain that most items on the menu were unavailable so, after ordering a panoply of tapas, we were left sans main course.  The situation was aggravated by the manager's rude reaction to our comment that they should maybe print lunch/dinner times on the menu, or at least have  waitresses explain what's available when one sits down to eat.  We will definitely never set foot there again.  Oh, its also super overpriced.
