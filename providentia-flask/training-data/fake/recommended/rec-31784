It's been a while since I was at Race Street Cafe, and it has gone downhill.  It wasn't very clean and in disrepair.  Service was not good.  The food was poor to mediocre, ordered from a menu lacking variety of inspiration.  At 3 p.m. in the afternoon we had choices of 95% brunch items - who wants brunch at close to dinnertime?!  We had four people in our party, all of whom ordered hamburgers (the only other real option to breakfast food) and all our buns were stale and dry.  The burgers were cooked well enough, but underseasoned.  Food was also not served hot.  With so many other places to go, I won't be back to Race Street  Cafe. If it weren't for a couple good beer options and a friendly bartender, I would have rated this establishment as ONE STAR.
