Great addition to the neighborhood! My friend and I were interested in the gluten free menu (not listed on the website) and decided to check out Rex 1516. The food was amazing.  We ordered the burger and salmon to share.  I also had a mint julep, which was tasty.  The burger was cooked perfectly and we appreciated the gluten free bun.  It reminded me more of a biscuit and was a little crumbly, but it's homemade and tasted great.  They should offer it as a side with brunch! The caramelized onions, blue cheese and bacon worked great, and the sweet potato fries were amazing.  Crispy and served with a creamy, sweet mustard sauce.  The salmon was also cooked perfectly, and was a large portion.  The green rice was great, but the ham hock jus really didn't add much to the taste of the dish.  Some sort of vegetable on the side would work much better. The dessert on the gf menu is a variation on the chocolate torte with pretzel crust and ipa sauce on the regular menu.  It's basically a flourless chocolate cake with sea salt and a bourbon caramel sauce.  It was amazing.  I got it to go and heated it up for a few seconds with the sauce on top.  Highly recommend! Overall a great meal and I can't wait to return.
