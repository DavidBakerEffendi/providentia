Great wine, great cheese.  Cool knowledgeable bartenders-- Is Jesse still there?  Love the feel of the place.  Anyplace that feels like the east village and serves stellar wine is a winner in my book.  I try and only go on off nights... but a great place to bring a group of wine lovers anytime.  en vino veritas!
