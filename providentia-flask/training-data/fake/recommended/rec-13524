Question of the day: Ippudo NY vs. Momofuku Noodle Bar Result: Ippudo NY!! Went to Ippudo with my roomie for an early dinner. Foodwise, I would give it four stars - their signature ramen was delicious with thin noodles that are much easier to eat and a broth that was so fantastic that I actually drank some! But the fish buns were a little above average (although their wasabi mayo was amazing..especially when I hate mayo...) and the sauce they used in the pork bun was good but the pork itself didn't melt in my mouth like that of Momofuku's... BUT: the decor of the place is amazing..with wonderful service (awesome waiter! he had a crazy wicked tattoo all over his right arm but a keroppi watch from mcdonald's on his left wrist! I really wanted that watch!!) and the price was $6 than what my roommate and I paid for at Momofuku's, giving it one more star! I will be back to try their special ramen (without the intestine of course!)!!
