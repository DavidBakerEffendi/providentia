I love when places are "dialed in": pay attention to and nail various details, big and small, about their presentation. The Brooklyn Star is dialed in from the food, the drinks, the decor, the waitstaff. I had the romaine salad, jalapeno bacon cornbread, and meatloaf sandwich. Really yummy stuff. I wasn't a huge fan of the mashed potatoes being on the meatloaf sandwich itself and had to add ketchup for flavor, but to each is own. Loved the mason jar glasses, the beautiful plants, the light fixtures and the wait staff was attentive. Also, the dishes are moderately priced. The giant meatloaf sandwich was only $10, big pan of cornbread $5 and the salad $8 or $9. mmmm I'm hungry again just thinking about it.
