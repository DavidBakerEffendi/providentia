My friend was in town visiting and she spent some time in Vermont and knew of American Flatbread. When she heard they opened one in Tribeca she said is was amazing and that we had to go. Food was AMAZING! My friend and I got a large pizza and had them do half of the kalua pork and half of the tribeca specialty pie (can't remember the exact name). Both were so delicious. We also got beer and since we didn't know a lot of the breweries described to the waiter what we liked in a beer and told him to surprise us since all the beers were around $7 a glass and didn't have to worry about him giving us something too expensive. He did a great job! the only reason I gave this place a 4 instead of a 5 was because of the hostess when we checked in. We made a reservation on opentable since it was valentine's day and figured they might be busy. We got there and most of the tables were full. We checked in and the woman said our table would be ready shortly so we stepped aside. After waiting for about 10 minutes and watching other people walk in and be seated I asked how much longer. It was a different woman this time and said she couldn't find our reservation. I pointed out the woman I checked in with and after seeing the reaction we realized that they had given our table to one of the other groups that walked in. The manager was there and quickly found us a table and sat us. While they took care of the situation something like that should never happen.
