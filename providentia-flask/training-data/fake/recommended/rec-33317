I came here for brunch and had a Greek omelet with feta/olives and fried potatoes. It also came with a little salad that was so delicious, they make some kind of garlic vinaigrette that is really amazing. The omelet and potatoes were good as well but I was super impressed with the garlic vinaigrette, which I'm sure seems like an odd thing to fixate on, but it's the little details that really close the deal for me. I also had a rhubarb vodka cocktail which was pretty good. Not too sweet, etc. I'm moving out of the neighborhood soon but otherwise I would be a regular at this place. Seems like it would be a good date spot as well.
