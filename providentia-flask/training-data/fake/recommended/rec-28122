It's funny, the first thing that stand out for me about Tuk Tuk is the clean dining area and bathroom. I admit that I'm a little bit of clean freak. I cannot stand typical Asian restaurants mainly because of sanitation issues. 4 stars for the good variety of salads, my favorite is papaya salad. You will be happy with their Panang curry too.
