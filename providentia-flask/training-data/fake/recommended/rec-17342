Fail. Gross food...even after a bunch of drinks, so that's not a good sign. Service is terrible. The manager was arrested  for hiring hitman to kill his uncle. I remember dealing with him...what a disaster. The decor is a mess...there's just nothing nice to say about this place at all.   They need new ownership...
