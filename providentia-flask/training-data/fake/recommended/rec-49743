I visited this for the first time in November 2013 on a first date and it was an amazing experience. It's more like an Italian market with different shoppes of food, dessert, coffee/cappuccino and a restaurant to sit and eat. The atmosphere was great for everyday walking around and shopping or a different date experience. I highly recommend checking it out!
