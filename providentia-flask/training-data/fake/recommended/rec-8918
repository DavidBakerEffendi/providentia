Fresh ramen + fantastic service + quiet room upstairs = kamazi in mah mouf!!!! Noodles were fresh and the broth was silky smooth.  I'm normally a pho guy but this place knows how to combine broth and noodles.  We sat upstairs in the test kitchen... it was very quiet and clean... me likey. For reals tho.... you need to show up early.  If not, you probs will be waiting a while.
