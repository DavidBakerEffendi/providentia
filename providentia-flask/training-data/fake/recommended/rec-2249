So to continue down the checklist for my Philly tourist visits...my buddies and I did an about face at Geno's and in front of our face was the competition...Pat's! It's pretty cool that at 12am cars/taxis were pulling up to both places and were packed! Great experience! Taste test time! We wanted to be fair so we ordered the same at both establishments and got a plain old cheesesteak sandwich split into thirds (because there were three of us). We got a funny looks asking to split our sandwich in thirds, but it was for taste testing purposes. See whichever sandwich tasted better (from our 1/3 sample size) we would then buy a full cheesesteak to ourselves from the best tasting spot w/out trying to fill our stomachs with two full samples from each. First thing I noticed right off the bat was the flavor from the meat! Better than the competition and my buddies agreed. Overall taste was close, but not as good. I think the bread separated the two. Pat's bread was thick and created dry spots for me. I will say Pat's has more of a quality fresh flavor, but I want my cheesesteak messy and flavorful! Pat's got 1 of 3 votes from our trio.
