I really don't understand the bad reviews here. I've been twice and both times had such great food and service. I really can't say enough good things about the food - I've eaten two different kinds of pizza, fish tacos, chicken wings, thai satay skewers and the spinach/artichoke dip and cannot give one complaint about any of it. The service was very friendly and quick, from the hostess to the servers. Food came out quick and delicious. Even though we were full, we still wanted more. Last time we went, the table next to us ordered what looked like a s'mores making meal and it looked amazing, so definitely going to try that next time. Love it here!
