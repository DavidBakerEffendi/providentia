Okay, I went on a Friday night and the atmosphere was great. Lots of people, loud, fun, etcetera. I could not make reservations because they were booked up but they told me arriving any time after 9 pm I would be seated pretty soon. That was not the case. There was hardly even space at the bar to order a drink- eventually some lady sat on her boyfriend's lap and gave her seat to my lover and I. After about 45 minutes we got a table right infront of the door, complained, waited five minutes, got another one. The food....was.......interesting. I ordered sea bass tacos. They were like 18 bucks. When my plate arrived, I had to ask the waitress if I'd somehow failed to understand that the food was tapas style because the portion was miniscule. It was not tapas style, it was just measly. I took three bites and boom, it was gone. So, all in all, I realised this was the kind of place one goes to when you have had dinner beforehand, someplace cheap and filling, so you can appreciate the sophisticated flavors without your grumbly tummy getting in the way of your meal.
