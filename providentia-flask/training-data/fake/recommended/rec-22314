I love this place. It's on the smaller side, but I really enjoy the food and the atmosphere. I'm a creature of habit and almost always get the Ropa Vieja. I love the sauce, the plantains, the beans are just about perfect. I wash it down with Xingu, a Brazilian beer they serve. Top it off with amazing tres leches and call me a happy customer. This really is a great spot to hang out with friends or a quiet dinner.
