This place is quite small, it's split into 2 parts: bar and restaurant.  We went on a fri night at about 7, bar was empty and restaurant was 70% full because it was probably early, but good because we didn't have to wait to be seated. The restaurant is split into 2 parts, a room in the front and one in the back. The seating is quite close together and you can definitely hear each others conversations. Not much of a drinker but you can BYOB. We had the whole fish red snapper and the cippiano (mussels lobster scallop and shrimp).  The seafood broth that came with the cippiano was awesome, finished every drip of it.  This is pretty much a seafood place, I've had better seafood at a slightly lesser price. This is a good place to take a date on. Parking can be found around the corner.  The restaurant is really on hicks St, not union.  This place is okay, not a place that I would come back to since there are so Many places to try.
