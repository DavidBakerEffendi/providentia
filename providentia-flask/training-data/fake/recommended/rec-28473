Such delicious paninis! Well, frankly everything here is top-notch.  This place puts so much effort and thoughtfulness into each dish, but doesn't have the pretentiousness that could come with such high quality food. You can tell that they're concerned with using the best quality fresh ingredients which shows in some freaking amazing tasting food. Recently, I took two friends here for lunch and they couldn't stop raving about how amazing their paninis were. I've been here for lunch, brunch, and for a glass of wine and cheese plates, and every time I felt welcome and had a great meal.  I just recently ate in the back garden, and that place is a hidden gem! You feel like you're in some European winery (well when there isn't construction going on at the restaurant next door!). Last time we went, I shared the artichoke with goat cheese, sweet onion and rosemary oil panini and the prosciutto with Gorgonzola dolce and fig spread panini with a friend.  Wow! I've had the artichoke one before-- it is so good that I keep coming back for more.  The sweet onions with the goat cheese are such an amazing sweet/salty combination.  I was afraid I wasn't going to like the Gorgonzola dolce but that was something I can't wait to taste again.  We finished up with a Crumbs cupcake (yes, they serve Crumbs cupcakes!) and had such a relaxing amazing meal.  Only one negative comment-- my friend wishes that they served the panini with a side salad or with fresh fries/chips.  The paninis themselves are plentiful, but sometimes it is too much of a single taste.  I'd happily pay a bit more for a side dish but the salads are rather pricey to have as a side.
