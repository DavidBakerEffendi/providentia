I've had Umami Burger in SoCal and loved it. So when I heard that Umami was opening in NY, it shot up to the top of my list of places to stop at when I'm in the city. Unfortunately, I wasn't in the city for a while. But I finally got my chance. Unfortunately, it was not as amazing as I remembered. Got there on a Sunday morning a bit after 11. We were the only guests there, but couldn't be seated until our whole party arrived. Two of us were there, out of a group of three. I guess it's just their policy - can't seat us until our whole party arrives. Though there was no one else there. Nothing they can do, I suppose. All three of us order various burgers, all medium-rare. But all of our patties were quite rare. Not pink. Red. Raw. Still falling apart. It still tasted alright, but definitely would have been significantly better if it was just cooked a bit more through. The service was alright. Very friendly, but didn't refill our glasses at all, though there were only a handful of other parties. Could be better. Nothing turned me off so much that I would never try it again. I'm still hooked on how good the burger I had in LA was. So just cause of that, I want to try the NY one again. Maybe the undercooked meat was just a one time thing. The irish fries were alright.
