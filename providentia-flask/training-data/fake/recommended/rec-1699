Before all else Pat's was our first stop in Philly. We were a bit confused on the ordering--separate window for the sandwiches and drink/fries. Was sadly disappointed in the cheese-steak. The meat was flavorless--was it just boiled? The bread was hard and slightly stale. We got the pizza fries and enjoyed those but after eating a few it gets really salty. Good place to get some local color, but the food was a sad let down, plus quite overpriced.
