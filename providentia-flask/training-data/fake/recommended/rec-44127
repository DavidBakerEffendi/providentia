I went there for the first time yesterday to meet a friend for lunch. I got the pumpkin soup. I ordered a cup so i expected a small serving, was I surprised when I got a nice size bowl! And the soup was AMAZING!! It tasted like pumpkin pie. To top it all off ,in the midst of a lunch time rush,the staff was super nice too. I'll definitely be back to try more soup.
