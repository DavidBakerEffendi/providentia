Went with a friend for dinner to satisfy an urgent and enduring steak craving. Heard that they served great steak from a few friends, but they may have meant "for Hanover"... because I was underwhelmed. And I'm not hard to please when it comes to steak. I ordered the 16 oz. prime rib (did I mention my "urgent and enduring steak craving"?) and didn't end up finishing a third of it. Believe me, I was hungry and I am definitely capable of wolfing down 16 oz. of bloody meat in one sitting, but it just wasn't THAT good... not BAD, but don't expect the "wow" you might find at steakhouses in areas where there is actually competition. I tend to weigh "attention to detail" heavily in evaluating my culinary experiences, and Jesse's scored poorly in this area. I'm talking about the sides--I had fries as a side and it also came with a "vegetable medley." The fries were of the thick-cut, barely fried, soggy variety you might find at a mediocre American family restaurant, and the vegetable medley consisted of cut pieces of zucchini, carrots, and green peppers that tasted like they had been boiled for a minute too long, drained poorly, and dashed with salt and pepper. I was not impressed. Bread and butter was served as an appetizer, as one would expect from a restaurant owned by the same group that owns Molly's and Lui Lui, but Jesse's b&b have nothing on the latter two's. Our server was super friendly, the ambience was comfortable and cozy, and they had a good selection of drinks and other entrees to please everyone in a large party. But if you're coming primarily for the steak, don't set your expectations too high.
