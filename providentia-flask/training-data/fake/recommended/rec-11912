Took my parents here for an early, quick bite before their Broadway show. Great place! To echo previous reviews, the decor is awesome and far superior to the surrounding hole-in-the-wall Thai joints. Beautiful chandelier in the middle of the restaurant, cleverly lowered and situated over a glass mirror to provide a beautiful display. Room Service has a classy-trendy vibe that's pretty unique given the low price point. Foodnalysis: - Room Service Pad Thai - quite different from traditional pad thai.  Vermicelli noodles with mixed seafood, different flavor (less sweet?), served in an egg white crepe. Tasty. Mom loved it. - Pad Kee Mao (Spicy Basil Noodles) - Good, but not exceptional.  Heeded my "not-too-spicy-please!" request, so if you like this dish but can't take the heat, just let your waiter know. - Green Curry - Didn't try it, but my Dad thought it was great. Unlike me, my Dad has a very high spicy tolerance and thought this had a nice kick to it. I always feel that Thai restaurants skimp on the rice that accompanies curry (Room Service was no exception, it was a pretty small bowl but not as bad as Spice)... but maybe my carb-errific Chinese genes are to blame. The Bottom Line: Great place for Thai, especially if you're looking for above average ambiance.
