Don't think I'll return. It is very dirty, and they clearly don't clean at night. We were there at opening and it was already filthy. Crushed up cheese doodles in the corner of mini golf, dust bunnies everywhere on carpet near bounce houses. Candy wrappers and other garbage inside the bounce houses.....I could go on and on. My kids did enjoy the bowling and mini golf.
