So glad we found this place! There was a little wait, which is whatevs. But the food was super good. We got the karaage which was different than I'm used to. It had less breaking and was more like a chicken strip but it tasted good and the sauce was NS nice addition to the flavor. The ramen was good. I had the shoyu ramen and added corn which was yummy. The noodles were cooked well and the flavor was good. Not too salty in the broth. But my pork was kinda too salty for me. Cute decor and friendly fast service! This is a legit ramen place in philly.
