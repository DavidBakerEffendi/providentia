Generally speaking I hate German food.  This is somewhat of a dilemma since my boyfriend is very German and LOVES the food.  I was very pleasantly surprised that I really enjoyed my meal here and the beer is obviously good. The accordion player plays songs like Build me up Buttercup, which threw me off but was pretty entertaining.   The service however was horrible.  It took forever to get our meals and the server basically told us what we should and shouldn't order.  I'm all for suggestions but don't tell me what I picked isn't good and I should reconsider...yes I want the pork!! The apple streudal was really good, I've actually gone back since just to have that.  Unfortunately, the place is so packed on weekends I haven't been able to get it. I also imagine this place is a good time with a larger group.
