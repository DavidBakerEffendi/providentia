My approach: I am mostly into the overall "experience" of dining out and drinking: atmosphere, ambiance and whether the outing meets or exceeds my expectations at the time. I expect food, products and service to be good. Jadis is a 5-star experience. It is wonderful for taking others, especially non-NYers, because you approach it along a street and in an area that doesn't look so inviting or that would have any place decent enough to eat in. Once there and the grins are on companions' faces, you find you are always warmly greeted into a charming, cozy, cheery, old-style room. The second time and after that I visited Jadis, several on the staff recognized me. I like the food-drink bar because I like to see the foods being prepared, usually by one man with whom you can chat. Amazing what can be created with a few simple ingredients and a single warming oven. There are comfortable tables and an eating shelf up in the front and soft velvet sofas and "coffee" tables on which you can eat in the back. In good weather you can even relax, eat and drink under the open sky. Small plates, cheese-and-meat combos, salads and quiches are best bets, coupled with very sufficient types of French wine by glass or bottle. Always get a little plate of the wonderful olives while waiting for entrees. Perfect for Happy hour with selected wines.
