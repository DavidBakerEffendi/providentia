I have been to Selamat Pagi a few times and it gets better and better.  Last night's dinner was perfect.   Perfectly representative of the mix of "Asian"  and "Balinese"  cuisine.   And,  of course,  that to me means that the food is great and a pleasure to taste.   Just as the food is an adventure, there are several international beers you wished you knew about years ago. The wine selection isn't shabby, either, and priced reasonably. This is a great restaurant for those who want something different, tasty, and done well, and would feel that this adventure is worth the trip.   The waitstaff are knowledgeable, eager to please, competent, and, well, nice. BTW,  don't leave without having a double espresso.  One of the best you'll ever have.
