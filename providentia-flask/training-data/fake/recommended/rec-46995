If I could give 5 stars for the brunch alone, I would do that in a heartbeat. Sabrina's us easily one of the best places around South Philly by far. There are a one to two places so far that come close. The past four times I've visited Sabrina's I had a different brunch plate, and each one far exceeded my expectations. The servers at times can walk around a little bit in space but for the most part the coffee Â stayed full, as well as water or whatever else it is you might have ordered for a drink. The egg dishes especially are a reason alone to frequent this place for brunch. The names on the menu are always quirky and fun with schemes from local happenings or events like the recent names inspired by the Olympics and the athletes, breaking up the typical high brow monotony you would expect in a place serving brunch as good as Sabrinas does. You get an inviting personal atmosphere with friendly service. Speaking of atmosphere, each time I have been here it has never been overly loud and remained comfortable with a vibe where you don't feel rushed wether sitting outside or inside in the spacious open rooms. All in all, GO HERE for brunch and you will most likely mark it as a favorite hot spot, or at least go back a second time. Now I wish it was earlier to go eat some breakfast tacos!
