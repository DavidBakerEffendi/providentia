Top 3 brunch spots in Philadelphia - and trust me, I've frequented quite a few.  I've enjoyed everything I've gotten here, and brought different groups of friends and family who were equally impressed.   They're also really chill about substitutions - I changed a few things on one of their breakfast sandwiches and ended up with some delicious concoction that included asiago and pesto... I still dream about it on the regular. It's not huge, so I'm sure the wait can get long, but luckily I've managed to avoid that for the most part. It's a bit off the beaten path (not a ton of other spots around there or foot traffic) so I think it tends to be a little less crazy than say, Sabrina's or Green Eggs.
