I would kick you in the head for this french toast. I'm really appreciative of the "crispy-coated" genre of french toast, so this version pleased me immensely. I'm also very appreciative of the "more than enough food to make me fat/sleepy/diabetic" genre of french toast, so they've got my heart on that front as well. With roasted strawberries? SHUT THE HELL UP. Service is kind of bored and wandering, or maybe I'm just not cool enough to know that bringing people more coffee or cream quickly is "so 2006" or something. In fact, my only complaint is about the clientele, but that has more to do with my lack of understanding as to why people insist on carting their children to non-romper-room restaurants, when everyone knows that children's tiny hands make them excellent coal miners, and they should be working in a coal mine when I'm having brunch, not taking up 80 square feet with their tanker truck of a stroller or tripping the waitstaff with their "cute antics." What was I saying? French toast for the win.
