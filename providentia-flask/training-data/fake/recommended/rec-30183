SO. DELICIOUS. The hummus was literally the best I've ever had. It was smooth and creamy and paired perfectly with the warm pita bread. We also had the brussels sprouts and the black iron shrimp, which were both to die for. For dinner we split the mixed grill, which was the cherry on top. The meat was perfectly cooked. I'm still dreaming about the lamb chops. Will definitely be back!
