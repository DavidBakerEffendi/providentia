[This review is for brunch only. 3.85 stars.] I'm already looking forward to having a spinach and goat cheese omelet again at Rye. And I don't typically like eggs. Seriously. Well-crafted, attractively presented, and simply delicious food. Heavy on the meat, which was not a high point for me personally. Nevertheless, I was able to opt out where I wanted, and still had good choices, albeit fewer of them. The brunch cocktails are original and plucky. Well, at least I felt plucky after consuming them. I had sips of a few, and would recommend the Buck's Fizz and the Retox. Â  Gracious service. Better to eat and drink at Rye on a cold, cloudy day, in which case it feels homey and cozy inside. Coming back out into the sun after a couple hours in here made me feel like a mole re-entering the outside world after a long, dark snooze. Not entirely unpleasant, but if it's a bright Sunday (my one day off), I'd rather sit outside -- or be able to see outside.
