Good place!  Always a wait, but they've got a cozy fireplace and chairs.  Good flatbreads with good toppings, and a customization option.  Had their salad special--spinach, delicata squash, roasted beets, 2-yr old cheddar, lightly dressed. Easy walking distance from the shopping mall.  Extensive beer menu. Recommended!
