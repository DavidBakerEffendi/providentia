I came here today for a quick plain slice, it didn't dissapoint!  But, like others have said, NYC truly has the best pizza.  This is pretty good for Philly!   I liked the oldies music playing, I heard Sherry by The Four Seasons, also some other classic rock hits, fun!   I like that they accept Visa, cool.  I'll be back, the slice was cheesy, and just a little bit greasy, which I love!  I like the NY nostalgic license plates and photos, that's neat.
