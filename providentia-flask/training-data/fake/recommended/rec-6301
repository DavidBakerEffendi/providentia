I had high hopes for this restaurant because of the reviews across the net - not just on Yelp but my boyfriend and I were both disappointed. This is not traditional Greek food - it's more rustic Greek with an American twist.  I ordered what I thought would be a traditional Greek salad but it was just marinated tomatoes and cucumbers with a couple olives and triangles of feta on top.  Overly disappointing.  My boyfriend ordered the Moussaka - the potato was tasty but the rest was just off.  Neither of us finished our meal - eating only 3 or 5 bites a piece.  Our waiter never questioned whether we liked the meal or not. The waiter was friendly, but the rest of the staff was just plain rude.  They wrote our phone number down wrong for the wait list, so we finally called them and they said they were hoping we'd call since the number was incorrect.  When we got there again for our seating, the hostess and her sidekick were rude.  We waited about 10 minutes to get our water from the buss-er and were told we had to order our entire meal at once - appetizer and entree as they take long to prepare. Lastly, we left my boyfriend went to use the restroom and I walked across the street to the ice cream shop.   I immediately realized I forgot my phone on the table and turn around.  Our dishes had not yet been cleared, that's how long I hadn't been gone, and went to retrieve my phone.  As I was gathering my phone, the hostess stood there and scolded me as if I were a child for forgetting my phone and said "That's not ALL you forgot" as my boyfriend left his wallet - though he was still in the restaurant using the restroom. This was also my birthday dinner - I was less than happy due to the staff, food, and overall experience.
