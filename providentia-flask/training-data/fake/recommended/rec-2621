WOW! This was a total surprise to me.  I had heard how good the burgers were here and tried not to get my hopes up (re: Blue 9).  I really didn't know what to expect and saw the barroom setup and very little seating space in the back I started to think it was same deal UNTIL......I saw a their burger! It was a very nice sized burger for the price they had.  It was done exactly as I ordered and they have beer!! McSorely's no less! Typical example of the hole in wall place with a great food. I can't wait to go back again.
