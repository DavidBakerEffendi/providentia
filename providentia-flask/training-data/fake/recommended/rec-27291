Excellent choice of restaurant in LES. We sat at the bar and had a lovely waiter who was great at recommending cocktails. We had a few dark rum mojitos and grapefruit margaritas. The waiter even let me sample the jalape√±o spirit which was soooo hot!! Loved it! Food was yummy, especially the chips and guac. Great atmosphere, friendly staff.....give it a try!
