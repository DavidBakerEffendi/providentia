I write a 1 star review for Santucci's with great reluctance. I have had many great meals from this place and order 1 to 2 times a week.  On this particular night my order consisted of 2 chicken Caesar salads and an antipasto board.  As usual they estimated the delivery to be 45 mins.   After 1 hour I called to see if my order was possibly forgotten.  I was told it went out 8 minutes prior to my call (so 52 mins to make 2 salads and cuts some lunch meat).  15 minutes later, 1 hr and 15 mins total, I finally hear the doorbell ring.  I grabbed my order, tipped the driver (not his fault right?), and opened the bags. What I found was plastic container for the antipasto that was minuscule (menu says feeds 2-3).  I called because I was upset that my $40 salad delivery was so light in the food.  The offer to me was to not eat the antipasto and they would send me a new one they could get out in 20 mins.  So after waiting 1hr and 15 mins I was supposed to now wait 20 mins (yeah right 20 mins).  I told her thanks but no thanks and hung up.  To perfect my evening I opened my Caesar salad to which I had asked for no croutons only to find them everywhere. This was an incredible dissappointment from a place I like so much and their remedy was unacceptable.  It's ashame because the food is great and although the service has always been slow the was ridiculous.
