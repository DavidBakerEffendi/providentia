My curiosity got the best of me. Went ahead and finally checked out this place yesterday. Don't be fooled by it's size or location. Once you step inside, it's like a whole other world. Although tiny, it's quite quaint. Also comfortable if you're lucky enough to snag a seat. There's signs above the counter explaining what to expect right off the bat. Super-duper clean, with an A grade to boot. Nevermind the cuteness though, how's the food? These empanadas are the best I've ever had, bar none. I had one corn flour codfish, one white flour cheese, and finished it off with a dessert patty of guava and cheese. Each one was pretty solid. My personal favorite being the guava and cheese mix. If you're dining in, the empanadas will be served on a wooden platter, along with a green sauce condiment. I didn't try the organic wheat flour ones, but that's for next time. The best part is that there's both meat and vegetarian options. Another perk? If you don't feel like cooking tonight, supposedly you can order some to go, then reheat the empanadas at home. I assume you can probably reheat either in the microwave or toaster oven. Regardless of whether it's dine in or take out, you're gonna get that food high. A Queens gem indeed.
