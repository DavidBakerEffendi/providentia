I don't get to this part of Jersey much.  Well, really ever.  So when I went down to see a friend for a weekend all for and other such choices were completely up to them.  Petrock's was out stop for dinner on Friday night. The place is big but just as busy.  The bar area was packed the whole time we were there and we had to wait for probably 20-30 minutes to get a table around 8pm on a Friday night.   Upon sitting down, I learned that my friend of almost 20 years is now a pescatarian.  I take a more meat for the meat eaters approach with all forms of vegetarian types, but I was mainly surprised that they would pick a bar for dinner then.  How many bars have a substantial vegetarian (plus fish) menu? Well this one does.  They have a vegetarian page to the menu plus a most of their other sections of the menu had at least one veggie choice.  We split an order of veggie nachos to start (ok, a bit too heavy on the black olives for my taste) and my friend got a pizza to start.  I, however, rejected all forms of vegetarianism and got a burger with blue cheese and bacon.  My friend and his wife did their best to hide their horror as I wolfed down our fallen cow colleague, and I did my best to not criticize the bar for putting red onion on a mushroom & onion pizza. They've also got a full bar with a solid beer selection, it was Stella for me that night.  I don't know much about the area, but the bar seemed like a decent spot to catch a game or meet up with friends for a low key night out as well. Like I said at the start, I don't get down to this area very often, but Petrock's is a solid, friendly bar with a friendly atmosphere.  Definitely worth checking out.
