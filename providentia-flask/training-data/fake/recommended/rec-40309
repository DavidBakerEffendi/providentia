I really cant say much other than I wish I was there and eating one. Kind of reminds me of the way my mother cooks her burgers. So to me it was a happy flash back to childhood. This place is classic and I've seen it since all over TV and other spots. I am just happy I can say, "I had the og burger!" This is THE great fat burgers... yum!
