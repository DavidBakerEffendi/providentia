I dined here last night with a couple of friends for Restaurant Week.  Although I have a huge crush on Tom Colicchio and love watching him on Top Chef, I'd never actually eaten at one of his restaurants and was very excited about it! I was incredibly impressed with both the food and the friendly/accommodating service.  We sat outside to take advantage of the view and the break from the heat wave, and while it was very nice, the cars driving by on the FDR were a bit loud.  (I can't blame that on the restaurant though!)   For my first course, I had the avocado and hamachi salad.  I was pleasantly surprised by the serving size as I assumed it would be tiny for restaurant week.  While it was $5 extra, it was worth it - fresh and delicious with just the right amount of spice and, of course, the presentation was almost as impressive as the taste.  One of my friends tried the calamari salad and said she thoroughly enjoyed it.   For my main course, I had the pork chop - again, the serving was larger than I expected for restaurant week and I ate the entire thing.  It was flavorful and not the slightest bit dry which is often the downfall of pork dishes, in my opinion.  One of my friends ordered the duck breast and said it was delicious.  Finally, for my dessert, I chose the ice cream with peaches and sponge cake and my friends both chose the chocolate tart.  They both said the tart was fantastic.  My dessert was "ok" but I wouldn't necessarily rely on my opinion when it comes to dessert because I don't have much of a sweet tooth.   Between the $5 extra charge for the appetizer and the bottle of wine, my portion came to $69.  Worth every penny!
