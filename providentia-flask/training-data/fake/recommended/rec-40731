For lunch I ordered: Appetizer: Jones Chicken Nachos - good, plenty of toppings to go around, and the chips were homemade. There was more than enough to share among the 3 of us. Portobello mushroom sandwich - tasty, especially the tomato pesto "ketchup." In lieu of chips I ordered fries on the side - they were fresh and hot. The lunch menu offered a wide range of options if you are looking for more than a salad or sandwich (Jambalaya, for instance). Our server was very friendly and very attentive, and the atmosphere is laid back/fun/retro. I would definitely recommend Jones!
