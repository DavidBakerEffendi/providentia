Best place for roast pork.  I've eaten dozens of these sandwiches over the years and I've noticed some changes in the last year or so.  Perhaps since they moved locations inside the terminal. -When you order a roast pork (never even attempted other options), with peppers, they would put on a slightly spicy pepper.  Now they ask if you want sweet or hot.  The hots were pretty bleepin' hot!  I don't like all sweets cause you just get the tangy-ness flavor that obscure's the pork.  So to hot or to tangy.  Yesterday for the first time, I refused to have them put either option on my sandwich. -The only choice of greens was broccoli rabe.  Yesterday, I was asked if I wanted broccoli rabe or spinach. Wha??  They are known for this combination of roast pork and broccoli rabe.  Adam Richman from the show Man vs. Food did a special  either pork or roast beef with broccoli rabe.  Why mess with what they are known for? -Sharp Aged Provolone - Perfection - If they start offering American or Swiss I am going to have to organize a sit-in protest.  Be a true Philadelphia and don't cater to what everyone else in the market does!
