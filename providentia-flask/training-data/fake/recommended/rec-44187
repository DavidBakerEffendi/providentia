The food was delicious and the service was outstanding!!I got the chicken shish and my wife got the lamb shish. Both plates were amazing. The food tasted fresh, the meat was tender. The rice was really good too. The waiter was really nice and attentive. He opened and close the door when we got there and left. This place is really a gem. Not too many left that have great food and great service.
