This place is great for a special night out.  The space is tight and they don't take reservations for small parties, but the atmosphere is fun and relaxed.  Very charismatic wait staff with good recommendations, friendly and efficient without being overbearing.  Appetizers were great--the escargot was really wonderful, served in a thick sauce with apples, mushrooms, and bacon.  The wings were good too, fun presentation, but maybe nothing special.  I did like the real blue cheese that was served with it.  The skate main could have been a little more flavorful.  Definitely get the banana split for dessert.  The cost keeps from coming here more than once a year, though.  $14 for six wings is a little steep.  Dinner for four with three glasses of wine, two beers, and two cocktails was $300 with tax and tip.  It was great for a birthday dinner, but definitely not an ordinary night.
