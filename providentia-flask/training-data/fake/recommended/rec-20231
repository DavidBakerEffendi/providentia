Best brunch in the area (Buttermilk Channel is better but that's a mile away in Carroll Gardens). Really nice & comfortable room. Food is solid. The uovos affogato (eggs in spicy tomato sauce) are delicious. The tuna & fennel salad has been happily devoured by friends, as has the bread pudding. Perhaps Strong Place could learn from this bread pudding? Wish they served regular coffee instead of only espresso.
