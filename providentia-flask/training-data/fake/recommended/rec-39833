As I've said before I'm a huge Top Chef junkie, I couldn't come to New York without stopping by Perilla.  It was one of two "must do's" for this trip. We arrived early and had to wait a few minutes for our table, but we were seated right around our reservation time.  The service was attentive without hovering. I had the hamachi appetizer, the hanger steak entree, and the s'more for dessert. My dining companion had the gnudi, risotto, and doughnuts. The risotto was definitely the biggest hit at the table, though everything was good. The highlight of the evening was getting to meet Harold. He came out to speak to another table and I observed to our waiter that I was a fan. He said we could go back in the kitchen and say hi provided it wasn't busy. He even brought a menu for Harold to sign. He was very nice and happy to talk with us. I've had experiences in the past where chefs grudgingly dealt with diners. It definitely wasn't the case here.
