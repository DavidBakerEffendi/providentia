Love Alice's Arbor! One of my fav farm-to-table craft beer bars for breakfast/lunch/dinner or just a cocktail. Located in the Â Clinton Hill/Bedstuy area - I can't get enough of this gem. It's been a minute with the holiday craze and am excited to be back - love! love! love! the veggie omelette w/no cheese plus bacon (Yeah I know - paleo) or just a coffee w/almond milk to-go. The kale salad is insane and their bloodies on the weekend are amazing (try it w/bacon for a double zing) HH everyday from 4-7pm! Brunch on the weekends and holidays! Over the past 15 months I have repeatedly deferred to them as my living room away from home to host friends, family, colleagues or clients. Such a great staff - stop in and say hi! They would love to have you!!
