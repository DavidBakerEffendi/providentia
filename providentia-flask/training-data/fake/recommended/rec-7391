I like it here.  The menu is inventive and its quite impressive how many different dishes come out of a tiny oven and one chef who - totally focussed - is half man half robot. A nice range of wine, knowledgeable staff who are ready to let you try before you buy, and some fabulous cheese.  Nice place to hang out alone or with friends.
