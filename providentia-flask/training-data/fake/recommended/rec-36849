The grand marnier souffle is a SUPREME FOOD ORGASM... I would come back just for that! Burger was really so-so.  I've had much better burgers for less than half the cost of the overhyped "Black Label Burger"... sorry, guys. We were also in a really crammed-in table... not very comfortable. Overall, the room has a cool, "historical club" vibe.  The waitress was quite nice.  Souffle sensational.  Burger SUPER-MEH.  And it would be nice if the place expanded their menu to include things like cassoulet, duck confit, bouillabaisse, etc.  I just thought that their main dishes seriously lacked the panache and flavor of their dessert!
