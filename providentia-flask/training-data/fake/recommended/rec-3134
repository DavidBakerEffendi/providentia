This place deserves either 3 or 2 stars. 3 stars if you can't schlep down to st marks, because this is the best you'll get in midtown. 2 stars if you can make it down, because sake bar hagi is both more expensive and less tasty than the izakayas in the village. Personally, I feel gypped if I waste money and calories on mediocre food when I know there are other places within twenty minutes that are both cheaper and better. The ambiance here is also the sort of place you have to be DRUNK AND YELLING because all the other groups around you are, and the restaurant has reverberating acoustics that deliver the shouting from the table two away right to your ears.
