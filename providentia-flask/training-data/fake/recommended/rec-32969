Came here for New Years Eve dinner. Staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. The overall ambiance is great. The burgers are wonderful! I had the turkey burger and highly recommend it. The rest of the family's burgers looked fabulous too! Definitely will be back next time I am in town visiting.
