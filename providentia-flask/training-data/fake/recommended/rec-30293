Cool spot for brunch. Walked up and got on the list for brunch on a Sunday around 1pm. Was told a 30 min wait. So we walked across the street to grab a coffee at the Highline Hotel courtyard and hang while we waited. At exactly 30 min we walked back over and as we got there the host called our names. Perfect timing and great estimate on their part! We were seated on the patio (it was a nice day out today, score) and ordered. Ended up skipping the starters and just shared two brunch dishes between the two of us: Huevos Rancheros and Shatshuka. Both were great. Service was fast, food was good, atmosphere was great. Would definitely come back.
