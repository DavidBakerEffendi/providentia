I went to Reading Terminal where they had everything you can think of.  Fresh produce, deli, cheese, coffee, baked goods, olive oil, Dutch, Amish, Indian, Italian, American, Asian,  and so much more. Then there was Tommy Dinics. I remember going the day before and saw the line to be endless, a reason I had to come back and try it out. I was not disappointed. Ordered a roast beef with provolone and broccoli rabe, a tasty grease filled hoagie. I loved it. The broccoli rabe was soaked in a big pan filled with marinade, cooked well done. It brought out a very pungent smell, but tasted great. Just like a durian, smells like shit but it's good. What sets this apart from Genos and Pats?  The  thick slices of beef and cheese stuffed in between the bread, overflowing with broccoli rabe. I couldn't wait to get home and finish it up. I will be spending time in Reading Terminal the next time I go down.
