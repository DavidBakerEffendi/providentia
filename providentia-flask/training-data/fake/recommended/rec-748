As a resident of Tel-Aviv for a few years, seeing this place pop up in my hometown of the Illedelph was a pleasant surprise indeed. My wife and I popped in to pick up some snacks for a picnic and were pleasantly surprised. The lamb hummus was bangin'. So for those of you out there looking for a taste of "home" - this place has it. Would be great if they had more going on outside of hummus/tahini, more seating and more than a wall of posters to represent one of my all-time favorite cities, but it gets the job done for sure. If you're into hummus this place is about as fresh/authentic as your going to get and a really great place to swing into for lunch or a hearty snack.
