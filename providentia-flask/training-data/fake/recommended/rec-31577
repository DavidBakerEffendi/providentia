My guy found this place for us through Yelp! one night when were craving some Thai in the area.  All of the reviews were positive, so we said, "Let's do this!"  After one try, It has quickly turned into our little place to hit whenever we're feeling a tiny bit fancy.   The food is INCREDIBLE!  The fried tofu appetizer is the best...A thin crunchy crust over bite sized tofu pieces with a great sweet and sour relish to dip with.  The ginger pandanus tea is probably the greatest beverage I've ever had...The flavors dance on your tongue and can bring anyone to their knees!  Their curries are perfect!  You can get them as sweet or as spicy as you want without any lip from the staff. Speaking of the wait staff, they are really great and know exactly what they are talking about.  They will explain what every single item is on the menu if you asked them to, I'm sure! Bottom line? LOVE this place! Best Thai I've had around!
