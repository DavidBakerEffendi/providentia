I was impressed- we were a little nervous about the neighborhood, and it's one of those hole-in-the-wallish restaurants that I would always question, but the other reviewers gave it such good marks we just had to try. We had the hush puppies, Mac and cheese and shrimp Po' Boys. The hush puppies and sandwiches were perfect- the shrimp had a great crispy coating and the bread and aoli were fabulous. The Mac and cheese was probably a 3/5- it was made with real cheese (not cheese like sauce) but it is cafeteria style so lacking a little in freshness compared to our other food. Still very good, just not awesome. For warning though, the place is not air conditioned, if it's hot out, order to go :)
