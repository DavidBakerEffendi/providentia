This place is delicious!  A great atmosphere, and a great place to take really any group of people - parents, friends, etc. - and also a great place for vegetarians (I'm a vegetarian and found plenty to eat) It is definitely a bit on the pricey side, but worth it for a special occasion.  I went last fall for dinner with a friend (yes this review is a bit late) and had, among other items, the kobacha squash toast - which I STILL think about.  It's also easy to share plates/appetizers as your meal if you'd prefer, or get something on your own.  I'm also a sucker for places that use locally sourced ingredients, so that was also a bonus.  Looking forward to my next visit!
