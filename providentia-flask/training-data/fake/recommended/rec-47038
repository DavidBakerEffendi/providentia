Oh Sabrina, gurgle your sweet honey mustard froth on my chest! Great place! Went here on a recommendation from the concierge from my hotel. Did not disappoint! Was crazy busy on a weekend day lunch. I went with one other friend though and we were seated Â immediately. Tables are CLOSE together. Like I shared a spoon with an old man, close. The food was delicious though, and so many options! Great price, great food. Staff is very attentive for such a busy place. Even our waters were filled over and over again right on schedule. If I didn't have to get my leg rubbed by the old man sitting next to me this would of been 5 stars!
