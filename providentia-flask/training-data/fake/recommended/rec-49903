On the night that I went there, M Night Shyamalan was there too. Random fact that's of no relevance but I thought I'd mention it anyway. Also, I resisted the temptation to tell him that his movies suck. Anyway, on to the review. The space is great especially if you're with a large group. I can't comment much on die trinken since I'm not a beer drinker (went with other folks who are) but I did like the bottled cider I tried and, from what I hear, their beers are really good. At any rate, selection seemed better than that at most other places I've seen in Philly. I *can* comment on die essen They give you a massive serving of fries so be careful when you're ordering those and they taste really good (a kind of curry flavor). I also really liked the Bratwurst. It's expensive, yes, but worth the money, I'd say.
