This has been in my top 5 favorite restaurants in the city for years and has never fallen from grace. Â The BBQ platter and flaming volcano ate a must have. Everytime we go we get these and mix it up with other dishes. Another favorite of ours is the tomato crab soup. Vietnam has always served really good food; we have never had a bad experience.
