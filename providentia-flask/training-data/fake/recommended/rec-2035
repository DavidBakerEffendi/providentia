Ok, Johnny Brendas. I go here fairly often. The first floor bar is long. Ample number of tables in the back too. Lots of oddities adorn the wall and counter behind the bar. Stools are ragged and torn. Two pool tables take up a good bit of the first floor. Come summer, the outdoor seating is great. I enjoy watching the occasional el train go by and the hustle and bustle of Frankford & Girard. (The Girard Ave el stop is a hop, skip & jump away, another plus.) Under the same ownership as Standard Tap, you will find strong similarities between the food & beer menus. The waitstaff are also very cordial and attentive, like at the Tap. Really tough to say one is "better" than the other. It really depends on you and what you're after on any given outing. A total "eye of the beholder" - type thing. The one thing JBs has that ST doesn't is a steady flow of live music on their second floor. I love going to see shows there. Since it is a little more rocking than it's sister bar to the south, does it attract a younger crowd you might ask? Well maybe, but it doesn't really matter. It's not a clubby, dancey, pukey, pretensey kind of young. It's more of a laid-back, chill vibe than anything else and that always crosses age barriers. It's hard not to feel comfortable at JBs. It's gritty, but charming. If you want to let your hair down yet still require the quality of food and beer that comes with a top notch gastropub, this is the place to be. My advice: Keep an eye on their band schedule and go see a show there!
