I do not even know where to start! This place was awesome. It was so close to the stadiums and it was spacious too. We were looking for a bar to have some appetizers in and we found Chickie's and Pete's! How lucky! We were able to sit at the bar be served right away. They have a large beer and drink selection. The menu was large too. We ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wing Nachos and Jalapeno Poppers. Being from Western New York and living in Buffalo for four years I know my chicken wings (and I love nachos). I have to say the nachos were out of this world. They were cooked just right, not soggy, full of flavor, just enough blue cheese and shredded chicken to make it perfect. I remember licking the plate clean. The jalapeno poppers were good, definitely go with the nachos though. They are famous for their crab fries, but we didn't try them. The service was fantastic too! The bartenders were on top of their game as soon as they saw our glasses empty they came over and checked in on us, but not in an annoying way. It is a great place to go for dinner, for a game, before a game or after a game. They also had a shuttle to the stadiums as well.
