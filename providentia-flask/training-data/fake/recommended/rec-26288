My friend and I waited for 2 hours to get the table. Seriously, why do you have to have people come in to put down the name and then have them wait for 2 hours? You could easily let your customer call in for a day-to-day reservation! Some people waited and got really grumpy and left.   We had Salmon Wrapped Poached Eggs and nutella french toast. The salmon was way too salty that you can't even eat it without drinking a lot of water. It ended up with tasting bitter so I have to throw them away. The French toast was too dry that you have to put in a lot of syrup. The sake bloody merry was the worst bloody marry that I've ever tried. Taste like dipping sauce of shrimp cocktail.   The waiter was nice though at least. He deserved a star. That's why there is this star.  But I would never come back and wasting two hours of my life to wait for the food which is not good at all...
