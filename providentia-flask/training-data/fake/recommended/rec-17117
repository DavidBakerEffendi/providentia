I went to Just Jake's for the first time on a Wednesday night and had a couple of beers and the Cuban Chicken Sandwich. The bartender was pleasant and friendly and the food was good. The crowd was a nice mixture of ages, so I think anyone could come here on a random night and feel comfortable. Because it was in the middle of the week it wasn't too crazy but I understand it gets pretty packed on Friday and Saturday nights when they have live music. I'd definitely come here again for beers and decent bar food!
