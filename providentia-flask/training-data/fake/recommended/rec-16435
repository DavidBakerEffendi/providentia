KOBEYAKI Interesting name, honesty it was the first thing that caught my eye, okay that is the lie, the door for some reason perked my interest. FOOD Okay it is over priced, I will come out an admit this. The food is not half bad and any place with sweet potato tempura fries honestly can charge me more. The bowls are good, could use more meat though and I shall agree with a previous review that there was no enough meat on the burgers. the Kobe be delicious but the moment doesn't last long and is soon overtaken by the bun. SERVICE Super nice people that give the aura of maybe liking there jobs a little, and may spot the owner walking around also (when it opened you can tell that the nervous man standing outside was him.) either way he too seems to enjoy the place. VISUAL NOTES Love the industrial look this place has, and of course it took me till the second time to realize under the booths are cubbie holes for your stuff and hooks on the tables for you bag, nice functional design! VERDICT This is Midtown next to a college, of course it will be over priced! Don't let that stop you though when you have a couple of spare quarters to stop by and get some good tastiness.
