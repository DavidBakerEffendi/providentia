This place is great for a casual lunch. You have a choice between a meal that's light (salads), medium (sandwich), or heavy (platter). Choose wisely, for you are also committing to a possibly-irreversible afternoon sleepiness level. If you don't have class after lunch, I say go all out! At 1, there are plenty of seats for small parties. The platters, priced at $9.50+, come with plenty of food (fries, choice of meat, salad, hummus, pita) and are great for sharing. I requested extra hummus on my chicken breast sandwich, half-expecting them to charge me extra, but nope, it was on the house.
