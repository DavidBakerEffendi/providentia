I used to go to Melissa's down the street because it has more seating, but I prefer prosperity for the quality and price. It boggles the mind how you can get soup,sesame pancake sandwich, dumplings and a soda for $5...and it be absolutely delicious????? This place is lifesaver when your broke and want to eat something extremely tasty. Fyi. ..weekends are sheer madness unless you get here early (when they open)or much later in the evening.
