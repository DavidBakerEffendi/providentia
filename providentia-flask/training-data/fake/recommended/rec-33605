The four stars I'm giving Iron Chef House belongs almost solely to their monkey roll. I've both eaten here and gotten takeout a number of times. The food is fine -- really, the usual assortment of sushi and rolls. But the fried shrimp, avocado and saucy rice roll they call the Monkey is fantastic. I can't Â get enough of them. Oooo! Ooooo! Aaaaah! Aaaaah! Pass the Monkey, please.
