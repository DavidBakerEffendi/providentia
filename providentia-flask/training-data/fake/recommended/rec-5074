This low rate is not for the food but based on a bunch of miscommunications. I stopped by today by 4 pm with my family. After we placed our order and got our drinks, we have been told that they had no more brisket, we changed our order and the waitress came back to inform us that they were out of meat till 5pm, only sides were available. We decided to finish our fritos pie (without silverware, cause they were out of it as well at this time!). Before we leave my son ordered a key lime pie to go. We realized on time that our waitress mixed up another fritos pie with the key lime we ordered. She took the bag to fix the mistake and brought it back to the table. Unfortunately my son realized once we get home that he was still missing his pie :-( Unpleasant experience at Morgan's barbecue which left us a bitter feeling
