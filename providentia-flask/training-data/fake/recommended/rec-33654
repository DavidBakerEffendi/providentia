Freshness counts, perhaps in sushi more than any other cuisine. And Iron Chef House has been reliably on the occasions when my husband and I have eaten here. We typically order the same or similar dishes (sushi deluxe and chirashi over brown rice), and whether it's Tuesday night take-out, Friday night delivery or a Saturday night sit-down meal, we've never been let down.
