My wife and I walk about a mile in each direction to enjoy our favorite sandwich a turkey club with potato salad. Let me tell you the walk is well worth it. They give you so much for a great price. The sandwich is always delicious and the potato salad is fantastic. Also there is no skimping on the portions. The staff and owner are so friendly and great to hangout with while you wait for your order to be completed. If you find yourself hungry and are near by stop in you won't be sorry you did.
