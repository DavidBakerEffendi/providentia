This place is absolutely adorable!  We walked in around 7:30pm and the place was still filling up for the evening.  The head waiter greeted us at the door, as did the chef whose kitchen is basically "in" the dining room.  The specials sounded so good we wanted to order it all; the wine list had a great variety including some very affordable by the glass options; the decor was quaint and fitting for the Isle of Capri!  I would like to point out that the cheap ($6.95, pre-fixe) meal option is a lunch deal, not dinner.  Here are the highlights. * Affordable with good portions * Variety in the menu was a surprise; the salad special we had was served with an awesome house-made vinaigrette * Got to watch the chef prepare our meals individually from our seats! * Faint music gave a nice ambiance without being annoying. * We opted out of dessert, so 10 minutes later, the head waiter brought out a great plate of specialty biscotti and whipped cream to enjoy anyway.  Yum, yum, yum! From the street, this gem does not look so appealing, but it's a find and we loved it!  Note that they DO NOT take credit cards!  Also, it was raining a bit when we were eating so the staff decided to save water by placing all their live plants outside to catch the rainwater. It was endearing. =)  Thanks once again, fellow Yelpers, for a great suggestion!  I'm a fan!
