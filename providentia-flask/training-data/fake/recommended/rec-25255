Best place for inexpensive, yet delicious Chinese food. The wait is 5-10 minutes, usually longer during meal times since it can be packed with tourists. This location is cheaper though than it's 14th St. sibling. Items really worth trying: Wontons in Spicy Sauce, Sesame Pancakes with Peking Duck, and Chive & Pork dumpings. Unfortunately, I have not had the greatest experience with their soups. The Hot & Sour soup is okay, but not spicy enough by my standards and their dumpling and noodle soups are a little bland.
