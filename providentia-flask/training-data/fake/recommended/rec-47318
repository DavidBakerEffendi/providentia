This place brings me back to the Summer of '08 and my trip to Nice.  Totally quaint and adorned with memorabilia from the French Riviera, I sat across from my companion with a prime view of Hotel Negresco on the Nice boardwalk (albeit from a souvenir hanging on the wall).   The food is absolutely delicious and super cheap!  The duck rillete and duck liver pate appetizer are a killer and come in a very generous portion.  My special-of-the-day hangar steak ($14!!!) was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  AND the best part is, they have an extensive crepe offering, both sweet and savory; seriously this is the first place I've seen since being in Paris that offers creme de maron.  I've been here twice and nothing has disappointed, except the woman next to me who had the never ending voice of a bullhorn and did not realize she was talking over EVERYTHING in the restaurant.  Almost would've ruined the dining experience had she not finished eating and left.
