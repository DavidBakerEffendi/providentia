"Whiz-wit!" "Eight dollars.  NEXT!" That's it.  That's all it takes. There is a difference between gruff and rude, a distinction subtle enough for the Easily Offended to miss. The few times I've been to Pat's they've been gruff, but they've never been rude.  And that's OK.  The line is long and they want to keep it moving.  It's hot as hell back there they're grumpy.   But some people are expecting rudeness and end up acting rudely themselves; sort of a preemptive strike.  In return, they do get the rudeness.  And they deserve it. You're never going to see these people again, so why waste time (yours or theirs) by making idle chit-chat.  There's 30 people behind you, so why waste time hemming and hawing over what to order.  Know what you want and say it.   There's also no accounting for good taste.  I find their gruffness to be part of the charm of eating here, the way that my feet sticking to the floor adds to the charm of going to a movie. Oh, the food?  You want to know about the food?   Well, it's a Philly Cheesesteak.  Now, I'm not a fan of saying, "It is what it is" but..... Yeah, it is what it is. And it's the best cheesesteak I've had.  The meat is chopped up so that it mixes with the cheese and onions to provide balanced flavor.  The cheese Whiz is hot and melty.  The bread is firm enough to handle the weight of the filling without being too hard to chew comfortably.  And the steak still tastes like steak through it all. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to cruise I-95 between Philly and Boston to figure out where a Cheesesteak magically becomes a Steak And Cheese.
