Best no frills burger in NYC, HANDS DOWN! Came here for lunch last Friday after talking it up to my co-workers, hoping that we wouldn't be disappointed.  Expectations were met and EXCEEDED.  CB was as good, if not better than I remember it being the last few times I came here.  I ordered a Bistro Burger (Bacon cheeseburger) and I also split a plain cheeseburger with my buddy to get the unadulterated flavor of the meat.  Every bite of the burger was cooked perfectly to a deep red medium rare as it should.  I really could find no fault anywhere even if I want to nit-pick.  We didn't order fries as the shoestring ones they serve are nothing special.  Who comes here for the fries though??  We all had such a great meal that we have agreed to make a monthly trip down to West 4th, even though we work in Midtown.
