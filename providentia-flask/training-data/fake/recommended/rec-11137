We decided to try August First for lunch on our first day visiting Burlington based on Yelp reviews and found it to be just OK. The place is a converted garage that offers various breads, soups, and sandwiches at reasonable prices. Wife got the Turkey Bistro sandwich which featured smoked turkey with Swiss cheese, lettuce, and a honey curry spread. She is a sucker for a tasty, well-constructed turkey sandwich, but did not care for these one too much. The sourdough bread was delicious, but neither of us was too enamored with the curry spread which was basically an over-dominant mustard that permeated every bite in a negative way. I got the BLT on a Baguette, which was exactly what it sounded like. And in the end, it was quite good. Delicious bacon for sure, and good bread, but nothing to take it to the next level of sandwich glory. Overall, August First was a nice stop but ultimately kind of forgettable. I'd go back, but only after trying some of Burlington's other sandwich options first.
