Jimmy's Diner is an intimate, cozy pseudo-diner in the depths of Williamsburg. Â There is a good selection of breakfast dishes, as well as sandwiches and platters for lunch and dinner. We headed here around noon for a late breakfast. It's good if you're on a budget, because you can get 2 eggs, home fries, and cornbread for $6. They also have "breakfast bowls" which involve throwing random eggs, potatoes, guacamole, and salsa into a bowl. Gluttonous, but delicious. Their Bloody Marys were tasty, but not out of this world. They also have a selection of milkshakes that can be made with or without alcohol. For Wiliamsburg, this is a great alternative to something like Kellog's. Though not open 24 hours, the food is better and the prices are better. If you're looking for a greasy spoon with cheap coffee and cheap diner food, this is not the place.
