I have long wanted to try this Japanese ramen restaurant and finally was able to stop by for a visit. Like many ramen places, the line was out of this world, but as a single diner I was fortunate to grab a seat at the large communal table as soon as I arrived. The venue was larger than expected. It encompassed a wait area, an open kitchen, and several large tables surrounded by booths that reached from one wall to another. The decor was unlike many dark and eclectic ramen places I know, it was rather trendy, hipsterish, and accompanied by servers and ramen chefs who were oddly not Japanese. I started off with the Tako Wasabi ($5) that came in a small cup filled with chopped raw baby octopus served with a smudge of wasabi, salty mustard, a slice of lemon, and mint leaf. Serving was small, but the Tako Wasabi had great texture as the wasabi flavor was sharp but pleasant to complement the subtle salty lemony minty flavors in every bite. I recommend it. My ramen, Akamaru Modern ($15), consisted of tonkotsu broth, umami dama miso paste, pork chasiu, cabbage, sesame kikurage mushrooms, scallions, and garlic oil. The broth had decent flavor with enough lift coming from the cabbage and scallions, but the deep tonkotsu flavor did not render the savory creamy marble broth that I was searching for. I was hoping that the toppings could supplant the lack of depth in the broth, but the added soft-boiled egg ($2) did not have enough seasoning and the charsiu was cut rather small for the price. Service was hands-off and brief. For $17, I was expecting a lot more than what I would get from cheaper and better places such as Tsujita, Santouka, Daikokuya, Robata Jinya, and Totto Ramen. It was overall still a decent meal but the outrageous cost brought the rating down to a 3 star rating. I will be sticking to Totto Ramen on my next trip to NYC.
