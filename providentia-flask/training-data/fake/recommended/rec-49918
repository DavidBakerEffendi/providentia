Thank God I live near this place! Whether for brunch, dinner, or drinks, this is place is awesome. The boy and I have been going here so often lately that our usual server Steve remembers our orders. We even make a point to go here every weekend for brunch while we're doing laundry across the street. My faves include the black bean burrito with chipotle mayo (brunch) and the nachos with chorizo (dinner). I don't like beer, but they have a nice selection of craft beers. Definitely worth checking out, especially if you live near the area.
