Five of us went to Knock last night, and had a blast. We decided to share dishes so we tried many of their specialties, and they were all terrific. Woody, the owner, came and sat with us, so we got to know the history of the place as well. While more a gay restaurant, it welcomes everyone, and I highly recommend it.
