I used to absolutely love White Dog when I was younger. The menu was so creative and unique, and the atmosphere was fantastic. But since it has been taken over from the original owner, and expanded, making the university city location bigger and adding the Wayne location, I think the service and quality has suffered. At brunch time on Sunday mornings, they seem to have more diners than their kitchen can handle, and so service is slow and the food frequently comes out cold. I understand that food needs to be made ahead of time to keep up with the high demand, but this doesn't mean that my eggs should be room temperature when they reach my table. The taste and inventiveness of the food is still there, but none of that mattered when your omelet is rubbery from sitting in the kitchen too long. The prices are as expected for a university city restaurant, and I would say that the quality of the food has the potential to live up to them, if only it were proper temperature and delivered in a more timely way. Also they seem to have a lot of turnover in wait staff, and don't seem to properly train their new hires. I've had water spilled on me every time I've eaten there this year.
