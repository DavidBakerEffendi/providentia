My first time as a carnivore braving the world of vegan brunch and I was pleasantly surprised. While I could have gone with a "safer" option, I opted to try a variation of one of my all-time favorites:  the Tofu Benedict. While a round cut slab of tofu is certainly not as sexy as a poached egg, the vegan spin on hollandaise won my heart. A relatively large portion gave me a bit of tofu fatigue when all was said and done, but the lightly dressed salad and home fries helped me to power through. The decor was eclectic and the staff was super friendly (provided me with a maple coconut muffin for the road).  I am glad I made the choice to try Champs on this outing!
