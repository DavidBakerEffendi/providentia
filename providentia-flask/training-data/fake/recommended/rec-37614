Tucked away on a street in Brooklyn, Wheated is a small haven for delicious pizzas and drinks. To begin, Vincent, the Friday night bartender, is definitely meticulous and masterful when he makes your drink. The Horse's Neck had just the right amount of ginger- light and refreshing. But once you drink two, you're already on your way to enjoying Wheated a bit more (if you know what I mean). The pizzas look big, but believe me when I say that your stomach can handle all of it! The thin crust and fresh ingredients complement the drinks well.
