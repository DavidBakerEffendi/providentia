Came here for my birthday right before watching Once. I'll be the first to admit before this place I hated Italian food and was actually hesitant to go to Becco- Italian food was way out of my comfort zone. Upon initial arrival I immediately assumed it would be the type of restaurant that served ridiculously small portions that left you starving- I was very WRONG! We were seated immediately and our waiter was really nice- not stuck up at all. He mentioned all of these specials- so many that I actually stopped listening after some time. They bring out this bread basket with two types of bread, cheesy bread sticks (yummy), olives (wish I tried them) and this yellow bean dip. To start we got the fresh mozzarella and roasted peppers (mozzarella Lavorata)- mouth watering! It had golden raisins which gave it such a subtle sweetness. I ordered the stuffed cabbage with veal, pork and meat. I tried to find it on the menu that's posted online, but couldn't find it now. Anyhow, it came with spinach spetzle (YUMMY- I need to learn how to make this) which I'm currently craving. It was crispy, but soft all in one bite. It was one of the best things I've had in a while. It changed my view of Italian food- guess I didn't hate it after all. He got some type of pork chop and all I can remember was that it was a very large portion- like I didn't think they came in that size kind of large! While I may have been stuffed to the brim, we did get dessert. The tiramisu was very delicious, but I thought it was a tad strong for my liking. The panna cotta was better for me as it was smooth and creamy without an overabundance of sweetness. I normally cringe at the thought of an Italian restaurant, but I am so glad we came here. I would definitely want to go back at some point.
