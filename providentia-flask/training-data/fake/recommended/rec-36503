We came in on a whim and got lucky to get a table while a dozen people where already waiting at the bar. The food was very good, I had the Pumpkin Ravioli, Chicken Riesling and strawberry rubarber pie. Combined with a nice whine, which is defintely where their profits are on. The service was impeccable and would defintely go again.
