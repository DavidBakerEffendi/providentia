Very rude waiters, very unaccommodating.. they sat us next to the bathroom even when there were seats available, we (kindly) asked to move if possible, were rudely told "no." Usually people give an explanation, but he only gave one after I stood there awkwardly for a while- I stood there counting in my head to just to see how long it would take him to give one, and I got to 8 until he finally mentioned, "its closed".
