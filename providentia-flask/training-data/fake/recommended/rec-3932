Haiku Review: Yeah, cool atmosphere. But lame waiter and dull eggs make for a whack brunch. PS I only went here once and to be fair, the coffee was pretty good. The waiter was so lame though! Dude answered his cell phone mid-order, walked away to continue conversation, and then went to a different table.
