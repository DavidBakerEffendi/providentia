We met friends for dinner last weekend and had a great time.  We came at about 6:45 pm on Friday and had no trouble getting seated. Antipasto platter: okay Smelts: excellent, but the accompanying dip should be jazzed up Truffle/mushroom Pappardelle:  very good Beet ravioli specia:  excellent Striped Bass: okay Grilled Artichoke side:  excellent Service was adequate.  The atmosphere is conducive to a larger party and I really liked the front room (by the open kitchen), but the rest of the restaurant feels too cavernous.  Generally, however, I am not a huge fan of this decorating style (fake Italian).   The best thing about this dinner (other than the company) was its good value: we spent $75 (including taxes and a 20% gratuity) for two and had two apps, one pasta entree, one fish entree, one dessert and two coffee beverages.   I would go again for a casual dinner with friends on the spur of the moment.
