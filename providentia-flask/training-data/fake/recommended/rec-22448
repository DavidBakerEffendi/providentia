I came here a few weeks ago with some friends and we really enjoyed this place. The restaurant is huge and has a bar area out front, restaurant area in back, and an outdoor seating area out back. They have quite a good selection of drinks and an extensive menu and they will sell a small flight of their house brews (not on the menu). I tried the fish and chips and they were fantastic - very fresh and crispy. This is a solid place overall and I definitely recommend it!
