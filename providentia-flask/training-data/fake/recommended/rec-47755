I love Pizza.  I love this pizza.  I understand that this particular pizza is an institution.  There is good reason for that. The first time I visited New Haven, I was immediately taken to eat pizza at Frank Pepe's.  Don't drop off your bags, just leave um in the car, lets go get some pizza.  I admit, I didn't get it until I put it in my mouth.  And then I did.  Because the pizza is a amazing. I learned a few new rules on how to order pizza, Mozzarella takes too long to say, so it's with Moose.  I love it.  The culture, the myth, the fervor are all so wonderful with this iconic spot.  You will have to wait a bit if you want to dine in, which I suggest for a first-timer, but it's also a good idea to call ahead and pick up. Just go there and eat it.  You'll be happy.
