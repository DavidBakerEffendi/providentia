I have eaten here once before, the food is executed very well. There is always a line for the coffees and pastries they sell at the counter. I recently tried their seasonal Maple Milk - Â it is insanely good. (I just wish I could get a small cup instead of the only size being large, had to share it because it was way too rich after awhile. Need to come in a try a few more things before I can 5 star them. I will update after next visit, which should not be too long from now. Keep doing a great job, friendly staff!
