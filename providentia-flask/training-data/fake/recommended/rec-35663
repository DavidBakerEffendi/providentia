Having been to Amada twice already, I had high expectations for Tinto. Boy, did it ever deliver. Although smaller in restaurant size and menu size, the flavor was just as strong and amazing as Amada. The dessert menu was the only weak area, only having 4 choices, none of which sounded amazing to me, so we passed. The standout dish of the night was the scallops- definitely order!!! Other fabulous choices were the brisket sandwich and patatas bravas (different style of serving and taste than Amada.) Don't miss out of another one of Garces' gems.
