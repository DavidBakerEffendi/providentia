This is a great hang out spot with a real fireplace!  Very good music and chilled crowd.  However, I made a lethal mistake by having dinner with 6 other friends here, and their food was bad period.  My seafood soup was purely disgusting.  Again, it was my mistake.  Stick with the appetizers and drinks.
