I violated one of my own guidelines: "Don't eat Mexican food east of the Mississippi".  First: the food here is good, if bland.  What fools you is the food only looks like Mexican food. $18 for an enchilada platter?!  That price should include dwarves and scented oil. Beans that look like Boston Baked Beans?And finally new food rules:   "Run away, don't walk, if the tortilla chips come in colors." "Yelpers are not reliable."
