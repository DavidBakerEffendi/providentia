Disappointed.  I'm a big Jose Garces fan, and can honestly say that I love all of his restaurants...except for this one.  The food is tapas sizes but entree prices, and it mostly tasted like butter.  We tried a solid portion of the menu, not really impressed with any of it, and some of it had to be sent back for being defected.  $75 per person later, and we left hungry.  The space doesn't feel intimate and parking is somewhat of a disaster.  Sad to say that for the first time, a Garces restaurant disappointed me.  Not going back. :o(
