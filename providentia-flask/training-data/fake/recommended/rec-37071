Pros : Very tasty thai food (salads, appetizers and entrees). fast service. Best thai food in Hell's kitchen. They make curries without fish sauce which a lot of Thai restaurants don't. Interesting ambience. Good regular mohito there. Plenty veg/vegan options.Customize your dishes without much fuss. Cons : Very noisy. Not my pick for a first date, especially in the peak dinner times. Waiters whiz by every few minutes to ask if you're done almost in a fake polite manner sounding like "you need to leave soon". I've heard lots of people and strangers on tables next to us complain about this.
