Went there on a recommendation for breakfast, but was unimpressed with the pancakes. Fat, lifeless. Great views of the river. Mixed lot when it comes to staffing - some staff was unfriendly while server was quite pleasant. I only ate 1/2 of a short stack of pancakes, but the server didn't inquire if I didn't like. My partner had a hamburger and was very pleased with it, although it somewhat deconstructed itself due to too many condiments in it. Would recommend for the view. Not to the food so much.
