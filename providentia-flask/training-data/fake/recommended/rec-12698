It was my first time at this restaurant and I was far from impressed.   The oh-so raved about sweet potato fries are decent...in my humble opinion the frozen ones from Trader Joe's are far superior. The classic pho with beef was just OK.  I wouldn't be able to comment on the flavor of the broth or the beef because it was overpowered with an absurd amount of cilantro.   My boyfriend and I both ate the lemongrass chicken.  It was good in the moment, but the aftermath was far from enjoyable.  We both were plagued with illness. Sure, the price points are good but spend a few bones more and you can enjoy a far better Vietnamese meal.
