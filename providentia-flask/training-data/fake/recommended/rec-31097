We just got back from In Riva, and the meal was so fantastic that I finally created a Yelp Account just to write this review!  We started with the whipped ricotta "vasi", and every component was absolutely delicious - the subtle sweetness of the ricotta, the richness of the roasted onions, and the perfectly toasted crusty bread with a drizzle of high quality olive oil.  Our next course was the meatballs, which were moist and bursting with flavor, with a rich, complex sauce.  We also got the spicy ham pizza, which had a really nice kick, and a delicious crust with the perfect touch of char.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful, and we appreciated how direct she was in helping us decide what to order (instead of the typical diplomatic answer that everything is good).  We enjoyed a lovely evening on the outdoor terrace, and I have nothing but wonderful things to say about In Riva!
