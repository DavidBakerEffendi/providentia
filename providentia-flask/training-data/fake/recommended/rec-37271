Dear Umami Burger, You make me want to holla at you from the passenger side of a car. You are the sexiest, most deliciously moist, and delectable burger I have ever experienced in this lifetime; I have hit Nirvana and came back to preach about your greatness! My other half insisted we come here and not debate about any other place for our 1 Year Engagement (awwwwwww!).  Here's the break down: We entered. We were seated. Menus hit the table. Gave them back without opening them and said, "Truffle burgers & truffle fries". That was it.  Ignore the ketchup on the table; it's not needed - trust me.  Take small bites; you will cry when your plate is empty.  The truffle fries were crispy and cheese-y, with the subtle taste of truffle; sinful! Top the dinner off with an ice cream sandwich with sea salt and caramel, and you will wish you worked out an hour or two before you ate it.  Do NOT leave without trying one!  Sharing is welcome. What's even better?  The bill being about $40 for us two.  Impossible for Manhattan? Not at all!   See you in the New Year!
