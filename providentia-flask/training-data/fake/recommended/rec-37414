This place was great! Couldn't decide between so many things on the menu... I had the Cow Girl (veggie burger) which was great. My friend had the french toast, which comes with cornflakes fried around the outside giving it a nice crunch. Also the fried chicken was apparently great. Sometimes they have Kale, definitely worth it for a side.
