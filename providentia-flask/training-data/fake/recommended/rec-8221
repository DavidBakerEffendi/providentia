Went here for quick breakfast, had the egg sandwich- Portuguese roll was very good although Bacon thick cut not crispy, came with home fries. Very nice shop and service, not sure would call the food healthy but was the best hot grab n go option I could see. Â Would consider for lunch as that menu looked healthier.
