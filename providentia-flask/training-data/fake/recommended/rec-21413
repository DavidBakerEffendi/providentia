Had to bump this down to a three star rating. Here's why: It gets SUPER crowded now late at night. I guess the word got around that this is the new late night spot for food, but my friends and I got to Shiao Lan Kung, and waited fifteen minutes at the door, when clearly there were tables open for us to sit at. Strike one. When we finally got seated, it took another twenty minutes for the waiter to take our order. We said we were waiting on two other people and they were late, but I figured the waiter or someone would've came over and asked us if we wanted to order first. Common sense much? The food wasn't that great this time around as well. The pan fried dumplings weren't as crispy or hot. They also upped the price to $6 for 8 dumplings. The salt and pepper squid seemed to rubbery and WAY too salty. The sweet and sour BBQ pork just did not satisfy my needs for that night. Side note, there's a sign that says their credit card machine isn't working, but they'll swipe your debit/credit card if you pay more than $20. Overall, Shiao Lan Kung is a better spot to eat at late at night compared to Rising Tide, but it's not the best spot anymore.
