Was sent over from Traif... should have known better. Our table was not allowed to see a food menu until we ordered our drinks (red flag) The staff seemed knowledgeable and nice enough, but after waiting almost an hour for tapas and 10 minutes for a coke is pretty ridiculous. The wine menu is just beyond stupid....I cant even. The food was just ok and overpriced considering the small portions. After eating here and spending $150, i went to ANOTHER place to eat. Ahh the new Williamsburg dining scene, where you have to go out to eat after you go out to eat.
