Horrible experience. Went there for dinner with my wife on Valentine's Day. We were looking forward to ordering a Lamb appetizer, Lamb Chops and Organic Chicken. But when we sat our table we were informed by our server that on 14th Feb, we only had the option of going in for Chef's Tasting. So we only had the option of eating what the chef wanted us to eat not what we wanted to eat. My wife & I am not a big seafood fans and nor do we eat beef. So we spend $75 per head on food that we didn't enjoy at all. I made a reservation 1 month back and I feel when I was making reservation, I should have been informed of the limited menu that would be available on 14th Feb. Big let down. Definitely not worth the money.
