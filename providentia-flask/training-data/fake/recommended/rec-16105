I've been wanting to come here for some time and we finally made it for brunch last weekend. Started with a little pate to get things going.  Tasty with a couple of glasses of wine.  My husband ordered the chicken salad - steamed chicken with beans, potatoes - kind of reminded me of a nicoise.  Excellent. Great flavor and the chicken was super moist. I got the steamed eggs with smoked salmon and crew fraiche over toast.  Fabulous! Finished the meal with the most decadent chocolate mousse I think I ever had!  Soooo delicious! Looking forward to coming back and trying dinner!
