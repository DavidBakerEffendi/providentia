I found this place on Yelp and thought it sounded interesting. I went here with a couple other people on a Tuesday night. We ordered several tapas and some house special drinks. I'd recommend the guacamole and a Yucajito. The service was a little touch-and-go at times but we weren't in a hurry anyway and it didn't affect my overall experience.
