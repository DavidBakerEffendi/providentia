A strong favorite-- this place is a beacon of consistency. I always order the same things as the menu so helpfully includes all of my favorite foods. Fried Chicken 1/2 chilled lobster Marrow Bones (sometimes these need to be served a tad hotter- the kitchen doesn't want to risk overcooking them and turning the solidified fat into liquefied fat BUT they have been served to me undercooked and I have gotten ill. trust your judgement, IF (and only if) you know what you are talking about, otherwise, trust theirs. Kumumoto Oysters Steak tartar occasionally the terrific rack of lamb They will make you a hell of a White Russian, as they understand the true merits of the drink. They will also serve a perfect New Zealand Sauvingon Blanc with your oysters for a regional change of pace from french Sauvingon Blanc (i.e Sancerre). Wait patiently at the bar- yes you will have to endure sometimes inappropriately loud jerks who still think they are going someplace trendy. Ignore them, eat your perfect oysters.
