when i want to impress a guest with breakfast done right, i take them to cafe orlin. the food is very fresh and the ingredients stand out. the mushroom omelet has never failed to impress. coming from san francisco, i am a coffee snob, and they avoid the weakness of so many ny places by only serving espresso-based coffee.
