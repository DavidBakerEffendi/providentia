I was pleasantly surprised as I was a loyal subject of Ippudo (much to the chagrin of myself and my size 2 wardrobe). The crispy Brussel sprouts resulted in mild heart palpitations and the spicy kimchee ramen left me with Ipuddo-esque satisfaction (no Bakudan, but comparable spicy garlic additive if you ask nicely)! The kale salad (i ask them to hold the golden raisins) will no doubt stack up better than your actual dinner date! Its is frighteningly delicious! Â The staff is so sweet (ask for Susan) and I constantly crave this dangerous obsession!!!!!!!!!!!!
