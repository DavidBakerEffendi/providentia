I went to Beco on a regular basis and enjoyed the food/atmosphere until the bartender (curly hair works on weekends) mistook me for some another black women that had run out on her bill. After accosting me in front of the entire restaurant I paid the bill and left. What's insane is that the bill I supposedly ran out on was 17$! First let me say that I am black, and I also do not steal and we do not all look alike. I urge anyone/everyone to not frequent this place.
