I was in Philly for work and I had one opportunity to eat outside of the many pre-scheduled meals for the next couple days. So I did what I typically do when I'm going to a new city: check Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. I found this gem and brought along a few other coworkers; I felt confident in guaranteeing that we would all enjoy our meals even though I had never been. We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table (Saturday late morning), but we were snuggled into a booth and observing all of the decor that surrounded us while we waited for our meal. The food was delicious (classic diner but with some fancy twists), the service was friendly, and I even snagged myself a t-shirt I liked this place so much. Guy did me right once again.
