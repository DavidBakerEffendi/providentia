We went here for a Friday night dinner and it was spectacular. We arrived a little bit late for our reservation (essential to make!) but it was no problem with the wait staff. Actually, they had turnover issues and we ended up waiting about 25 minutes for our table but it was absolutely worth it! The snack plates are very tiny - we had the chickpea fries, dumplings (pork/shiitake), and fried calamari. All three were fabulous with the chickpea fries being my least favorite. The mixed green salad is simple but fabulously prepared. Maybe a little bit of sea salt was used in the dressing - very well put together. All 3 of us at dinner agreed that their roasted chicken was THE best chicken we had ever had. The lightly breaded outside was the right amount of crisp and the meat was cooked for the perfect amount of time with the right moisture. Can't wait to go back!
