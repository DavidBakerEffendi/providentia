I've never had a disappointing experience here.  The food is always top-notch, seasonal and local.  The cocktails are well-crafted, and the wine by the glass list is great.  The only downside is that it can get a little pricey if you want to have a  couple drinks.  But that's the price you pay most places for getting liquored up on something better than the usual "lager" There is a real focus on locally-sourced foods here.  I had a delicious brunch the other day, especially with all the late spring/early summer produce out in full force.  Everything we tried was thoughtful, fresh and just yummy.   There is a long bar when you enter.  A small full dining room is in the back & there is also a patio for nicer weather.  But we prefer to eat & drink at the bar.  It's elegantly casual and fun all at the same time.
