Yummy! Every time I tried to eat here there's always been a ginormous line... and neither my friends nor I wanted to wait more than an hour to eat dinner. But hearing raving reviews about this place and still haven't tried it, my friends and I decided to wait for a table on a Saturday night. The wait was long it was almost 2 hours long and this was for a party of 3! So we walked around Astor place instead of waiting inside. Our waiter was really cool, cute and funny! I can't really remember which ramen bowl I ordered but it was delicious! I also ordered the calpico drink, being a lightweight, that one drink made me feel all warm and fuzzy. And if you finish all your ramen, you can always ask for another scoopful for around $3 I think.. I'll probably go back here but seriously the long wait sucks :(
