I have been getting take out here since they opened. I was happy it opened so close to where we live. It's decent generic thai food like most of the places on 9th Ave (except for Pure Thai cookhouse which is amazing). But nonetheless we enjoyed ordering from here regularly though I hate the waste of takeout. Today I thought I'd try to go for lunch with my mom and toddler. The restaurant was half crowded, but the host didn't think my stroller would fit. I clearly saw an end spot near the bar where we wouldn't be in anyone's way and figured it was not that busy so why wouldn't they want the extra business of two adults eating there? Clearly they didn't need our business or they were not family friendly even during their off hours to a well behaved toddler. So thank you for all the meals but I will walk the extra blocks to yum yum Bangkok for the same food when I want generic thai food!
