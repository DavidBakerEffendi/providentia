I am addicted to the Sabich sandwich: fried eggplant with yummy salads, sauces, a sliced egg, and dressings.  I haven't tried anything else here since I can't say no to the sabich. While the taste of the food is excellent, the service is lackluster and the sandwich often comes soggy or greasy (I get it to go).  Lunch hour rush is very stressful.  The space is not large enough to accommodate the masses.  I prefer coming after 2PM to avoid the chaos. Honestly, if it weren't for the delicious food, I'd rate them a 3.
