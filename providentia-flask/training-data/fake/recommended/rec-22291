It always takes me a while to get seated and when my girlfriends and I have eaten at the bar, the bartenders are usually too busy flirting with us or the other wait staff to stay on top of their game, but the question is-- is the wait, the food, worth it? I would say the food is pretty good and the prices are fair.  Nothing phenomenal, but not bad.  The beef chimichanga and the shrimp and rice dishes we had were plentiful and tasty.  They were not creative, not "authentic fresh mexican" with cilantro, etc-- but they were good.   I would go if you like Americanized Mexican and split a dish if you are watching your cash. Don't count on service because although it could be excellent one day, it could be lacking the next--  mostly attractive, Mexican, privileged teenagers or young 20 somethings that clearly have other things on their minds than good service. Also, be careful about parking your car. It can be cramped space-wise, so you may have to wait to find a place with plenty of room.
