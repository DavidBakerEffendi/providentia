A great place for fast reasonably priced korean food!  The food comes either boxed or you can order it buffet style where you pay by weight.  There is a good amount of variety and options for the vegetarians out there.  For the most part the food is delicious!  You can't go wrong with Woorijip for lunch.  There is a good amount of area for sitting although it does get busy. P.S. I hear Taeyang stops by here too.
