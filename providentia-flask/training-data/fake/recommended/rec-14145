Based on its reviews (and its write-up in Serious Eats), I was hoping to like Kefi - it presented a great solution for my out-of-town parents who often shirk at Manhattah atmosphere (the wait and the "intimacy" of most restaurants) and the Manhattan prices. However, I just wasn't blown away (and neither were the parents). The food was okay (I sampled 3 mains and the assorted appetizer plate), and the atmosphere was a bit college-y.
