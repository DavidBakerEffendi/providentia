Their pancakes were simply thin cakes that were baked on a pan, I think this is their secret! Don't get me wrong, I found them to be extremely delicious; I have never eaten pancakes similar to Clinton St. Baking Company's. One thing is that all the tables around us had some vouchers that gave them some discount, I was unhappy with paying the full price, so check internet for their deals before coming to here.
