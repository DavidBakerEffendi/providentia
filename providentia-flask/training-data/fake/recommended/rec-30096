The food is outstanding... very fresh.  The owners are very friendly and care about the food they prepare.  We went for lunch on Friday, loved it so much we went back on Saturday and thinking about it again today for Fathers day... The kids love the Chicken Parm Grinder with Fries... What a nice surprise to find such a great place at reasonable prices so close to home.
