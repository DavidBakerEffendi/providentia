Having grown up locally - I have been to literally every diner within a 50 mile radius. This is by far the best of the best. The steak fries are superb, especially when accompanied by one of their delicious pizza burgers. They also have great dinner specials where you get soup, salad and dessert included (in which case - I highly recommend you get a Napolean.) Perfect spot for late night munchies - open 24 hours! You'll probably get that surly waitress at this hour but she is part of the fun.
