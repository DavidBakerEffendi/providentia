C'est merveilleux! I had a 9:30 reservation and got seated at 10. BYOB, no corkage fee, they opened up the bottle before we sat down. It was great food, lovely service, really intimate tiny resto, so cute, so romantic, so lovely. The food was amazing, the side veggies were fantastic, the dessert was amazing. Definitely going back. It's 5/5 stars for SURE and the owner came and put our coats on for us. Magnifique. Merci beaucoup.
