Went to the Stone Hearth for lunch today. Service started out a little slow on the ordering, but then my meal came very quickly. I had a great steak sandwich which had a liberal helping of gorgonzola and was a perfect medium rare. The onion rings were well made. The only sour note was the fries which were pretty pedestrian. Overall good experience.
