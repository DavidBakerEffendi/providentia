Very polite here. My bf was not a fan of the atmosphere of the type of people. The food was normal. Somewhat touristy menu since it is in a hotel and needs to accommodate Â the guests. Went to the rooftop area after. Needed a reservation just to sit, but we got a place to sit pretty fast. If I had to choose I would have eaten at the rooftop restaurant.
