I've ordered from here many times and have always enjoyed the food here.  It was a nice surprise to have Black Bamboo open up in our neighborhood.  West Hartford is lacking fast, cheap and delicious food.  The prices are reasonable for the area and the food is delicious.  They have healthy and  vegan (though I've never tried the Vegan) items on the menu. The owner is really friendly and will accommodate any special requests.  This is a fun place to grab some food.  While you're there, stop by the liquor store next door to pick up some beers or a bottle of wine (they have a great selection) and have it with your meal.
