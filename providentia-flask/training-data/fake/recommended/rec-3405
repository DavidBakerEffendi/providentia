Came here on a Saturday around 12:30pm. We requested a table for 10 but wouldn't be seated until the whole party was there. Around 1:30pm we were seated. We were given menus and pitchers of water. At first glance the restaurant is not very big but there's enough space once you go further into the restaurant. I ordered the challah French toast brunch special and that came with a small glass of orange juice and a caffeinated beverage. I had the cappuccino. The orange juice was pretty good. The cappuccino was also good. They left me a leaf design on the top, cute. The French toast was pretty big. There was 3 slices. It was pretty good. Not the best I've ever had but definitely up there.  It also comes with a few apple and orange slices but I didn't eat those.  Some friends ordered the steak and eggs. One ordered it medium rare and one medium. The medium was looked more like medium rare than medium but it was ok. The medium rare was more on the rare side though so just something to look out for when you order. Overall, the food was good. I don't know if it's worth such a long wait but it was nice to try. As for the atmosphere, it's very noisy. I felt like it was a little hard to have a conversation but not awful. There are 2 bathrooms in the restaurant but with a shared sink outside each bathroom. Our waitress was eh. She could have been more attentive and checked up on us. The owner/manager was super nice to us though so that's a plus!
