Hands down the best ramen i have ever had!  My favorites are Akamaru Modern with an added egg. pork buns (to die for), and the ribs.  Good idea to go with a small group and share things. Or by yourself on a cold day :)  There is always a wait because it totally worth it! The majority of the staff has been there for sometime.  I always see familiar faces and always welcoming.
