So I finally made it to Philly to have a Cheese steak. The line was super long at Pat's (as I expected), but not as long as Geno's. They had rules for ordering at the window and the were very quick to get you ordered. I don't blame them... with a line like that I would be doing the same thing. I took my first bite of my Cheese Steak and instantly became hooked. I ordered it "Wit Wiz". I kept it basic and wanted to experience a classic. To me it seems like the Cheese Steak is the same as it was when they first started serving it there, very basic. No fancy seasonings and toppings. I loved my sandwich. I thought the whole experience was great, waiting in a long line with strangers to eat a classic that calls Philly home. I will be back to Pat's next time I am in Philly. I might even try Geno's too...
