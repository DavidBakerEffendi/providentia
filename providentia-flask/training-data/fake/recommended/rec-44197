Farmhouse is all about local. Locals (and tourists like me) come here to drink ice cold locally brewed beer and eat a fancy burger made from locally sourced ingredients. Everything here is done with great care. Was it the best burger I've ever had? No, not even close. But it was very good in its own right and the overall experience was delightful. I'm a fan.
