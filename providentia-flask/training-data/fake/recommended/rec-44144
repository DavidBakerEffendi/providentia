I tried Vintage on my first business trip to Philadelphia and made a point of returning twice on my second. It's a wonderful place to relax with a glass of wine (or two or three), a book, and a nice meal. The wine list is comprehensive and interesting, the food is excellent, the staff are knowledgeable and strike the right balance between being overly solicitous and snooty, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. I especially appreciate their friendliness towards me as a solo diner. A full meal with drinks will take a bite out of your wallet, but the cost is Â not unreasonable for the quality and they have items in a broad enough price range that you can do pretty well without breaking the bank.
