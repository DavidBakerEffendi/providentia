Best Item: Israeli Breakfast is the way to go! Gets crowded on the weekend for brunch, but opens earlier than most.  The consistent staff are  efficient, friendly, and accommodating and keep your coffee cups topped off. The menu offers satisfying flavors with much more variety than Park Slope's typical eggs/toast/french toast selection.
