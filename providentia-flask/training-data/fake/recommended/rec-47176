SUNDAY AFTERNOON RUINED. Horrible douche fest; mindless staff. I created a Yelp account after 12 years in NYC (I'm only in my early 30s) to review this place, that's how offensive it was. I sat down for a nice late afternoon wine and salad on the beautiful quiet street. This is a cozy-looking, civilized-appearing place, not a frat-style club. Please note. Anyway. A few nice tables were also seated outside. I was asked whether I would order food, otherwise I couldn't sit outside. I said I would. A few minutes after I ordered, an obviously tipsy woman emerged from the bar and asked if she and her friends could finish drinks outside. Ok, so the ordering food rule isn't "across-the-board". Her friends (two loud blathering bros) stumble out soon after and they proceed to start playing music from their iPhones (Calvin Harris and Avicii, on two phones simultaneously...) and dancing on the sidewalk. The wait staff lingered listlessly by the front door. Finally 10-15 mins later, after this gang have been shouting and dropping F-bombs nonstop, bro! ... the host and servers told them they couldn't play their own music. Wow. They then argued - "...why not, had someone complained?!" The whole thing was utter nonsense. I paid my check ($40 for arugula salad and a glass of wine), left most of my wine and food, and got the F out of there, BRO!
