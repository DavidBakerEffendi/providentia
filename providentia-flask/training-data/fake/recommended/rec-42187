One of my favorite fish restaurants. Make a reservation as they can get crowded. Any fish I've ordered from them has been delicious, I highly recommend there red snapper. I took my mother here for mothers day and she says the best scallops she has ever ate. Not cheap, but well priced for fresh yummy fish.
