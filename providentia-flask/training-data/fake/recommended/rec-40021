First went here with my boss after court since he'd seen it on a food network. The 50/50 was AWESOME! I like ordering on haystacks (french fries) and their house Sriracha sauce on this is phenomenal, it really made the sandwich. I've been back twice since, the second time I took my sister and her friends visiting from out of state. My sister and her friend ordered some holiday turkey thing with cranberry and they both were in awe of how good it was. I must show up off rush hours I guess because the place has yet to be packed and the servers are always pleasant, friendly and more than happy to tell you about anything on the menu. This place will never Replace Di'Nics or Old Nicks, but they are a solid contender for my money when I'm in CC as their menu has variety and is always delicious.
