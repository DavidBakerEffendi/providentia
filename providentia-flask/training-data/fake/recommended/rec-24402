Saw this place in Time Out and figured we'd give it a whirl. The place has a great hang out, catch up with friends over pizza feel. The decor is pleasantly rustic. (As the sun went down, it def would'nt have hurt to turn on an extra bulb here and there.) We ordered the artichoke and smoked pancetta, arugula with prosciutto and the frittata. The arugala was not bad but extremely soggy in the middle. Folding my pizza was a difficult task. The parm cheese slices on top were delish. The artichoke and smoked pancetta was okay but was on the salty side. Lastly, at all costs, avoid the frittata. It was completely bland and we actually took toppings from other pizzas and added it to it for some flavor. Maybe we ordered the wrong items because I can't understand how this place got such great reviews based on the food. I would've gave 3 stars but I had to take one away for the food itself.
