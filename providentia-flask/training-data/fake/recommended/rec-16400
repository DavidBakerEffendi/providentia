I loved this place, the staff is friendly and the food is great. Started off with fresh oysters, the crab croquette and market green salad.  The oysters were amazing, very fresh and delicious.  The crab croquette was great as well there was a tartness to it that blended perfectly with the crab meat.  I was not a fan of the market green salad as there was a floral flavor to it but none the less my cousins enjoyed it. For the entree we had the all natural chicken and the grass fed rib eye.  The grass-fed was brought out to us for inspection and asked how we would like it cooked.  We decided on medium rare which came out perfect.  The steak was unbelievable, the sauce was light and the sea salt accompanied it nicely.  The all natural chicken was cooked to perfection, the flavor was balanced and the meat was moist and very tender. At this point I was stuffed from everything so we shared a  cheese cake.  It topped off the perfect dinner and I have to say it was a wonderful evening. I definitely recommend this place if you want some great eats and quality food.
