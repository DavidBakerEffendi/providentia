This place was just ok.  Good, unique menu.  The slab of bacon appetizer was intense and amazing, but the main course was just ok and the portion was on the small side.  The place has an amazing whiskey menu so if I came back, I'd probably just go to get drinks at the bar as the bar scene at this place was hopping when I was there for dinner.
