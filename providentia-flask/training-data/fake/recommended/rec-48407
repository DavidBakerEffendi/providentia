The most inviting German haus in Brooklyn with some of the most delicious food. Great atmosphere and the tallest glasses of beer around. If only the WC lived up to these standards. The facilities are offered in a small box with a "modern" square bucket sink. Without any insulation and a surprising lack of towelage, it recalls an outhouse. Feeling as though I were back in old Europe, I did catch myself whistling "My Favorite Things" to take my mind away from the present circumstances.
