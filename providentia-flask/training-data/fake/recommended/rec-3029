3.5 stars I went here last month for the Rachael Yamagata show. Since I was still recovering from a cold/the lung crud I have to confess that I didn't order beer. It looked like they had a fairly decent selection of beer on tap, as well as a decent selection of liquor. My cokes were delivered fairly fast and they didn't give me 'tude for drinking coke, which isn't always the case in a bar. The music part of the bar is pretty small. If I'd gotten there earlier I would have probably been able to get to the balcony or a spot on the floor.  It was so freakin hot on the main floor and I was getting so jostled that I stuck to the back near the bar. I will  that they had the a/c on and it was blasting freezing air into the back part where it wasn't warm.  But I made sure I wasn't under the air vents. The sound was pretty decent, even back in the bar area, which was nice since I'd been to the Starlight the weekend before and experience the muddled/crappy sound there. One minor annoyance was that they don't have the doors/stairwell isolated from the downstairs, so music and voices from the downstairs can carry. They probably should label the bathrooms a little better, since I saw people hunting for the bathrooms all night. The bouncer/ticket taker and I were keeping track of how many people went the wrong way. I think I lost count at 10. I'd recommend here going for a show. Good ticket prices, nice venue, good service.
