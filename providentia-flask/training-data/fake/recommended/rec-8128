Real good ingredients, filling and varied sandwiches, good promotions, and always friendly.  Also, nothing over $10 (unless you're doing the challenge and then you're asking for trouble).  Definitely go there before noon as it's not as crowded.  I'd say it's much better than the sandwich chains but not as consistently good as some places in South Philly.
