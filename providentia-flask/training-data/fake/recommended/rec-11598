Comfortable and beautifully designed modern restaurant with inviting bar up front and main dining room set further back. Â Not necessarily an overly romantic place, but definitely has a nice, relaxing ambiance. We enjoyed the food, tried some nice wines, and received great service. Food: loved the lobster pappardelle, liked the pear and fig salad. For entrees, we ordered the lamb and duck, and we enjoyed both. Drinks: tried a few different varietals of wines (they have many by the glass) but nothing too notable for me. * The waiter was patient with our wine selections and invited us to sample a few we were thinking about...always appreciated. Chef also sent out a few different small things to try, including a delicious 'foam' soup on a spoon (I believe squash flavor, but can't remember for sure) which was delicious. Creativity and quality are obviously important to the restaurant. If we make it back again, there are plenty of more dishes we'd like to try, and some of their drinks that we've heard about too.
