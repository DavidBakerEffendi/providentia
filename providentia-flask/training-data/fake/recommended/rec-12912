Very overhyped. If you've had good pancakes before, likely if you're from the south or similar parts of the country, you won't be impressed by this place. Overhyping of mediocre restaurants that attempt to "excel" in one thing by suburban transplant kids in downtown New York is an epidemic. In addition, the service was poor, the food was extremely overpriced, the pancakes were mediocre, and the wait was not worth it.
