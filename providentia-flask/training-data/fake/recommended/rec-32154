I love sushi!  I could quite literally eat sushi everyday for at least one meal. Min Ghung has been and continues to be my favorite sushi restaurant in the area. It has recently gone under new management and there is a new menu.  The new menu is well laid out. They will also make items from the old menu if you request. The food is extremely high quality, always fresh and tastes amazing! The interior décor remains cool and funky. The patio is a fun place to eat and hang with friends. The service is good and usually friendly. I highly recommend a visit to this hidden gem in Glen Lochen.
