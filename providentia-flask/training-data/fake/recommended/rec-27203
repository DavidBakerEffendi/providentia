Good, but not great: that sums up my assessment of Taste Good. Quintessential hole-in-the-wall joint that offers an authentic feel, but doesn't really deliver as authentic a taste. I really expected a spicier kick to the food, but some of the dishes were actually rather bland. The best part of the meal my parents, my wife, and I shared may have been the roti canai and satay appetizers. For $2.35 an order, you can't pass up the roti canai. It's very good but not meant for sharing! I will say the curry was not too oily and tasted really good; it could have used a little more kick, but really good regardless. The satay, especially the beef, is awesome; tender, juicy, and delicious! The noodles and rice are priced so low, I go nuts ordering a variety just to try them out. The beef rendang was good, but again, not great. The aromatic chicken, was surprisingly the best dish at this place. We ordered a whole flounder in a chili sauce...big mistake! The fish was fried way too long and lacked any sort of flavor. The chili sauce was way too sweet and didn't really add to the flavor. The Thai are way better at doing fish, so I wouldn't recommend seafood as much as the meat or vegetable dishes at this place. Overall, I would have given this place 3.5 stars, but since I can't, I'll round down because it's closer to a 3 than a 4-star joint. The lack of ambience, the mediocre service are to be expected in such an establishment, but the food really isn't as amazing as other Malaysian food I've had. Regardless, you can't really go wrong if you want a Malaysian fix at a negligible price.
