This place is SO good. A group of us came to Maialino after a friend recommended it to us. Best decision we've ever made. We had an early reservation, and didn't wait long to be seated (maybe 5-10 minutes max). We ordered a bottle of wine, and started nomming on the bread, looking through the menu. There are a number of seasonal items on the menu, which always makes me happy. I ordered the Trenette All' Orto, which was basically a pasta with a winter greens pesto that was to die for. My friend tried the Malfatti Al Maialino (braised suckling pig), and said it was amazing. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and all of us were licking our plates clean by the end of our meals. We then ordered dessert, first a special of a gelato with olive oil (which may sound weird, but was delicious), and then their Bomboloni (apple doughnuts) that were these perfectly light and airy fried pieces of heaven coated in sugar and cinnamon. The food was absolutely delicious, but not heavy or overly-filling, which is a phenomenon I generally experience after eating Italian food. Our waitress was suuuuuuper nice, and even gave us a short wine lesson. She knew what she liked on the menu, and when asked, shared her thoughts. Everything was spot on. The one downside was that for how nice the restaurant was, the bathrooms smelled like a bathroom smells on an airplane. That's no fun. Otherwise, great experience, and will definitely be back!
