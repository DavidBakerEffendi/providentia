It's not the best sushi in the world, but the value is fantastic. The all you can eat menu is surprisingly extensive. The selection is really varied and the rolls you can choose from are pretty intricate (we got the edison, volcano and spider among others). We had apps, rolls, individual sushi pieces and dessert, so we made sure we got our money's worth. The place seemed clean and the sushi was fresh and everything was made to order. We will absolutely go back.
