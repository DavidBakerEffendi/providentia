I had a really great experience here. Picked off a local Yelp search (thanks!) my friend and I stumbled into Barrio Chino a little before dinner time. Lucky we came when we did, when we left there was a line at the door! It's a small restaurant, but it didn't feel cramped. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. The prices were reasonable. The decor is confusing. "Wait this is a Mexican place, right? Oh I get it. Chinatown...Barrio Chino...". And the food...oh my. Probably one of the better meals I've had in my short time on this planet. It was shrimp and fish in some sort of super-awesome tomato based sauce (I don't remember the name it was really tasty!) with delicious bread to soak up every last drop. In fact, the sauce put the meal on it's back and carried it to this 5 star victory. Next time I'm in NYC I'll be coming back!
