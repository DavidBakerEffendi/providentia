Bierstube is a great bar in Philly. My wife and I tried it out on our anniversary and had a great time. The bar has a wonderful selection of different craft and import beers, including a few beers that I had been aching to try for a long time. The service was spectacular. I don't know how frequently Vinnie works the bar, but he was one of the friendliest bartenders I've ever met. He was extremely knowledgable about all of the beers they serve, and made a surprisingly good Ginger Old Fashioned. The other servers were all very kind as well. The atmosphere was relaxed and laid back. The food was great. Of particular note was the beer-cheese dip for the soft pretzels. If there's anything that might seem confusing about the place, it's that they have a great selection of Belgian beers. It seems odd for a German restaurant, but it works.
