Update and a bad night: Okay, we have been coming here for 3 years and love it. The late night is perfect and wonderfully chilled after a harrowing day of full-contact shopping but now, alas, something happened. Don't get me wrong, I really and consistently enjoy this cafe/bar/restuarant but last night, while chilling to what really feels like a Parisian evening, a large roach zoomed out of some small space and up a nearby wall. Heartbreak! What to do, what to say. Please bare in mind that this was 1 am in the NYC summer. These nasty little guys are endemic to the city. This happened DESPITE a well deserved A rating from the health inspector (yea. I do check before I eat...). At the end of the day, I will be back despite my six-legged encounter - it was THAT GOOD.
