This place was absolutely delicious and very healthy! I don't know which I would rate higher, the food itself or the service, both were excellent! Seriously these guys were the most pleasant, attentive, and professional restaurant staff I've come across in the city thus far! And the sushi was great tasting, unique, and left me feeling great even after eating two rolls and miso soup (since the meal was full of vegetables). I had the Sweet Tree and this month's special, and I will definitely be coming back!
