Mmmmm - have eaten Philly pho at Pho 75, Xue La, and other locations - this place is the tastiest by far. Fragrant delicious broth, good meats, lots of side veggies. Service is super speedy. Ambience wise - c'mon now - pho is basically Vietnamese street food - whaddya expect? The food is good, fast, and really cheap.
