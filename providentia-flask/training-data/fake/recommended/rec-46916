So disappointed. I ordered a vegan brunch which was basically just a sweet potato and black bean burrito. The menu described it as being stuffed with smoked seitan, but there was none. I would not have ordered this if i knew there would be no seitan! please, anyone can roast sweet potato and put it into a tortilla for much cheaper than $13. My boyfriend ordered a mexican brunch which was better but they lied on the menu description for that as well saying it was served with avocado slices which made him want to order it, but there was no avocado anywhere in the dish. Notice how the two promised items that they left out of the dishes (seitan and avocados) are expensive? Clearly a planned rip off. The breakfast potatoes are awesome but i just can't support a business that lies on their menu to deceive their customers.
