I love this place. Its a little restaurant in olde city. The place is SMALL, but the servers are super attentive and very nice (although one of them often seems like she is on speed and is entertainingly hyper). If you are going to have more then a few people join you for dinner, I would call ahead! The food is very good. My fave is the fettucine bolognese, super flavorful but not too heavy. Most of the entrees come with soup or salad as well. I have noticed that the specials of the day are often over priced, whereas the rest of the menu is very reasonable. It is a BYOB but they give you free sangria when you get there, and who doesnt love free alcohol?! Also, there is usually a groupon Now for here giving you a 40 dollar credit for 20 dollars. This place is always in my restaurant rotation!
