I was craving Thai food and what better place to go to find some than to Hell's Kitchen? This area is filled to the brim with Thai, and this was one place that I hadn't been to. There was a 20 minute wait for two people when we went (a Sunday around 6:30pm), so my friend and I took a pit stop at Amy's Bread while waiting. We were seated as soon as we got back toward the back of the restaurant in this little alcove that was kind of awkward and did not have too much space. If you're on a date, maybe this would be romantic, but as I was not, it was not... They have mimosas and mojitos aplenty, and they are very standard, good ones at that. So my friend and I both ordered mimosas (and I know you're thinking, who orders mimosas for dinner? Well, I do) and I ordered the Massaman Curry as I always do, which is how I base my ratings for Thai restaurants. The food came out super quickly. Like way too fast, which was reflected in the fact that it tasted like it had been cooked a while ago and then just reheated. Massaman was pretty ok, only thing was that the tofu felt a little too rubbery, which is what I might expect if I had boxed up tofu and taken it home to eat the next day. My friend also had mixed feelings about the dish she ordered (which I can't remember what it was), and both of us were left feeling sort of "eh" about the restaurant. Pros: It's a cool, hip ambience, lights are low, lots of young people (20s) eating dinner, good cocktails. Cons: food may not be the freshest, there's a wait, check took too long to get delivered. Will I come back? Probably not seeing as there are better restaurants in the area. One note though, I did end up boxing my meal and eating it for lunch the next day, and it was a pretty decent lunch!
