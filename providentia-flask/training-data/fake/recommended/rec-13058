We had both Halal carts at the corner of 53rd and 6th and I didn't notice much of a difference - I really don't think they are different companies. The white sauce is very delicious but that is probably because it is not very healthy - I think it is mostly if not almost all mayonnaise. The meat itself and the rice underneath are not very good though.
