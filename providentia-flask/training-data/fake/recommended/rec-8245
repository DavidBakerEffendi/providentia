Great food!  I don't know how many times I've been here, all I can say is I've been here a lot!  New Years, lunch, late lunch, dinner, late night, etc.  A great locally owned pub with lots of beer on tap(says my dad).  Cannot wait to go here for new years again! If you are in Burlington for lunch or later do not miss the Vermont Pub and Brewery and make sure to try their bagel sized onion rings!  Don't expect Crème Brûlée and foie gras, expect pub classics at a reasonable price
