Skeptical going at first - the restaurant is located in a basement after all with little to no windows.  This restaurant is a rare find, esp. in Jersey.  Many other Japanese patrons who shared our sentiment the night we went.  Excellent sushi, sashimi, Japanese cooking overall.  Place is small, may be suitable for 20 people.  Good for 1-on-1 dinner with a close friend, perfect for first date - very cozy.  Try the Bento Box B, I think it's the best deal out of all.
