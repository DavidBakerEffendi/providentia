Definitely a hidden gem for Bay Ridge. It's a small place, but it's very nice. It feels like you're eating at someone's kitchen. The chef comes over to talk to you. He prepares all the food, including the bread. Service was excellent, as was the food. I'll definitely be back here. Make sure to get a pot of Moroccan mint tea!
