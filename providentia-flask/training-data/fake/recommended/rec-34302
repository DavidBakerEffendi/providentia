Always liked Eccola in the past, but hadn't been for years.  went for a drink and apps on valentine's day and enjoyed it so went back for dinner last night.  We like the booths by the window, so I called ahead.  I'm not a fan of the 2-by-2 seating many restaurants use.  I get the space utilization thing, but don't like being shoulder to shoulder with other diners.  The maitre-d was very accomodating and said he would hold the next booth that opened up.  we arrived at 6:15p and were greeted by a very pleasant maitre-d who quickly sat us at the booth.  apps and dinner were great - I had the Zuppa d'pesce special and my wife had eggplant parm. The service was great and the bill was reasonable.  I'll be back soon.
