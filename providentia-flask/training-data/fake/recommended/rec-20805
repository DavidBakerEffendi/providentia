My husband and I stopped in today for the first time, and the food was wonderful! He has the steak and plantains, and I had tilapia and friend green plantains! Since my dad has just been in the same day, he offered us dinner size meals for lunch, and threw in a free piece of tres leches! We also ordered a piece of flan which was delicious and tasted homemade! The owner, Josh went out of his way to make sure our first experience was perfect, and it was! We are very excited to have such a great little restaurant in our neighborhood! We will definitely be going back!
