3 stars primarily due to the wonderful atmosphere and fantastic service we experienced at the bar with one of the most hospitable bartenders ever (though she commented that my wife and i reminded her of her parents--who were 5 years younger). duck meatballs, excellent.  my pig trotter wasn't good at all.  my fish entree was good, as was my wife's duck breast entree.  the spice duck fat popcorn wasn't bad, not wonderful but good. anyway, wouldn't run back but might walk.
