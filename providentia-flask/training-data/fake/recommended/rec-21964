First time I ever went here from a suggestion of Â a Brazilian friend...WOW, food is delicious. Met the owners too. The place isn't over the top - like other restaurants - but what matters is the FOOD. Its Brazilian (not Portuguese)and Its a buffet style but cooked fresh - the kitchen is right in front of you. I also went in there with a bottle of Pinor Noir (its a BYOB establishment). And we enjoyed the atmosphere. Very accommodating. It was a little too bright in there and its nothing fancy, but you will go back for the food definitely. I will definitely go back and tell my friends about this place. I saved the directions in my GPS - its that good.
