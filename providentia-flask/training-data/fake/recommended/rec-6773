I came here with a couple of friends after dinner at Fette Sau.  I've heard so much about this place and I finally got to check it out.  I really like the openness of the place; a true vision of a 'hall'.  They also have an outdoors area that would have kicked ass if it wasn't freezing out right now.  Even so, they have awesome heaters. I wish I drank beer because those giant liter mugs are bigger than my head.  We got the pretzel...yummy soft pretzel-y goodness. Although, the hot chocolate was a bit strange and funky.  Maybe it was too much of a nutmeg spice? Anyway, you can't go wrong with a night of ping pong and 'jumbling towers'.
