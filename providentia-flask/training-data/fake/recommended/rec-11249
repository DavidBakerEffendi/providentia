I love this place. And I will explain why... I love the vibe, it's cool, casual and hip. I like the decor, and the different types of seating outside..fire pit! I love the location, Best spot there in the piazza in the middle, outdoor and indoor seating. I love the food! It's a fun and creative take on burgers and milkshakes! And even though the menu change recently really disappointed me.... BRING BACK THE TOTS... Everything they still have is delicious. Best veggie burgers around.. Also, they have inexpensive PICKLE BACK SHOTS. Love it. Always come here for birthdays, who doesn't want a free bottle of champagne! And so finally, a word about the service. Although sometimes I've waited 20 minutes at my table without water just to be greeted by the server... Recently I've had better experiences. And honestly, I've never had a rude server. They're all really nice, and that counts for something! They seem to be understaffed most of the time.. When theres a so called 40 minute wait but clearly 10 tables are open. So understaffed..results in the slow service, i guess thats managements problem. But regardless.. I still keep coming back. Don't expect to be in and out, it's a place to hangout at for a bit, but that's not a bad thing.
