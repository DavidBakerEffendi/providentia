If there are any doubters ...The afore and oft-mentioned corn on the cob is in the top ten things I have EVER eaten. It's that good. Don't go expecting a lot of elbow room or a nice quiet dinner. It's crowded. It's noisy. It's fantastic. There was a line out the door on a Friday evening, but it turns over pretty fast so it only took us 15 minutes to be seated. On our list when we return to NYC and we may both just eat corn until we've had enough. I'm guessing I can put away 5 ears, easy. Dinner for 2 with 3-4 adult beverages. Less than $50 including tip.
