this is many of my good friends' favorite place to get brunch in NY. i love it as well. the wait does get a little insane sometimes, but, get brunch for 2! no wait :) it is cute country farmhouse style, with great alt-folk and bluegrass playing in the background. the food is always really good and the waitstaff is really nice. Â they take credit cards now too!!!! yes!!!
