Love Pepe's!! I have gone to pizza places all over the country and IMO Pepe's tops it all (sorry New York, you can't always win)! The clam pizza is life changing, and their other pizzas are very good as well. The wait staff is efficient and super quick - no chit chat here - but they are always friendly and bring their A-game. If you are anywhere near New Haven, you must stop!!
