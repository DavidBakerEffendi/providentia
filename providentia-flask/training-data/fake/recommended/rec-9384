I came here on a date and I loved it. My date and I enjoy a mixed seafood dinner with clam sauce and linguine noodles.The platters are big for two or three so if you go with that amount just make sure you all are on the same page about what to order. Our waiter suggested white wine with our order and it was so good!. He was very knowledgable about the wine as well as the food. I loved this place I cant wait to go back.
