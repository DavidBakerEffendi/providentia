Ok I normally don't review places after only going a single time, but I really liked Ulivo. I had avoided it because I had such a bad experience at the previous spot at the same location. Ulivo is light years better. I showed up with wine and no reservations. Even though it was pretty busy, we were seated within 5 minutes. Our server was very attentive and actually a lot of fun. I had the all'amatriciana and it was fantastic and the portion size was perfect for me. The desserts looked great but I just just couldn't fit any more. I am definitely looking forward to going back.
