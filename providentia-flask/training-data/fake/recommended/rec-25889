I really love this place. The food is fantastic - hearty and flavorful! Â And for decent prices. It does get crowded, so it's definitely not a place to pop by on a whim if you're in a hurry (unless you go early). Also, I'm not sure it's a place to go with a large-ish group (I was with 6). It can get a boisterous so it can be hard to hear.
