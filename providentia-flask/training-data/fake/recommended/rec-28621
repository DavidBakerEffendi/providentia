I really wanted to like this place, given the fact that there aren't too many paleo/primal friendly restaurants around.  Even though I only work a few blocks away from Hu Kitchen, I actually wasn't aware of it until I saw a behind the scenes video on the PaleoCon webpage.  The chicken parm looked amazing, and a glance at the menu made Hu Kitchen sound too good to be true. ...And it was.  I feel like there was a major disconnect between the items listed on the menu and how they actually appeared in the restaurant.  Only a few of the meals were actually served hot, and I was a bit disappointed in the selection.  My boyfriend's meatloaf was lacking in flavor, and the bacon was inedible to the point where I spit it out in my napkin.  The bread on my egg sandwich was decent, but I couldn't help but feel let down when I saw how small it was compared to the large dish it was served upon.  I felt cheated out of an experience that I had been looking forward to for weeks.   I would give it zero stars if I could, but I guess it's worthy of one star because I do appreciate the concept and the chia seed pudding was tasty enough.  Given that my standards for a restaurant are higher than "tasty enough", however, I probably won't come back unless I have no other options.  The food that I make at home is honestly way more enjoyable than this, and also a lot friendlier to my wallet.
