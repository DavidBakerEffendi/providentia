I love the Blue Point Grill.  I've lived in Princeton for 17 years and this place is definitely in my top 3 in-town restaurants, best seafood in Princeton.  This isn't a place you want to come if you're looking for an intimate meal, but rather a great place for socializing with friends and/or family. First of, this place is BYOB, so bring a nice bottle of white wine and then expect to wait at least 20 minutes to over an hour depending on the night and size of your party.  You can call in and get your name on the list the night of to minimize the wait, but of course they don't take reservations. My last visit was especially nice; dinner with a good friend.  We only waited about 20 minutes for a table inside (it was very humid outside).  Our waitress was very pleasant, opened our bottle of Riesling and brought bread to the table very promptly.  We ordered the crab and guacomole margherita as an appetizer, which came with corn chips for dipping.  Delicious. After the bread and appetizer, I was actually quite full, but still thoroughly enjoyed half of my hazelnut-encrusted tilapia with cherry glaze, garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed veggies (yes, as delicious as it sounds).   Overall, this place is fantastic!
