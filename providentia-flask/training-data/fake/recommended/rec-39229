Black Bamboo has a small, yet delicious vegan menu. The vegan boneless BBQ spareribs and the vegan drumsticks are my favorites. The prices are good and the staff is always friendly. It is best to order take-out since the seating area is small. Overall, I thoroughly enjoy ordering food from this restaurant.
