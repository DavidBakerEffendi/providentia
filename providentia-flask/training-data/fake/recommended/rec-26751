I've read people's reviews saying that this is the "best pizza in South Philly," but I'm going to go ahead and say that this is the best pizza in the city proper, hands down. Although I'm not a fan of traditional Chicago-style deep dish pizza or Sicilian pies, LaRosa makes the perfect cross breed of the two. The buttery, thick crust is (as my dining partner described it) "a buttery pan pie, like what Pizza Hut was going for, but perfected and respectable." Enough said. Who isn't a sucker for a crisp, thick and flaky crust? Add to that any combination of gourmet ingredients of your choice for one hell of a delectable pie. I mean, I couldn't stop myself from eating so much that I felt sick from being overstuffed after the experience. The pepperoni is full of flavor, sliced between too thin and too thick, it's perfect. I highly recommend the white potato, rosemary pie - even without their delectable, home made sauce, this one's a flavor party in your mouth that goes unmatched. Fair prices for an absurd amount of delicious food, that's my kind of establishment.
