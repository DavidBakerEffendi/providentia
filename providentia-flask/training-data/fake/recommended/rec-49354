Walked in looking for regular sushi near the area.  I actually thought they served fish here along with vegetarian rolls.  It is all vegetarian but I loved it anyway.  Another thing I liked was the person helping me at the counter.  He was so polite and really seemed sincere in helping me choose.  So many places I get turned off by the staff acting like they hate their job.  Not this place.  One thing that I was not crazy about was it is a really small space. I am sure they will expand soon because they are selling some awesome vegetarian food!
