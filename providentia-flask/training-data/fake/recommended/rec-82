Do not go here if you are a minority. The entire vibe is off as soon as you walk in. We were told a few minutes, then there was a wait, then to have a seat. There were plenty of tables open when the waitress told us they were booked for the night. Completely dissatisfied with the service and uncomfortable atmosphere. Get over trying to be like the sopranos and jersey shore. It's 2014 there's black, Spanish, etc people everywhere
