My husband and I happened to have stumbled upon this amazing small little shop that I had heard was good in passing and thought we would head in for a quick lunch.  Our food was f*%king awesome!!!  I had the rotisserie chicken sandwich and my husband got the pulled portal sandwich.  My son got yogurt and granola (which I couldn't help but finish).  Everything was seriously scrumptious and I hope that we are on that side of town again soon!!!
