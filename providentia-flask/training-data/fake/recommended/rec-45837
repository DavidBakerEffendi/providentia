First off, there were 4 people behind the counter and their way of operating was extremely inefficient: take an order, walk away to make order for five minutes, then get to the next person in line.  What were all those other people doing?  Also, 13$ for a sandwich and an apple juice?   I ordered the signature, Red Onion Sandwich, with garlic mayo (instead of the usual sun dried tomato) and on sourdough bread.  Out of  all my group, I was the last to order so we all headed outside to await delivery of our sandwiches.  As expected, mine was the last to come out, but sadly it was on honey oat and not sourdough.  The guy placing it in front of me (who was not the one who took my order) asked if I was "sure" I had ordered sourdough and not honey oat.  I explained that yes, I was sure, and would much prefer the sourdough.  He seemed confused and a little out of it and asked if I ordered it from him (keep in mind, this was 5 minutes beforehand) or the "short guy". Once he left to return the sandwich to the kitchen to correct the error, it took at least another 5 minutes before the guy I had ordered from in the first place comes out with a sandwich made with HONEY OAT.  I explained that I had ordered sourdough, which is why I sent it back in the first place.  Immediately this guy gets defensive and told me he was sure I told him honey oat, then grabbed the plate and stormed back inside. After another 5 or so minute wait, sourdough bread finally came out!  We were wondering if it was too good to be true, and in my opinion, the sandwich was sloppily made and literally dripping with way too much garlic mayo.  It was an OK sandwich, not worth the money, and I was peeved to not have received any sort of apology let alone any form of compensation for my ridiculous wait (I would have taken a cookie, they looked delicious!).  All in all, one of my worst experiences ever with a waiter/mixed up order, and they weren't even that busy!
