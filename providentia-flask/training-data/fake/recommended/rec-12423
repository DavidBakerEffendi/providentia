I am writing this as I'm trying here for the first time.. I had the combo for like 9.50. I had the kinoki soup and two rice balls which was hawaiian and unagi. Omg both rice balls were so delicious. They both had full of flavors. It was actually better than the spam musubi I had in Hawaii. The soup had so much flavor and the mushrooms were so yummy.. I am actually taking two rice balls to go..
