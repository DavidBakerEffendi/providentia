Went here for the 10th time the other day.  I was hosting an academic friend from the UK.  We brought some wine, and we did not have reservations.  It was a Thursday evening, and the restaurant scene was busy downtown.  The place filled up an hour after we arrived, but we were never pressured to vacate.  We lingered over our meals and eventually dessert.  The decor in this place looks to be about 25 years old, and it could use an upgrade.  However, the atmosphere was nice and quiet.  If you want to have a long conversation with a friend you have not seen in some time, this is your place.  I eat Thai all the time in Manhattan, and this place measures up well.  My friend, who I found was a vegetarian, was especially pleased with his meal.
