Great "hole-in-the-wall" place (it is tiny). Grab your slice after a show and stand outside to enjoy while watching the stage performers leaving the theaters. The pizza is top quality and delicious NY style. and OMG, their ricotta cheesecake is amazing. I'll never be able to eat a regular cheesecake again. Avoid all the other pizza places- the ones that look like you walked into a Sbarro. This is the real deal. YUM!
