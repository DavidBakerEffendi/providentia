Wow! Love this place and I can't wait to come back. The outside seems so innocuous, but as soon as you walk in you're transported to a lavishly decorated paradise. Started with the fig, cheese, prosciutto appetizer and we were both in Heaven. Very authentic, my g-pa used to grow and eat figs like mad, he would have loved this dish. Moved on to a veal dish w/ prosciutto and fingerling potatoes....Perfectly cooked, addicting sauce For dessert, we had trouble choosing the flavor of gelato, so our waiter recommended "coconut.....it tastes like vacation." A+ for him, we made up our minds right away. When we asked him about the artwork, he engaged us in a 5-10 min conversation...he clearly cared about the place and his customers, even though it was at least 11 at night. Refined traditional Italian cuisine. Loved every second of it.
