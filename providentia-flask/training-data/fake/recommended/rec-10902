Despite the heat, I've been craving ramen of late, so early last evening I headed over to Chuko to try out their fare and I'm so glad I did!  I initially headed to a spot at the bar right in the middle, but one of the staff was kind enough to point out that the position would put me right in the draft of the AC unit, so I scooted down a few stools closer to the door and was much more comfortable for it.  (Even with the warm temperatures outside I'm too often chilly inside...I dislike AC.)  So, right off I felt well taken care of, which was appreciated! I started with the Crispy Brussels.  They're insanely delicious.  Definitely a must try!  Carmely and sweet, yet spicy - and the combination of the peppers, peanuts and fish sauce is delightful.  For the main attraction I got the Miso Ramen with Pork.  The broth is flavorful, but could be deeper, other than that - I had not one complaint.  The taste of the noodles, with the scallion and corn and pork is spot on.  And...ohhhh the pork -  just the right amount of rich fat to offset the meat - yum!  The portion was typically more than I can finish - but I housed the Brussels, so perhaps next time I'll do a couple small plates, and then the following time solely a bowl of ramen and no small plates...  And trust me, there will be many more visits to Chuko so I can better master the ordering!
