I had the "package set" which allows you to order one appetizer and 3 different types of pasta. While great for saving money (as you are allow to refill), I was like meh. There aren't obviously strict quality control over this as the pasta can be refilled and everyone around us were ordering them too --- therefore, the chef just massively produced them and I'm guessing they let it sit and warm them with faint heat if no one is ordering yet. But again, like a i said, it's a great deal. The Panna Cotta was DROP.DEAD.AMAZING -- this is a must order! Perhaps when I have the chance to come back I should order their main course and see if it'd actually be way better.
