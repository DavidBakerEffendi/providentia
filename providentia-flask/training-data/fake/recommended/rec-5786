Incredible food! A the pork dishes are outrageously great!! Wine on tap is wine still in the barrel - wow! Best ever. Desserts are ALL amazon too. Can't recommend this place highly enough. Amongst 5 of us we ordered several shared appetizers and main dishes. There was plenty to go around and each of us had our favorites. Only caveat: the music inside is loud and played through a crappy sound system. We sat outdoors to avoid the sonic wall of noise. Alla Spina would do well to invest in a decent music system that can be played at a lower volume but still create the atmosphere they want.
