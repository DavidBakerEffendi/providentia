We visited Balthazar after having tried to book at Pastis, and realising that it had shut! A quick look at its website and a simple booking site later, we were on our way to Balthazar for some brunch. We were both pretty hungry, so I ordered the full English, whilst my fianc√©e ordered the gruyere omelette with an English muffin. I have to say that the food was excellent and we have both said we would go back again. Quite possibly for dinner this time as the menu looked fantastic.
