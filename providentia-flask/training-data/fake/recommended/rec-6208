Dangerously close to where I live. The food here is the bomb. I know I'm using early 90's catch phrases but for real it so tasty I have to refrain myself from going there every, other day. Fresh meats, veggies and desserts with an acai juice to wash it all down. PS - Marcello is serious eye candy! :) Also, don't miss out on the sweet caramel flan thing. It is heaven.
