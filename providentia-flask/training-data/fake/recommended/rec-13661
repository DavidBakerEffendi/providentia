I have been craving Japanese style crepes since the shop near St. Mark's closed a few months ago.  I can't remember the name of the place at St. Mark's but there was an old man that ran the shop. Anyway, I loved Eight Turn Crepe's crepe.  I had the one with strawberries and bananas and I was quite pleased.  I scarfed it down my face.  I can't wait to go again and try a different one after that.  They have savory crepes as well that I'll try next time. There's two seats in the shop so you might end up standing and eating.  It's definitely a hole in the wall kind of place.
