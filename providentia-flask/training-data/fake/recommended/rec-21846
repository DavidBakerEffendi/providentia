This is the second time I have eaten here and once again I ordered a citrus soda as my beverage of choice. The menu changes daily, and I had the braised pork belly as my appetizer and the steak as the entree. My girlfriend ordered the lobster, and I was able to persuade the kitchen to make her an appetizer portion of the risotto (on the entree menu). Both of our appetizers were phenomenal. With that said, my steak was decent, but I've had way better. The gf had grilled wreckfish, which was flavorful by itself. The sides it came with were rather bland though. I almost forgot to mention this, but their white and wheat homemade bread with pate and French butter is scrumptious. I'd go back just for the bread alone. Our meal was slightly over a $100 even without ordering wine or beer. The next time I go I'll just stick with ordering a couple of appetizers since both times we went the starter dishes outshone the main entrees. The entire staff is solid here, and I would rate them a five if the main entrees didn't let the restaurant down a little.
