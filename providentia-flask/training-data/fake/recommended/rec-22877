Fresh hand drawn noodles! Need I say more? This is asian comfort food at its best. Hot noodles on a cold day or if you need that perfect hangover cure. This is it. They even have a vegetarian/vegan broth! Good portions, fast service, right in the heart of Chinatown. *Dont forget its cash only but they have an ATM right outside.
