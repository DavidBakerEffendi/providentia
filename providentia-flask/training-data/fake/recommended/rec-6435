I've been coming here for almost a decade and although there are complaints, it's the best halal cart food in ny. It's different, the meat is well marinated and spiced, and I always go for the combo (lamb and chicken) cuz I can't choose. Service has gone a bit on the rude side... Asking for a to go lid seemed to them like the biggest trouble... but I guess money does that to businesses... Oh wells. At least the food is still awesome. ESP on a rainy chilly night.
