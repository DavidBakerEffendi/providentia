Friendly service and great coffee and just a few steps from Washington Square, near Jefferson Hospital and Jewelers Row! Â The counter is garden level (downstairs), with a seating area upstairs that overlooks Washington Square. They have the usual coffeehouse baked goods, macarons and smoothies, plus good sushi, bibimbap, salads, fruit, sandwiches, all fresh and at decent prices. The seating area has beautiful hardwood floors, there is free Wi-fi and plenty of tables. The La Colombe coffee is delicious and each purchase of a coffee comes with a free treat--a small walnut shaped cake (which are tasty and are also sold 3 for $1.) So happy to see another coffee place open on the block as I really missed the old Next Door cafe.
