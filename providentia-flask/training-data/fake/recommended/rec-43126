We had reservations for last night at 7:30. We arrived about 10 minutes before that. 3 parties that came in after us were sat ahead of us. We stood in the cramped waiting area with my father in law who has brain cancer and was using a walker for OVER AN HOUR. We finally got sat around 8:45 and we were all starving and cranky by this point. My husband and I got mussels as an appetizer. First one tasted good then the 2nd one I had to discreetly remove from my mouth. I know bad shellfish when I taste it and I've been hospitalized because of it in the past. I didn't say anything to my family and then a few minutes later my brother in law spit out a mussel and said "whoa that is a BAD mussel" so I spoke up and told him I had a bad one too and we decided not to try anymore. The server got the owner who came over and decided to argue with me insisting they're fresh. I said "I don't doubt they're fresh but it's nature and sometimes they're just bad no matter what you do and I don't want to risk my health, sometimes one bad one can alter the taste of the whole batch". He reluctantly took them off. My garlic chicken (which arrived an hour and 15 mins after the apps were done) was dried out and hard as a rock. I could barely eat it. Rice pudding dessert was runny and gross I make a better creamy one myself. They also never brought our coffees and I had to call the waiter over about 10 minutes after we finished dessert and tell him "I guess you're not bringing our coffee so I'll take the check". There was also a loud party in the room attached to ours with a DJ blasting music, kids non stop running through our dining area yelling, we couldn't even talk to each other. I am so mad we wasted $200 of hard earned money on the worst mothers day dinner I've ever experienced. I wouldn't go back here if they offered to pay me.
