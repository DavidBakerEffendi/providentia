Food: really good Serrano Ham wrapped Salad, lamb meatballs, and shrimp dishes. The drink menu for me was nothing special, some interesting Tempranillo wines which I had both. The atmosphere was very crowded but typical of a true Tapas bar, just not really my thing to be sitting 1 foot away from another random. Overall very good tapas and cool atmosphere.
