I haven't eaten a cheeseburger in 12 years.  Sometimes you have to suck it up to see if the masses have it right.  And at Corner Bistro, they do.  The Bistro Burger comes loaded and includes bacon, and the fries are tasty, too.  Ordering is not difficult here, there are only like five things on the menu and that probably includes drinks, too.  Two can eat lunch in a cozy dining room for approximately $25.  On back to back weekends, I wanted to see which was better-- Corner Bistro or JG Melon.  Melon's didn't even come close.  Plus, Corner Bistro is very close to Li-Lac for dessert.
