Well, first impressions weren't the greatest.. We arrived there around 2:45p to find they had closed early and they didn't have the best way of keeping people out.. I mean, I know the 'closed' sign was there but there were tons of people waiting in the lobby and I don't know, just as a first time guest, kind of confusing. We decided to keep trying to go so at 4:30p we lined up for the 5pm opening.. Line was around the block by 5pm! Upon going in, it was a great experience, loud individual greetings, great decor. Even though you sit with multiple people at one table, you still feel the exclusivity of your party. The waiters were great, there were tons of them waiting hand and foot, my water glass was never empty. The chairs though, seemed to feel the traffic, as they didn't feel as sturdy as it once was probably. As far as the food goes.. Since I'm vegetarian/pescetarian there wasn't really much for me on the menu since ramen is pork broth, but since we mentioned it to the waiter, he told me of a vegetarian option not on the menu. I thought this sounded really great.. And tasted great too! Overall, this place was good, and if I'm ever in the city and feel like ramen, this would be the place I'd go. On the other side, I would have to say, if you're ever in LA, it's better there for less (in terms of the food) but the decor/service here is definitely one of a kind.
