Last Friday night, I met up with one of my best friends for Thai food and wine at Room Service.  I have no complaints--the space itself is posh and pretty, with that beautiful chandelier in the center and the dimly-lit ambiance.  The place was packed between people eating sit-down dinners and the impressively diverse, bustling happy hour scene.   I ordered one of my favorite Thai dishes--the spicy stir-fry with cashews and vegetables.  It came with chicken, as I requested, and a cone-shaped serving of rice.  I was pleased with it but I thought it could have used a little more heat.  I rarely feel that way with this type of cuisine but at least I know for next time.  Adrienne enjoyed her green curry with chicken.   We both sipped glasses of riesling which complemented our meals well.   The prices were surprisingly reasonable, considering the luxurious decor and the quality of the food.  While I don't spend much time in Hell's Kitchen, I would gladly return to Room Service.
