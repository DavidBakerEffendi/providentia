This place is a nice local spot that has some solid food all day and night.  I've been here a few times, and there is one thing that separates this place from the others.  They have surprisingly decent Vegan selections...I'm nowhere near vegetarian by the way, I devour animal protein indiscriminately at virtually every meal.  Still, I felt compelled to try the Vegan sausage as part of a tofu scramble with black beans.  Delicious!  Everything was spiced righteously and came together in a way I hadn't experienced with veg cuisine.  Came here after the gym, super casual, and found a solid spot for a quick meal.  Bruschetta panini was good as well, worth a shot if you're looking for an alternative from your run-of-the-mill pancake house!
