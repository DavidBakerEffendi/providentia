Empanadas del Parque is a cute fun little place. It is tiny and busy. All the empanadas are good most are delicious. There is not always a place to sit. My favorites are the Whole Wheat Mixed Vegetables and the Nutella Banana Empanada's. Take a car, get off on the 108th St Exit on the LIE and take some home. It is worth the drive. Visit TimmyO's on the way home.
