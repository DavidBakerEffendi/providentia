I like that it's so cheap and you can have so much for so little but the boiled dumplings weren't as good as I thought they'd be. I guess I'm used to the texture of steamed dumplings. These were different. Â The sesame pancake was pretty good. If I come back I'll try a different flavor. This place is good to stop by if you're in the area after a night of drinking.
