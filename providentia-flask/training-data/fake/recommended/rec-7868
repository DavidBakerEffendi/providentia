I had a fantastic late lunch with my son after a freezing couple of hours at Chelsea Piers a few blocks away hacking balls over the Hudson River. The tapas were the absolute most authentic and best I've had in this country - no holes barred on the rich, robust seasonings and ample doses of garlic.  The top of the list was the bocadillo de buttifara - a sandwich on crusty bread of catalan pork sausage, carmalized onions, tetilla cheese, and mustard ... And the selection of sherrys by the glass over the top especially the super sweet special reserve (can't recall the name) which was like raisin syrup.. Ended with an equally syruppy double espresso. Great way to spend a very cold afternoon in the city.  Looking forward to returning in the evening sometime and revisit the friendly and professional staff.
