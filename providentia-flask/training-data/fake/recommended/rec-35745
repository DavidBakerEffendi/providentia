OMG, how have I never heard of this sandwich until I watched Man vs Food?!!  Move over Philly Cheesesteak... I found my favorite Philly sandwich.  Tender roast pork, sharp provolone, greens and hot peppers drenched in pork juices... the flavors come together like nothing else! I usually look forward to going to the Reading Terminal for crepes, but now it'll definitely be for this sandwich!
