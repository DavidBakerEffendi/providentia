OCabanon is a hidden treasure in this neighborhood! I am French, so my fiancé and I were looking for a French restaurant to have our wedding dinner party, with approx. 90 guests. OCabanon turned out to be the best decision we've made. From the beginning to the end, the owners and the staff made sure we all had an amazing time, and we did. We were able to rent out the entire place and to decorate it as we wished, everything turned out simple and very elegant. The food was DELICIOUS - trust me I know what I'm talking about here! Mushroom risotto, daube provençale, apple cider fois gras, steak tartare...  A big cheese and charcuterie board was also set up on their beautiful copper kitchen counter. They offered a very good selection of wines, which frankly is quite difficult to find in NY. And they even surprised us with a wonderful "pièce montée" (traditional French pastry creation very common at weddings - only real chefs can make nice ones!). Our guests were very satisfied with the food and the atmosphere, and so did we. In addition, the owners were absolutely amazing in the way they helped us prepare this very important day: they really paid attention to what we wanted, provided good advice when we weren't sure what to select, and always gave us a lot of options. As for the price, OCabanon was by far the most affordable place we found for a private party with 90 guests, all night long, with such a high quality menu. These guys are passionate about what they're doing, and the results are here. Whether you're looking to have a simple yet elegant and tasty dinner, just a glass of wine, or an amazing private event, OCabanon will not disappoint you. I highly recommend it! Give it a try!
