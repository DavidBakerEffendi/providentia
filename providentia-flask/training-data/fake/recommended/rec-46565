WOW - this was the best pizza I've had since I spent a semester in Italy. I went here on the first night I moved to Philly after researching on yelp for a good place nearby and was blown away. I got the parma pizza which was absolutely amazing and piled with fresh prosciutto and arugula. My boyfriend got the lombarda pizza and he finished the entire thing. Can't wait to go back!
