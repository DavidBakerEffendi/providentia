Well, the food is pretty decent. The shaved noodles were varied in texture and satisfying; the beef brisket was okay, a little tough. The portion size is quite generous. But, ugh, the floor is really gross here, and they asked us to order IMMEDIATELY after we sat down. I would say that the food is 3.5 and the service/cleanliness is like a 2. I'll probably come back here because there aren't many sit-down places in Philly that have food much better than this place at this price point, but... it's only worthy of a 3 at best. Â Talk about a let down.
