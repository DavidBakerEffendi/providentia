Maybe it was because I went around 7:30 on a Sunday evening, but I had none of the service/noise/cramped quarters complaints that other people seem to have. Sure, the tables are close together and they have to pull out the table to let me in. Whatever, I'm eating dinner in Manhattan, everyplace is like that. I found the service incredibly pleasant and fast - our entrees probably took 12 minutes to get to us? The food was delicious - I had the wild mushroom polenta and baked eggs and my dinner partner had the baked gnocchi and watermelon gazpacho (plus some desert that I don't remember because I don't eat sweets). Both of us were delighted with our food (I like heavily spiced food and I found the polenta and eggs well-spiced). I also didn't find the restaurant inordinately noisy. It wasn't completely full, but it was mostly full, and I found it very representative of the speed/noise of a standard Manhattan restaurant with better service and good food that is actually ethically- and locally-sourced. I'd reccommend Northern Spy to anyone looking for good food in the EV.
