The nearly day-glo lime green walls, harsh fluorescent lighting and utilitarian decor make this entire joint look like it got beamed in from some street corner in South Asia. The food is absolutely delicious and the owner is a gem. If you aren't familiar with the foods don't worry, he's happy and eager to explain.
