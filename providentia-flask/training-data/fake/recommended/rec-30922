Love SCRATCH.  I Buy their products almost everymorning at my local coffee shop.  My favorite: Rosemary Scones.   Why only 3 stars for a a company I love....HAIR!   There has been an increase of hair being baked into the goods.  So Gross.  Seriously all...cover your arms - cover your heads - maybe trim the beards!  But please please stop shedding all over the prep area!
