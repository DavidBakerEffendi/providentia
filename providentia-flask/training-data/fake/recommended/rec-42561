This place is definitely a hidden gem. I was looking for a brunch place that offered vegan options and I finally found it. I went there for a Sunday brunch and it was packed. However, since I called ahead to put my name on the wait list, I did not have to wait long. After 10 minutes , I was seated while I waited for my guest. I ordered the freshly squeezed orange juice and it was so delicious. I highly recommend it. Our waitress was really nice and helpful. She suggested the vegan French Toast with fresh strawberries and pecans, which the other person ordered. I ordered the vegan pancakes with fresh bananas and toasted coconut. It was AMAZING!! It came with vegan butter and the bananas were in the batter. I was so happy and full after eating this fluffy pancakes made with no eggs. I will definitely be going back there soon.
