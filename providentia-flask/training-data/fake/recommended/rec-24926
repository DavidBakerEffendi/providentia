I'm the dork who goes to coffee shops all the time but doesn't drink coffee, so I can't comment on the quality of that black, bitter brew everyone else seems to like so well. The friendly baristas at B2 hook me up with iced tea garnished with lemon and ask if I want a refill when I sit at the counter with someone else's cast-off Inquirer or the City Paper.  They substitute sun-dried tomatoes on the tomato-basil-mozzarella sandwich and endure me whining about crappy out-of-season tomatoes with a smile.  They blend up my weird smoothie requests (yes, I really want cucumber-melon-pineapple-mango, vegan, please) and laugh at my bad jokes. I love B2. It's a real community hub down here, just like its older-but-littler sister Benna's down the way.  Also, vegan softserve!  It's only $1.50 and lac-tards like myself love it.
