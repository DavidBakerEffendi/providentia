My second time coming here. They are having the restaurant week special right now, but it's pretty confusing as everything on the menu even added up as appetizer, entree, and dessert is cheaper than the $38 they are trying to charge you. Also, it appears that if you do not make reservations you get seated in the front of the restaurant, next to the cold. I had the sheep's milk dumplings. They sounded really interesting based on the description, but I felt that the end product was a bit underwhelming. The dumplings themselves were good, but the sauce was too salty for me. On the other hand, the grilled octopus was stellar. It was a nice mix of deliciousness. Too bad $10 will only get you 2 pieces of it.
