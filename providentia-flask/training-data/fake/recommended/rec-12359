Umami burger was a deliciously enjoyable experience for the most part. I had the truffle burger and it was good. My girlfriend had the original burger and it was solid. However, our french fries were heated in uneven fashion, as if they had been sitting around a bit. And my stomach did react a little but negatively after. But it was tasty enough that I could see myself coming back.
