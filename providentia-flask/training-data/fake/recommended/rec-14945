I'm inherently suspicious of restaurants that constantly run deals on every one of those daily deal sites imaginable. Either they're in such bad shape that they're desperate to get anybody in the door, or they've inflated their prices so much that the deal just re-sets the prices back to normal. Zento seems to fall into that latter category. The sushi was good, but you can't honestly call Zento a sushi bar. The food is all prepared in a kitchen somewhere in the basement of the place. The service was solid. I'm not sure what else I can say. It was a good meal, but not anything that blew my mind.
