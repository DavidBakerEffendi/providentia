Will NEVER EVER Go AGain! B rating establishment.  Why? Probably because the waitress doesn't wash her hands after using the bathroom. The food is over priced.   Was watching the waitress who didn't wash her hands to make sure she doesn't touch my food.  After leaving the bathroom with nasty hands, she joins her friends who were dining in.  She ended up sitting with them and eating their food. When I asked for a manager they told me they didn't have one for if they did, our food would be more expensive because they will have to pay a salary of a manger. That was just it.  We only went because it was late and they were open.
