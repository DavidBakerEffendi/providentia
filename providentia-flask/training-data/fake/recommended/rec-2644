Delicious and terrific.  Truly a neighborhood gem because up until recently, there wasn't much else there except the Subway and this place STILL stands out against Route 6 and Alla Spina. I was here before about a year ago with out of town friends who ordered lots of food I couldn't eat and I still dreamed of going back.  This time, I went with a friend who didn't care about meat and my dreams came true. We ordered the antipasti plate to order.  Unfortunately, our server had it made for 1 person instead of two but he seemed a little off and I won't hold that totally against the restaurant.   Before I even continue about the food, I want to comment on how amazingly accommodating the chefs were to my dietary needs.  I wanted everything without nuts and without meat and they acted like this was their pleasure!  Amazing! The Antipasti Plate to order was well presented and gave us a taste of every vegetarian antipasti.  Perfectly seasoned, pickled and prepared.   The Porcini Salad was enough for one person, but not really to share.  The pears and mushrooms went well together, and not something I would have thought would have tasted good so that was a surprise.   We also had the Zucca pizza.  Best zucchini pizza I have ever had.  Hands down.  Delicious.  The cheese was sweet and the squash was sweet and the rest of the pizza was savory so it melded perfectly together. The fried cauliflower antipasti was ordered as an afterthought because we were still hungry.  It was green and black which was weird but tasted really super fantastic.  It was served in an anchovy sauce and they alerted me to this since I had dietary needs, which was super nice of them to remember and act on it.   Gripes:  Small plates, waiter who was basically afraid of me and my friend and did not have an antipasti plate to SHARE made for two, and not nearly enough chocolate on the dessert menu.
