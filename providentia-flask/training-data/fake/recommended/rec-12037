Sabrett's are my faaavorite hot dogs and Big Daddy's does them the best! I'm not really a big hot dog girl but I can put down three of their dogs easily! The toppings are great but it's hard to stray from my favorite the gyro dog... So I just order extra! And the workers are really nice too! Great place!
