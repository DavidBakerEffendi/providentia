The restaurant and bar have a lovely atmosphere and it is always very busy. The bartender had already explained that their food is 'Italian Italian' not 'American Italian' so they have 2 ovens for pizza so my friends and I were keen to try a pizza for our starter. We chose the Margherita. It was as good as any others in NYC and as close as I have come to Italian pizza here but I live in Switzerland and go to Italy for a day trip and this certainly wasn't Italian Italian. The burrata and tomato were very good the grilled calamari was sadly void of any flavour. Pappardelle with porcini and veal ragu, was excellent, very tasty and the pasta was well cooked, the daily special cod and prawn pasta, was nothing special and my husbands fusilli with pesto was nothing special either and the fourth dish we had was another special with scallop was dry and over cooked. We decided to share a dessert that was a gelato bombe (?) I can't remember the actual name but the waiter said this was their signature dessert. It was truly terrible. It was so hard that it was difficult to cut without it shooting off the plate - deep frozen because it is not made onsite but in a factory somewhere else and brought in weekly. There was a hint of a smell of pistachio but no real taste. Our dinner friends actually have a gelato business alongside their restaurant business and were very disappointed. We did tell the waiter and the owner removed the dessert from the bill. All in all we had a pleasant evening with good service, nice wine and enjoyed the atmosphere in the restaurant, but even though I am staying less than 5 mins walk away for another 6 weeks, I won't be back as the food was very disappointing.
