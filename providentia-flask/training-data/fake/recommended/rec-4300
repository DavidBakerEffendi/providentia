I walked past Cafe V on South Street and decided to try it out. It was a very calm atmosphere and had light music playing when I went in. All the decor is in white and serene colors. I ordered the breakfast burrito which was pretty good and had their own homemade salsa. The prices are slightly higher than diner prices and the server was friendly. They also have outside seating and Cafe V seems like a good brunch place on a nice day.
