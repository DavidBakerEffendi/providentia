Loved this place in the past, what happened??  Most of the food was fine, not stellar.  My wedge, shockingly, was a small slice from a head of lettuce (no wedge here), crumbled bacon and 3 thin 1/2 slices of rock hard tomato.At $8-9 a pop I would think I could at least get a wedge of lettuce as the namesake implies.   The bluecheese dressing is the best and  would pay for this alone.  Steak was cooked as desired, mussels were tasty, shrimp was overcooked when served with pasta.  We did send one side dish back as the potato part was inedible - tooth breaking tough pieces of fried potato.  Not even sure how you make a potato like that.  They did not remove the dish from our bill.  AND because they never asked how our meal was after this side dish showed up, we couldn't tell them it was bad until they came later to see if we wanted dessert.  They guy who consistently filled our water glasses (he was super attentive, non-english speaking), didn't understand we wanted to send the side back to the kitchen.  He was the only one at our table throughout our meal. Creme Brulee was tasty.   If you want go to the Station, sit in the bar - there is no better bar  environment around.  Eat the bread (awesome) and firecracker calamari and you will be happy.   If you are looking for an top notch meal perhaps you should call ahead and ask about the service for that day...  I know they can hit the ball out of the park, but they nearly struck out for us this last time.  I really hope that the place works out the kinks we noticed this last time.  It is completely charming, and has potential to be a fantastic, unique restaurant.
