Overall, Print left my guest and me Disappointed. Not only is the host staff preoccupied with checking their phones, but the servers did not seem to care about our experience or our satisfaction with the courses. The fluke was by far the most disappointing experience of the evening.  The herb crusted fluke is in actuality an overcooked unseasoned breaded filet. We were not asked about our satisfaction with the polenta appetizer nor the main course. While the chicken was flavorful, the server would have never known. I still do not know who our server was for the evening.  The dessert menus were placed on the table by a busser and the server carelessly asked if we wanted dessert two minutes later without recommendation.  We were provided with the check prematurely as we sipped on our wine. Additionally, the note I placed in my reservation went completely unacknowledged by all staff members. Unfortunately, Print was quite a let down. The restaurant would benefit from more attentive hosts, servers and managers.  Lastly, all guests should be offered coat check.
