Decent Italian food if you don't mind a deafening atmosphere, sitting shoulder to shoulder with every other diner, and being made to wait an hour and a half even though you made reservations. It would seem they over-book the restaurant on purpose every night, because if you drive past on any weekend there are crowds of people outside waiting to get in. If this was some sublime dining experience, I can understand the inconsiderate overbooking. But the food is no better here than any any one of 20 other italian restaurants in the area. The food, contrary to what they want you to believe, is just OK. After they made me, my date and my elderly mother stand around for an hour and thirty minutes WITH a reservation, I'll never go back. UPDATE: Since the owner saw fit to call me out on my review (very professional), allow me to address her comments... 1.) You suggest that seeing a thumbnail-sized picture of my face would somehow enable other "dinners" to judge whether or not I know anything about food. Tell me... what exactly does the tiny face of someone who knows about food look like? And for that matter, where is YOUR face picture? There isn't one face picture on this entire page of reviews, but you seem to have a problem with mine. 2.) If you don't know the difference between "dinners" and "diners", how do you manage a restaurant? Now go back and edit your grammar and pretend it didn't happen. 3.) Interesting how the only positive reviews you have both seem to know the owners name and where in Italy he's from... hmm 4.) You may be new to this online review thing, but you're doing it wrong. Review changed to 1 star due to a combative hostess.
