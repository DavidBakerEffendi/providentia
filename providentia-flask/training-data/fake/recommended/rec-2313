OK, we were there for the first weekend they lit the tree in Rockefeller center, so the city was crowded, but Lombardi's was jam packed! It was freezing, there were people waiting outside, you could barely walk thru the restaurant. We decided to order take out. First you have to find it. You have to pretty much go into the kitchen and give them your order, it's very confusing and busy. Then you have to wait down there for your pizza. We ordered the original, bottom of the line cheese pizza. My god it was heaven! I do want to try their white clam pizza, but I think I would have to order both because the plain was soooo good. We were there for dinner time. I don't know if they would be any less busy earlier in the day. If you're waiting for pizza though, stop by rice to riches across the street for some rice pudding. Rum Raisin, yum!
