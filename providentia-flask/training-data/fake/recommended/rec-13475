Brunch.. The Rye Benedict which is an eggs benedict with the traditional english muffin/ham swapped out for a biscuit/pork belly was solid but unspectacular. The Meatloaf sandwich w/onion stings on the other hand was a definite winner. Packed with flavor and just enough heat. It's a heavy meal and considering the size of the sandwich, you'll probably have leftovers.
