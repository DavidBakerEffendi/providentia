Imagine an east coast bar where all the men are wearing plaid this season. A yuppie bar that I've visited three or four times over the last three years. It definitely reminds me that I'm on the east coast -- but it's a hip kinda yuppie (at least). Place has a raised mezzanine level that's a bit darker in the back and a long, spacious underlit bar table in the front. There are cabana-like booths running alongside the bar, great for sharing stories amongst two or four. There's food there too. Truffle fries and cuts of cheese and meats always. I've never had anything heavier than that, but they do offer. And let's not forget the drinks with their provocative descriptions -- although I'll advise you, even though you know to ignore the jestful warnings on the menu, the real danger is that your ego will make the danger a self-fulfilling prophecy. So take the admonition as a meta challenge -- to drink several cocktails without going overboard ;)
