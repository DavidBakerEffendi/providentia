I've been to this place many time, but after the last experience I don't think I will go back. I found a hair at the bottom of the dish when I was almost finished. The staff seemed flustered and annoyed that I pointed it out to them, but they did offer to replace the dish or order something else on the menu. Â  ambiance: similar to a fast food place. Wait staff: they rush customers to order, get annoyed when one suggests to share a dish Dishes: overall decent portions and flavorful
