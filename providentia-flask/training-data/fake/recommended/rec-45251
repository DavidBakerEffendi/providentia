I LOVE this place. I got so much work done at this quiet, friendly cafe. There's a very welcoming & warm vibe here. I ended up working for a solid 2 1/2 hours here and never got the you-should-leave-already look that I often get at cafes that I stay over an hour in. Did I mention that their espresso is super smooth and delicious? That helps, too. Ended up getting 3 (count 'em!) americanos. There are quite a few options for food, too, and they look like they're easy to grab and go wherever you're headed if you don't want to sit and chill. If you have a lot of work to do, I recommend hanging out here and sitting at the counter by the window. You might have to sneak onto one of the neighboring store's wifi, though. :)
