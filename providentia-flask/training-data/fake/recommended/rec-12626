Had the Challah French and it was really good. Light and fluffy compared to other regular French toasts I've had. My favorite out of all the other dishes my friends and I had. Pumpkin pancakes with yogurt cinnamon glaze didn't meet my expectations. Very dense, a little dry, reminded me of over baked pumpkin cakies. The yogurt didn't help it either. Tasted better when doused in syrup. Huevos rancheros wasn't great. A little bland, and didnt taste like hue is rancheros, not sure what they attempted to do with this one. However, I'd come back for the Hallam French toast and possibly try other dishes.
