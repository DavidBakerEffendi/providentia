As any other Philly first timer I had to stop and grab one of the original cheesesteaks at Pat's during my summer X-country roadtrip KananAcrossAmerica.blogs….   The Verdict: Love the authentic experience, the lady taking my order even had that 'hurry up, I'm watching a Phillies game' attitude that I found comical, however the steaks ain't all that.  I mean I devoured it because it was my only meal of the day, but their at best 'okay.' I highly recommend if its your first time in Philly, but I wouldn't go back.  WARNING: Cash Only!
