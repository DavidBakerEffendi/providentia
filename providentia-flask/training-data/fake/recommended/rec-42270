My brother, sister-in-law, friend, and I went to Blue Ribbon last Friday for my SIL's and my joint birthday dinner (we always go somewhere fancy). The service was completely disorganized and horrendous from the jump: our waiter introduced himself, then disappeared for 20 minutes (well, not really; he was 2 tables over, ignoring us); we ordered drinks from a maitre d', simple ones, and they took 20 minutes to arrive; ditto the second round. The busboys were totally on top of it with the bread and water, but...bread and water. This restaurant is not cheap. When the food it took forever to order finally arrived, it was effing amazing, as always. Everything kicked palate ass (...ew, sorry; just go with it), from bread to oyster plate to dessert. It just took forever and was super-irritating, so I approached a manager and asked if we could get some free-dessert consideration for the fact that the server team seemed to be stoned at best. Not only did he agree, but he apologized profusely; explained that the transition into one single restaurant is causing some growing pains; AND threw in the oysters for free. So, for the time being I would have to tell you to steer clear of the place, at least on weekend nights, while they get their acts together and nail down their process -- but the food is still fantastic and totally worth the price, and we all really appreciated that the management admitted to the problem and made it right pronto. Goes a long way. Good luck with the refit, BRBB. We'll totally be back.
