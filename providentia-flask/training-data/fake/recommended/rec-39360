Don't let the dark name fool you, the Dead Rabbit is a lively place and a hell of a good time. I especially like the second floor with its old-timey drinks and they have the coolest hand crafted menu that I felt I needed a handlebar mustache to order from. Took all my willpower not to try to steal one for home. The drinks are a bit pricey, but they never disappoint.
