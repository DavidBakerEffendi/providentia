The $40 chop and $10 per side is not an uncommon thing among upscale steak houses - you got your Smith & Wollensky, Morton's, and a few others. These places have set a standard, from the style of service, to the menu, to the preparation of the steak.   There was a prix-fixe menu with a steak, potato side, salad, and dessert for $49.  I paid $2 extra for the Caesar. I liked my salads cold and crisp.  This one was fresh, but a bit on the soggy side.  We got the salads, but unfortunately, the drinks that we ordered in the beginning only came out a bit later.   The stuffed mushrooms and calamari came out on time.  Mushrooms were good.  Calamari was a bit weird for me.  I like my calamari the traditional lemon & marinara way. This one was done with roasted red peppers and missing that tanginess you get that hits you around the back of your cheeks.   For the chop, I got a filet with a baked potato.  Ruth's Chris has this style of grilling their steak with oil that comes out on a 500 degree plate. The steak was cooked just like I ordered it - medium rare, but it didn't quite have the aged, rubbed steak taste I remember from Smith & Wollensky.   Finally, there was a chocolate symphony pastry for the dessert which came out with a small sauce dish filled with vanilla ice cream.  This tasted way too much like a chocolate muffin from Costco.  I really was not crazy about it.   This is an upscale steak house, but the dining experience was not more than 3 stars and barely lived up to the standard.
