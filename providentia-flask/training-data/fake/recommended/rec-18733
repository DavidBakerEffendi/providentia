Tough place to review, my brain tells me one thing, my stomach another.  Should I go with my brain (0-2 stars) or my stomach (3-4 stars)?   The assortment of four pickles was fine but not great if you measure them against one from a barrel at the late Guss's on the LES.  Same with the fried green tomatoes--fine but not great. The fried chicken sandwich on a biscuit with mushroom gravy was tasty, but how can three very ordinary everyday things--chicken breast, a biscuit, and gravy that tastes like canned cream of mushroom soup--make for an interesting and memorable dinner? They don't. And why did all of them taste so much better when doused in the maple syrup that came with my friend's pancakes? The grits were tasty, but way too cheesy, smooth, and soft. Hey, shouldn't grits be gritty? Shouldn't they taste like corn and offer some resistance when you chew?  They do in Texas; not here. Still, I don't hate this place.  There was nothing left from my dinner to take home, so someone--the kid in me, I guess--must like the food.  But it's the adult in me that pays the tab,  and he won't be rushing back here anytime soon.
