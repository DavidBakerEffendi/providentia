4 on food a 1 on delivery... Can I do that? Food is awesome, But delivery is on a day to day basis.  If delivery is not available during lunch hrs in the financial district, don't say you deliver on your website.  Or add a restriction.   Hope these kids turn it around because I like supporting new business and the food does taste great.
