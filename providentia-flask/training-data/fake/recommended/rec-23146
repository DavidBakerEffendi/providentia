I was more than a little confused by some of the other reviews - they seem to laud the food, promise to come back, and give an indifferent three stars. Ya Ya Noodles has good food and fine service, worthy of better ratings than that. As a fan of Americanized Chinese, in all of its sauced and fried glory, Ya Ya satisfies my hunger. The dishes taste fresh, the flavors are clean and crisp, and, and oddity for most, the food does not sit too heavily. They offer a choice of brown or white rice accompanying, so if you feel like assuaging your conscience, go for the brown rice ("See, brown rice! I AM eating healthy!") I cannot speak too much to the authentic dishes, but the eggplant and tofu never disappoints. Overall, Ya Ya is one of the better Chinese food places in this area, and well worth a visit.
