When my lady friend suggested morning Glory over Sabrinas i was quite skeptical, however she raves about it so i acquiesced.  After being told to wait outside by a rather standoffish staff member, i was already down on the place.  Once seated (10 minute wait) i looked around and saw some pretty impressive dishes on my neighbors plates so that got me a bit pumped.  I also was happily surprised to see russet potatos instead of home fries.  The coffee was in fact good  and i am not one of those losers who rave about so and so's coffee over some other so and so's coffee, however it was my dish that was the star. i ordered a rib-eye with eggs over easy, both cooked perfectly and tasted amazing together.  The potatos were nicely cooked and seasoned with rosemary and were great topped off with a beautiful personal mix of homemade sweet/tangy ketchup and sriracha hot sauce.  The homemade (huge) biscuit went great topped with what i assume was also home made strawberry jam.. amazing.  As a nice finish to the meal, it seemed every dish comes with a small ramekin of apple chunks tossed in a cinnamon sauce which was a sweet palette cleanser. all in all, the meal was very good and i had to admit to my lady (begrudgingly) that she made a good call.  all of this was only $10 by the way, a great deal,  so the cost was well below Sabrinas altho i would say the overall experience was slightly lower.  The hipster staff was somewhat corny...
