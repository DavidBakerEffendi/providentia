The setting was pretty nice and unique. While there is seating available on the side, there's a long lunch table in the center of the restaurant. Guests can sit next to or across one another. There's a hook under the counter for your coat and other possessions. It is a bit of a tight squeeze though. I liked the Honeycrisp Apple Kimchi and the Shanghai noodle which I hated because it was cold. The service personnel were great and patient enough to answer my questions about the food.
