When I am craving some seafood, this is my absolute favorite place to go to. You cannot beat a $20 lobster meal, which is absolutely delicious. When you order a dozen oysters for $8 you also get a complementary glass of wine or beer. If you love soups try their bass pot soup, it's $25 dollars but it is to die for. The food is great but keep in mind they do not accept reservations and they are always busy, expected wait time about 40 min. still well worth it.
