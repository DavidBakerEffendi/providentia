The atmosphere in this restaurant shouts Italian cuisine. I know this restaurant is in Little Italy, but where is the Malaysian decor? Looks more like a poorly lit lounge. The food was pretty good, The roti canai was pretty average, I didn't find the curry to be the right texture from what I'm use to. I also had the pineapple fried rice which was a great mix of sweet and spicy. For my drink I had a red bean and coconut shake that was absolutely delicious with its perfect balance of red bean and coconut juice. My reason for the 3 star rating is due to the barely existing service we experienced. On a hot summers day I expect to be immediately greeted with a glass of ice water at my table, however I had to wait well over 15 minutes before anyone brought us water. Our waitress disappeared right after getting the quantity of our appetizer order wrong, Â following proper etiquette we waited for the rest of the table to also receive their appetizers before we could start eating, causing the appetizer to get cold. I expected this restaurant to have a full wait staff on a Saturday afternoon, however I was disappointed with the entire service. If you like being ignored like a red headed step-child this is the place for you!
