Brick Lane in Upper Montclair has been my "go to" Indian restaurant but we went last night and were confronted with a 30-minute wait -- ugh.  so we decided to try Chatni and I'm so glad we did.  While the service was a bit slow (actually, it was the kitchen, not the servers), the wait was worthwhile.  The samosas were extra crunchy and good but you could serve a bit more mint sauce with it!  The mains -- chicken tika masala, aloo gobi and shrimp jalfrezi were all delicious and the naan was perfect.   We'll definitely be back.  I want to try the buffet but work in the city and it's only available at lunch.
