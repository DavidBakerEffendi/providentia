This was the perfect dining experience (and that's exactly what it was, an experience).  We had a reservation and when we got there the hostess asked us if we would like to dine at the chefs table or in the dining room.  Um, Chefs table please!   We got to watch the kitchen the entire night and I was so excited!  Everyone was so nice, including Vernick himself!!  He even took the time to explain the dishes that we ordered (ie. which ocean the fish came from, which local farm the strawberries came from, etc.).   The food was OUTSTANDING.  We got a whole bunch of small plates ranging from tuna tartare (my favorite of the night), to beef tartare, to strawberry and goat feta salad, to pappardelle with braised rabbit (yum!).  Every single dish we got screamed with flavor.   Best birthday dinner ever.
