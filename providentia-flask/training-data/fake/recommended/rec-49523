I'm not from New York so vegetarian/vegan sushi option are slim to nonexistent in my head. This place was great. They had several creative rolls, single pieces and a variety of hand rolls. Did I mention that it's pretty cheap. Definitely coming back on my next trip - hope they will have expanded by that point. --Try out the spicy mang and the nutty buddy
