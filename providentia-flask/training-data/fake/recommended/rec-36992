before i went to actually have a meal at balthazar, i was on a pastry tour of new york.  my chef-instructors said this was a place to go.  i had the mango souffle tart.  so good.  had a very new york moment sitting on a bench outside of the bakery sipping my latte and attempting to eat this tart with no plate and a plastic fork.  so A+ on that.  i would love to work there one day.   just yesterday, i went out with my friends from out of town to balthazar the restaurant for a good meal (or so i had heard at least).  it a bit of cafeteria feel with the noise level in there but i decided the food had to make up for it.  i started out with the butternut squash puree soup and it was wonderful (for a chef in the making i suck at describing why food tastes good).  then i ordered the duck confit.  a duck leg with mushrooms and these potato crisp things (also not up on the terminology).  oh my god.  the meat just fell of the bone and the mushroom/potato crisps were the perfect compliment.  for dessert i had the creme brulee (so excited that i had made half of the dessert menu before). overall, very delicious and very satisfying.  not too kind on my wallet but i brought on myself so i can't complain.  it had very classic decor.  very french.  loved it.
