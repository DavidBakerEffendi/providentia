I miss Malaysian food and come back here whenever I come back to NYC.  Great for group dinners because you can sample more dishes.   My favorites are: - Roti Canai with curry dipping sauce - Hainanese Chicken with chicken rice - Chow Kueh Teow - Kang Kung Belacan - Soy Milk with Grass Jelly Cash only. Tip:  Go with a large group to try more dishes.  Don't forget to order the signature dish, Hainanese Chicken with chicken rice.
