Very unique, flavorful Latin American food. While there was a long wait for a table, we enjoyed having our meal tapas style in the lounge area. The avocado salad was amazing, with very delicious plantain chips. The lamb empanadas was also great, with tons of different sauces for great flavor combinations. The bread rolls are brought to the table with a flavorful bean dip instead of butter. We finished with the "bistec" steak with garlic fries. Â  Everything was amazing. I would definitely come back!!
