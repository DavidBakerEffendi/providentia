I've been there several times and they always have amazing food!  As a longtime vegan, I don't often love non-vegetarian restaurants, but this place gets my vote.  The vegiburger is exceptional (no soy nor gluten and a delicious, unique taste).  GF/brown rice pasta bowl was outstanding, too.  Juice bar is very good.  Great service - the staff are really friendly even if you're getting takeout or not spending a lot of money there.  The "alien" theme to the decor is cheesy but fun. But the main reason they get 5 stars is that nearly everything is organic!  It's pathetic how many vegetarian or "healthy" restaurants don't offer any organic food.  My only complaint is that many of the shakes come with soy protein...let's hope they upgrade to Sun Warrior or Vega One.   If you're a meat-lover and not sure where to take a vegetarian or vegan friend for lunch, or a vegan who wants to take a meat-eating friend to dinner, Siggy's could be a good option.
