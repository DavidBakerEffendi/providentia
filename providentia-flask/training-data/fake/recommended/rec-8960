Delicious, Huge Portions, and Dirt Cheap Both dishes I've tried (Charr kuey teo & S.E.A. Kroeurng Tofu) were really good.  Honestly, you can't go wrong here.  Plus, the owner will help you pick out a dish. Review: Apparently 5th ave around 20th st has become the new go-to spot for food trucks, as I've recently seen Mexico Blvd, Mexicue, The Cinnamon Snail and weekly stalwart Taim Mobile. Now add Cambodian Cuisine Torsu to the list. Owner Jerry Ley escaped Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge in 1979 and eventually made his way to the city to share Cambodian cuisine with New Yorkers. After several setbacks with high rent and apparent mafia landlords, he has taken his food to the streets and serves his Cambodian cuisine from a food truck. I had never seen this truck around the area so had to try it. I have limited experience with Cambodian food, but I would describe it as a mix of Vietnamese and Thai. The first dish I had was the #7 - Charr kuey teo with cubes of fried tofu (sautéed angel hair-rice noodles, eggplant, napa, bell peppers, bean sprout, scallion, and carrots served with peanut sauce; $6.95 I believe). This particular dish was similar to Vietnamese noodle dishes, with its thin rice noodle, vegetables, peanuts and fish sauce. Overall the dish was really tasty and had a little kick. Then again, fish sauce makes most dishes taste good, but that's besides the point. It was cheap, really good and the portions are huge. Definitely give it a try. The next time I tried the #15 - S.E.A. Kroeurng Tofu (Tofu sautéed with broccoli and sweet basil in our hot and spicy galangal and lemon grass creamy sauce (non-dairy) - Served with rice; $5.75 I believe). I love fried tofu so I really enjoyed this dish. The sauce was flavorful and tasted like a creamy curry and had a little kick to it. A clean and (semi) healthy dish, but wish there were more vegetables. Note: This dish doesn't come with crushed peanuts, but I asked for them because why not?
