Excellent biscuits and gravy, cocktails, and pickled veggies! I really like going to Jacob's pickles for any occasion- brunch, casual drinks, dinner. The restaurant has a great rustic brick-y vibe and it's always pretty crowded. But the wait is worth it and the restaurant is surprisingly large in the back. The sausage biscuits and gravy and fried chicken are my favorites, and I always get some spicy pickles too. I would suggest skipping the mac and cheese though, it's a bit too greasy and bland (especially the leftovers upon reheating...and there will be leftovers from the huge portion they give). All in all, I have walked across the park from the UES for Jacob's Pickles many a time, and have never been disappointed.
