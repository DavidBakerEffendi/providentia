I freaking love this place. Even though it's slightly pricier than I prefer it's just so good. Veggie burgers: Greenpoint and the Cowgirl are so delicious. I love creamed spinach. And I love BBQ sauce. So, score. My friend found the Veggie Reuben underwhelming and thought the added guacamole odd. But I'll still try it for myself. Sweet potato fries are so crispy and salted juuuust right. Yum. And the Tater Tots are similar to hush-puppies because they are handmade but don't let that deter you! So far, I have yet to find a side I don't like. I really wanna try the Mac n' Cheese. They serve breakfast all day. And they have mimosas and bloody mary's and beer! But I have yet to have a breakfast (such a fool!) but soon I will...very soon. They have $5 milkshakes and I had a Black &White and PB shake which really hit the spot. Someone next to me said "$5? I could buy a beer for that" and his friend said "I could get Ben & Jerry's for less than $5" (actually, not really guy) my point: OBVIOUSLY. You get a $5 milkshake because you want an f'in' milkshake. I could sit there and list everything that costs $5 or less...but that's dumb. So is talking shit about the people sitting RIGHT next to you.
