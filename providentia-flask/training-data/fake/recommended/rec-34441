I think stacks is a solid addition to the Burlington area. The north end has needed an inventive and unique deli for awhile, and stacks has brought that. The sandwiches offered here are truly unique to this place. Sure you can get a Cuban or an Italian other places but you will know when you bite in to a Stacks sandwich. The first flavor to hit your mouth is the bread and it is awesome. Always soft and fresh and the sesame seeds on top compliment each sandwich really well. At this point I have tried three of their signature sandwhiches and each has been quite good. The first one I tried was the cuban. The pork was nice and tender and the pickles have a nice flavor and the cheese both added a really nice compliment to the pork. Over all I was pleased with the sandwhich but not floored. Next I tried the perchetta. This sandwhich was something different that I had never had before and I really liked it. This, like the cuban, is a pork sandwich, but was topped with broccoli rabe, and this brought the sandwhich to he next level. The broccoli rabe was obviously fresh and had a subtle spice, which was a pleasant surprise.  This was the better sandwich over the cuban in my opinion.   Next I tried the Chicago and this so far has been the best sandwhich for me.  The slow roasted beef is super tender and has a nice flavor.  What makes this sandwich for me is the flavor combination of the hot jus and the sharp provolone cheese.  Get this sandwich topped with sweet roasted peppers and you will be happy. The price may be on the higher side but the sandwhiches are good size. I usually get a full sandwhich and eat half and save the other half for later. Sometimes I can't help it and I eat the whole thing in one siting andI  am uncomfortably full after. I think this place is worth checking out if you like fresh, quality food.
