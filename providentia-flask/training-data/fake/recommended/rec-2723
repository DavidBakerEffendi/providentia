If you love pho, you will love this place. The menu is simple and straightforward. Choose your protein (beef, duck, ox tail, vegetable, what have you) then you choose whether you want the handdrawn noodles or the shaved noodles. So far I can only speak for one soup, the duck with handdrawn noodles. It's pretty good. Comes with a lot of greens.  Make sure to add some sririacha and chili oil! The only qualm I could have is that they don't give you the good meat on the duck, kind of like the more fatty and bony parts.  Tastes like the typical chinatown roast duck (the ones hanging in the windows). Big ups on price, freshness, good free tea, and fast service! Beware of possibly having to share a table with other people if it's really busy (like I had to!) It's not that bad though.
