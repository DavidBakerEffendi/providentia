I have to give Beco two stars because "Meh.  I've experienced better." just sums it up so perfectly.  There aren't a lot of cute little bars in this particular section of Greenpoint so I really want to like it.  However, I just cannot for the life of me understand how they can justify selling a glass of wine (in a rocks glass yet) for TWELVE DOLLARS.  Are you kidding me??  What is this, the UWS? We were also annoyed because we went on a hot Saturday night and sat inside where it was pretty warm.  The outside seating cleared out so we asked the waitress if we could move to an outside table.  She told us we could not because it was too late and they needed to keep the noise down.  Fair enough.  Except then a table of four who apparently knew the waitstaff sat down outside and proceeded to smoke, drink and make a lot of noise for the entire time we were there.  They were still there when we left.  Are you kidding??  This is just rude. The reason this place even got 2 stars though is because they show soccer games, which we appreciate.  But as a night bar?  No thanks.
