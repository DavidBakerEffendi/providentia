Met some friends early Friday evening at Pierre Loti for some wine and merriment.  It couldn't have been more pleasant.  The staff was welcoming and attentive.  The wine was delicious, between us we tried 3 different wines by the glass and each was outstanding.  We ordered a few appetizers as well which were delicious and prices for everything were very reasonable.  Can't wait to go back.
