Had my fifth falafel from here this weekend - it's one of the places I have to stop every time I visit the West Village.  Phenomenal falafel for only $2.50!!  Definitely some of the best I've had in the USA, and the hot sauce is deliciously spicy. If you want falafel, this is a staple not to miss. Best I've had outside L'as du falafel in Paris, and that's saying A LOT.
