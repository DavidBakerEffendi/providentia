The best thing going about this place is the hype, lots of people waiting for a seat on Friday and Saturday evenings.  Food wise, it's very oily and salty.  Both the green curry and pineapple-pork fried rice were just over-oiled and over-seasoned.  Pad see ew was admittedly quite tasty. Despite the thousands of Thai restaurants in NYC, I'm stll searching for the place that reminds me of the balance of lightness, seasoning and flavor I experienced in Thailand.  Thus far I've found too much sauce, salt and oil. Update: after my initial review based a recent experience, I admittedly felt that perhaps I should give them another chance, which I did last nite.  Result - downgraded to 1 star.  It was even worse the second time, and on second thought the pad see ew isn't passable at all.  Prices are good but what's the point if your taste buds are left sorely disappointed?
