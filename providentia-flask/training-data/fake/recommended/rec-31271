My visit here with friends was decent. From the outside the place looks small and cozy but it's actually huge and has two floors. We were seated on the second floor and the main negative I had about that was that it was FAH.REEZ.ING. Freeeezing cold! It was a lovely warm night, around 80, but inside it had to have only been 55. Ridiculous. At least the food was pretty good. I got the special - salad and unlimited pasta. The Caesar salad was fine and the pasta was good. The three served were pasta with a red sauce, mushroom ravioli, and pasta with a clam sauce. They made a special batch of the third with no clams, which was very thoughtful. Service was attentive.
