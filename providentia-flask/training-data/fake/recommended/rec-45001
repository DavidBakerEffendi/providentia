Had an early dinner there on Sunday with 5 friends - all of them foodies (and one a restaurateur herself). Absolutely nothing but praise for the menu and the food. Now the service, that's another story. Pressured about an upcoming reservation that would require them to turn the table were slightly at edge (remember, this is 5pm on a Sunday). It didn't get any more comforting when the server spilled a glass of red wine all over one of my friend's shirt. And her first reaction was not concern over my friend but to look guiltily at the host. None of this would be a problem (other reservations and spills are par for the course) if it weren't for the follow through on the experience: The host then told us that the reason they had to turn the table was that friends of the owner were coming in. (Note: This is not a valid reason and might even by reason NOT to turn the table). Secondly, in an effort to smooth over the wine spill, they suggested desserts and topped up our wine glasses. Imagine our surprise when none of these were comped when the bill came. Finally, when the friends of the owner arrived, the host informed us matter-of-factly that we had to leave. Again, a distinct lack of apology or accommodation in way of comped drinks or anything. When I go to my favorite restaurants in NY, anything out of the normal (extra long waits, rushes, spills) result in above-and-beyond apology and a reflection of that in the service and the bill. Here we had a quality meal that was hugely soured by the service and not commensurate with a $100+ per head tab.
