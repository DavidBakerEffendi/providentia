The food and service here is always great. I really enjoy eating here when we have the chance. The cheese bread is a great way to start the meal. And getting to take home some fresh baked bread from Calandra's Bakery is a nice adult "goody bag" on the way out the door. The prices are extremely reasonable, and I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice night out!
