ZOMGZOMGZOMG! If you're a fan of Subway, you haven't had anything yet until you've tried Koch's. A real Jewish (not in the negative way) deli, they whip up arguably the BEST sandwiches east of the Mississippi. What I Ordered: The past two nights for dinner I've ordered the "Restaurant School Special." It's a delicious sandwich featuring three different cuts of meat, a special pepper-jacky cheese, cole slaw, dressing, and choice of hoagie bread or rye bread. You can imagine why I've had it two nights in a row. Verdict: 5 stars hands down. The BEST sandwich I've ever had in my life. Highly recommended. If you don't like it, I'll personally give you your money back. P.S.: Order early and over the phone. Waiting at the shop requires a decent amount of patience. But for the patience, they usually pass out samples of cheese and meat. Either way, it's a win-win for you.
