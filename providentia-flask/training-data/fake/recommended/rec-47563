I really enjoyed the Salsa; it was a little spicy, but had a pinch of cilantro (if my taste buds serve me.) The service is wicked slow. I've been here twice and I plan to find a better Mexican place, which really stinks because the guacamole here is really great. I just can't get over the below incident. DO NOT GET THE "FRIED ICE CREAM" I cannot emphasize that enough. I was looking forward to something like a tempura ice cream that one would get at a Japanese place. What arrived was ice cream with cold and stale corn flakes on top (there wasn't even warm chocolate sauce to make the appearance that it had been fried.) We didn't eat it, but the waitress put it on the bill anyway $4.95, outrageous.
