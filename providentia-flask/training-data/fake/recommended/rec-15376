I had the pleasure of eating at Upstate, service was great.. Good energy from the time I entered until the time I left. I enjoyed and understood why they're known for their oysters.  I thought they were fresh.  I don't usually add just squeezed lemon and viola I was in heaven.  I tried the whiskey cake which I never had and that too was very good, not too sweet but you can definitely tell there is kick to it. If it's not broke, don't try to fix it.  a+ on service..
