Went to Brooklyn Taco Co. for the first time today for lunch at their Essex Street Market shop. Well-appointed tacos on delicious blue corn tortillas. No sloppy tacos here, these guys are pros. Everything that went into that tortilla worked in harmony to deliver the best medley of flavors to my taste buds. I found myself resisting the temptation to douse them with hot sauce as I would lesser tacos so as to not disturb this balance. The brisket melted in my mouth and the pineapple in the salsa on top set it off perfectly. The guaco taco was fresh and zesty. The ingredients were all high quality for a low-budget price. Plus, the owner was friendly and enthusiastic and took the time to explain to me why they were located in LES and that, no, there wasn't a BK location. Looking forward to catching their cart in the warmer months!
