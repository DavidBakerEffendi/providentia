I very much enjoy coming for the affordable and deceptively filling 3-course lunch.  For your $10 you get a soup, a small appetizer, and a main entree from a limited menu.  I always get the Tom Yum soup which is delightfully spicy, but also very light.  You can't go wrong with any of the appetizer choices. The main courses include Thai curries, Pad Thai, sweet ginger, and one or two other things that I can't remember.  I really like the green curry and the sweet ginger with any choice of protein. The staff is very friendly, the clientele is all over the spectrum, and it looks like they are planning to expand their space to include the place next door so there will be even more room. I have yet to be there for dinner, but lunch is solid.
