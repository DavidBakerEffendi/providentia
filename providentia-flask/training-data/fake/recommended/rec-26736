We went here at like 1:30/2 on a Sunday afternoon and it was completely dead.  Better for us!!  We walked in, were seated and had a blast with our Italian server, mexican cooks and Filipino manager (their words, not mine!).  I got the gnocchi with marinara...delicious!!!  My uncle got the linguini with pesto which was amazballs, mom got the angel hair with garlic.  THanks to mom, I had her leftovers for lunch the next day- still delicious!!  We even ended up with a free bottle of wine when the server heard I graduated med school and saw we weren't drinking yet.  I can't complain about that one!
