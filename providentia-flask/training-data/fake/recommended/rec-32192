This one is huge !. I've been to a lot of Irish Pubs around the world (including Ireland) this is the biggest I've ever seen and one of the best too. The food was fantastic, I had a Shepherds Pie which was a variation of the usual pub fare here in Philadelphia. The Stout (4 to choose from) was served up in a 20oz proper pint glass and went down smooth, I'll be back often.
