I went here with my brother for dinner on Christmas day.  Nothing was really open except this place and a few others.  There was us and only one other table there.  I ordered a soup which was totally lacking in flavor and didn't like it much.  Funny thing is that this place has stuff like General Tso's chicken which my brother likes.  They are Korean there so maybe they should stick to dishes like Kim Chee and other Korean stuff rather than trying to please people with Japanese and chinese mixed together.  Always a very strange combination for me.  They were really nice there, and when we ordered dessert, they wrote Merry Christmas on the plate.  They spelled it wrong though, and so reminded me so much of "A Christmas story".  Funny stuff.  I'll post the pic of it if I can find it.  The dessert was yummy though.  They had mochi with ice cream.  At least something was yummy there ;)
