Service is terrible if you come with a group of 10 people or more. And gratuity is included for big groups. So let's say the food is great but your experience is cut short by poor service. Out of the 463 dollars we paid the gratuity was 70 bucks. Just paid for shit service. We waited about 40 minutes to order our brunch and the waitress wasn't attentive at all the whole time. Took long to grab her attention to just order drinks when we just arrived at the place. She was missing half the time.
