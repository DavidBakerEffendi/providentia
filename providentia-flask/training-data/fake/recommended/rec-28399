Absolutely love this place. Even took my family here when they came into town. And what tops it all off is they have Chimay! I'm not the type of girl to sit down to a romantic dinner and have a bottle of wine, for me beer is where its at. The fact they carry the big bottle of Chimay (Grand Reserve) gives it an extra star in my book. Don't let the drinks overshadow the consistently amazing food at this place either. Everything I had here has been extremely fresh with great flavoring all around. I can't wait to try out their new place Panchanga Patterson tonight!
