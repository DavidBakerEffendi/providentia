This has become a popular breakfast meeting spot for my friend and I as they're in a great central Jersey location. The service is always great and the menu is small and inventive. There's enough diners in this state with 10 page menus, huge portions, and cheap prices. If you like quality food for what it is supposed to cost, this is your place. When I was there yesterday I got the coffee (nice dark roast, refills were offered multiple times), home fries which were satisfying, and the steel cut oatmeal. They were kind to make it with hot water instead of milk upon request, and then brought cinnamon, sugar, and diced fruit to go inside. Delicious! I'd love to give 5 stars, but I need to see at least one hearty vegan breakfast option first. They are vegetarian friendly without a doubt, but for those of us avoiding eggs or dairy for allergy or ethical reasons there isn't much beyond oatmeal, potatoes, fruit, and dry toast. For now though, the fresh juices do serve as a nice comfort! Try the one with cucumber.
