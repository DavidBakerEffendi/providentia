Pat's used to be my favorite cheesesteak place in highschool.  Three weeks ago I returned to get a cheesesteak after about 10 years of not being here and was pretty dissappointed.  Both Pat's and Geno's quality declined.  Geno's bread was good but that was about it.  Pat's cheesesteak however, didn't really taste that good at all and the cheesefries looked skimpy with barely any fries and/or cheese.  The meat in the cheesesteak was lacking.  Not sure what happened but the quality has declined.  Hopefully, things will improve.  Tony Lukes was better but I still need to try Jim's steaks - can't wait.
