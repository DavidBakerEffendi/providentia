Everything that I have ever ordered from Blue Point has been amazing. It is BYOB and there are two liquor stores close by which is really convenient. You always need a reservation, it is always packed and only open for dinner and in the summer it is great sitting outdoors. The service has always been impeccable. For appetizers I highly recommend the buffalo shrimp and the calamari. The oysters are amazing and they will help you out with all the diff types they have to see what you would like the best. For entrees, we love the artic charr, lobster ravioli, crab cakes and atlantic salmon. Everything is always very fresh. I highly recommend this place,you won't regret it !
