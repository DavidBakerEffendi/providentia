My husband I knew that blue point grill would be good. Every time we passed by we've seen the lines, the crowds, and that its packed all the time. We enjoyed this place tremendously. We ordered the creamed spinach, Coho Salmon, wild, which came with mashed sweet potatoes. We finished off with a chocolate lava cake. The spinach was out of this world. I am surprised also! Who knew spinach could have such glory. I don't know what they put in there, probably butter, but it was amazing, and we both couldn't get enough. The mashed sweet potatoes were fabulous, cinnamon-y, soft, and really complemented the salmon to a T. The salmon was incredible, not too fishy, really well prepared. The Waiter suggested it as the most complex in flavor. The lava cake was rich, warm and served with whipped cream, vanilla ice cream and a strawberry on top. The whole dinner was amazing. It is pricey, but well-worth it for a higher quality of ingredients/meal.
