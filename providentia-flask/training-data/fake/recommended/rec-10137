I was here atleast 5 times last September, and I would go back here again and again! I brought my parents here and my coworkers and they all loved it! The room service pad thai and thai iced tea are to die for. It's funny because I had a vacation in Thailand for 3 weeks and I never liked the food! For some reason i love this one. Their lunch special is a great deal. That friday night around 8:30pm was crowded, but I was lucky to get a table in less than 5 minutes. Def not too expensive..
