Wow - talk about an under-rated place! Where else can you get an ENTIRE rotisserie chicken, rice (or FF) and a salad for $12.99? NOWHERE! I frequently get take out from here on my way home from work, and the delicious, perfectly-seasoned  chicken is ready for me when I arrive! Sometimes the people answering the phone have spotty English, but be patient.  It is worth it!
