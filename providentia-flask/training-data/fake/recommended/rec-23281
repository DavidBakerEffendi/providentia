Very disappointing experience. After reading a lot of positive reviews on Yelp and seeing the menu online, we were looking forward to giving this place a try. Everything we ordered lacked flavor and was just plain bland. Ended up hoping the the desserts might at least be the high point of the meal, but unfortunately that wasn't the case. With the unlimited dining choices in NYC, we certainly won't be dining here again.
