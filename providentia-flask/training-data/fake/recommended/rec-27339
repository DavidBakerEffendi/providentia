Roses are red, violets are blue, cookies  are tasty, rhyming is hard... Anyway, I had the cottage cheese cookies, when they first suggested them to me I made that eewww face but after a sample I was like YUMMMM. The place is small and charming  so please don't bring your large, nasty dog inside. smdh. Other than that this place is pretty special.
