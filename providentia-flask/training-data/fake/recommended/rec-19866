Buttermilk Channel is a romantic, (although seriously noisy), warmly lit, small space that has excellent food and refinement. My friend and I shared a number of items in order to test out the menu. When we ordered half a dozen fresh oysters, we were served a chef's selection of tree very varied (savory to sweet) that were detailed by our waitress at the table. The ricotta based flatbread was more of a crisp and not anything to reorder unless you are looking for a salty drink pairing. The highlight of the meal was an exquisitely creamy and balanced chicken liver mousse with charred fresh bread. And a simple asparagus based Spring pasta dish finished off out meal. All in all an excellent meal although a bit loud.
