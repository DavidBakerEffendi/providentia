This place can hold it's own with the big boys of the pork sandwich world here in Philly. I usually lean towards the traditional pork sandwich (pork, broccoli rabe and provolone) but they drew me away with some of their non traditional choices. I chose the 50/50. The sandwich itself was pretty good but a few decisions short of being awesome. For some reason they decided to use shredded provolone on top. With the big sandwich that it is, it takes work to keep the cheese (which is a pivotal element in any pork sandwich). Just line the rolls with a few slices so a get provolone in every bite! Jake's also prides itself on their love of Sriracha. There was supposed to be a Â Sriracha spread on the 50/50 but there was no familiar taste of the neon orange sauce. Other than those, the pork was incredibly moist and flavorful. The played a big role (pun not intended) and absorbed all the juices without falling apart. They use fresh ingredients and make everything in house. Not much to complain about here and I will be returning soon.
