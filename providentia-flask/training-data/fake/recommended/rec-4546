Rubamba is great! I was introduced to Colombian style arepas the first time I dined here and the stuff just blew my mind. I couldn't figure out how this stuff could be so delicious - something about that combination of corn pancake and warm melty cheese filling, lightly browned on both sides and topped with meat...I've had their arepas from their truck as well and while those have been good, their restaurant tends to give more food and the arepas are more fresh. Portions are generous (rice and plantains come with the order) - you can get combinations of toppings as well (pulled pork and chicken are both great)
