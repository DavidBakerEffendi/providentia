For some reason my review of when this place moved got put at their old location (see the one in Bloomfield). Anyway, delicious Thai food (I've been back 3 times since my first review). The mussaman curry is the best I've had- the sauce is very thick and not so soupy like other places and the fact that you can adjust the spice is great (if you like spicy, try 5 first- you have to be really good to eat 7 or more).  I also need to comment that the waiter we've had the last two times has been excellent. If you've been there, you probably know who he is. He asked my son's name and talked to him, always brings him the check- to much laughter from my son and this time he even did some card tricks for him. Beyond this, he is a great waiter, and can explain things about the menu, spiciness etc, as any great waiter should. Thanks.  If this place were closer to my house or work I would go once a week!
