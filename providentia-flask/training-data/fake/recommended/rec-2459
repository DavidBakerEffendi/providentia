Best value for your money in NY!  Seriously for $6, you won't get anything better in NY as far as food is concerned. I was visiting NY a few weeks back and my cousin from Jersey texted me saying to stop by the Halal Cart off of 53rd and 6th.  Cart?  Huh?  Isn't the meat kind of sketchy there?  I usually pass on the food at these carts thinking that they weren't any good.  I'm glad I gave this place a shot. After watching Wicked a few blocks away we walked over to 53rd and 6th.  We see three carts, which one is it?  I'm guessing the one with the longest line.  Keep in mind, this is like at midnight and there's a line of about 30 people in line.   Is it worth the wait?  It actually went really fast.  I didn't know how to order so I checked Yelp on my iPhone 4 to see what the popular choices were.  Chicken and Lamb combo over rice, with some white sauce.  Ok now I know what to order.  I ordered it once we got to the front of the queue.  $12 for two combos.  I was surprised by that.  Usually I'm paying at least $40 for me and my date.   The food came hot and quick.  I ordered the half lamb, half chicken over rice, heavy on the white sauce.  I must admit it's REALLY REALLY GOOD.  Imagine how much better it would have been if I was intoxicated? Haha  The chicken was nice and flavorful as well as the lamb.  Usually lamb is hit or miss for me but the one at this halal cart tasted so good.  What set off the whole meal was the white sauce.  It's a MUST with this meal.   Seriously with this many reviews, you can't go wrong.  And for $6?  Order two and eat one for lunch tomorrow.
