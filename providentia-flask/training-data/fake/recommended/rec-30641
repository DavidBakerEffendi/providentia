Came for brunch with the family. Bread basket comprised of multigrain bread slices and raisin/nut slices with a delicious crust. The butter was yummy as well as the preserves. We ordered: Brioche French toast with fruit and whipped cream: it came with a vanilla creme anglaise instead of syrup which really made the dish because it wasn't super sweet. I am not a French toast fan but my husband, son and I (who all prefer savory dishes) were stealing bites of my daughter's toast. It was crispy on the outside and soft, eggy, buttery on the inside. Definitely the best French toast I've had. Beef burger: son loved it, esp because it came on a baguette. Their fries were delicious too... crispy yet potatoey. Grilled octopus with chickpeas and mesclun fennel salad: delicious but overdressed... it would have been perfect if there was less dressing. Merguez with hummus and salad: I adore merguez but this one was way way too gamey... I couldn't eat it. Their mimosas are the best I've had because they make them with a passion fruit pur√©e so it adds some tartness which balances the sweet of the orange juice... Yum!
