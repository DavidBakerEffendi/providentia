Fraunces Tavern is still Fraunces Tavern...but it has new owners. The Porterhouse Brewing Company, out of Dublin is running the show. This company has other locations in different parts of the world, and has a good reputation. The Tavern is still vintage, historical and a place with a lot of history. I had probably the best Shepherd's Pie ever in the room George Washington addressed his officers and troops. My fellow diner had excellent fish and chips. Bangers and mash looked great at the next table until the plate was empty. Service was helpful and excellent in making appropriate suggestions. So for our lunch, it got 3 stars but close to 4. Maybe Yelp will do 1/2's someday.
