Oh Cosmi's. I'm sorry I forgot how much I loved you for those three years I wasn't living in Philly. After moving back I casually got take out there while my husband and I were unpacking in our new place. Mostly just because it was convenient. Soon enough I remembered this was one of the best places to get sandwiches and other food in South Philly. I'm now a vegetarian and I was concerned about how the non-meat options would be. Meat eaters and vegetarians alike will love this place! In my meat eating days I would grub on their chicken cheesesteaks or regular cheesesteaks or cheesesteak hoagies (are you sensing a theme here?). But so far I've had their veggie lovers cheesesteak which is a bunch of grilled veggies with provolone. It was amazing! I've also had another veggie sandwich which was great, and all of their sides (fries, mozzarella sticks, etc) are always delicious. The guys who work here are always really nice too. You'll be seeing lots more of me Cosmi's now that I'm back in the neighborhood!
