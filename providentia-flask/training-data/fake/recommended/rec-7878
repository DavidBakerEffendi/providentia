The meal was inventively prepared, very fresh, and consistent with "foodie" standards.  I was in from out of town and it really connected me to the local food/farm feel of the mid Atlantic.  I felt like I was in the "place," not just another upscale business dinner.  Quaint atmosphere, good service levels too.  The main thing is the food, though, in my opinion.  The complimentary melon juice shooters were a real bonus.
