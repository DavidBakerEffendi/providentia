The greatest $25 date EVER: * Take the Staten Island Ferry at dusk (free). * Loosen up with some beer from the ferry snack bar ($3). * Catch the 44 bus from the Ferry terminal to Denino's on Port Richard (free with your unlimited MetroCard) * Enjoy the greatest pizza you've ever had (whole pies only, most around $12 for about 16-18 inches of thin crispy deliciousness), and a pitcher of beer ($7!!) * If you're not stuffed then stop across the street at Ralph's Italian Ices (the 44 bus picks you up right in front!) Seriously. Wow. This is my new favorite date.
