i took my girlfriend recently: we feasted ravenously, then decided to buy and take home the good ol' bag o' fifty pork dumplings for eight bucks. and you know what? they're good. they're REALLY GOOD. 1) boil them for around eight minutes (trichinosis is so passe) 2) drain 3) toss into a screaming hot pan with safflower oil 4) brown 5) garnish with ramekins each of sriracha, sambal and a mixture of two parts soy sauce to one part rice wine vinegar 6) go to town you'll never buy frozen dumplings anywhere else.
