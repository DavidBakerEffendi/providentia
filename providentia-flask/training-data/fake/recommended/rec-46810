Had to go to the Yellow Plum for lunch today due to "Restaurant Week in Bloomfield." Glad we got there around 12:15 because they started to fill up. We got both the regular menu and the restaurant week menu. I loved the choice of ordering from either but the restaurant week menu was 3 courses for $20. How could we say no to that? And, the restaurant week menu is lower in price than the regular menu.....love it !!! We both had the salad, mac n cheese and the hamburger. Needless to say.....hands down the "BEST" mac n cheese ever !!!!!!!!. The flavor from the short ribs is just amazing and had my mother not taught me manners, I think I would have licked the dish. Our waiter Sam was attentive and also informed us that the Chef changes the menu each season. No wonder I couldn't find the Watermelon Salad. But, that's just another reason to keep coming back..... restaurant week or not.
