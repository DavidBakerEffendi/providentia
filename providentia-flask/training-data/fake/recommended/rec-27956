It's probably the best Cuban food in New York (especially when you consider the cheap prices), but the best part of Cafecito is everything besides the food. The sangria is strong. The lighting makes everyone look great. The servers are sweet. The hours are great (they're open late). And did I mention the low prices? (They really are very low.) Troy the appetizer sampler and remember your cash, they don't take anything else.
