The naan itself is just enough to come and try this place ! I love the garlic naan and the tandoori chicken, so juicy with a little kick. It's even better with their yogurt sauce, I could just have a bowl of that with their naan. I loved seeing another kabob restaurant pop up in Lake Hiawatha, as good as the other one on the street is, it can be heavy and greasy at times but sanam kabob house is lighter, authentic and delicious! Definitely get the naan and the tandoori chicken, you won't be able to eat enough of it! Now I'm day dreaming of it, I can't wait to eat there soon.
