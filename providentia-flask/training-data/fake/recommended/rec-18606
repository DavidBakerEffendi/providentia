After a long day of being reeled about in concentric circles at the various attractions of Coney Island and fantasizing about the huge dinner I'd soon consume, I jumped on the subway around 8pm, headed toward Pok Pok with a ravenous appetite and excitement to try this place I have heard so much about. Sadly, I was not so excited halfway into the meal.  The food is...good, nothing award-winning.  No complaints there - minus the fact that we were not able to actually try what we ordered.  Our waitress brought the wrong orders to us twice, and to another table our orders (twice).  So that makes four mistakes before we received our main courses.  Okay, maybe the just messed the tables up.  I'm not one to nit-pick. But, no.  We ordered three main dishes - the first two came out, and after we finished those, we sat impatiently for the last.  When I asked out waitress where the mystery dish is, she remarked smugly that "food comes out as it's made."  No kidding?  So we waited yet longer, and when a busser came by to clear our tables we told him we're still waiting on a dish.  He looked surprised and said he'd check on it.  Many more minutes go by, and out waitress comes by again and asks if we're ready for dessert.  I told her we still haven't received the third order, and it's been well over a half hour now, so forget it. When we got the bill, they only charged us for one of the two pints we ordered - no doubt the other table they mistakenly brought it to earlier found it on their tab.  I wouldn't go back - not because the food isn't good -  but because of the the general smugness  and apparent incapability to deliver a proper order. Oh yeah - and it's overpriced.
