location seems a liitle odd; Â I live only ten minutes away and never knew it existed. with that said... ive been there twice. its a bright, modern little space, tiny tables (i like a little room). about the food: i generally find amuse-bouche to mediocre at best, yet the tiny bites from the orange squirrel left me wanting more. one thing everyone MUST try.. the tempura mushrooms, simple, salted, heavenly. Halibut: perfectly cooked, and perfectly seasoned (most restaurants kill any fish dish with a sea of sauce) The only part of the meal I could have skipped was the dessert. The menu did not sound appetizing and the triple custard dessert was waaay too heavy. I also found the prices to be on the higher end ... but in my business as in most others, it is often true that you get what you pay for. bottom line: worth every penny, DO NOT leave without trying the mushrooms.
