My cousin brought me here for thanksgiving on my visit to NYC! It was so scrumptious that I could barely move after our meal! They had a special thanksgiving preset menu that we chose from, which was an amazingly good deal for the amount and quality of food! I had the shrimp cocktail appetizer, prime rib with mashed potatoes, spinach and sweet potato and a pumpkin mousse tart for dessert that melted in my mouth! I wish I lived in NYC so I could make this a monthly restaurant spot. Pros: Lovely surroundings, friendly staff, flavorful food Cons: A bit pricey and a long wait for seating
