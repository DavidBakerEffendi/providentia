All you need to know is these are the best fries you will ever have.  Ever.  They toss in hot peppers and onions and the fries are perfect and the peppers and onions add an amazing level of heat and sweet.  I had them about a year ago and have been dreaming of them ever since and when I returned to Philly last weekend they were my top priority. The falafel is good too. But really.  The fries.
