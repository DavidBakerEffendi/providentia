Nice Italian restaurant with a cozy ambience. It's near my office in midtown, which is a great location for dinner after work. I ordered the Spaghetti Ai Frutti Di Mare, and they let me substitute the spaghetti for penne pasta. The pasta and sauce was excellent--just the right amount of spice without being too overbearing. The seafood was a bit lacking; I had more empty clam shells than I would have liked. Overall, it was a good experience.
