Came here for dinner with friends.  It was late and we ended up staying until closing.  It has that nice kind of atmosphere.  It was very quiet and cozy nestled on Union street.   We took advantage of the prix fixe dinner option.  The avocado starter with the mini tortillas.  They were very crispy yet a little soft, great consistency for the avocado and the avocado was very fresh and not mashed up--sliced and seasoned well. At first, I tried to order the Antichukos (which are basically an assortment of organs that are cooked probably medium--a delicacy--I know--I just wasn't feeling it), they were understanding and allowed me to get the avocado instead.  For my main, I ordered a wonderful fish course.  I'd go back just for that.  Be warned!  Their menu changes, so if you have your heart set on something, it may not necessarily be there.   Finally, the wine was delicious.  I'd like to go back for brunch.  The service was pretty good, the food was delicious and it has a nice vibe.
