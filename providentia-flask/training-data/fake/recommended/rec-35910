I've been coming here for about 5 years now and I love it. The decor is great, and the food has always been outstanding. The drinks were very good as well, I couldn't resist getting a second just so I could try to figure out the flavours. Our service on this visit was not quite as good as usual -- not quite as professional as what I've come to expect here, but friendly and trying hard nonetheless.
