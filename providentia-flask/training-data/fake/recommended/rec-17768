My family and I have been coming to Luigi's for years. I have been here at least 10 times and have always had a pleasant experience. Their special salads are usually great. My favorite meals there are the homemade cannelloni and fusilli with bolognese sauce. The waiters are pleasant as well. If you are in the mood for decent Italian food, Luigi's is a good choice!
