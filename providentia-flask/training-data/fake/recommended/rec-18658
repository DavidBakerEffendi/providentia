BBQ Beef Ribs & Brisket were ok, the sauces super sugary, the sides were pitiful at best!!!  This was totally opposite of my first experience.  The baked potato was old and microwaved, the collard greens boiled with no spice & no flavor!  We definitely will NOT be back!!!  Only good thing was the cornbread!  Very disappointing!!!
