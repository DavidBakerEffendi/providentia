Why Come Here? Casual and fun atmosphere, small but great menu, fresh and interesting oysters If you like great food in a relaxed atmosphere and don't mind not having a back on your chair, you'll find Marlow & Sons to be a hidden gem. Tucked away under the Williamsburg Bridge, I'd never heard much about this place until seeing a review on Immaculate Infatuation. However, it quickly became one of my favorite restaurants. You enter into what appears to be a deli (and actually is) before heading back to the oyster bar. It's small, dark and wooden, kind of like a cleaner version McSorely's with less chachkies. The staff is fun and friendly, so we didn't mind having one of their delicious cocktails at the bar while waiting for our table (and you probably will wait - the place is tiny). The menu is also small and appears to be pretty standard fare (oysters, salad, tartare, etc.) Once you try the food, however, you'll realize there's nothing ordinary about it. Here's a rundown of what we had: Oysters - When you enter, you'd never take this place as an oyster bar. But the 3 options were all very different but interesting in their own way. The malt vinegar sauce with chilis was a fantastic accompaniment. Mustard Greens- Â Fresh, leafy greens with a nice tang. Risotto - The flavors were fantastic, although I can't remember exactly what they were. The only negative was the Parmesan sauce, while tasty, was also a little too heavy for me. Brick Chicken - This really blew me away - I never thought chicken could be this good! The skin is simply incredible - firm without being tough and intricately spiced. The meat is moist and juicy.
