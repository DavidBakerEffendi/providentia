Not much going on here. The burgers are tasteless and greasy and the fries are disgustingly bland. The beers are served slightly above room temperature which could be a plus for some people, but not me. At the very least it is a cheap place and the service was pretty fast, but you get what you pay for and maybe just a little bit less at Corner Bistro.
