We went here for brunch (which is offered everyday) and it was delicious. I am happy I made a reservation for us, since there were 6 of us and a baby. The food was really great and the service was friendly. The most outstanding thing we ordered was the Organic Buttermilk Pancakes with nutmeg butter and Vermont maple syrup. They were fluffy and absurdly delicious! But everyone's food looked and tasted great. Most people in our party did order egg dishes like Huevos Rancheros and the Breakfast Burrito. The granola with local yogurt also looked great! I love that they are committed to using local, organic and sustainable ingredients. Many of the items on the dinner and brunch menus contain grass-fed meat. But there are still options for vegetarians, although not many vegan ones which I had hoped for. There is also a garden in the back. I look forward to going back on a warmer day to take advantage of it. The other really cool part about Get Fresh is that the restaurant is actually a market too. They sell a great selection of extra-virgin olive oils, vinegars, sea salts, local drinks, honeys, yogurts, marmalades, pickles, teas, books, pastry mixes, jarred veggies, local meats, cheeses and even the wonderful Organic Nectar's Raw organic vegan gelato  Also all their packaging is eco-friendly. Some is made from recycled plastic; some is compostable, biodegradable and petroleum-free and their shopping bags are 100% biodegradable. See more here: marisaskitchen.wordpress…
