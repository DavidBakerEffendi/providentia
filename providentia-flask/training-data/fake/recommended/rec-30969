OMG!  BEST FOOD EVER!  I am not exaggerating, everything was so delicious I could not believe it.  Everything tasted so fresh and well paired.  The presentation was equally beautiful.  I would eat there every day if I could afford it.  This is not Subway after all, but the prices are not unreasonable for a restaurant of this quality and certainly not for the food and service you get.
