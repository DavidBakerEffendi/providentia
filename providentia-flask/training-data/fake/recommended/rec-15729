Sometimes eating with a group of people or your best friend is a wonderful experience.  You get to share, catch up on old times, and experience great food together. But there are those times when you want to be stingy, selfish, and giddy from having something good all to yourself.  To say "To hell with the diet!" or "Dessert for Dinner!"   Visiting Cha-An is one of those times.   Let the 2-year old in you rejoice Welcome to Cha-An:  Home of the Black Sesame Crèame Brulee.  A deep dark well of smooth sugar crusted Black Sesame Crèame Brulee with a scoop of creamy black sesame ice cream.    Can you say two desserts in one? I felt the tension of the day wash away as I ascended up the wooden steps to the intimate interior of Cha-Ann.  You are greeted warmly by the staff and seated at  one small dark wood tables.   Each table has enough space for it to feel intimate. They have a concise menu offering food, teas, and desserts.  I opted for dessert and Dragonwell Green Tea.  It was a good combination and I was not disappointed. The dessert was satisfying and makes you slow down to enjoy each spoonful.  This dish satisfied my curiosity for something new and gave me a chance to see what else Cha-An had to offer.   I suggest to my Yelpster family to try Cha-An.  Take the next rainy or chilly day and go have a dessert, appetizer, or tea.   I think you will enjoy your experience and leave feeling better than when you arrive.
