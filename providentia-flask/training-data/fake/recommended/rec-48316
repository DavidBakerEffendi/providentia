There's always a line for these guys! The hours say 7 pm to 4 pm but I'm here at 1:30 and they are open for lunch!! Yesssssss!! Just one thing:  Their slices of meat are a bit too thin. But, I do appreciate their prices have stayed consistent for the past 8 years that I've known them.  $6 for a plate that can feed 2 people!  Sounds good to me!
