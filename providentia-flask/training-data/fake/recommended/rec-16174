Went with the GF and a few friends for brunch last weekend before doing the cherry blossom festival at the botanical garden (the weekend before, we went to bed bath and beyond...I'm becoming frank the tank). They couldn't seat us until her friends got there, so we ended up waiting a bit but it was totally worth it. Got the scrambled eggs with a biscuit, grits and sausage. While we were waiting, I noticed the grilled cheese with bacon at the table next to us and kind of regretted not ordering that...the bacon looked incredible. Food came and I no longer had any regrets...some of the best scrambled eggs I've ever had, the grits were outstanding, the biscuit was a little dry, but with a bit of butter it was ethereal (not sure what kind of butter it was, but wow). I was a little nervous about the sausage after seeing how good the bacon looked, but wow...just...wow. Sweet, smoky, tasted like there was a little maple syrup in it or something. Just amazing. Oh, and the coffee...holy hell...I never want another cup of dunkin donuts or starbucks again after trying that. Everybody else seemed to like theirs too, including the alcoholic beverages... Even with the shlep to Park Slope, it was well worth it.
