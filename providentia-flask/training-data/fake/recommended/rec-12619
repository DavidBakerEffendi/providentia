I'm on a serious hunt for the best brisket in nyc.... Humo might be it. Super moist and flavorful. Owners awesome delivered my food himself. Everything was timely and the prices are great. Oh and man oh man are those black beans killer. I'm a fan and totally excited about this addition to the neighborhood... Smoke joint is gonna have to step up their game.
