3.5 stars. Came with a group of 10 and ordered the pork shoulder (in advance), pickles, corn and several orders of buns - BLT and normal.   The pork shoulder was a thing of beauty when it arrived at the table.  I didn't expect it to have so much meat.  We had tons of leftovers, which they wrapped to go.  I wasn't 100% satisfied, but I probably should have used more ssamjang (red paste) on each wrap as it wasn't that spicy.
