I was really getting sick and tired of the Staten Island dining scene.... It seems like the only places to eat are Perkins, the Country Diner or some Trattoria Generica. So I turned to Yelp... and decided to head over to Vida after reading Mary S' ebullient review. The moment I set  foot inside, I noticed the warm orange glow, the vibrancy....and how it contrasted with the surrounding dull banality of Van Duzer street :( The food was good. The appetizers were the star of the show. The glazed pear, with goat cheese and walnuts over greens was simply superlative. The spinach with portabello was also very good. Unfortunately, Vida continued a personal trend, where entrees have been failing to live up to their opening counterparts. I had the tilapia...the fish itself was great, but the garnish tasted like Altoids sours... way too much lime. I think I just picked a dud entree and should've had the steak instead. As I have previously alluded to, the primary detractor of Vida is perhaps it's location. Just make sure you face away from the windows.  Priceage is reasonable bordering on expensive. Not sure if they can accommodate a large group. Good, friendly service. I will definitely return....
