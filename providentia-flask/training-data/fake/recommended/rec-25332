I loved the atmosphere of honeygrow .. the staff was very friendly, and there was a long line of people (but it was pretty quick!) ... I ordered a vegan salad while my friends ordered stir frys (coconut curry and spicy chicken, I think?). They told me that the stir fry was very good .. one commented that coconut curries normally don't have a very pronounced coconut flavor, but with her stir fry, she loved that it had a stronger presence. Â  As for my vegan salad, I liked the mixture, but I didn't enjoy the sesame chili dressing. Note to all: honeygrow spicy does NOT equal U.S.-spicy! (I personally find the latter a little pathetic while the former was surprisingly a bit too much. I had brought a little thing of sriracha to add, but it was not needed) ... Definitely coming back to try their other foods. Also, the sample of the smoothie was refreshing and sweet with a great balance of flavors (I think that day it was orange, strawberry and pineapple).
