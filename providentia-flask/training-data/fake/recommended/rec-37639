Food wasn't as good as a year ago, but same friendly staff. Impeccable vibe, evoking Old New York. Music is great, but not overwhelming. The mussels (on a Sunday night) indicated their lack of freshness by the difficulty getting them off the shell. The roast chicken had great flavor but was a mess, falling off the bone into the soup of mashed potatoes and squash. GREAT service, mediocre grub, this time. I'll be back to try again.
