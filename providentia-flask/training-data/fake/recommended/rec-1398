Elegance with exceptional service. Was in town for business and wanted to get out with the locals. Turned to Yelp and this place had reviews head over heels above anywhere else within a couple miles. Gave it a shot and was not disappointed. You enter to a small, corner bar with appropriately dimmed lighting, full length bar back mirror, and starched aprons that give nod to the experience awaiting you. Small four top tables line the outer walls and chairs await you at the bar. Service was prompt and friendly, cocktails indulgent and refined. They were nice enough to let our party of 20 mix and mingle about the tables and bar provided we kept walking space open. Nothing but rave reviews. This is my kind of place. Will certainly be back for a meal experience.
