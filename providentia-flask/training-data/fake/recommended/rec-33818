Cash only, don't bring plastic. Lots of food, bring your appetite! Very group friendly, I wouldn't recommend going solo or on a date. Service is always excellent, food is delicious, not your everyday meal. Great atmosphere, Both times I went were during the weekday, early dinner time, so its pretty quiet and relaxing, and you can share a meal and talk with your friends easily. Would love to see this place on the weekends and get the full experience with the belly dancers.
