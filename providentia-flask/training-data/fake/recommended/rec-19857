Been here a couple times for brunch as a walk in. Both times have been seated right away and its worth noting that they are kid friendly. They also have TVs and play the football games, which keeps my husband happy during sunday brunch. This place is really small and has an interesting ambiance. It sort of reminds me of a place you could find in the South. Sort of like a welcoming  tavern, cute, intimate, but just an atmosphere that is hard to pinpoint. There are some shared tables and a bar, and some private tables. The service has always been attentive and friendly. The drinks are very good, im a fan of the brunch cocktails. The food, I would say, has been for me, not great. I got the pancakes once because they looked so good on someone else's plate, and they were "whatever". Another time I got the Persian omlette, which was also just ok. Niether were bad, but definitely wouldn't say they were good either.  People I was with got the breakfast pizza/flatbread thing, and they seemed to really enjoy that. Sweet potatoe fries also good. Also, the $15 brunch deal is pretty good. You get a cocktail, a meal, and a coffee/tea. Note that the brunch is cash only... Overall, for brunch it is easy (no line, kid friendly, inexpensive...), but not a place that you cant wait to go back to.
