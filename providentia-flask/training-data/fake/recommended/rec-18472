There isn't always the best selection of brunch places in the Murray Hill/Kips Bay area but this one really isn't too terrible. I got the Nutella French toast and it was one of the best I've ever had. Also, the price tag of $18 prix fixe brunch with cocktail is a good value in the area, and quick delivery is also available. Definitely a place that I would come back to.
