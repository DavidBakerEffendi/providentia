Kati rolls is a nice change of pace for myself and my lunchmates.  You'll pay around $10 for two rolls, which may at first seem like it wont be enough, but it will be.  You wont be stuffed but your belly will be content.   The two that i prefer are the chicken and potato rolls.  The chicken has more kick, but the potato is more flavorful.  They have a bunch of other choices that may ticket your fancy. The only negative thing i would say is it gets ridiculously packed after 12 pm.  If you decide to eat there, be prepared to have a ton of people standing around waiting for their orders. Also because of the volume of people, it can be over half an hour before you get your food. Either call in an order for pickup,  or get in before 12 or after 2.
