This place is my go-to place for lunch in the area. They have tons of interesting sandwiches particularly their PBLT and the beer battered fish great, but any of the original sandwiches are a pretty safe bet. They do take a fair amount of time with the sandwiches but really nothing out of the ordinary. The price is really great too for the amount of food you get. I come here fairly regularly and I haven't been disappointing yet.
