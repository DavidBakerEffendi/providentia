It's kind of touristy, honestly. The dumplings are good--excellent, compared with the rest of the things that pass for dumplings around here--but they're not divine. These are the best dumplings I've had so far in New York. I got some fried dumplings and some steamed; they're interesting, but the thing that really makes dumplings good is thinner skins, and the skins here are thick and amazingly chewy--which is good for fried dumplings but disappointing, for boiled ones.
