Welcome to Good Burger, home of the good burger, can I take your ooorder? Sketch is a quaint establishment in the Fishtown area. They provide paper & art supplies in the form of colored pencils, markers, crayons & whatnot. Patrons are welcome to doodle (or sketch) away their heart's delight. As you wait for your scrumptious sandwich, take a gander at what has preceded you. As for the burger itself, they offer a substantial array of choices to dress your burger. You can choose from your cheese, sauce, & toppings. Notable toppings include bacon, avocado, & (my personal favorite) truffle butter. Luckily for me, they had a bison burger on special when Acelyn B & I paid visit. Top it with bacon, truffle butter, and provolone cheese. YUMMMM. The sweet potato fries were savory in their dry seasonings. Service was friendly. & so were the patrons. When Acelyn B & I walked in, two gentlemen offered their table to us. They accurately read our timid nature in avoiding any conflict as we didn't want to disrupt the cake display on the hightops by the window. Very nice people all around. Oh yeah. Cash only. Don't forget the cash, folks.
