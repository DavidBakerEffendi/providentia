Pretty good pizza, I must admit.  Did I REALLY just pay $42 for a pizza? But why can't they replace the chairs?  You mean they can't go to Costco and buy some chairs for $15 a piece to replace the disgusting, ripped ones that are at the folding tables?  Seriously?  Are you cheap or just oblivious? Four stars are for the pizza, not the ambience.  Not worth $42 (three or four toppings) but I let my companions do the ordering, so I accepted it.  (my fault!)
