I came to know about Nyonya thanks to Yelp. So my friend and I went for the adventure. To our utter astonishment, the menu was soo long, it required some studying! After all it boasted some exotic dishes like fish head soups, frog legs and chicken feet. After some deliberation, we shared roti and beef Satai for an appetizer, for the main meal we ordered mango chicken Â salad and clay pot chicken dish. Everything would have been fine until the waiters' bizzarre behavior. Pretty much 4 people stood very close to our table, staring at us as if listening to our conversation, and really looking into our plates. They impatiently snatched the empty plates away, not giving us time to enjoy. Then one of th waitresses conversed with us and asked a lot of personal questions, which seemed unprofessional. We felt like we were stripped of privacy there, couldn't keep up our own talk. When I asked to box up my food to go, I saw the same strange waitress spike my food with something like salt (or maybe MSG), what the hell is this? Food quality was good (when it was first served) and atmosphere was inviting but... Don't stare at me or spike my food, just let me eat in privacy, people!
