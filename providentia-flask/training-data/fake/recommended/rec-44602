A very cute place for brunch or dinner. Had a caramelized pear salad with brie baguette and hot cocoa. All delicious, well size portion (ie, not TGIF portions). It's gor a very cute and charming setting. If you go on weekends for brunch, you'll likely wait 1hr+ in line. Go on weekdays for dinner and you'll have a nice quiet place mostly to yourself.
