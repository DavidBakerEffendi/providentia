YUM! Was very happy here for lunch.  Two of us had curry and fried pork.  The other had a chicken dish.  Service was very quick and food was satisfying.  Server was nice too.  He was obviously busy with the lunch rush, but he didn't mess up our order or checks.  He made sure we always had water and even engaged in a little conversation with us. Prices are great too! I will definitely be going back.
