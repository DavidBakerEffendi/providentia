Worth the trek down from Manhattan if you're willing to devote an entire afternoon to the adventure. It's quite a unique experience to watch DeMarco work his magic with the dough. After waiting in line for ~20 minutes we placed our order.  We went for the square pizza with double pepperoni. The wait from placing our order to actually being served the pizza was a solid, painstaking 2.5 hours. The first bite after the pizza came out of the oven, however,  made the whole day trip and 2.5 hour wait worth it. The crust was crispy, the cheese could be stretched an arms-length, and the in-house made pepperoni is the best I've ever had. My only reason for docking a star is that (1) they didn't give us double pepperoni and (2) the 2.5 hour wait was a bit excessive. Be cautious of the insane wait if you go for the square pizza, but I think it's 100% worth it.
