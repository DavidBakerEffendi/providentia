I can't think of a recent weekend morning when I haven't woken up craving Yuca's Heuvos Rancheros. Best brunch meal in the East Village. I know it's probably not doing much for my hips to eat this once a week but I really can not stay away. Tips: they won't seat you until your whole party is present, can be busy at brunch time but great outdoor seating.
