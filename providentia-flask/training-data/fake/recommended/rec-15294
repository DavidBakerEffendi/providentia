Located in the touristy Times Square, but the food is not plain or touristy. The place is always packed with locals and the theatre crowd. Portions are huge and not too rough on the wallet. Just dining here is an experience you will enjoy. Everything I tried here was well above average and the atmosphere just added to the experience. It may sound strange, but try to the spaghetti and meatballs.
