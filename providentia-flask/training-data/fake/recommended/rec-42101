Cool vibe.  Amazing cuban sandwiches.  Tasty sangria.  Nice waiters/waitresses.  What more could you want from a restaurant??  Puerto Viejo is well worth the visit. The yucca fries with the garlic sauce are ridiculous.  The steak is juicy.  Can't say enough about the place.  I'd knock it down a star for not having hard booze but my liver appreciates the break.
