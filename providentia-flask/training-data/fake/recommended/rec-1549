Whenever we're hungry and its late, we hope in the car and head to Philly. Genos is open late and its delicious. Slabs of meat, whiz wit', a birch beer, and cheese fries. Can't get much better than that. Plus its a great go to place with the guys. I highly suggest it especially for first timers. Its a cool atmosphere to have your first Philly Cheesesteak. It has always kept me coming back for more. Sometimes theres a line, but it doesn't matter, the foods good enough in my mind.
