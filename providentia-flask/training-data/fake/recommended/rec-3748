Mmmmm ... Sabich! $8! Tasty! Fresh! Pleasant store to stand and eat your goodies! Friendly staff! They gave me a pint glass (really, glass!) of water! Why 4 stars? Good value, friendly staff, clean and comfortable store. It was a treat. I'd go out of my way to eat here, especially when I'm craving falafel or sabich. TIP: The white pita is fresh, fluffy, and bready BONUS: Close to the New Museum and Soho shopping drag TIP: Good for children
