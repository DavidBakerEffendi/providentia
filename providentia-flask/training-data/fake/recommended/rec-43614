This place is fantastic! Came here on a Saturday night with a bachelorette party of 10. We were seated almost immediately, which was wonderful. We ordered 3 pitchers of sangria to start, each flavor comes with a different type of liquor. They served us ten courses of great tapas, of the chefs choosing, we didn't even have to look at a menu. I am a vegan so on courses where there were animal products they made a modified version for me- it was truly wonderful. Even thought it was a busy Saturday night they didn't rush us along or get upset when we got a little loud in our celebrating. Â I would definitely recommend this to anyone. We ended spending $65 a person (between 9 girls since the bride to be didn't pay) for 10 courses, and 5 pitchers of sangria, I think that is a pretty good deal!
