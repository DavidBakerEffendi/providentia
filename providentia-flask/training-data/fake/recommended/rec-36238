Our server (tall, slim, brunette--I presume her name was Jana by the name on our receipt) was awesome, the food was fantastic, the atmosphere cozy and cool. We had the ceviche de hamachi, spinach cheese corn empanadas, bone in steak and cheese platter to finish. For drinks, we shared a pitcher of Sangria followed by a couple great glasses of red recommended by our server. I hope to try other items on my next visit but that overall combination might be tough to beat. (sorry I'm just posting this now! It was so long ago when I started to rate this and just neglected to complete!)
