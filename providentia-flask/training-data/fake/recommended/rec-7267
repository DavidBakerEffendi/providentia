Amazing atmosphere - I feel like it's one of those places where you go to see and be seen. The food, however, is underwhelming and overpriced for sure. Service seemed a bit disingenuous and pretentious. I really wanted to like it since it's a neighborhood spot, but it's one of those been there, done that kinda places. Meh.
