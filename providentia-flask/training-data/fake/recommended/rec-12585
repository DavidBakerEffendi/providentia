Went on a Saturday morning around 11:30am EST while visiting the city on a Business trip.  Definitely should have gone much earlier as there was already a 2.5hrs wait for those who are dining in about a 1 hr wait for a table of 1!! So I decided to take-out my stack of Blueberry pancakes (which I've waited for about 30mins) and walk a couple short blocks to Hamilton Fish Park for immediate seating. At first I was concerned about how they were going to package the stack of pancakes, blueberry compote and maple butter syrup.  However, once I got to the park I was pleasantly surprised that the pancakes were still in tacked in a nice tuperware container. The pancakes were really tasty (on sweeter side, fluffy on inside and slightly crispy on the outside) but not sure that it's worth the long wait...although from my observation, I feel that the hostess & staff are really unorganized and are attributing to the long wait time!  For example, tables are empty yet there are a ton of guests waiting...and once the guests are seated, the table service takes a while to greet & service the guests.  Once this is improved, I can see improvement on the wait time & translates to happy returning customers. In terms of the price, the pancakes are on the pricey end -- $14 for 3 stacks of 5.5 inch pancakes and they accept CASH only.
