Just had the Cheddar Burger with Truffle Fries. Amazing! Don't be afraid to get messy with it. The bacon aioli is really delicious and unique. I'd get this again in a heartbeat. We sat at the bar because the host told us we can get 10% off. At some of the places I've been to, that means you don't get the same quality of service as the tables so they give you a discount on the food. Not here. Our bartender Natalie provided spectacular service! She was very attentive and recommended great beers to go with our great food. I'm trying to dine more consciously - supporting the restaurants that source locally and humanely. So far, it's been pretty difficult to find but I'm so glad I stumbled on this place. Can't wait to come here again!
