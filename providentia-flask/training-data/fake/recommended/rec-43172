If I could give it less stars I would.... Just left this restaurant and I will never return. The first hostess was very nice and friendly and told us the wait would be approximately 15 minutes. A second hostess walked up and without any kind of greeting, looked at our group and said "what are you waiting for?" Well to eat I thought... She literally had the worst attitude and immediately put a "bad taste in my mouth." We got seated approximately 20 minutes later and sat at a table for nearly 25 minutes without ever seeing or speaking to a waiter. We finally saw the first hostess walk by and we asked her if we had a waiter. She apologized and said she would take our order. Still no waiter in sight...we finally had enough, cancelled our order and left. Very disappointed because the restaurant had great reviews, a nice atmosphere and good menu. Don't waste your time though.
