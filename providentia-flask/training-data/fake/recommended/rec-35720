This place was one of my favorite things about my last visit to Philly.  It is right on Rittenhouse square.  It has plenty of seating so we never had to wait.  The espresso drinks and quiche was some of the best I have had in my life.  The french bread tastes like real french bread from France.  The attention to detail is amazing.  My friend got this decadent wonderful hazelnut espresso drink.  We asked how they made it.  What they were putting in it was a confectioners nougat that was so delicious it was indecent.  The wait staff was young and a little naive, but always helpful.  The check took a while to show up, but we were on vacation so we took our time.  I agree it is noisier on the weekends and therefore less enjoyable.  Seemed like a lot of families with kids were in the place which always ratchets up the volume.  We were getting the little two seater tables facing the park in the open air area.  I was able to block out the noise by turning my back to them.
