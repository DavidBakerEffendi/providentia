My wife and I have been taking out from Thai Awesome at least once a week since we moved to the New Haven area around one year ago.  It's not only staffed by the most courteous, friendly, quick, and helpful staff imaginable, the food is outstanding and very reasonably priced.  I should say that the pad thai is outstanding, since we almost always find ourselves unable to not get it when we order.  I have had a few other entrees, however, including the garlic chicken, which was terrific. I also highly recommend the som tum (shredded green papaya salad); it is always super fresh and intensely flavorful. If you live in New Haven or Hamden, like Thai foord, and you haven't eaten here, you're seriously missing out.
