I have gone off and on to 168 York st for many years.  It is a great home town bar.  You have your regulars who go every day.  Everyone is friendly and has a good time.  The employees are also very friendly.  Thursdays are there busy nights especially in the summer.  They have a patio in the back which fills up pretty quickly.  They have a room you can rent on the second floor which I did for a party.  The food I ordered was great and again service was great.  If you have never been for dinner and or just a drink try it out.  Yes it is a gay bar but everyone can have fun here.
