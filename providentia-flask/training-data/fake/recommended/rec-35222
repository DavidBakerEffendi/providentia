I made the reservation 2 weeks in advance and was really looking forward to some decent Lebanese food. What an awful experience from the beginning till the end. We were seated in a bad section with a wobbly table. The hostess slammed the table against my feet...I still have some bruising on my toes. Our waiter followed with the biggest attitude. And then the manager came along when only one of us wanted to do Restaurant Week menu and said that was against their policy. The absolute climax was when the same manager rushed in front of us to tell the hostess we decided to leave (SURPRISE!!!) and told her to put our reservation as cancelled in Open Table. How low was that??? I DID NOT cancel the reservation...it was all ilili fault..."thank you" for spoiling our Friday night and your wobbly horrible table will never be forgiven. Amen.
