Highlights of the night: -Some of the best Italian food made outside my own kitchen. -Homemade limoncello (absolutely delicious!), and the man who shared his secret limoncello recipe with us. -Spending over two hours there, not because the service was slow (it was perfect!) but because we were having that good a time. Very accommodating to our large group, especially since we made reservations. It was a busy Saturday night there, but not unbearable. I can't wait to head back.
