The bartenders at Bar San Miguel make the best margaritas in New York City. Although not a bespoke style cocktail bar the likes of which were popular about a half-decade ago, bartenders here are very amendable to making cocktails sweeter or drier or adding a little heat with jalape√±os. Bar San Miguel offers good bar food, too. Good guacamole, good tacos, and they can even grill up a pretty good steak. Come sober for desired effect. You'll want to be coherent enough to tip these folks well.
