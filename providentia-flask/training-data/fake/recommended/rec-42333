I went to here with a friend last night.   For appetizers, we ordered the Mac Attack since we read great reviews for it.  The appetizer came and it was borderline room temperature, like it was sitting on the counter for a while before it was served to us.  We brushed it off since the restaurant seemed busy.  The appetizer was just OK... didn't meet our expectations after such great reviews.  Our entrees were served when we were still in the middle of our appetizer.  Again, we brushed it off.  My friend had the chicken & waffles and I had the country fried steak.  Like our appetizer, our entrees were borderline room temperature.  Also, I found my entree to be a bit salty.  Overall, I think I would appreciate Cafeteria more if our appetizer and entrees were better.
