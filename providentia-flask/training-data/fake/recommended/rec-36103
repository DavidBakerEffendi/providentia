Love the service, love the food, and love the atmosphere in this restaurant! I've been there once with my Japanese friends, and the food was delicious, so this time I brought my friend here again on a Thursday night, and it was empty so i was kinda scared, but after 7, there were almost full. We ordered octopus, pork belly, beef with garlic, tamagoyaki, and grilled chicken. I enjoyed the food a lot!
