This place was hard to find, hidden behind Main Street, but it was worth the effort! My husband and I were traveling through with our dog and they didn't blink an eye when we asked of we could sit out on the deck with her. We ordered the clams in garlic sauce and shrimp in spicy red sauce for appetizers. These were both phenomenal!!  We didn't let them take away the dishes when our entree arrived so we could continue dipping our bread in the sauces. I'm so glad that a previous Yelp review said that a full order of ribs would easily serve two people. We would have been overwhelmed if we'd each ordered a plate. My husband thought the pork ribs were a bit too fatty but they were really tasty!  We ordered sides of rice and black beans, both flavored nicely. Considering we were the only customers out on the deck, the staff were wonderfully attentive and the courses were timed very well. We'll definitely keep this on list to try again!
