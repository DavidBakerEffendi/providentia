Three things I like about Jane: Numero Uno: the name. They picked very, very well on this. Numero Duo: they know how to poach an egg. Numero three-o: if you get there on a Sunday prior to noon, there's no wait---compared to the HORDES of hip n trendy that arrive at noon. (This is due to the blue laws; no liquor served on Sunday mornings until the clock strikes twelve. But if you sit down at 11:40, and take your time with coffee and deciding whether to have eggs benedict ("Jane") or with maple-chicken sausage and johnnycakes ("Johnny") or one of the other delicious options, by the time you get to put in your order with the charming and melodramatically gay young waiter, it's drink time and up pops your fabulous bloody mary that by the way is included in the price of brunch and my, that was a long parenthetical, wasn't it?) Overall: Great food, great bar, hectic buzz, get there early, make faces at all the people waiting for your table, and enjoy! A great place to catch up with old friends over hot coffee and stiff drinks and perfect eggs. Four brunch-a-listic stars!
