Bluestone has been my family's #1 choice for breakfast or lunch for about 5 years. Â The staff is very friendly and we have never once been disappointed with a meal. When you cash out, they ALWAYS ask if everything was OK and honestly it always has been. Never felt like the wait for food long and the food is constantly good. Oh, and the coffee is fantastic! Even the decaf :)
