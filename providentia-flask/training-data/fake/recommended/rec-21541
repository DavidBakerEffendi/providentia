04/16/2011 - my brother and I we just driving around Philadelphia when we saw this spot.   I ordered the meatloaf, wrapped with bacon with mash potatoes.  Yum yum yum.  My brother had the Asian spiced tuna burger.  The wasabi mayo was tasty. The service is friendly so it feels homey.  Wish we could stay for the night life.  Looks awesome..
