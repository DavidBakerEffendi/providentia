So ALL my friends talk about this place.  I don't know if it was just overhyped to me or what, but I didn't think it was the best thing on earth.  It's more of a 4.5 star to me but I'm rounding up because I feel obligated to.  It's cheap ($6) for a huge plate, and what you get is a pie dish sized plate of very well seasoned rice and very well seasoned lamb (or chicken).  The white sauce is amazing.  It's some seasoned yogurt based sauce.  The red sauce is really good too, but not as hot as most people are saying so I didn't put enough on :(  (imo you need a 2:1 ratio of white sauce to red sauce). Again, it's very good and I'll try it again, but even though my rating is a 5 star, I still feel it's a bit overhyped.  Coming in and knowing it's not the best thing since sliced bread will help you appreciate it more. yelp.com/biz_photos/xEnN…
