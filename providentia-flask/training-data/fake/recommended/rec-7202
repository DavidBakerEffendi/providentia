long wait. expect a long wait. we came here on a week night and we waited with a reservation. ha. we were also told that this is the spot that chefs come eat late at night when they get off their shifts so i had high high expectations. and honestly....it's a-ok! ergo the 3 stars. yakitori and most other foods are really pricey for what it is. i don't say this often bc i think nyc is the end all and be all of restaurants but LA has better yakitori for cheaper. the only thing i really enjoyed was the quail eggs. the other skewers came extremely overcooked. we also ordered the riceball which was good but too much rice and a few other dishes (see photos added). the udon was also a stand out but i think i like any noodle drizzled with japanese mayo. because of the small space, expect to be squeezed in tight spaces with strangers. also extremely loud. crowd's young and professional. food's average. overall, just ok.
