Swimming among the Italian BYOBs in Center City, it's easy to get lost. After trying my share of pasta and wine joints, Melograno seems to deliver on all fronts: not impossible to get a table on a popular night, the atmosphere is romantic but not overly cramped, and the food is creative but accessible. The artichoke app was roasted perfectly, but didn't sparkle, the mushroom pasta was abundant and delicious, the beef short rib and polenta was to die for, and the canolis and panna cotta were light and satisfying. Brad's rating (out of 5): Price: 3 Food: 5 Decor: 4 Service: 4 Wild card: Really good bread basket
