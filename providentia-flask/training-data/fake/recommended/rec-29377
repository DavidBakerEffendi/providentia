I know this is a highly reputable restaurant in the city, but I can't say that I understand why.  It's certainly ritzy, impressive on a date, etc.. but the food isn't among the top places around in my opinion.  I know to expect to pay out the nose at some places, and with that high check comes high expectations.  That's where I fall short on being able to give more than three stars.  Don't get me wrong, I do like this restaurant, but for the price I think there are so many other places to check out that you will enjoy your meal a bit more.  To sum it up, the food is pretty good, the prices are pretty high.  We got the prawns for the first time ever, and ended up being a little scared at what ended up at our table - however I blame that on myself for not knowing what to expect - mini white lobster looking creatures in full form, on a plate.
