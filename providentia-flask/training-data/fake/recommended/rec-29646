I was honestly disappointed with Benito's. I picked it because I had a friend visiting the United States for the first time from Norway and we spent a weekend in NYC. I wanted her to get a feel for all aspects of the city, including historic Little Italy. I have been to a few phenomenal restaurants in Little Italy, but they lack some of the atmosphere. For example, Grotta Azzura looks like a Papa Ginos, but damn the food is AMAZING there. I was hoping for even better at the real deal, Benito One the Original. I made a reservation on the phone - no trouble. When we got there, we were seated at a rickety picnic table outside, way too close to the diners next to us (as in, the tables were basically butted up together). I get that it's tight in that neighborhood, but it wasn't what I had in mind. The menu was HUGE! The prices were a bit steep for some things and appropriate for others. I got a glass of sangria and it was pretty good. The bread was uninspired. But my biggest disappointment was my meal. I got gnocchi and the flavor was dull, the portion was small by normal standards -- let alone italian standards! -- and while it wasn't BAD, it wasn't great, as I had hoped it would be. We didn't linger because we didn't feel welcome to do so. We packed up and got out of there, and I don't think I'll be back.
