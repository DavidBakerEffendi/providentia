Wow I didn't write a review for the other 1st location when I came 2 years ago? Honestly what can I say that others haven't already? This is their newer 2nd location. Lines started at 1130 on the dot. Service is efficient just like the original location. Food seems to come out faster here tho. Akamaru modern! You are THE ramen that changed what I thought about ramen. Yummy and perfect noodles that don't seem to get soggy and complex and deep broth.
