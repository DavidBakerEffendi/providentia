Food here does not disappoint. Squash soup was well presented with toasted pumpkin seeds and a yummy drizzle-flourish. For main course I had the appetizer size seared diver scallops with a light curry sauce and chopped vegetables--delicious. Appetizer size with the soup was an ample lunch. My lunch mates had the smoked trout (a hit) and the chicken salad (excellent and hearty). Elegant decor, clean, and excellent service (except for a minor snafu with our reservation--otherwise perfect.) Bring your foodie friends and enjoy!
