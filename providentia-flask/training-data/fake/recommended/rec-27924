I don't mean to be the voice of dissent, especially considering I frequent Sunny and Annie's every single day, sometimes twice a day (coffee + drunken snack). But every single time I've gotten a bagel or a sandwich, I have been disappointed. Every. Single. Time. So disappointed, that I refuse to get sandwiches from them anymore. I can get more flavor at home with a slice of bread and a smear of peanut butter. Other than that, coffee is good for bodega coffee, and it's cheap. Selection of chips, drinks, random foods, and "oops, just ran out of toilet paper/detergent/batteries/dog-food" is great. Prices are what you'd expect. Damn good bodega, but overhyped sammys.
