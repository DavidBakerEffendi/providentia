My BF was so excited to bring me here as he has been multiple times and really really enjoyed himself. First, we had reservations and they sat us at the asshole table.  Yeah we all know the one where you get bumped into or worse have a drink spilled on you - like I did - by the girl walking down the stairs with one leg in a cast and a drink in her hand.  Our server watched all of this happen while he was standing at our table and just kept on asking what we would like to eat as if nothing had been spilled or I hadn't jumped from the table and started grabbing napkins. So bit of a bumpy start.  BF asked to be seated somewhere else while I was upstairs in the bathroom cleaning cast girls cocktail from my hair and clothing.  All cleaned up I begrudgingly returned to the table where my BF told me that he was sorry but they had no more tables available for us to move to.  This is when it got hairy.  I had just been upstairs in the bathroom where the dinning room up there was half full.  The host must have picked up on my 'hold on a hot freaking second' face and came over and said 'oh we seem to have a table upstairs for you'.  We moved and were much much more comfortable. We ended up ordering loads of tapas and loved every last one but the service was nonexistent.  No one asked how our food was or if we wanted refills, nothing.  When I had asked our server for another drink and to look at the menu to see what else we wanted to order she couldn't have been bothered and actually made me feel like an imposition.   Alta your servers completely ruined a fantastic meal.  I would love to say oh I'll give it another try because the food was that good but I can't because the service was just THAT bad.
