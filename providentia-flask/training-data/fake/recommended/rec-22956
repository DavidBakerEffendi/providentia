HJ house offer bad sushi and service. I've been there few times, but their food and service are as bad as always. I don't even want to tip them. I had a cucumber salad this time, it's only few pieces of cucumber and tomatoes with some weird sauce. Their sushi I had in this places are bad too. Rice is supposed to be the most important part of sushi, but their rice is too sticky. And the raw fish they use are not fresh, at all. I don't recommend this place!
