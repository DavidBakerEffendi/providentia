Had a reservation for 9 but we didn't sit until 9:30.  We killed time in the bar (great cocktails) and they made it somewhat right with some duck fat popcorn.  Food was worth the wait. Spicy duck meatballs and the duck breast were pretty dang good.  Other diners enjoyed the steak, dorade and chicken.  Service was a bit spotty, but I would definitely go back and try the duck burger.  And yes, I'm aware that I have a duck problem.
