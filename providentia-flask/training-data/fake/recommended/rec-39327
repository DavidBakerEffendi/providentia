Mezcal was literally some of the worst restaurant service I have received in a long time. I arrived by joining up with a big party in honor of a recent fundraiser on behalf of the New Haven Land Trust. Although the ambiance of the restaurant was fine, the waitress was rude, dominant and condescending. We ended up standing and mingling for a long time, without even a friendly greeting by the waitstaff. My legs were getting tired so I requested to sit down in one of the couple empty tables and order early. This particular waitress insisted on making my friend and I wait until the entire (fundraiser) party could sit down at tables. (I arrived at 6:15.) My friend and I literally waited over an hour and a half just to sit down, even though there were a few empty tables available off and on. When we were finally seated, the food took 25 minutes to arrive. The food was average, though one of the sauces for the chips was good and drinks were good. My friend made a request not to have sour cream on her food, but four big dollops were served on her food anyhow. Ultimately, I will not come back to this place. Disorganized, slow service and a discourteous waitress makes me say "Adios!"
