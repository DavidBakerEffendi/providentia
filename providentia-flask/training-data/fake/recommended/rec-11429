I love the idea of two friends, both from different backgrounds, coming together and creating something unique. That's what Benjamin and Michelin did with this French/Mexican restaurant. My palate was craving Mexican, especially after the table received a trio of salsas and tortilla. We started off with the house made guacamole, served in a classic molcajete. Each is made-to-order and ours was thick and chunky - yum! Allowing you to taste all the ingredients. My main entree was the Organic Chicken Tinga Enchilada. Three enchiladas packed with chicken in a chipotle sauce, which was not overpowering with a smoky flavor one would expect, and then topped with a slab of queso fresco. Dessert? Too full! Next time, but I am hoping the chefs create a French/Mexican infused macaron!
