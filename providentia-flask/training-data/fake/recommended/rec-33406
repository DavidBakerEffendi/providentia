Nice place! The decor is lovely. Good atmosphere. Very pretty and friendly overall. Drinks: I had a strawberry mojito. It tasted pretty watered down to me. Very yummy though. Just not alcoholic. Appetizers: I got the vegetable dumplings. Delicious! I loved them. Fresh, very yummy. My friend had the fried or baked tofu with dipping sauce. I took a bite of the tofu and I did not like it very much. Entree: I had the shrimp with avocado curry. Not bad! They didn't give me enough rice with the curry, but I liked the avocado, I liked the veggies, I liked the curry sauce. The shrimp was all right. Service: started out good, ended with my table mostly neglected. Not awful or rude, though. They just weren't paying attention to us. I'd come here again if I were in the neighborhood or in the mood. I'd say it's good, even at times delicious, Thai food. But nothing spectacular.
