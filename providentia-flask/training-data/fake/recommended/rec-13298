The Gold Standard Cafe is a solid brunch experience, especially after a late night in a smoke filled club with drag queens.  I got the hash with chirizo and it hit the spot.  The chai was very yummy and my sister liked her quiche a lot.  We didn't have to wait for a table and service was very friendly.
