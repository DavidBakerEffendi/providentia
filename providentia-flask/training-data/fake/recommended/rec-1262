I stopped in because I had an old WMMR Deal of the Day coupon.  When I first walked in I was thrown off because the place is chopped up in an odd way.  There is a small bar when you first walk in, and then a dining room and a second bar upstairs.  I walked upstairs, but as it was a weekday it seems that only the small bar near the entrance was open.  This is first section is very small, probably 800sq ft, but it wasn't crowded so we grabbed a high top table and ordered some drinks. The beer selection was weak compared to most Philly bars.  There were about 5 beers on tap with Dogfish 60 Minute being the most exotic, but their Tuesday special was $4 Dogfish which is a good deal so that was cool.   The bartender was a very friendly girl that was upbeat and made the place fun.  A young newly engaged couple came in and the bartender bought them and us a round of shots to celebrate.   We ordered our food which was really the highlight of the place.  I had the shepards pie, which was really good.  My wife had a chicken/pesto/avocado sandwich which was really good too.  We also shared an order of cheesesteak spring rolls with their Cavanaugh's sauce.  The sauce was awesome, and I'm pretty sure it was a mix of sweet and sour sauce and buffalo sauce.   The food prices were reasonable for the quality and the beer special was a good deal.  Overall, I was really impressed with this place.  Without the coupon I probably would have never come here, but I had a good time and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  I would not hesitate to come back and certainly will.  It is one of the best irish pubs I've been to in the city.
