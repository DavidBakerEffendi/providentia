I joined Yelp just to write this review, after my first visit to Graffiti- mainly because I am appalled that people could slack off a place with world-class food because they felt a little cramped. I hate to say this folks but GET OVER IT! Who can read so many reviews about the small space?! WE GET IT! All those who are reading this, know that the place is super-small and yes, cramped; don't go if you are a full-on snob that wants a Per Se experience and likes to get all dressed up and play banker for $400 per person on your spare time! I have been to Per Se and the food here is just as good, but laid back, more inventive and 1/10th the price! Come to Graffiti if you want to be yourself and eat great food at an affordable price, served by very nice people. I have been to all of the top restaurants in the city and this has just become my favorite place... Chef Mehta is a genius and a lovely person to interact with. Go and enjoy! Be thankful for the tiny size of the place- its part of the charm and what keeps this incredible dining experience affordable.
