In my unceasing pilgrimage of Hell's Kitchen Thai restaurants, today I chose Room Service. The moment I walked in I kinda wanted to hate this place. It's so damn loud, somehow it's even manages to be louder than all the honking buses and taxis and barking dogs and cell-phone-chatting tourists on 9th avenue... They really should turn down the music... And their phones are constantly ringing, which is really annoying. The tables are a little bit too close together, even though the tables are large enough so that you have plenty of elbow room -- it's just a little hard to get in and/or out of your seat if you're sitting on the inside rather than the outside. My waiter was really nice. I asked him to have the kitchen make my food really hot, extra hot -- and that's exactly what he did. Holy cow, my spicy basil noodles with chicken was obscenely hot, I haven't had a dish this hot in a really long time. Â The ingredients of the dish were all cooked perfectly, the flavors were all great, and the presentation was beautiful... I also got the chicken satays which were very fresh and tender and delicious. I wouldn't necessarily call this "authentic" Thai but for main-stream white-people Thai it's pretty damn good, not sweet and not really dumbed-down. The space is very attractive, perhaps a bit excessive, but nice nonetheless -- thankfully the prices aren't any more expensive than at other places with less impressive decor.
