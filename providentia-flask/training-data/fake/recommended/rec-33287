My fianc√© and I went here for our four year anniversary last night. While the sangria, dips, and Spanish "Pitza" were tasty, our service was really poor. Our server Lucy, (which she never said, we saw it on the receipt), said two words to us the entire meal and never even made eye contact. While we appreciate good food, good service goes even further. If you like to go to a place where the waiter rushes by you to throw down a menu or never asks you if you like the food, and doesn't even say thanks for coming, this is your restaurant.
