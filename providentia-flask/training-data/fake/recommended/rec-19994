I have eaten at the restaurant once and ordered online several times.  The time I ate there the waitress was extremely friendly and she was incredibly attentive.  She explained everything in great detail and really seemed to love her job.  It's unusual, especially in the NYC area (as opposed to down south where I'm from), to find people who really seem to care about their jobs and the customer service they provide. The food is always of great quality.  I typically get the margherita pizza and I love it every time.  I am a huge fan of their sauce and the fresh mozzarella is excellent.  It's priced in line with most other pizza places in the area if not a smidge cheaper.  The consistency has been there, too, and it's nice to know I can rely on that.  I always know I'm getting something good! Though I should have written this good review already, tonight really compelled me to finally git-r-done!  I placed my order online and went about my evening.  About 40 minute in, which was still in the window of wait time shown on the app, I get a call from a woman at the restaurant.  She asked if I'd received my pizza and I said no.  She said she was sorry about that, the delivery guy went MIA, and that she'd have one to me in 10 minutes.  The fact that she noticed a problem that affected customers and figured out who all might be missing food was really impressive.  I could tell it was slammed in there and she had the wherewithal to know everything that was going on.  I was really appreciative of her efforts and of course it just makes me plan to remain loyal to Table 87 for my pizza needs.  I just hope the second delivery guy gets a tip somehow since the manager's replacement order was not my original one that included the tip.  I'm sure this excellent manager will sort that out, too.  My faith in people's attitudes around here as it relates to customer service work is a little renewed now.
