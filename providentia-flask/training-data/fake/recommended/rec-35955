I ordered the rack of lamb, it was slightly overlooked but the flavors of this dish made up for that fact. It was a savory, delectable meal. I purchased a Groupon for this restaurant and was pleasantly pleased with my lunch experience. Â As other Yelpers have cited, this restaurant is desolate around 2ish. I had the entire restaurant to myself which was awesome. I will definitely come back to the restaurant for future meals.
