We had a lovely dinner. Our waiter was attentive though we called ahead to request one vegan meal and they knew nothing of the special request. Our waiter asked the chef if he could prepare something and came back to say they would roast some veggies. As we finished dessert we were abruptly approached by the RUDE manager who told us to leave to make room for the next table. We were just sipping our last drop of our tawny port. We were shocked. The experience is not just about the food. This rating is about the poor customer service.
