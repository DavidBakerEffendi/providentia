At first I thought this was one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  However, i realized that my tastebuds were probably swayed by the 90 minute wait we had to endure.  A fair price for a 6 PM dinner Saturday night. As for the food...pizza is pizza; and this is exactly what that is. There's nothing exceptionally special about the pizza.  The crust is nice and thin. The ingredients are fresh. And the service is speedy, which is great if you stayed in line for so long. You can definitely find this type of pizza in other places in New York, sans the wait. The most delicious part of our meal was the special sodas that we ordered. (The cream soda was awesome!) The atmosphere is casual and fun, and the wait staff was helpful. I definitely think that everyone should experience Grimaldi's at least once, if only to tell people that you've eaten there.  It's one of those "experiences" that you need under your belt.
