It's not much for appearances, but let me tell you...Prosperity will not disappoint. If you have less than $3 in your wallet, you've come to the right place. You can literally eat till your heart's content on a few bucks. Just don't expect a place to sit....and be ready for a line at lunch time. If you have the time to wait, you definitely won't be disappointed. Try the chive and pork fried dumplings or the sesame pancakes. Yay for Chinatown!
