First of all, Rest in Peace to the Chelsea location. That was my favorite and I'm still shedding thug tears. I'll review this location instead, since it's the first one I ever went to and their food is consistent across all the locations. When someone wants good Thai in a cool ambiance, I come here. When someone wants to catch up over dinner with good food and a good happy here, I come here. When someone wants good food for a decent price period... I usually come here. Or Wendy's. (I know I contradicted myself, look I don't need that now...) The Happy Hour will give you a wide variety of creative cocktails at a good price. Some are stronger than others, and the server will always give you recommendations if you need them. All of them have said across the board that the drink named Room Service is the strongest. The description sounds like, Long Island Iced Tea level crazy. But it's never gotten me out of control. Taste-wise, one of my favorites is the Key Lime Pie cocktail that comes with graham cracker crumbles on top. The Pad Thai is always solid. Lately I've been getting Beef Pad Prik Khing, which is just the right amount of spicy and is great every time. For appetizers, I always end up getting the Golden Triangles, which my friend introduced me to, and splitting them with whoever I'm with. For a quaint, boozy dinner, good Thai food, cozy lighting and a bill that will never make your heart sink, you can't really go wrong here.
