I have been here several times, and the food is usually well prepared. Unfortunately, my last visit did not go well. We came in later at night, so it wasn't overcrowded, still our wait time was unacceptable (about 45 minutes) especially considering that people who came in before us got served first. In addition, it was hard to get the waiter's attention. The long wait could have been a legitimate error, such as the order slip was misplaced in the kitchen. Next, I guess it's human psychology: once you get frustrated about the unreasonably long wait, even the food doesn't taste so good anymore. I want to go back to this place soon, and hopefully update my review with more stars and positive comments.
