I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  It is a beautiful space in a beautiful neighborhood.  The menu is exciting and different although not intimidating. We had one of each of the mussels to start (simple, very good) as well as the fritters (made from some kind of fish, don't remember).  The fritters were like a delicious little bite of a crab cake.  We each got one of their pastas for the entrée.  I had a the cavatelli.  This was one of those "once in a lifetime" dishes.  It was creamy but not heavy.  It was served with broccoli (so not terribly unhealthy) and raisins (what a unique combination).  For dessert we had pumpkin cheesecake.  How can you go wrong with that? Go there.
