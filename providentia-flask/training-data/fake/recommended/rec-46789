Great katsu curry! The good: the curry was  as advertised, great! The katsu was incredible! Not too greasy and very well marinated.  I ordered the slam to share with my son, so it was just enough food. The bad: the place has no bathroom, and is was small. 9 seats over 4 tables makes for a cramped meal.  The fried shrimp was a bit too oily, surprising since the katsu was perfect IMO. The sausage was simple, not really worth noting and certainly not worth the money. The ugly. I ordered the largest portion of rice on top of my order, but they gave so little!  Look, I'm Asian, I love my rice. But that was insulting. I hate paying lots of money for more rice. Bottom line: I would certainly go back and recommend it to others. I would ask for the curry sauce on the side though, and if I could just get them to be more generous with their rice....
