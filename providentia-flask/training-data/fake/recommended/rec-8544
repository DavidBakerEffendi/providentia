I only went for the Passyunk avenue restaurant week, but I really enjoyed my meal.  It was kindof expensive, but you definitely get what you pay for.  Even though most restaurants dull down their menus a bit for the special deal thing, the butternut squash soup was amazing, and my salmon entree was cooked just right.  The service was absolutely phenomenal.  There were only a few people working, but boy did they hussle.  Everyone was extremely polite and knowledgeable and I can honestly say this was the first dining experience I've ever had in my life where I truly felt like a princess.
