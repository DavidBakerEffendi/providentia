Easily one of the coolest places I've stumbled into in New York. I was half-way drunk, a belly full of pizza, and clueless that I've lost credit card. It was a Tuesday night this place was packed. For it's late night hours it was still a lively and in interesting crowd. It's a small space with a linear room which made bumping elbows a perfect excuse to make conversation. When I had lost my credit card the doormen, the bartender, and the manager were nice enough to make brief checks for me before handing me their card to contact them in the morning. Understandable since the house was packed and everyone was running around chaotically. But that didn't stop me from enjoying the night. Before wandering into the night to search for my card, I instantly ordered the cocktail that caught my eye, the Hemingway Daiquiri. The drink was perfect and briefly eased my worries. I only wish I had a hefty beard grown and a heightened disdain towards females and I could've chatted up some cute girls, in New York *snort* Of course, the drink was pricey as usual, but I did enjoy the experience.
