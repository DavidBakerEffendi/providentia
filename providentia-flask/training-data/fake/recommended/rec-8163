I had to travel to Philidelphia for work and was recommended the White Dog for dinner. The fact of the matter was that I was only in PA for 3 1/2 days and I ended up at this place twice!!! Dinner: Overall pretty good. Nothing super spectacular. They had a lot of vegitarian dishes and I later found out they use local produce. Supporting the local community grants an extra star! Bar scene: The 5 stars is going to the overal ambiance and the fabulous bar scene after dinner. Because it's right down the street from U Penn, it's a pretty chill college bar atmosphere. But the crowd was definitely diverse; professors, students, business peoples, and me ;) The bartender was really helpful as was our server and the drinks were unique and tasty! Everyone was friendly and seemed to be up for conversation. I'm always down with that! Overall, it will be my new favorite bar in PA!
