The only con is cash only BUT there's an ATM inside. Came here for a quick bite before my flight back home. Didn't know what to expect or what kind of food it'd be but it was so delicious. I got the latke sandwich, very happy with my choice. Also I didn't think the fries would be good but I was proven way wrong. They were fantastic!
