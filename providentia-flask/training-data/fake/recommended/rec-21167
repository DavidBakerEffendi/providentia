My friend made reservations to this secret speakeasy Japanese restaurant for a friend's birthday celebration.  Not easy to find if you didn't read the other Yelp reviews...it's a hidden gem behind a butcher shop on Great Jones St. You must have a reservation to dine here. Small restaurant that seats about 25 people, so you will you get plenty of attention from your servers. There are 7 tables and 5 seats at the bar. Feels like a nice cozy living room. Our server was nice and checked in on us often. Note: Time limit for dining since there is a 6pm and 9pm seating. We had a 7pm seating and had to be out by 9:15. Restroom was big and toilet was like a bidet...remote on the wall to flush, clean, etc. We opted not do to the tasting menu. If you choose the tasting menu, your entire party needs to do the tasting menu. We decided to have: Fried sweet potatoes  - tasty sweet potatoes, but not too sweet Toro Taku Roll - comes as 2 pieces, pieces were big so fell apart easily Foie Gras Sushi - comes as 2 pieces, was good but also fell apart easily as you pick it up and try to eat Washu Beef Mini Burgers - was ok, lacked a little flavor. Kuro Buta Pork Loin - very good. 3 of us shared this dish. Give the Specialty drinks a try.. Tried the Jimi's view - tastes like lavender and one of my friends had the S.B.C. (strawberry) Dessert: Cheesecake souffle - good but had goat cheese icec cream or something Green tea brownie with raspberry sorbet, raspberry sauce, crushed potato chips dipped in white chocolate (shaped as a rose) - Sorbet was good, green tea must have brewed a bit too long. Great place for a special occasion. Looking forward to coming back.
