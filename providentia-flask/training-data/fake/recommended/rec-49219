Wow.  Cannot believe this adorable little bag-paper menu candles everywhere to-die-for italian food is a stones throw from my apt and I did not go here sooner.  Wow.   Amazing spot for when you are feeling escapist or craving real, (I'm all for Carmines, but c'mon, seriously with chicken parm the size of a frisbee?) healthy, fresh italian dishes.
