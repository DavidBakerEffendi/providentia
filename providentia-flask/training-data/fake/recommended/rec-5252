Had some big fattys BBQ for a catered Â function at work. The beans and pulled pork were actually quite good. The sauce was sweet and not to tangy and the ribs were good also. Hey it's the upper valley and there isn't much at all for BBQ up here so this will have to do if you get a craving. I didn't really like the chicken but the coleslaw was very good.
