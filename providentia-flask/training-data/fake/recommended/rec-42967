I have only been here for drinks, but it is one of my favorite places to grab a great drink before heading out for dinner in the West Village. They make several great whiskey cocktails!  The bar tenders are all wonderful, and very good at what they do.  The atmosphere is swanky and comfortable. Everything I have had on their cocktail list is top-notch.  I will continue to go there for drinks.  One of my favorite places in the village.
