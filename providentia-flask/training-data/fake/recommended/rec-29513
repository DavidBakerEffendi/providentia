I always lived here in the area, without going by.   So my boy Rod Diggy and his lovely wife Christy came up from FL, and we were walking the hood.  He wanted authentic empanadas.   We came here... We were both equally impressed.  Empanadas made FRESH, so they're very hot (be careful) and NOT FROM A WARMING CASE.  I got two classics, chicken and cheese. They had corn, wheat and whole wheat based empanadas, for an average of 1.50, not much higher than the usual corner bodega.   It's weird in there in the best way possible.  There's one park picnic table that seats for and it's tiny in there, yet it's very nicely decorated and clean.   The empanadas take about 7 minutes and are well worth the wait.
