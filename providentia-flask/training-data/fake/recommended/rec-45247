Get their banana dream. Last time I was there, it was not on the menu anymore, but I asked for it, and they made it. It's a crepe dish with bananas in creamy sauce with citrusy delicious tropical syrup on the side. Another favorite is the Dutch baby. I like it plain. Pancakes here are delicious as well. The service is great too. Yes, the interior is outdated, but you will be so busy devouring your food that the 30 year old furniture won't bother you!
