I haven't had Belgian fries like this in a long while.  They are really crispy on the outside and hot and fluffy on the inside.   They come  before your burger and really hot.  My only criticism of them is that they aren't long enough.  You end up fishing in the basket for fry pieces which is really annoying.   I still ate most of them.  For $2 with a sauce for a small order, it's a bargain. I got the beef burger.   Extremely huge burger, I wish there was a mini version or a 6oz one instead.   Half a pound of burger is a lot.  I asked for it medium and it was slightly over medium, but I can be really picky about burger temperature.   A little annoying, but still a good burger.  Also, the cheese was really gooey and kinda slid off the burger and then the burger began to fall apart.   The caramelized onions were cooked down a lot, but you could tell they were prepared well in advance and was cold.   All things considered, I'll be back and please the the Harissa aioli on the fries, it was great!
