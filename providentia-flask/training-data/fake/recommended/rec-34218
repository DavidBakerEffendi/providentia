This place is fantastic. I was mezmerized by the Pepsi-cola sign as I walked in. Love the decor and vibe. Great music. I'm a huge fan of tapas-style food, I really enjoyed all of our bites especially the croquettes. The GM Josh was very nice and accommodating. Got to talk to the Chef and found out he made the pepsi-cola sign and much of the decor. Very cool. Can't wait to go back for brunch-They have a $5 unlimited mimosa-bloody mary deal!
