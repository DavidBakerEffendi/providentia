This is place is fun! Their chips and salsa are great. The location of Agave is great and its great for people to grab lunch. It is little busy during lunch hours but its totally worth it. The waitress... Jesse was a sweetie. My reason to go back is to see her inviting smile... oh and her suggestions turned out amazing. I had coffee there and it was pretty good. Enchiladas were good decent sized...wish they served bigger portions...
