I just want to thank everyone at Yerba Buena (especially Giovanny who organized everything) for an AMAZING birthday dinner!   I came here a few weeks ago and have been meaning to write a review.  I booked the private room downstairs and had an awesome birthday party with 16 of my friends.  There was a little bit of a wait to get our table, but that was ok because we ordered a round of incredible cocktails at the bar.   All of the food served was outstanding.  I got tons of emails the next day from my friends saying they loved what they ordered.  They also sent out some free shots and dessert drinks which went over very well with my group.  My birthday cake had a serious torch to blow out, very festive!   I am headed back tomorrow night with two friends who were also at the dinner... we are all obsessed with this restaurant now!
