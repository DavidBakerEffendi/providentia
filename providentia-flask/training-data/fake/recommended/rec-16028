I love tasting menus for the simple reason that they free us (the diners) from the tyranny of choice.  I am making decisions from that first moment of quasi-wakefulness in the morning (how many times to hit snooze) to the moments leading up to my nightly repose (how many glasses of scotch will it take to put me down tonight).  It's nice to just shut up and be fed. The pasta tasting menu at Becco accomplishes that in spectacular fashion.  It's all perfectly-made, it's unlimited, I don't need to think too much about it, and it's a fantastic bargain.  Couple that with an unpretentious atmosphere (not what you'd expect from a restaurant run by some of the most storied chefs in New York), and you've got a winner on your hands.
