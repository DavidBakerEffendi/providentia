There are lots of good sushi options but this one is the best I think. Wide range of items, the knifework is generally excellent, big menu, pricey but worth it. Service is outstanding once you become a regular, but I could see how it's less than perfect if you are new. Still the food is first rate, which is so critically important when you eat anything raw.
