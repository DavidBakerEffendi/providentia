mmmmm choo choo!    I am not the hugest pho fan in the world, but I do love me some pad thai, and they have the best pad thai in the city, especially for vegetarians.  the #617 - spicy veg pad thai - is to die for.  they give you a ton of it so I always get to enjoy leftovers the next day.          Also, best Thai iced tea in the city.  And mmm unfried shrimp spring rolls.  and shrimp coconut curry.
