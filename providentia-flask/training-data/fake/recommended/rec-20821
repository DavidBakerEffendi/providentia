First visit and I was really impressed. The staff is friendly and the food is excellent. The restaurant is warm and welcoming; makes you feel like you're sitting in your kitchen at home. If you come for just a coffee on your daily errands there is a cute sitting area next to a fireplace with a sofa ad comfy chairs and a coffee table. Now on the the food...bring your appetite. The portions are generous. You have lots of choices for either breakfast or lunch. I came for brunch an wanted to try it all. I got a Taylor ham, egg and cheese on a bagel, but wanted to try their poached pear French toast...so I got one slice. The bread was sliced thick and was served with a poached pear on top an smothered in a whiskey caramel sauce...very rich, but absolutely heavenly. Their latte was really yummy. And the ambiance is friendly and welcoming. You have to hit this place up!
