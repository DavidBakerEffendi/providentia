The stars are adjusted for my expectation that the dining experience would be phenomenal ... But I thought the food was good but not out of this world good. Maybe it is because I went there w a large group w pre-selected menu... Also did not love the Parma pizza... It's basically prosciutto and arugula on dough... Maybe I am a traditionalist, but much preferred the margherita. Next time, I will try the pastas not covered in cheese and butter...
