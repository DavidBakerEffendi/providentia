YES!  This place has got it going on!   I came here with my family on our visit from Chicago and LOVED this place.  The decor is super cool without being pretentious and the food was great.  I love the little glass of deliciousness they give you when you sit down.  (We were here for breakfast, not sure if this changes for any other meal.)  The food was fresh and tasted amazing.  All 4 of us were very happy with our meals. The restaurant was run beautifully and efficiently making the restaurant seem much less chaotic then it was for brunch time on a Saturday.   Next time I am in Philly, I am for sure coming here again.  Id love to try dinner and drinks here!
