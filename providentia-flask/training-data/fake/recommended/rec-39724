Unfortunately, I feel that many tourists (and some locals) are drawn to Trecolori out of sheer convenience.  It's an ideal location for anyone trying to grab dinner before a show.  It's certainly worthy of 3 stars, but any half-way decent Italian restaurant rarely disappoints.  The wine selection is fantastic, along with the desert.  The dinner menu is exactly what you'd expect from a NYC Italian place--a few pasta dishes, veal, chicken + sauce, etc.  I ate with a party of 3, each of us sampling one another's meals.  All of it was tasty, but only "3-star" tasty. If you're grabbing dinner during the pre-theatre rush, the atmosphere can be a little hectic--as mentioned by other viewers.  People seem to think that exposed brick makes a restaurant better than those without, but don't expect to be blown away be the restaurant's aesthetic.  For a convenient, enjoyable, and affordable meal in Midtown Manhattan, Trecolori is a great option.  Enjoy!
