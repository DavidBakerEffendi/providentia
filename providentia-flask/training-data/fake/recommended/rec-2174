I remember coming here back in 2006 during my first trip to the East Coast and had to try this place and Geno's.   The steaks at Pat's were prepared better than what I remembered from Geno's.  There wasn't much of a wait time that night.  I've read about this place and thought it was amazing how two competing restaurants can do pretty good business on opposite corners.  Since I'm not a Philly local, I wouldn't really know any other places to check out, but I loved what I tried at Pat's.   The next time I'm ever in Philly, I gotta come back here.
