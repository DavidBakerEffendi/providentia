The costumer service sucks.  We ordered what we thought was the catfish sandwich.  Turns out they changed the catfish to codfish and we're not willing to give us something different when we said we didn't want it.  I will say it depends on who is in there when you go.  I was treated so bad I will never go back. Sad because I really liked this place, but I refuse to support places that don't have good customer service.  P.s. I tried to eat the cod since I was stuck with and it was horrible.
