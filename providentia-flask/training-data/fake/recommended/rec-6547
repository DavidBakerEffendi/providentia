This place definitely stood out from all the other Thai restaurants in Hell's Kitchen...It's the decor...a beautiful crystal chandelier was beckoning us to come inside for some air conditioned lunch on a hot day like today. What a chic atmosphere...my friend kept saying it looked like we're at a nightclub. Under 7$ for lunch special before 3:30pm everyday is pretty awesome! I mean I was really full and I just barely even finished my plate. You get a choice of an appetizer and a entree....I got chicken satays and the pad thai with tofu...my lovely friend ordered the veggie dumplings and the penang curry w tofu. There was great flavor on just about everything I ate! I really liked the texture of the tofu they used! I loved it. My chicken satays were pretty tender and flavorful and I loved my friend's penang curry. :) The padthai was good and so were the dumplings. I was very happy about this place....and may definitely return if I'm in the area and craving some Thai food.
