The food at this establishment was great! I had the dosas and Idly and fell in love with the place. I was so happy to see a South Indian Restaurant in Mercer County! The service is wonderful and provided assistance with a large group. They did allow us to bring wine and beer. I will bring a group back to this place. I try to make a dosa night with my parents or friends.
