I was legit craving a burger badly when I walked by Bareburger. There are a lot of pluses going on here. Different types of meats you might not see at your average burger joint. You can build your own burger or stick with the creations they've invented. Gluten-free buns, veggie options, and non-burger sandwiches are all on the menu. And they have a liquor license/little bar! Ron was my server and he was great. Friendly and attentive while also respecting that I needed some time to chow down properly. I'll be back with friends!
