Came here with the boyfriend and a friend after another place had too long a wait. Boy am I glad that we came here. I got the brisket with a side of burnt end baked beans and it was absolutely amazing. The brisket was tender and juicy, with just a touch of soft fat, and it had a smattering of sea salt for extra oomph. The burnt end baked beans were rich and flavorful. My companion got the pulled pork, which was also delicious. While heavier than the brisket, the meat was still tender and flavorful. (He also raved about the sparkling lemonade.) This place is "cafeteria style" and wonderful. Definitely worth a visit.
