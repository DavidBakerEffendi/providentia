been going to casa piquin for two years now and they still are the best mexican restaurant i have ever eaten in. Â i had an issue with my credit card being charged WAY WAY over the amount i should have been billed. Alex, the owner handled it wonderfully. there was a new waiter about two months ago, who would always claim it was his "first week" when in reality, he had waited on my table at least four times! that got to be a little annoying. but overall, their food is a hit. i bring friends there and they all rave. the burritos, enchiladas, quesadillas, flautas, all amazing. and like i said earlier, BYOB def is great !
