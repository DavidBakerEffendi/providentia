The grilled octopus and bean salad was the BEST octopus I've ever had! I'm not a huge fan of octopus, but I'll eat it. I actually ordered the octopus just to freak out my bf because he doesn't like them :P His idea of octopus was only in the form of badly done sushi, the raw rubbery hard to chew type. I convinced him to take a bite of Kefi's grilled octopus and it changed his mind about octopus forever! The octopus was perfectly seasoned with just a hint of smokey char, exceptionally tender and succulent (my whole mouth just filled with saliva remembering it...). I also go the sheep milk dumplings with spicy lamb sausage. The dumplings were melt in your mouth delicious, and the spicy lamb cuts the richness of the dumplings really well. Excellently balanced dish.
