This is by far my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn. The cocktails are great and the food is delicious. It has a very intimate neighborhood feel to it that makes you just want to eat and drink there all night.  I have yet to have a bad meal here and a couple of times the chef has taken the time to come out and say hello, which is a nice touch.  My fiancé and I had our first date here and now we bring anyone who visits NYC or hasn't been here.  One thing all of us agree on is that the mac and cheese is the best in the city, hands down.
