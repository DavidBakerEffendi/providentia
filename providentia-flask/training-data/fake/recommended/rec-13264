This is going to be a redundant review about the... you guessed it! Pho sandwich! I had to give my opinion on it because I'm sitting here across the country at 3am craving it, and you know when you crave something, it's something goooood! I love the Pho sandwich because sometimes I want pho, but not always in a hot, oily broth, so this is the perfect substitution! You get the whole pho experience in a textury mouth full!
