Just thinking about these meat balls in - and around my mouth hole - initiates salivation. On my first visit to The Meatball Shop I went for the sliders. I figured it was a good way to taste all the varieties of balls - and indeed it was! My favorite was the chicken with parmesan cream. We also ordered the polenta, risotto, and brussel sprouts - all if which were simply marvelous! Â The meal was completed with, of course, an ice cream sandwich! Where else can you go and have a made-to-order ice cream sandwich?! Ummm.. no place I know of! Honestly, this is the place to get to early! It gets crazy packed; although, the wait is well worth it! The service was on point and the food is amazing! I sat outside, so technically, I have no idea on the decor inside. My advice: Come one! Come all! Come and stuff as many balls into your mouth as you can! HAZAH!
