I love this place.  I really do.  The omelettes are great,  along with the french toast.  They serve Le Bus (right?) and it makes everything taste better.  Good cup of coffee, free refills (which is good- cups are a bit small) and good iced tea.  Love the fries!  I also have had great salads and great specials from the board.  Food is delish, overall. I can't give 5 stars because I have never had an overly positive experience with the waitstaff.  Always seem so busy and preoccupied, which is usually annoying.  I've learned to not expect much from the service.  I've had better service at their 9th and Christian location.  ALSO, and I think this is a serious gripe- I hate their seats.  The booths are so small for 4 people, and the tabletops fit very little. Oh, and at least in my experience, I have never gotten a straight answer about breakfast.  Some servers allow me to order breakfast for dinner, while others do not.  Don't know if it's a personal thing or what..
