This place is right by the theaters so it's packed as people fill up the place before going off to a show.  We went with no reservations, but we only had to wait about 10 minutes even though they said 30 minutes.  It seemed like we got there just as groups were starting to leave but as soon as we were seated the place got packed again.  It took us longer to get a cab to get there than it did to be seated.   I had the unlimited pasta that came with a choice of salad or antipasto.  The antipasto was excellent, the gnocchi was uninspiring, the spaghetti with marinara was good, and the other pasta with bacon and cabbage tossed in olive oil was my favorite.  A waiter comes around with a pan full of pasta and you tell him you want or you don't.  Someone at the next table had ossobuco and it looked good enough for me to want to try it the next time. Overall, service was excellent and prices are reasonable.
