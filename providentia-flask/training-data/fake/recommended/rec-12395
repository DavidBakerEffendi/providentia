I'm sorry, I just hate it when "popular" restaurants think they have the right to be rude. And stop using technology if you can't handle it. They supposedly have this system where you put your name on the list and they text you when the table is ready. We were told that the wait will be around 45 min and we went to run some errands. 25 min later I got the text that the table is ready and I should go see the hostess. So we hurry back, park our bikes and all that then was told that just kidding, they just texted everyone because the iPad died. Umm... You guys don't charge that iPad?? And also where is the sense in basically lying and not showing a bit of remorse. I wouldn't be making this much of a big deal if I was seated 15 min, 25 min, or even 30 min after that text. It has been ONE HOUR since we got that text. I'm typing this as I still wait outside.
