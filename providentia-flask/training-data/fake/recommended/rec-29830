Really good menu - nice balance between sweet and savory options - and such a nice change from everything else in town. The BLT crepe is amazing.  Really, really good bacon.  Can't wait to go back and try more of the menu.   Make sure to get there early or in between meal times as it's quite crowded! (Before you go: Might be wrong, but I think it's a $10 min for credit cards.)
