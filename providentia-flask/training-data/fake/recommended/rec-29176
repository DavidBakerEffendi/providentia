I never been to Dalessandro's but I have heard so much about it. I was born and raised in South Phila. and now live in New Jersey . A friend of mine who lives near this place brought me a cheeseteak from there and I have to tell you it was amazing!!!!!  By far the best I have ever had!!!!  Someday I hope to make it there.
