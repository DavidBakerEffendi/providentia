This is my second time in New York, and the city hasn't let down. My dining experience at The Strand Bistro was nothing short of fantastic. The service was friendly and attentive, but not overbearing. Plates were cleared in a timely manner and our server was incredibly knowledgeable. As for the food...oh my lord, the food. The melon and prosciutto, panko crusted Mac and cheese, and tuna tartare were all fantastic first courses, but what absolutely grabbed me was the chilled corn soup with tomato ice. The tomato ice was quite possibly one of the most amazing components of a dish I have ever had. When you come here, you HAVE to order it! For the main course we had the pork chop-it was cooked perfectly and incredibly juicy. Served with grilled peaches and saut√©ed spinach-perfection! As for dessert, we literally tried everything. The show stopper is hands down the crepe cake. To be fair, I'm a crepe whore. I love anything with crepes. Light flavors and the perfect amount of sweetness. A great ending to a perfect night. Chef Kelvin has high standards and it shows through every one of the dishes. I can't wait to come back and try the next restaurant he is moving to!
