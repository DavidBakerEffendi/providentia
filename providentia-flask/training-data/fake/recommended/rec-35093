We are from Portland so we have a lot of little spot just like this . So it was nice to find something to give us a feeling of home from so far away . It was the hospitality that we experienced here that made it great. The owner was so nice and welcoming and even talked with us for a bit since we were Â traveling and gave us some ideas on where to go and what to do. The food was good. Not amazing but it was good! It filled our bellies and make us happy. I got the breakfast burrito and it was yummy ! Everything tasted fresh And my husband got thE pancakes which were the winner here , they tasted like home .... Pancakes your mom makes for you early on a Sunday morning . It's too bad we won't be here for Sunday brunch to try the biscuits. We will just have to come back to NYC .
