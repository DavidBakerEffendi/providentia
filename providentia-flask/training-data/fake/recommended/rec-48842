When experiencing rude service from another thai place on the UWS, yelp led me to Up Thai as an alternate and boy am I happy it did. 6 of us dined in on a Sunday for a late lunch (2:45-3p). There were only a few other patrons in the restaurant so we were seating very fast. We were shocked to see a lunch special menu on the weekend! It was amazing - $9 for a salad or soup, appetizer AND an entree! It doesn't get any better than that (especially on a weekend!). Between the 5 of us we tried the chicken pad thai, pineapple fried rice, thai fried rice and a curry dish. All of them were spot on. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great. It's incredibly clean and a great size. The bathroom is unisex, but again very clean. The entrance is a ramp, not stairs, so that is great for people with strollers or wheel chairs. All in all delicious food, friendly service & gives off a great vibe! With living in Brooklyn, it's unfortunately not that close to me, but if I am ever up this way again and in need of some food, this would certainly be my first choice!
