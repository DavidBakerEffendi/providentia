Delicious! Never had Indian food as a wrap, but it's really good. We had the chicken and shrimp, spices and flavors are so good. Has just a hint of heat, nothing too spicy. Would give 5 stars for the food alone, took off some just because they weren't paying attention and made two of our three wraps so we had to wait a bit. Also, the mango lassi is really good.
