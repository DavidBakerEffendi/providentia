Went to Extra Virgin last night for dinner with my family. Although we had to wait quite awhile for dinner (over an hour on a Saturday night) it was actually worth it. Once our food arrived we all said the same thing - we were so glad we waited. We had the lemon crusted sea bass, the muchroom crusted chicken, and the tuna. We also had a side of fries and the broccolini. Everything was delicious (we all had a bite of everything!) and we all agreed that if we came back we wouldn't know how to order. The portion sizes are generous, the service was attentive, and the wine selection was also reasonable. The restaurant is very dark and a tiny bit loud so every diner may not love it but was perfect for us. I eat out a lot (am just getting into Yelp though!) and this was one of the best restaurants I've been to in awhile. I already can't wait to go back. For dessert we ordered the peanut butter brownie sundae and the warm apple tart. Our server brought us a flourless chocolate cake, courtesy of the chef, because she had heard us raving about how delicious our meal was. How great is that! This place really impressed me and is truly deserving of 5 stars.
