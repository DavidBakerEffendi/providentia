I had ordered for delivery and the estimated wait was about 45 minutes to 1 hr. After the wait had surpassed the 1 hr mark, i called the restaurant and a woman told me that the food was out and on its way to my apt. 30 more minutes pass and I call the restaurant again. A male answers the phone and tells me that the food is still on its way. Keep in mind now that i've waited for almost 3 hours now. i get a call from the same male that i had spoken to and he tells me that the food never left the restaurant and they had lost my order. it's one thing to wait a long time for food, but it's another to be lied to on separate occasions. i could have ordered food elsewhere, but i WAITED because i was being told that my food was out twice. I've never been so angered before in my history of having food delivered to my place. The service from Chop Chop Grub Shop was completely unacceptable. i plan to write a rant to food blogs and articles about my experience as I've never quite experienced something as daunting as this before. Oh and note, the male i had spoken to. His solution was, "We don't know where your food is, but give me your name and number and we can give you a discount the next time you order." All i could say was, "Wow. You have the audacity to tell me that?"
