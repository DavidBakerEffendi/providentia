The food is excellent! Â Now that I have mentioned that .. Let me get to the heart of my review. I witnessed the line cook wearing latex gloves. He patted another employee who was leaveing for the day on the back(no disposal of the gloves)...He stepped away to retrieve more products from the storage area off to the side.(no disposal of the gloves) He puts away the products along the line.. (No disposal of the gloves) Returns to the line and handles food.. (No disposal of the gloves).. Cleans his working area and wipes his hands on several rags around his waist. (NO DISPOSAL OF THE GLOVES).. The whole purpose of wearing disposable latex gloves is to minimize cross contamination of germs etc.. After you handle food.. dispose of the gloves. His hands may be clean but the gloves have touched everything in sight and need to be removed.....Retrain the staff.
