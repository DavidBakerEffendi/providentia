My companion and I went here after reading good reviews. The first thing we noticed was the crowded feel of the main dining room. The tables are really close together, which makes the place very loud when busy and brings wait staff basically in your face as they pass by (granted, however, it was 8:00 on a Saturday night), so this probably wasn't the best place to come for a quiet night out. That being said, the food was decent but overpriced for what it was. I got the salmon, which was oily and over-spiced, and the grilled vegetables that accompanied the dish were burnt. My companion, to be safe, tried the chicken parm (since you wouldn't expect a highly-rated Italian place to be able to screw something like that up), which was bland with a tomato sauce you'd expect from someplace like Applebee's. Yes, it was busy, but our server was never around and it took her 20 minutes to give us our bill and finally return with the signature slip. There's much better Italian food elsewhere in the city for the same price. Perhaps we had a bad experience, but my impression is that this place is popular not because the food is actually good but because it's trendy and in a good location.
