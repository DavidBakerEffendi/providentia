Holy God. This is the best food I've ever had. (Also this is how I broke a liquid diet of three weeks. It was heaven.) We called them at 10 after another reservation forgot our reservation, got a reservation for 10:30, *which is when they close the kitchen* and then they kept the kitchen open for us to get our food. The atmosphere is beautiful and subtle. Dim lighting, huge flower arrangements, wide expanses of white, huge cantilevered lights. We ran into a beautiful friend of ours who we had lost touch with. I don't know what all we ate. There was taking pictures of food, and we are really not that type of diners. There was white chocolate with basil and yuzu. There was salmon with chili sauce. There were other things. I don't know. This might not be a detailed review, but the amazingness might be conveyed by my helplessness.
