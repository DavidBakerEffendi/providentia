I visited this restaurant last month with a group of friends whom I have not seen for a while.  We wanted to experience a different restaurant instead of the usual one in my neighborhood.  My friends suggested a restaurant uptown.  We went to Up Thai which did not disappoint.  The prices are reasonable and the food is fabulous, even the desserts!  My friends know I have a sweet tooth!  And they were right! You really have to go to experience what I experienced.  Enjoy!
