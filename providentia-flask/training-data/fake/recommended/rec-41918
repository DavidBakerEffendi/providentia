Brought my friend for Sunday brunch.  I had the quiche and she had eggs and bacon with toast.  Both of us ordered coffee.  Coffee is bitter and super strong, even with half a cup of cream: if you're a Starbucks bitter blend type, no problem. For the rest of us who might light a smoother blend, beware.  Someone said it was LaColombe brand but I'm sure they have variety so who knows.   Her orange juice arrived as well, I had asked for water, waited a while. No big deal, it was busy.  Food arrived, my friend was surprised there was only one slice of toast. She asked the waiter, he said, that was standard. She wasn't too happy as she usually makes a sandwich out of her eggs. My quiche was preformed and microwaved. Not really creamy or even fresh. I make good quiche and it's not too hard. This was obviously store bought frozen.  A few pieces of garnish on the side and I was still hungry after. Had no problem with server staff, friendly, helpful and responsive on a busy day.  Service was good.  Food was disappointing...this place has such a great location, perhaps a makeover in the kitchen is due.  Take it up a notch.  If you offer it, the customers will come!
