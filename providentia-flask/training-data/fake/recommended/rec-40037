Somewhat cramped and slightly claustrophobic, this bar is what Cheers would have been if it wasn't lame and was gay.  Oh, and in New Haven... While during the cold months the bar is a little tame I've had some good times during the summer months.  I have one fond memory of rock-star like partying in the back patio.  Since those days are mostly over now 168 will have a place in my heart always. Yes, it's true the clientele leans toward the older side but they're all typically nice people (there are some off-the-hook weirdos, but where aren't there?) and often make great conversation. I'm looking forward to a summer visit and hopefully to another rock-star moment.
