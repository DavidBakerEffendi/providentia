My fianc√© and I have been going to this place for years and we love it! They have always been consistent and the food is always fresh and delicious. The staff is also very friendly! Try the seafood salad, it's light with plenty of seafood! The gyros are a given...I've never had a better gyro! They also have a braised lamb with orzo dish that is my Aunt's personal favorite (she gets the same thing every time). Last but not least, they are a BYOB restaurant (that's always a plus)!!
