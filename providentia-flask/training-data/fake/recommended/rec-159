Nice ambiance for a Chinese restaurant -- which really serves as a point of distinction from its neighboring Great Wall competitor. The food is OK, really not good enough to justify the price bump. Worst of all, the serving time can take forever. Many people come here for the noodles, which probably have the highest profit margins. I taste a lot of sodium and MSG in their noodle soups, so bottom line is I probably won't be back.
