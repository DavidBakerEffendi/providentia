You get about three pounds of food for six dollars. I got the mix platter and my friend got the Falafel Sandwich. Falafel was only ok but the mix gyro and chicken was pretty amazing. That said, after a while you're pretty much digging at a box full of rice. If I was drunk I'd have given it five stars but I wasn't. I don't know if it's the best Halal Cart in Manhattan but it's pretty damn good. Their line does move much faster than one would expect. A good quick pit stop after coming out of MoMa.
