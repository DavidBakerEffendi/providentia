This was an outstanding experience. Our server was extremely professional, knowledgable about the food and drinks available, and suggested multiple items that really capitalized on our group's dining experience. We were a party of 5 and had a fantastic meal of 3 pizzas to share: Margherita Pizza: Outstanding! But a little light on cheese (not necessarily a bad thing). Bianca: was awesome! Balsamic Vinaigrette soaked into the crust. Can't remember the last pizza, but I promise it was great! Not terribly expensive for how classy it is! Also, try the long trail exclusive called Quattro. Amazing beer!
