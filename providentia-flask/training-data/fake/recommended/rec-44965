Took the lovely GF on a wonderful date here while I was visiting the city.  Had a 5:00 reservation that I made several weeks in advance, and as we rolled in other couples started piling in.   Something I noticed that is worth mentioning:  A ton of people were stopping by the street corner and taking photos.  Literally everyone who passed by that was holding a camera or had a camera phone took pictures.  I later went out there myself and took a photo and the GF pointed out that it's apparently a famous shot from Friends ?  I didn't recognize it but thats a nice special touch! We started with the meatball sliders.  Ok I am from out of town so I rely heavily on reviews when choosing a restaurant like this.  WTF guys, the sliders kind of suck.  I mean they are good for what they are but to call them Excellent and Life Changing is very misleading.  If you had one last meal in your life, don't get the meatball sliders.  Your life will end in failure. However, what I did TRULY enjoy was the Pork Chop.  That beast was enormous, and Delicious.  It was very very well cooked, juicy and flavorful.  We also had the calamari appetizer, it was completely different from the fried calamari that you generally see in restaurants.  It was a very healthy  cooked calamari with some sort of citrus dressing sauce.  I have a terrible memory so don't take my word for it, but the calamari was delicious. But seriously ppl, whats the deal with the sliders ?  I really don't think they are that good...
