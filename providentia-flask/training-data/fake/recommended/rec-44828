This was the best lunch I've ever had and incredible service! My friend and I had the slider meatballs(incredible) corn soup, summer vegetables and kale. The gelato was delicious and our waitress Tiffany was superb. She suggested perfect wine with our meal and was very helpful helping us chose our meals. First time there and will certainly go back! Wooooo Loves you??? We do. Danielle and Leeann
