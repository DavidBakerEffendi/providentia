In the mood for tapas? Tia Pol is a small, casual place for some tapas and wine. The menu is not that extensive, but of the dishes that my friend and I ordered, the food was good. My recommendations are the patata bravas, the bread with tomato sauce and salsa, and shrimp in garlic oil. They were all hot off the stove and delicious! I'd probably pass on the octopus salad. As a someone who appreciates good octopus, the salad was disappointing as the texture lacked Â freshness. The meal was enjoyable overall, but the space and seating are bit tight without hooks or chair backs to hang coats and jackets so travel lightly.
