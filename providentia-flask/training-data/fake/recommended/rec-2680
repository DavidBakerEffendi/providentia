There's only been two times in my life that I ate a meal in near silence because it was so good. Halal Guys is one of them (the other was a pretty amazing burger...carnivore tendencies). My bf and I stopped off at 53rd and 6th for the combination with rice (chicken and gyro), and sat down to inhale the food. Or at least pretty darn close to inhaling food. Mygoodness. It was delicious. Piping hot, tender chicken and lamb gyro smothered in white and spicy red sauce atop marigold colored rice. That first bite and the following 10-15 minutes were absolute bliss. So. Good. And for $6? Amazing.
