Have you ever had sweet plantains in your omlet?  I hadn't, until this morning.  Most amazing breakfast.  Two of us shared the corn (two huge pieces, more than enough for 2 of us), I got the plantain and green salsa omlet (salsa was on the side) which came with yummy buttery tasting potato (homefries?).  My friend got the juevos rancheros which she also really liked.  Super yummy, quick and not too pricey.
