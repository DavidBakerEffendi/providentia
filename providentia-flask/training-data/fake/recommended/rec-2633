Fantastic food -- have tried the falafel burger and the avocado BLT, both of which have been amazing. I am gluten intolerant and was amazed to hear they have both gluten-free bread / buns available (although you have to pay a bit extra). Service is warm and friendly, and the place has a great neighborhood-type atmosphere. They seem to be going for more of a cafe-style ambiance, which is fine, but I almost wish they could transform the place into more of a restaurant, with expanded (and more comfortable!) seating.
