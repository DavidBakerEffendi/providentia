Lovely decor in that industrial vibe that is the new standard. This would make a lovely date spot. The food was yummy though the price point is a bit high in my opinion. The food was fresh and spot on in terms of seasoning. I had the lamb belly that was delectable-it was fatty, crispy and served on some interesting paste made of lentils. I then had the bass which was super fresh and had some lovely vegetables (fava beans and some other veggies). I love carbohydrates and felt deprived with the vegetables that came with the bass so I ordered the truffle fries which were delicious though pricey. ( Â I would come back for the burger just to have those fries!) My dinner mate had the venision which was lovely and I am not always a fan of game meat-especially when its pretty rare. But the venison was good!!! Didnt have any dessert because they didnt have anything gluten free or dairy free. But all in all I was pleased with my meal and would definitely go again.
