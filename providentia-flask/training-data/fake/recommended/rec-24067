First of all, I am a huge fan of local cafes and privately owned restaurants. And if you are too, this place is PERFECT. The setting is modern with a touch of a nature, making it a pretty casual place (no need for fancy for breakfast!). My entire meal and my friends' meals were all fantastic, but I don't think any of us finished because the portions are so big. If you go, I recommend the raspberry chocolate truffle lattes, they were so good we got them to go too!
