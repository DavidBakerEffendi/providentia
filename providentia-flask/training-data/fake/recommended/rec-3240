Absolutely amazing! We had a party of 10 and we had our own private room. The food was fabulous. First off the bread was a fresh baked sourdough and we had 3 rounds of it. It was the best bread I ever ate. Â The lobster bisque soup was amazing and dipping the bread in was the icing on the cake! I had the scallop dinner which was so wonderful. My friends had the filet and it was to die for!! The sides are extra but they are big enough to share 2 or 3 people. I shared lobster mashed potatoes and let me say I could eat that everyday! It was pricey however it was so worth it!
