Don't get me wrong, still my favorite place, but a tad inconsistent (the gnocchi I got awhile back did not compare to the first time I went to this place.  And I can usually handle rude waiters if the food is really good, but these guys are really rude.  Like laugh in your face, forget to take your order, scoff when you miss pronounce something rude.
