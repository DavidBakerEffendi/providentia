Upon moving to New York from Tennessee, I gave up on finding a good biscuit in the North. It's like finding a good taco outside of California, it just doesn't happen. But low and behold, Home Sweet Harlem makes me forget the city streets, confusing subway maps and 24 hr bodegas. Â For breakfast, I'm back home.
