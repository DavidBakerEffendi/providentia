Food: Pretty good. Mushroom soup is good on a cold day. Panko crusted tilapia was a bit undersalted, but good seasoning in the white wine sauce, greens, and rice that accompanied it. Banana bread pudding was also quite good. Atmosphere: Cozy and clean. Good date spot. But also good for a small group of friends. Service: Courteous. Perfect amount of attention. My teacup was refilled several times without my having to ask.
