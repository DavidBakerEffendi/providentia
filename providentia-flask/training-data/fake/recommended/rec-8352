A wonderful little place near the south end of Prospect Park, with only 6 or 7 tables.  The papadams with sauces served as a prelude were excellent, as were a mushroom curry and a korma curry.  The chicken tikka masala was good.   A very tasty complimentary dessert was served at the end.  Service was very responsive.  All in all, an excellent dining venue, and they also deliver.
