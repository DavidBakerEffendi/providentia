We stopped here on a recommendation by the desk clerk at a nearby hotel. We were told that the food is prepared fresh and from local ingredients. We found the atmosphere to be casual and comfortable, but a little dark. I had to use the table candle to read the menu. Our waitress was very pleasant and knowledgable. Our group ordered several different items, including crab cakes, scallops, and the chicken piccata. We found the scallops and the chicken to be very good. The crab cakes, on the other hand were disappointing. Maybe it's because we live close to Baltimore and are used to a real Maryland crab cake but the ratio of filler to crab meat wasn't appealing. Over all, it was a pretty good meal.
