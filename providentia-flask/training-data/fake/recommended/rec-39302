A really great place pretty much in every respect. Absolute top quality ingredients prepared perfectly. I had the squid appetizer and the Amish veal chop. Both fabulous. The chef has a light hand and makes the main ingredient the star of the dish. If you like a bucket of heavy sauce on everything this is not the place for you. This probably accounts for some of the bad reviews from folks expecting typical Italian with sauce and cheese on everything. A grabbed a taste of my wife's duck and again just top quality prepared to let the taste of the duck shine. I got more of a country French vibe from the food than Italian. Â My kind of place and I certainly understand what they are going for. I would stick to a light bodied red wine a big Barolo would be to much. I chose a nice light Italian red and at $95 was pretty well priced for NYC. A lot of selections in wine between $50 and $100.
