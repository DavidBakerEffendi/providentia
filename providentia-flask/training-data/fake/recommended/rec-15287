Eh! This spot was recommended by a tour guide. This place is way overrated & way over priced! We were not impressed at all (this includes my 9 y/o son). I had a chicken/cheese sub which was dry & tasteless. According to my son the cheesesteak subs were dry as well. Our go to place is Gino's but we were too far from it (we were visiting on a school trip). We've even driven from Maryland to go to Gino's (& of course to visit other places). That's the place to eat a real Philly Steak Sub! This is just MY opinion! so thanks for respecting it :)
