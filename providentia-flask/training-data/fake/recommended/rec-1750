i have only gone here once and i can still remember the sausages. it is family style but that means that you have to bring a family, hahah. the food are delicious, but its hard to finish if you have less then 4 people i think we ordered angel hair, the chicken and the sausages, there was 4 of us and we couldn't finish it, and its hard to doggie bag anything if you going to a show afterwards
