Found this truck outside my office at the corner of Water St and Old Slip by accident. Boy, I was glad I did! I ordered the Lemon Chicken Brochette and for $7 I didn't expect it to be a footlong size sandwich. Thought I might have to save half for later. But when I took the first bite of that sandwich with juicy chicken in the spicy sauces, I couldn't resist but finish the whole thing. After my delicious experience, I read all the wonderful reviews on Yelp. I am definitely Â trying Lemon Chicken over rice next time.
