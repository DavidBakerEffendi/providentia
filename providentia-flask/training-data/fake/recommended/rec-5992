This joint would be my second choice if Nam Phuong next door is super duper packed. I usually get the rice plates here, simple and quick.  Vegetarian options here are weaker than next door, but I give props for even offering. Ooh, mixed drinks here rock - the taro milk shake is sweet, but let it melt a bit and its deeelicious!  Yellow mung bean rocks as well!   Im chicken butt, too scared to try durian.... Tons of dudes love this place - it used to be a coffee/beer drinking, chain smokin, eat like a bird joint for MEN....until..you know..that little law now where you cant light up inside...
