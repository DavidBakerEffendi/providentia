I love the no-electronics policy! It really brings something to this shop that is hard to find elsewhere nowadays. While I've only visited a couple of times, my coffee and croissants have been marvelous -- simply nothing for me to complain about! The $10 card limit is inconvenient, yes, but very understandable and nothing to really complain about. The place is always clean (and wonderfully lit from the big windows!), and you will find plenty of papers lying around for reading material. There is a lovely community-driven ambiance here, much like at many of the shops in East Rock. The service is great, and I feel like a welcomed guest each time I walk up to the counter. I still have yet to try almost all of the menu...there was a hummus sandwich on the board that caught my eye... I always get a small, black, Lulu blend, but I think I will have to try their French roast next time because I recently visited with a friend and he said it was a very good cup. I regret not visiting here sooner after I moved to New Haven...if you live in the area, GO.
