Stopped in yesterday for a quick dinner. My boyfriend and I shared the noodles with peanut sauce. It was a salty peanut sauce. Very good but I had expected a slightly sweeter sauce. I had the vegetable noodles. They were awesome. The noodles are so long and light. A very different texture than what you'd find at a Chinese restaurant that doesn't make their own noodles. There wasn't too much flavor to the dish but it was nice to just enjoy the noodles. There was a large portion and I took about half home. My boyfriend had the fish ball noodle soup and said it was great. A huge bowl that he could only finish half of. He got a bottled iced tea lightly sweetened and flavored with jasmine and I had a Thai milk bubble tea. Both were great. All this food and drink for just under $24! What a deal! I only wish they had more vegetarian options or a tofu noodle dish.
