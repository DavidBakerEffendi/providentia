One of Steven Starr's intentionally super trendy joints but probably one of the more affordable.  FYI, the high menu prices at don't translate to living wage pay or health benefits for his full time employees. The fries plate is monstrous and highly addictive and the vodka flights make this the only place I've ever ordered vodka.  They also have a great cocktail called the Buzz Aldrin or something similar with a Tang rimmer.  The retro airline styling of the menus is also a lot of fun if you ever grow weary of lists written in italics or script fonts.
