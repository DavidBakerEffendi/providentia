My birthday buddy & I had a pretty low-key, hang out with our bestest buddies wine-bar birthday celebration. We requested the lounge space with red velvet ottoman chairs, candles & coffee tabled area for a group of 25 ish people. The ambiance was cute, the slate walls with food/wines were a nice touch, the candles, separation of bar space & lounge space and waitstaff were all fantastic! Foods: - NY Pretzel with cheese sauce & mustard: good! - Flank steak with a parsley pesto with arugula salad was scrumptious. -- a small portion for the $$ but perfectly Wines: Sancere: crisp Framboise Beer- SO GOOD!
