Unimpressed.  Never had a good meal here - everything I've eaten has always seemed cheap and quickly prepared without any thought.  Oh, wait, I did once have a good lunch - the kitchen sink salad.  But it was a salad.  Tough to screw up? Monkfish with full on vertebrae included in the cut of fish, overcooked salmon, undercooked desserts...  Really, not a fan.  With so many other options in Hartford, I'm not sure why this place would be at the top of any list.
