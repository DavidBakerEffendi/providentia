What a hidden gem this BYOB is. I have been there 4 times now and every time has been excellent. My party was greeted by a friendly hostess and sat immediately. The dining room is beautifully decorated. The table settings are unique from other restaurants. Our waiter was very attentive and provided us with excellent professional service every time we have been there. The food is spectacular. Last night I had zucchini flower appetizer with a baby zucchini attached with fresh mozzarella, slice of local peach and drizzled with honey. We also had mouth watering baby artichokes, stuffed with goat cheese and chorizo. For dinner my wife had the scallops that were cooked perfectly and I had the red snapper special over exotic mushrooms. It was amazing. For desert I had a banana filled crepe with chocolate sauce and fresh whipped cream and my wife had their famous bread pudding. The whole thing was like an exotic culinary dance.  All the ingredients and garnish were definitely carefully selected. Chef Todd was very attentive and made his rounds through the dining rooms. All in all this place is a 6 Star restaurant. Oh I forgot they have a beautiful outdoor terrace for dining too. They grow fresh herbs and some vegetables  on these very interesting wall gardens. This is a must go restaurant in NJ. No need to go to Manhattan!
