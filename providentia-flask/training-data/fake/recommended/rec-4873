Tried to eat here two times and turned away without reservations.  Third time, a weekday, was the charm.   Had the arancini to start - delicious.   For my main course, a special; tuna with diced red pepper and spinach over rigatoni with olive oil, lemon and garlic.  It was light and delicious.     I also tried the gnocchi and I'm getting those next time.   They were unlike any gnocchi I've ever had - melt in your mouth. For dessert we shared the rice pudding with nuts and fruit - it was perfect.  Also, a dark chocolate torte with orange tarragon sauce - yum.   Thought the wait staff was pleasant and loved the atmosphere and the space.     I would recommend Ulivo.
