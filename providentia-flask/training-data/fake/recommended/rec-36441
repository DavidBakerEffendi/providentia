MmmmM MmmmM MmmmM! It claims to be the first pizza spot in the states. I couldn't care less about its history. The only thing that matters to me is how amazingly awesome their thin crust pizza is. Reasonably priced and delicious! Â The location is a lot larger than it looks like from the outside. There is a bit of a wait but nothing too terrible. Should definitely be a stop on every NY trip.
