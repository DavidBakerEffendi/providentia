Delicious food and cute place.   I had the bacon wrapped trout that came with grits recently.  A few months ago, i had the duck meatloaf and man, and i have to say that was one of the most delicious things i've eaten (yes, it made the list!). i like court street because it feels mellow...there are a couple good places around (like minibar has a nice selection of beers and a great happy hour 5pm to 8pm).   Next up (for this area) is frankie's and that Thai place.
