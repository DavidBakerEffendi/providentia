I'm stupid when it comes to sushi. I know absolutely nothing. I know I LOVE California rolls. That being said i informed the waiter that Â our party knew nothing about the menu. He very graciously informed us of the differences between "sushi, sashimi, and maki" I ordered the Maki (california roll of course) a friend got a salmon roll, another the avocado roll and my date got the duck special... everything was amazing. The Duck was a special it had a wasabi aoli (sp?) and sat on a bed of different types of mushrooms. The Mushrooms alone were to die for. Everything tasted very fresh and our waiter went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. (water and wine refills every few minutes non intrusive and very gracious) we sat until closing while finishing our wine and they did not for even a moment make us feel rushed. Upon leaving we apologized for making him wait and his statement was "think nothing of it it was our pleasure to have you" .. wow.. hospitality? in PHILLY!? I'm hooked. The bill was $45 for 4 people all having their own meals (which were very shareable!) Overall a great bargain, and i'm told they have lunch specials that are very filling for $10-15/ person! I will definitely return and tell everyone i know. Izumi is an AWESOME find!
