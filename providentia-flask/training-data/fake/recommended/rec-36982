Everyone has mentioned the wait, and yes I've waited about 45 minutes every time I've been to DiFara, but the wait is actually a pleasure and just as essential to the total DiFara experience as the pizza is.  The slow pace at DiFara just feels right when you enter a space where time has stood still for about 35 years (take a look at the cash register) and where every pizza is meticulously and slowly handmade.  The crowd at DiFara has to be one of the most truly mixed and diverse anywhere in New York, and they're all waiting patiently just like you.  It's therapeutic to go to a place like this and not be rushed, and to leave an hour or so later with a much slower pulse and a much happier stomach.
