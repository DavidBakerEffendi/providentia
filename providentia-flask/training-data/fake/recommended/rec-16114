Um. Truffle Parmesan Gnocchi. You'll know when someone orders it because the smell wafting through the air is like the perfume of the Gods. Its so AMAZINGLY good it makes you want to slap your mama and do cartwheels around the restaurant. When I caught a sniff of it passing by me I seriously contemplated tackling the waitress and grabbing it from her in what would be the most embarassing display of food lust. I also thoroughly enjoyed the prosciutto wrapped baked mozzarella and was astonished that they made sauteed spinach an outerworldly experience, but don't even get me started on the papardelle with bolgnase...it was toe curling. Service was top notch, the wine list superb, but I dream of that gnocchi!
