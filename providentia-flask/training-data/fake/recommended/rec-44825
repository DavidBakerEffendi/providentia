First timer review: Great location, friendly staff and a quaint dining experience. Now the food: good but expected better.  It didn't have the wow factor that I was expecting. Appetizers: summer vegetables and sliders- both very good. We left nothing on those plates! Main course:  I ordered the salmon with cabbage which was cooked perfectly but tasted a bit bland. Maybe that's what I get for going healthy! Boyfriend ordered the pork chop which he summed up in word word as "succulent".  The pork chop lived up to its hype. My tip: treat yourself and go for something hearty! I'll try the lamb chop on our next visit.
