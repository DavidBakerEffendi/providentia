You will die when you eat their biscuits and gravy. I did, and this is my ghost writing the review. The gravy was by far the most unique, delicious gravy I've ever had. The mimosas were lovely and served in cute mason jars. Staff was incredibly friendly and kept our drinks full and made sure we were well attended. My friends and I all had omelettes, which were fresh with fluffy eggs and crisp veggies. Each table has a lovely farm feel with fresh flowers and warm tones. Great brunch spot!
