This is one of the first coffee shops I ever visited in Philadelphia and I wasn't terribly impressed at the time.  Now that I live nearby and walk by them every day to and from work I have stopped in several more time and been just as disappointed as the first.  It's cute.  The staff isn't exactly unfriendly, but I've never had a lot of warmth and you can wind up waiting a long time even without anyone in line in front of you.  They don't volunteer information about their products, and forget things like giving you a lid for your to go drink so that you have to stand there and ask for one (and sometimes it takes a while to get the attention of the one staff person even though they literally just gave you your drink). Their espresso is way too expensive for the mediocre quality and the milk is always over steamed.  I would try their food more, except it's way too expensive.  I just can't afford it and the only time I did get a sandwich I actually thought it was pretty bad.  Kind of slimy lunchmeat and bland everything else.  The last time I stopped in just for a cup of coffee to escape the cold and wound up once again feeling like it was over priced and poor quality.  On top of all that it somehow manages to usually be annoying crowded. I give two starts instead of one because I do still sometimes go here out of sheer convenience, but if it was out of my way out all I never would.
