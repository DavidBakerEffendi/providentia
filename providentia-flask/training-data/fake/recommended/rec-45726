Great food! I had the Bahn mi burger (a burger with an "Asian" flavour): delicious. The meat especially, is very tasty. Only cons: we had to wait a little bit more than normal even if there were only a few clients. But nothing serious. Plus: wifi free access and very good fries (not heavy, just perfect).
