I'm gonna keep this short Pros: great ambiance, cheap drinks, delicious waffles, GREAT music! Cons: a little cramped, long wait (but is was Friday night *shrug), annoying host, bland chicken. I had the chicken & waffles, loved the waffles and spinach, the chicken was OK, not bad but a bit bland.  Overall, the place didn't live up to the hype, but not bad at all.  I'd def go back.
