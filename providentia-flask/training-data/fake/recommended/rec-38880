Best iced coffee I've had in the city, its smooth and delicious and they add espresso which prevents the dilution that usually results in a watery drink after a few minutes in the heat. The hot coffee is also some of the best in the area. Although Talula's also brews La Colombe, Walnut Cafe somehow makes it much much better. My go-to caffeine fix without any pretention whatsoever!
