This really is one of my favorite places to wander into when I come back to New Haven ever since my first visit probably about a decade ago. I'd never gotten meals here, however, until recently--and wow, have I been missing out! First of all, I can't recommend the breakfast I had highly enough. I had the cranberry pecan french toast with cream cheese and fresh berries--absolutely incredible. I loved that they did not skimp on the berries--enough for each slice of french toast (three total). It was absolutely delicious! I've also tried the grilled artichoke sandwich and the roasted pear salad--both also very delicious and very filling. The hot chocolate is pretty good. As other reviewers have mentioned, Atticus has an excellent selection of cute, quirky, and otherwise unique cards and journals. One of my favorite things to do is to browse through the variety. The one complaint that I have is that one of the clerks who occasionally works at the register for books/cards purchases has crept up and surprised me to ask if I'm finding everything okay, although in a way that makes me feel like she's checking up on me. I haven't seen her do this to other customers, although I could be wrong--it does make me feel a bit unwelcome to browse through books and cards for long periods of time. If I'm there too often, it's just because I love the place so much, so please don't scare me away!
