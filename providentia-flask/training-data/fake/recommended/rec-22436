Cute local bar, typical Tribeca. I like this feeling when you can recognize where you are. It's across the street from one of my favorite galleries, Soho Photo Gallery. It was a pleasure to sit down with my friends late at night at the bar, very casually and laid back. The bartender is cool and friendly, good to talk to. Nice place.
