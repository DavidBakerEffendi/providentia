Want to try this place out? DO IT. I've lived here alk ny life and ishkabibbles is the best place for cheesesteaks.. the put alot of meat and cheese which is amazingggg.. the fries are beyond delicious!  Its so crunchy and has the right amount of saltiness to it.. Usually I order on the outside.. but if you're lucky you'll get seats inside... its seriously super small... theres about 6-8 chairs..  I dont mind though On the walls, its filled with celebrity appearances, pretty awesome if you asked me.. ive been craving for their cheesesteak... I might go get some this weekend loll! I deff recommend this place for everyone...!
