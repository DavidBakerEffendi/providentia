Roasted Bone Marrow ($15) - Absolutely delicious! Packed full of flavor! Perfect! Country Fried Steak ($16) - Tender, soft, flavorful! Mac & Cheese ($9) - This one is just okay, a bit bland, we've had better Portions are decent. We were hungry when we went in. We left feeling full & satisfied. The decor is nice & comfy. We were here around 10:30pm. The bar was busy but the restaurant was empty. We were seated right away. Great service! Definitely worth stopping by!
