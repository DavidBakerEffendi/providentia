The pork XLB is dope! Its dumpling skin is soft and chewy. But the best part is the scrumptious combination of the savory soup broth with the meat inside. Be very careful picking up the dumpling since it breaks quite easily. You wouldn't want the soup to leak! The veggie dumplings are delicious as well, great choice for all the vegetarians out there. The panfried porkXLB is a bit oily, but still quite enjoyable. We also ordered one of the pork panfried noodles and a fish fillet (with black vinegar sauce) dish. Both were satisfying and I definitely recommend trying them! The tea was very soothing and cleaned my palate well. One notable thing is that the place was packed when I went, and the restaurant is not very spacious so I barely had any room within our table area. Both food and service were great! Solid four stars.
