I like this place. Good atmosphere, good crowd of people. Not really a douchey crowd the week night I went, along with some attractive ladies. I read about the $5 Lychee martini so I had to try it since I have never had one. It wasn't terrible but I didn't really care for it. Tasted kinda syrupy and bland to me.. I also tried the $5 Vietnamese Bloody mary.. That one I really did like.. Nice and spicy with some cucumbers added. I would highly recommend that. Then there is the fact that they have 3$ Yuenglings which is awesome. I Had some asian noodle dish with chicken. It was good, and reasonably priced. Place was packed on a week night. Kinda loud, but if you do get a seat its good.
