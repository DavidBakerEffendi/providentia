I made a Saturday night reservation for a special occasion and requested to be seated in the garden area, preferably next to the fireplace. I was told that they could not guarantee a table in the garden, much less in that spot, but that is exactly where we were seated. This room has to be one of the most stunning, intimate, and romantic places to dine in the city. My date kept gushing at how beautiful the space was. The restaurant was filled with flowers. It was quite loud at times with two large parties in the room, but overall a great atmosphere. The food was excellent. Two notables being the artichokes and the rock octopus. I highly recommend Salinas and I will be back.
