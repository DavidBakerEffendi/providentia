First off, the ambiance is amazing! The lighting isn't too dark (and definitely not too bright), and you're seated on ornate looking seats and pillows. The decorations make me feel like I was in a different country and made me forget the hipsters hanging out down the block on South St. The music also helps with this feeling of traveling to a different place. It's great! Next, I would have to recommend going on a weekend. The first couple of times I went it was great, but it was during the week. I finally went on a Friday night and there were awesome belly dancers. One of the belly dancers even pulled my friend and I up to the middle of the room to try to teach us to belly dance! I was in a small upstairs room so only two other parties were there to watch, so It wasn't too embarrassing. I enjoyed the interaction! The service is great as well. I felt like I was treated like a queen. However, service is better during the week since it's not as busy. The first time I went was on a Wednesday and the owner himself served us and tried to make sure everything was perfect. Regardless of what day you go, they will bathe your hands in rose water before the meal, which is pretty amazing. Lastly, I can't say enough about the food. It's a 7 course meal you share with your friends. You'll be eating off the same plate, which makes it more intimate and a great bonding experience. Overall the 7 courses are amazing. The chicken is so tender it falls right off the bone. The beginning salads are simply amazing with the pita bread they supply. The desert baklava is the best I've ever had, and it comes with great mint tea to wash it down. I will admit, I'm not too fond of the second dish, but that's because I don't think eggs and powdered sugar really go together. Otherwise, it's all amazing. It's also BYOB so I suggest bringing some wine with you:) I have to say this is probably my favorite restaurant in Philly and I recommend it most highly.
