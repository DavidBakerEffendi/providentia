Update: New tofu bahn mi!  I walked home from work on Saturday and was surprised to see them open and because there was a sign on the sidewalk about tofu bahn mi, I had to check it out as part of my vegetarian-in-residence duties. The tofu bahn mi was really, really, good.  A word about their bahn mi.  It wasn't exactly like one you would get from a Vietnamese sandwich shop.  There was a house made spicy mayo, pickled cabbage (which really pulled it together), cilantro, shredded carrot, marinated tofu, jalapenos, pickled cucumber.   I don't think I missed anything there.   I grew up in a city with Vietnamese food on every block so I feel pretty confident in this assessment, not exactly the same- BUT it was a damn good sandwich and I would call it a bahn mi.  I planned on eating half.  Then just one bite of the second half.  Then half way to the half.  Then it was gone.  I was stuffed.  It was spicy and so flavorful.  I want another one right now. Also, apparently they are open on Saturdays now (not sure when they open but it was about 8:30 pm when I was there).
