I don't know why this place is called a Wine bar when clearly they are known for their bourbon and whiskey selections.... After 2 bullet and guns I was a very happy girl. I have to agree with everyone else and say this place is definitely pricey. However, I was a fan of the atmosphere as it is very inviting and good for conversation. Sampled the asparagus toast and roasted oysters. Big fan of the toast and have to agree they have some wonderful cornbread. I plan on coming back to sample their bourbon drinks and some more appetizers......but I will need to find a male friend :)
