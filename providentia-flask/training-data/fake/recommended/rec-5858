I thought the ambiance was great, the food was awesome, but the prices were very high.  Whether it was the drinks or the $49.95 for the dinner.  I did try all the meats that came around, and everything was delicious.  They would give recommendations on how the type of meat tastes best (rare, medium, etc).  My plate was never empty, until I put the RED stop card up.  There was always a steak skewer close by!   The servers were friendly, and were inconspicuous, as they would let our table have chat time, but would sneak in to cut your meat without cutting off the conversations.  Great time, but can't go too often due to the $$$.
