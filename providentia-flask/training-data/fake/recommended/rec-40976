This place is AMAZEBALLS. Period. The curry goat dish is out of this world, along with the PainKiller and Dark&Stormy Slush! We will definitely be heading here again. Great decor, wonderful staff, perfect ambiance and relaxed atmosphere, it is a Crown Heights & BedStuy staple! Especially, since they give you a complimentary scoop of their awesome coconut ice cream with the check!
