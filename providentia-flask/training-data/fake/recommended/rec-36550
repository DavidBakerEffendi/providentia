Really 4.5 stars. We (2) walked in at 9:00 on  a Friday night without a reservation.  After a brief conversation with a semi-snarky hostess, a host standing next to her said he could in fact accommodate us ... as long as we were out by 10:15, as they had a large party coming in.  (The snark was what cost them the 1/2 star). Yum!  An hour later we were full on some great wine, butternut Squash ravioli and shrimp risotto.  Balthazar is consistently a favorite.
