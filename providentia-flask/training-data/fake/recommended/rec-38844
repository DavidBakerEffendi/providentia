Ordered a calzone..simple...mozzarella cheese and ham...picked it up expecting more than what we paid for...they added ricotta cheese, and it was burnt on top. When we called to complain. ..the employee had the audacity to argue with my husband.  Rude employee, if he would've just admitted a mistake was made I would've accepted it because it does happen,  but he had to be a jerk about it...will never order from here again.
