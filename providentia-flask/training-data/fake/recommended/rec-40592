Staying at Hotel Monaco so we ate here for breakfast one morning. It was fairly empty and we were seated immediately. I loved that the waiter had fresh oj and coffee in his hands when he came up to take our order. Our food came really quick, which I guess is expected since there were only a few other parties there. The food: - red owl omelet - I ordered the omelet with bacon on the side. The omelet looked good with a nice amount of gooey melted cheddar on top. The taste was just okay, I only ate half. The boy ended up finishing the rest after his meal. The potatoes were absolutely terrible. They were mushy, cold, and had an off flavor. - egg white omelet - to me it was ok. He thought it was too oily, but finished it anyways. He ate my bacon because I don't eat meat, and loved it, but I guess you can't really screw up bacon. - bagel and cream cheese - the best part of the meal. The cream cheese was so good that I finished the entire tin on my first half and had to order another for my second... but that's usual for my fatty self. To sum, I should have just ordered the bagel and cream cheese with orange juice as those were the only things I really enjoyed. Service was good and the staff seemed friendly enough.
