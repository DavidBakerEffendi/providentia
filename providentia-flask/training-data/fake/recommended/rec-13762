If there is an option, I would give this place a 3.5 star. service- 3.5 stars wine- 4 stars atmosphere- 3 stars food- 3 stars We came here to try the RW menu but we ended up ordering a la carte because the entree choices on RW menu were rather ordinary (chicken, fish, and veggie ravioli). Our waitress was very friendly, attentive, and really knew her wine! I was very happy with her recommendation of a French dry red. spicy duck meatball- very well seasoned and spicy. The shaved parmesan on top complimented the flavor of the duck. hanger steak (medium rare)- a bit too bloody for me but the portion was generous. Too bad I couldn't finish due to its rareness. duck breasts- delicious. the crispy skin on top really brought out the meatiness and the freshness of the duck. The texture of crispiness and tenderness together was like a party in my mouth! Â  Atmosphere: elbow to elbow seating and it was hot in the restaurant. Service was fast and attentive until the waitress spilled my friend's wine. She did top it off but not nearly as much as what she spilled. We didn't order any desserts but I think I will give Perilla another try.
