Rarely have I found a place as welcoming, cozy, and sophisticated as Friday Saturday Sunday - that also serves great food! I was very happy on my last visit here, with a glass of red wine and filet mignon that really hit the spot. I could generally fill myself up with half of an appetizer and one of their small plates - but I've noticed that the "small" plates vary pretty drastically in size from one another, so it's probably better to ask than to end up leaving hungry. Their chocolate mousse cake so fantastic I would take another trip back just for that - and to check out their bar upstairs.
