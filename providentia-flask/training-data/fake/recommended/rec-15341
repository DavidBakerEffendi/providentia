The consensus on the fries are right on. Their award-winning boasts are well-warranted. They are crispy, golden delicious! The cheesesteak is good, but I'm not in love with it. It is pretty cool sitting inside and being so close to the cooking. The people behind the counter are really nice-I'd check out Jim's across the way for a cheesesteak thoogh.
