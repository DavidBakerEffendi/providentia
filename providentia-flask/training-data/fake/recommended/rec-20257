I loved it!!  I definitely have to go back when they change the menu because it's seasonal.  I had the trout with grits and I was in love.  The portions are quite large for the entrees.  I also had the house made bacon with mustard.  Unbelievable!!  I'm still thinking about it.  Service was wonderful and the coffee was great.  They use Gimme Coffee.
