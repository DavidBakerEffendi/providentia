The food is superb!! The service is great, very friendly and knowledgeable! We did the Turista for $34.00 and it was outstanding!! It has been a long time since I was able to say....from start to finish everything was delicious!! All you carb-aholics you will not be able to turn away a least 2 or more helpings of the homemade bread and the infusion of olive oil, spices and homemade ricotta in the center.....are you kidding me!! I thought I died and went to heaven. Just one more thing, I've never tasted such flavorful food in every single bite!! Please note: because I refuse to say anything negative except the noise level is pretty loud so drink some wine and all will be well.
