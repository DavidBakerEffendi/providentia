LOVE the atmosphere! We ordered chicken, beans, yellow rice, fried yuca, sweet plantains and avocado salad.Everything was fresh and delicious..fast, attentive service. Normally go to the Pio Pio on Northern Blvd in Queens. The food is just as good, but I definitely like the decor in this one better! Everyone raves about the green sauce, but I prefer the -garlic sauce-YUM!
