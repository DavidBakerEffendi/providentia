I don't go out in the UES that much, but places like The Jeffrey make me want to come uptown more often. The Jeffrey boasts a great (and rotating) craft beer selection, wines, extensive cocktail menu, coffee bar which brews Brooklyn Roasting Company, and tasty bites. Everything you need one place! The bar is in front upon entering, and there is an indoor seating area as well as an outdoor patio/beer garden. My friend and I grabbed a spot at one of the picnic tables outside. Although there isn't much of a view since the space is nestled between apartment buildings, it's still a great space to catch up with a large group or just a few people. Table service is available in the outdoor area so you do not have to continually come inside to the bar to place an order. Despite the somewhat preppy crowd, the atmosphere is super chill and laid back, and gives the impression of a downtown or Brooklyn-esque  beer garden setting.   I went around 6 pm on a Saturday, and although it wasn't too crowded I can definitely see this place filling up at a later time in the day. Prices are pretty average by NYC standards with beers ringing in from $7-$10, cocktails at $13-$15, and glasses of wine ranging from $8-$12. The Jeffrey also has a separate growler bar tasting area for brewery nights and tasting classes.
