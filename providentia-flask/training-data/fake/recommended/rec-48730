As a slight regular here their kee Mao also known as drunken mans noodles is really bursting with flavor. I always order this just because it's spicy. Their up spring rolls are also really good. The calamari is good but better with the plum sauce instead of the mayo it comes with. Today I'm tryin the white sangria. It's soo pretty. And the service is always 100% and sweet. I love it here.
