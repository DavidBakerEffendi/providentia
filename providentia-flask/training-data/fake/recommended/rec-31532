I am reviewing the tavern/bar side of Rocky Hill Inn, I have not been in the formal dining area. They have a great selection of unique beers which makes up for the less appealing decor and for the slow and somewhat aloof service. My companion and I had the famed, Rocky Hill burger and it was just was good as everyone claims. I mean, does it get better than burger, bacon, and egg all on a bun? My companion said he could eat it for breakfast! There is cheese on the burger too, but it is a fairly small amount, which I found to be perfect, I didn't want all that cheese dripping off it and messing with my bacon! Their fries are good too and I became fond of dipping them in the runny yolk from the egg. We also had the calamari appetizer which was interesting because they bread theirs with cornmeal, which gave it a dry texture, the plus side is they were not greasy. The sauce they served with the calamari was good too and I think might be even better if they just sauteed the calamari with that instead of breading it at all. The burger was less filling then I thought in that it did not leave me with that, OMG I cannot believe I ate that feeling, but I was definitely too full for dessert. Despite being less than impressed with the service, we'd go back for that burger.
