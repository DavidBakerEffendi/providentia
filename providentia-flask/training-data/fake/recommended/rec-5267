The best Indian food in the U.V.! One of the chefs told me how they make their own paneer, and even showed me around the kitchen. They know how to cook w/ real HEAT. I asked for my curry to be served "really spicy" and I was almost hallucinating...plus delicious breads, tandoori dishes, and standard dishes like malai kofte and chicken tikka masala.
