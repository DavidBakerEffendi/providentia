Each time we go up to Philly for the day we try a different place for steak sandwiches.  So far, this is our favorite.  Of course, you have the perfect bread, that's expected in Philly, but Sonny's also has the best meat.  No gristle. Just tasty goodness. And, it's walking distance from the tourist areas so that's a plus.  Prices are about $9 for a sandwich that's big enough for two or one very hungry person.  They also have really great fries, thin but not too thin.   Can't wait to go back!
