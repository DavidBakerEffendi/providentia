XLB. cheap. word Crab and pork dumplings $6.65 XLB ( Pork dumplings) $4.65 Razor clams with black bean and chilis $15 Scallion pancake- good flavor and fried just long enough to be crispy but not oily. It is a tad too thick, maybe one layer less would be ideal those crab and pork dumplings are AMAZING!!! there was a resto near my place that had them and no sooner had i found it that it closed down (i doubt joe's is going anywhere anytime soon) . both dumplings look ginormous because it comes in a big skin but i realized that the meat portion is the same. the exception is that they are super duper juicy and so naturally they need a bigger skin to encapsulate all that flavorful soupy amazingness be prepared to share a table if you have a small party. Â the waittress are somewhat rushed but the food comes out fast! Joe's is on my must visit NYC list :)
