This is based on take out -- the only bad part of the Bangkok Kitchen experience is that they wrap the food in Styrofoam containers(boo hiss) but other than that -- Fresh, delicious, amazing is the only way to describe the food we just had. my only regret is that we've lived around here for 3 years and just 'found' the place! Bangkok Kitchen is the best Thai food I've ever had -- the grilled chicken - to die for (I could taste the lemongrass!!) with a light smoky flavor it's my new favorite way to eat poultry -- the spring rolls were crunchy with the perfect zing from the dipping sauce -- the chicken wings were some of the best spicy, crunchy yummiosity ever, the sauce was very similar to the dipping sauce that came with the spring rolls - sweet with just the right kick. The pork chops my husband had were falling off the bone juicy tender bits of amazingness all their own BUT if they made the chops boneless they would be even better, if that's possible.  Even my picky seven year old was eating off our plates (after coming home from a big Italian meal w her Nana).  The next time, we are going to go to the restaurant and sit down - and we're sure the food will be even better.  If I have my way, that day will be tomorrow :)
