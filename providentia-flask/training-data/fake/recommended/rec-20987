Possibly one of the tastiest brunches I've ever had. New year's day. Not a huge wait because we got there by noon. I had the latke with brussel sprouts, blue cheese, fried egg etc etc and my heavens it was perfect. Could have been a pile of heavy mush, but everything was cooked so that the textures contrasted beautifully: crispy blackened potato edges, soft egg with a papery thing fried edge, buttery soft brussels sprouts, chunks of acidic blue cheese to cut through it all. Seriously perfect. The pancakes were fluffy and thick. The coffee was strong. the slightly flattened scone was warm, although not perhaps as light as it could be. The crepe was tasty too. All in all, stellar work, I'll be back!
