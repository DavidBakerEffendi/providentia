Absolutely Gorgeous interior. The open Terrace was the serious WOW factor- it was so classy and so unexpected! I loved the Sangria, but the older gentlemen in our group thought the ice and sweetness were overload. This is a great place to host clients for a nice dinner. You can easily hear everyone speak, but it still has a classy hip vibe. The tapas were great. The paella was dry, but good. The real star of my meal was a tapas special with roasted eggplant and fresh cheese. So so yummy. All in all a great place, worth a return visit. :)
