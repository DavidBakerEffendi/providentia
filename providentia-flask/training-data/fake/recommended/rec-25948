This place is a foodgasm. So authentic and insanely delicious. Their cheese plate was amazing, as was their beef stew. I loved that the staff was French too! Wasn't a huge fan of the brunchy decor, but it really didn't matter because I was in love with this place. Would give more than 5 stars if I could!
