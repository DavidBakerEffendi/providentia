This place is amazing though a tad bit expensive. The restaurant is beautiful - the decor is sophisticated and chic. Definitely dress up when coming here (its great for birthdays and special occasions).  The service is excellent and the waiters are very friendly. The best thing is of course the food. It is impeccable, probably the best high end middle eastern in the city. My favorite is the bone marrow - it is to die for. If you've never tried bone marrow this is the place to try it - believe me you won't regret it. I wish I could have it everyday.  Everything else is excellent too - you'll want to keep coming back to try different things on the menu.  Just a warning - most of the food is served as mezze so the portions are small. Think of it as a tapas place.
