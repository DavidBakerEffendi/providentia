Went there for lunch, a little earlier than the normal lunch crowd.  I would imagine that it could get a little packed, but the space is HUGE.  There are different stations in the back and a buffet in the middle.  I had the Chicken Teriyaki over rice with miso soup-delicious! However, I wish there was more teriyaki on my chicken...the girl put just a little swirl.  But for $8 for a meal I could barely finish, who can complain? I thought it was pretty good, especially for a buffet style place.  If you get the sushi, the fish looked really fresh-something I was not expecting.   All in all, I will come back.  Especially because the buffet/salad/appetizer bar looked amazing and FRESH (rare for a buffet in my opinion).  Great variety and they had seating!
