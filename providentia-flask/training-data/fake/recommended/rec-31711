I stopped in with friends for an after dinner drink and overall I really liked the bar.  I'll preface this terse review by telling you that I am a Manhattan connoisseur.  I have a hard time finding a bartender that can make one to my standards.  I should have asked the bartender for his name but totally forgot but I am good with faces and will certainly return for another round.
