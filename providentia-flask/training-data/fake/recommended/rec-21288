I went here in November with my boyfriend and it was a really nice experience.  He made a reservation for a Friday night and we arrived a little early.  We were offered to sit early in the dining room but we opted to wait an extra 15 minutes to sit by the windows that look out onto the East River.  They have an outdoor section right by the river so it would be great to try in the spring/summer.  While we waited, we had cocktails at the bar.  I had an amazing drink called the Roots - beet-infused vodka!  It was SO GOOD.  Try this immediately.  My boyfriend ordered a sazerac but we're both pretty sure those drinks don't come from one bottle...he drank the mystery juice anyway but it certainly was not a sazerac. The bread is amazing and they will continue bringing more if you ask for it.  We were not ashamed of asking for bread twice!  We started with the salmon tartare...it was good, nothing special really though. The roe was nice.  I had the monkfish and the whole dish was really good, albeit a little fishy from the clams.  My boyfriend had the flatiron steak and the onions that came with it were really tasty. Good service and atmosphere.  We love Tom Colicchio!
