I really enjoyed this place.  We took my parents here for Mother's Day, and we were seated pretty quickly, despite the fact that it is a smaller establishment.  Our server was very nice, and the service was pretty quick.  I really liked their coffee!  I had their french toast special - with warm berry compote and cream anglaise.  It was delightful.  Everyone else enjoyed their food as well, and the little tim tam cookies that they have are totally worth trying.    I'll definitely be going back! Only slight downside is that they only take cash.
