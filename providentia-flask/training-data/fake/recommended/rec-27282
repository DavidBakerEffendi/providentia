This is a New York Staple!  The Mixed with Rice is fantastic. The white sauce is primarily made out of crack and is unstoppably delicious. The recipe that truly interests me though is the red-hot sauce. The sauce is something else, just one or two drops of the stuff are sure to send you to the infirmary. I am pretty sure it is made out of red peppers, childrens dreams, unicorn tears and a dash of black pepper. SO very very good! The only real downside is that they raised their prices from 5 bucks to 6 and there is always a line of tourists waiting in line not really knowing whats going on.  These guys run all the carts on this corner and the one across 6th Ave is the same food by the same people and usually has less people waiting in line. Protip: For those folks doing takeaway. Get the mix with rice no salad. It will make travel and reheating that much better.
