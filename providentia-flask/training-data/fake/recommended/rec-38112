We found this great diner through yelp but did not realize that we had walked in on a Sunday at 1250pm, ten minutes before they close. No matter, because Earl and his friendly crew took care of us with a terrific stack of pancakes and hearty omelette. We never felt rushed and Earl took the time to thank us for our business and even made sure we claimed our free cookie. Â You owe yourself a visit here just to see how friendly the folks in Burlington really are.
