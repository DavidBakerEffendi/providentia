I came here with a couple friends to celebrate my bday. Even though we made a reservation, we still had to wait (it was a Saturday). We ordered a few dishes to share. For food, we got the macaroni and cheese dish and the waffle fries. The macaroni and cheese dish was decent. The waffle fries were regular, we did not taste the chili powder that was supposedly on there. For dessert we got a crepe dish, a waffle, and a chocolate pizza. The desserts weren't too bad, but very sweet. My friends and I each also ordered a thick hot chocolate. I got the milk chocolate and my friends got the dark chocolate and hazelnut flavor. We all loveddd it! I would def recommend the thick hot chocolate drink. It was delicious and creamy! I would only come back for their desserts next time though. It's not a place I would frequent often but it's a nice place to go to if your in the mood for lotssss of chocolate! Also, the service was super! Our server was very knowledgable and took his time explaining the different dishes to us. He even gave me a piece of chocolate with a lighted candle on it bc he overheard I was celebrating my bday!
