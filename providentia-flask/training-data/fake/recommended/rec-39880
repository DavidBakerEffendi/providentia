This is one of the most overrated places in the city. I really hate it, and I hate that I hate it. I hate it for the fact that I work so close, and I love empanadas so much, and this would be the perfect lunch spot for me if it wasn't for the fact that they make the driest empanadas in the city, probably the world. Now imagine me coming out of my nice air conditioned office in the summertime to walk in the hot air only to come to empanada mama and eat their dry a** empanadas... that's what they call bringing sand to the beach. HUNGRY HIPPO PICK: Havana Central (now they make some good empanadas and it would be worth the walk)
