Great place. Friendly staff, good food, nice atmosphere. A little gem right in Brooklyn. Definitely a meat-heavy place, so it's not for everyone, but if you like sauerbraten and schnitzel and the like with sides of red cabbage or marinated cucumbers, you'll be very happy here. Good beer selection too. All in all, a good value place, very consistent.
