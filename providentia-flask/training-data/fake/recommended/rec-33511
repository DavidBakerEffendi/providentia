Tucked in a leafy, residential section of Ft. Greene, Olea's the kind of place that you'll happily stumble upon on a Saturday morning stroll.   The menu's refreshing, decor open and airy, and atmosphere laid back.  I'm sure it's a great place to read the paper if you got there early.   I'd suggest the green eggs and lamb, but everything's pretty good.  I just happen to be obsessed with cilantro and the green eggs are full of it. It's a little spendy for brunch so I don't think I'd give it a 5, but what isn't  spendy in Ft. Greene?
