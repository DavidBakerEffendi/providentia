Between the delicious pizza, the super nice staff and the view... You can't go wrong! We has the mushroom pizza which was full of mushroom... Can't get that in most places. We also has a plain margarita, just the right amount of sauce/cheese balance. And we also has a special pizza that has Brussels sprouts and spicy honey, I know spicy honey sounds weird, but it was freakin' awesome!! It was a little chilly out tonight and for some reason they didn't have the propane heaters on, but we were provided blankets! Very cool touch! Everyone should check this place out at least once Â before it gets too cold.
