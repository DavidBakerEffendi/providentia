Melter Skelter. By far the best grilled cheese I have EVER experienced. I was looking for a quick snack to hold me over till I had a "real" meal and figured half a grilled cheese was the way to go. Little did I know, I was about to experience pure bliss. The sandwich had BBQ chips, pickled green tomatoes, jalape√±o, and watercress in addition to the valley shepherd cheese and was served with chips and was beyond amazing. I would highly recommend this to anyone who even remotely likes cheese and flavor =).
