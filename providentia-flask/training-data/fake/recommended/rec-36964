The pizza is great and it's open at night and on weekends - a 'good to know' for the Wall street neighborhood. The marinara sauce has a ton of garlic so be careful with that one. I think the food overall here is pretty good and you can eat outside weather permitting. The last time I went we had a waiter with a terrible attitude - wish I caught his name but usually it's fine.
