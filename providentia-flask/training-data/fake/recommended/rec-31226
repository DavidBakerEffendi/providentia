I was recommended this place and really wanted to try some traditional Georgian dishes. But getting there at the lunch time with two kids probably was a mistake. The $15 lunch deal sounds good, but in reality it would leave you hungry. I had a piece of Hachapuri for appetizer, fried Hinkali for entree - seriously, two pieces as an entree????, piece of Napoleon for dessert - it's like one bite piece!!, and a glass of drink. In addition we ordered Hachapuri, chicken satzivi anf boiled Hinkali (this time - 3 pieces as an entree!!!). The kids liked Hachapuri and Hinkali. I would say it all was nice food, but not so special as I had expected. Now about the service - we asked for a high chair for a child, they refused to bring it, though we saw two of them near the bar. No idea why we couldn't get it... Our waiter really couldn't explain the dishes in English. When asked about a dish, she just brought the menu - read by yourself, dear guest! When I asked for some more water, she filled only my glass, but not the other 3 glasses on the table.. The restrooms are nice, btw, with black colored design. I loved the garden and brick walls. So, the bottom line is - go there for adult's dinner and expect to pay much more than $60 per person (appetizer, entree, desert, drinks, wine, tip.. ). The pricing range of $11-31 here on YELP is misleading, IMHO.
