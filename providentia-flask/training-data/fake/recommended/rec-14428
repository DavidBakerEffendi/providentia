The Halal Guys is a pretty awesome food cart.  They're to food cart in New York as the Bacon Hot Dogs stand is in Los Angeles.  It's well worth it even though you're freezing your butt off standing in line while it was snowing in the dead of Winter.  However, the line moves fairly quickly.   I got the chicken and rice bowl.  It was full of flavor and dirt cheap in a city where everything is overpriced.  The white sauce is amazing like seeing your ex with a down grade.  The chicken wasn't dry and it was moist.  I think it had to do with it being shredded versus it coming in big chunks.   Anyway, the Halal Guys is a must stop in New York whenever I'm there.  I'll definitely be down to wait in line, so Halal back, girl!
