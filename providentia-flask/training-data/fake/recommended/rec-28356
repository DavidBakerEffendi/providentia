I finally went and checked this place out.  I live three blocks away, and am happy that there is finally a "hip/cute" place to get a cup of coffee, REAL coffee.  The venue is pretty small, but has squeezes in seats outside and inside! I like that it's on "this" side of Broadway, east of Steinway!  They have 4 types of coffee.  It's definitely tastier, fresh brewed coffee, and less than S*itbucks, but more than the bodega/street vendors' cup.   - They offer a really tasty Jalepeno-guava. grilled cheese, and they compliment it with a really tasty kitchen sink salad.  The sauce on the salad is to die-for!! And, we're not talking about any grilled cheese.  The bread alone is huge!, It ain't sandwich bread, but has more of a "Challah" dense filling quality!   They also have an eclectic blend of beers!! I'd say the only thing they need: accept credit cards! they're open late till 1am weekdays! It's a new little cool place, in this very diverse neighborhood!
