Went to the Lemon Ice kings and then got hungry so I yelped empanadas and brought me here. Hooray! Cute little place at the corner of Van Doren and 108 st in corona. I got very excited with the menu.  They have white flour,  corn or organic. ( wasn't a fan of the organic 2 dry and bland). I ordered plantain & cheese ( my favorite) Chicken, Ham & cheese and Hawaiian.  Since I ordered a lot the girl at the register was very nice and threw in an organic chicken for free.  Toooooooo bad I didn't like it "( but it was much appreciated.  She was very helpful since I wasn't sure what to order at first.  If you are in a hurry order ahead of time bc it takes some time. The least favorite for me was the chicken.  For a second it looked like beef and was on the dry side.  2nd fav was the Hawaiian and ham and cheese (Lil salty but was still yummy). #1 favorite was the Plantatin.  Saw this was a must try on yelp and it was delish. Dessert: Homemade ice cream.  Lots and lots of flavors to choose from.  So delish. Enjoy! The
