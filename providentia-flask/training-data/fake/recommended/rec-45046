There are many, many thing to love about this restaurant: 1. The food is delicious! Everything we ordered was served at the perfect temperature, tasted amazing, and the portions were generous. 2. The service was impeccable. Our waitress paid enough attention to us, but not so much that we ever felt rushed. My party of three enjoyed a lovely, leisurely, three-hour dinner. 3. The space is perfect for intimate conversations. We didn't have to shout over anybody, or compete with loud music, in order to be heard. We sat near a large table of about ten men, and we were still able to hear each other perfectly. 4. The location is great - in the heart of the Village, near several different trains. 5. For the quality of the experience, the price was fine. Still not cheap enough for a random dinner, but a great place to go for a special occasion, or with someone from out of town.
