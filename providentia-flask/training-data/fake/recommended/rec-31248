Phenomenal. I was hesitant getting ramen on a somewhat-hot NYC summer for lunch but I would do it again in a heartbeat. Format: the place has isolated hours for lunch and dinner/late dinner so be aware of this. I came around 11:30a midweek and expected to waltz right in. I was told to sign in. I couldn't believe I was waiting for lunch in Hells Kitchen but soon realized this was the only restaurant for blocks with a line for lunch. Atmosphere: a tiny, sub-ground level restaurant with 4ish tables and bar seating for about 8.  I could easily see it being similar in Tokyo.  Employees yell out orders in Japanese in tandem which is cool.  All of the staff were a nice mix of friendly but keeping things moving at a NYC pace. Once I left I saw no less than 25 people outside waiting.  I saw no one leave after hearing how long the wait was.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a place to sit back and enjoy the atmosphere. You come for the great food. Nevertheless, I didn't feel like I was sacrificing any of the experience. Food (I'm vegetarian): I got the Spicy Vegetable Ramen that has veggie broth.  It was beautiful as it came out. Great aroma. The ramen noodles were perfectly cooked and effectively al dente, 'toothy' mouthfeel.  It was topped with mesclun greens (surprisingly crunchy even after being in broth), zucchini slices (amazingly fresh and flavorful), red pepper, avocado (which was a genius move), wood ear mushroom, seaweed, and the best topping, bunashimeji mushrooms (incredible).  The noodles weren't too eggy. The veggie broth was sublime.   I'm going out of my way to come again.
