WOW. I was taken here on the spur of a moment and I must say everything was phenomenal. From the service to the food, I definitely recommend this place. My favorite? The chicken curry. They don't hold back on the chicken and they give you just enough sauce to eat with the rice they give you on the side. For 7 bucks, it was definitely worth it. I also tried the fried ice cream and it was perfection! The crunchy fried part wasn't soggy like most places that make fried ice cream and the ice cream didn't melt while i was devouring it.    The service was just as great as the food. Every time I drank a sip of water, someone came by to fill it back up! Definitely give this place a go if you get a chance!
