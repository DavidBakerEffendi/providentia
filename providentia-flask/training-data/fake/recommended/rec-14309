Having just taken a vacay to Barcelona, i was glad to know that my previous trips and great appreciation for the tapas at Tia Pol were real and valid. I especially love the chorizo -- had the special which sounded strange, but works so well: think reeses cups-saltiness (the chorizo) marrying perfectly with chocolate on a bit of crostini. love the reg. sausage too ... the croquettes, the charred peppers, it's all SO good ... as is the sangria. and the cute, dimly lit interior and friendly waitstaff make this a great place to let your hair down. love it!
