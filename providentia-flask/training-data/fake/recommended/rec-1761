After a night out in Hell's Kitchen, I tried this place out with a few friends. The food was delicious. There are many varieties of empanadas. I started off with the mambo italiano (Italian sweet sausage, red and green peppers, onions and tomato sauce) and the shredded chicken (chicken cooked in a sofrito sauce) empanadas. They were both really good prompting me to get two more. The second time around I went with the cheesesteak (skirt steak with mozzarella cheese made latin style) and the chorizo (pork sausage with latin spices) empanadas. All the empanadas I had were made with wheat flour except for the chorizo which was with corn and they are all served with red and green salsas. A friend split them with me while 2 other friends went with the classic arroz con pollo served with maduros and the salsas. I tried their meals and they were so good as well. I must say I am partial, because I was intoxicated at the time, but I have no doubt in my mind that the food is just as good sober. Located right near the famous Katz's deli this place is a great end of the night eatery with prices under $3. Right there with pizza, this is a steal. I would definitely go back and would recommend this place to end or begin a night out in the city.
