This place is something special. The food is simple and delicious, not overly complicated, but obviously well thought out. The ambiance, too, is well curated-- it can get jam packed, but still retains a calming presence. The service is excellent, both our servers were charming, attentive, patient, and kind. Audrey Claire is one of our absolute favorite restaurants in Philadelphia.
