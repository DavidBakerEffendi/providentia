Came here on a Friday night around dinner time, crowded but was seated right away. This location has two floors, the lower floor seems a lot like a nightclub to me.. It is much darker and more for casual meet ups and you see draft beers ordered much more downstairs than it appears upstairs... Or at least the time that I went. The upstairs has a gorgeous view of the village.. The truffle fries are seriously the highlight of my entire experience here. (Aside from the amazingly kind waiter that was offered to us). The truffle fries are delicious though! We also ordered another type of fries, something with bacon in it but I forget the name exactly. This one had American cheese on it and I was not a fan of it. That was the only thing that was left unfinished. ALL FRIES COME WITH DIPPING SAUCES, they are all delicious. My favorite is the jalape√±o mayo, I'm still drooling over it. PLUS, all sauce refills are free so do not be afraid to ask. All of my friends and I got the truffle em especial, which is basically the truffle burger with an egg over easy. The burger is displayed BEAUTIFULLY, but becomes very difficult to eat with the egg just spilling all over the place. Aside from the fact that the burger is quite salty, I would say it is a pretty good burger. It comes med-rare, but you can ask for it to be well or whatever you would like it to be. The waiter was very attentive to us, constantly refilling our water and what not. Definitely a pleasant experience.
