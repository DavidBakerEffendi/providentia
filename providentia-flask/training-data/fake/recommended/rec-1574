I've been dying to go to BarBacon for months, and since I am moving soon I figured what better time to go than now. The atmosphere is great, it's a nice place and I love how it's outlined. When I received the menu I was a little disappointed, I expected there to be a lot more options for lunch and dinner. A lot of the items I saw on the menu were things I could easily find at other places: Bacon Burger, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Salads, etc. I really wasn't impressed with the menu, I wish they had more unique items. Ultimately I landed on the Lobster Loves Bacon Mac & Cheese. It was fine, nothing amazing. Just you're typical mac and cheese with some lobster in it. I think my favorite part about it was that the bits of bacon in my entree were small but thick pieces. Overall I'm glad I went, but I definitely wouldn't go there twice.
