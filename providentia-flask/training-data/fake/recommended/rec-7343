OK, let me just start by saying that I really don't understand the whole Pho obsession. It's a big bowl of brothy soup folks...how amazing can it be??? I'm willing to try it again, but I was seriously underwhelmed by it. Anyway, I had it here, it was fine. Let's move on. I never had a Banh Mi. I know, shoot me now. i decided to bust my cherry here @ Saigon Shack. Now that I really enjoyed. Explosion of flavors, really nice and complex. I will return. It's a little busy in general, but it's got a pretty cool vibe. Not a place to go and sit to catch up with a long-lost friend...it's a place to strap in your feed bag and chow. Get in, get out.
