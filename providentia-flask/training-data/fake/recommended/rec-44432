MY wife and I have been eating at  different Italian restaurants we have never been to lately trying to discover new  gems. this place was a home run with bases loaded!! here is what we had.. Hot Antipasto .... $16.00...delicious...& was perfect for 2 people for the main course we had.... Rigatoni Pugliese ... $17.00.. i switched pastas & added  sun dried tomatoes NO extra charge... ..it rocked !! Chicken Ripiieno......$19.00....... delicious and a very  nice size portion. Plus out of no were the chief Paul LaGrutta who is also one of the owners came by our table to see if we were pleased with our meals.That to me says alot... As the saying say.. you get what you pay for.... this place is a real GEM.. you won'tbe disappointed...
