A popular ramen noodle place located in east village. But they don't take reservation. When we got there, they are multiple group of people ahead of us and it is an hour wait. I don't wait for anything and they should have take reservation in first place. Anyway! For the appetizer: I ordered 4 appetizers including Pork buns (the most popular appetizer in Ippudo) and my friend came last time told me I have to try this. Shishito, I've always wanted to Shishito ever since I had it at other place. Tako wasabi and chicken wings,my cousin and sister said they love the Tako wasabi. For the entree: Our waitress recommend Akarmaru modern for me, and Yokosuka tonkotsu for my cousin, my sister had Karaka Ebi - Miso. One word to describe the Ramen is tremendous. Â The service was good also especially the waitress she was so helpful and thanks to her we had such wondering experience last night. I am sure we will come back sometimes , not only the food is good but also this place is packed. Next time we will avoid that . Trust me arrive early and wait inside.
