It took me a while to get here, and I was very excited to finally come. I left feeling a little bit underwhelmed. I know Umami is a Japanese word, but this place actually feels like a Japanese restaurant vibe with the long bar and small tables. I expected more of a classy burger joint vibe, not a low key-diner feel. It was by no means fancy, like I thought it would be. My friend and I split the classic Original Umami Burger and The Royale (truffle burger with short rib on top). I thought the Royale would by far be my favorite, but I was surprised to like the Original better. I guess it's Original for a reason! Â The burgers aren't massive and they look homemade, and not like a pre-cut patty. We also split the regular Thin Fries, truffle style. I was just overall unimpressed. Nothing BLEW my mind like I wanted it to. Even the 4 special sauces they serve with the fries were just decent. I guess I just wanted more here, especially for the higher end prices. I will continue my search for the perfect burger and won't need to repeat this one for any close calls. It was still good, just not recommendable as a must-go burger spot. We left paying $30 each for 2 beers, 2 burgers and 1 fries. Could easily find cheaper and better elsewhere. At least they had a comment box on the way out for ways to improve?
