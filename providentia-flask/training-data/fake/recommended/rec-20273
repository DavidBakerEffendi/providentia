Buttermilk Channel was sensational. So first off we were prepared that we we going to wait.  Friday night, dinner plans around 7 and that was okay for the four of us..we had a drink down the street for a while and watched the locals throw pizza dough in the air. (Long wait, I don't want to tell you but you know it's popular) Anyhow, the moment we stepped into the inviting and warm butterMilk, we were greeted with smiles. Really. Like the world was in a great mood, all of us inside this place on a cold winter's night. So at the bar, the bar tender killed me with kindness and patience. It was like, well he really genuinely cared if i liked the drink and wondered after offering us tasters, what I thought of the flavors and the differences between the two. He didn't run and do any other bar back work.. he waited for us to choose with such patience.  I really think the way people bartend these days is that they give you the 'I'm too busy for anyone look' or only for my friend that i'm kind of in with.   Anyhow, the food was also so delicious- the cheeses, salads & the best dish of all in my opinion was the Market Vegetable platter. The Kale was grilled to perfection, charred on a flame and those brussels were quartered so perfectly and grilled, i believe to perfection, aldente! Thank you for such a lovely evening Chefs ~ Ps. For the ratings, as good as it gets- is home cooking so this is the top!
