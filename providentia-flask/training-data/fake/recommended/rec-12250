I felt duped. Stopped in the other night with a buddy of mine. Ordered the nachos and was talked into the large order. My thought was how much more could the larger order be if the small one was only 7 or 8 bucks . Well when the bill came the nachos- which sucked by the way, as Â they were nothing more than a mountain of burnt cheese some beans, and some variety of meat- were 15 bucks!!!!! Really? That some coffee drink and dessert and my bill was over 30 bucks! For that amount of money there are much better places than the tale.... Food has sucked for a while anyway! We are taking a long hiatus from this joint! If we ever return at all !!!!!
