The place was packed on a Thursday night when I went before my show, but I got a very tight spot at the bar.  The bartender shook my hand and introduced herself (Lea) and took good care of me. I opted for a $15 glass of wine which is pretty steep but it was a relatively generous pour and it was Italian.  The bread and bean/olive oil dip prior to my entree were excellent (the foccaia in particular).  Little bowl of olives came with and were sprinkled with red paper flakes so be prepared.  I decided to have the pork chop and received the caesar salad beforehand.  It was one of the best caesars I have ever had - crisp lettuce and very tangy dressing.  The pork chop was ENORMOUS - close to three inches tall and probably bigger around than a man's palm.  It was served with grilled vegetables over the top - mostly peppers, which I don't like, but they were clearly served after it was cooked because it didn't taste like peppers, for which I was grateful.  It was grilled and interestingly spiced and made for a nice light meal in an Italian restaurant (solid lean protein and a salad).  One small criticism is it was slightly under-done right in the very center and since it was pork I was too afraid to eat it.  A great experience overall.
