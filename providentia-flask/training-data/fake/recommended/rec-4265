I have never in my life seen such an unprofessional staff. Please hire people with some education because it is very sad to have to use the restroom while the person I was with was pregnant and wanted to see the menu, she then didn't see anything she liked and was yelled at by a woman of larger frame " if you just wanted to use the bathroom don't make pretend you are gonna order" Â Never in my life have I ever heard or could fathom a person of hospitality saying those words... Seriously need to pull it together.
