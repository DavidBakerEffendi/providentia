I have passed this place SO many times on my walk to the PATH.  I can't believe it's taken me so long to get my big booty in there. I was hungry today... looking for a nearby spot for lunch that I hadn't tried before... Yelpers came to the rescue, and I decided to try Pinto. Pinto is perfect.  Well, nothing is perfect, but there are so many perfect details that it ends up being pretty perfect.  Literally, pretty. I sat down at a table solo facing the lovely Christopher St.  First thing I noticed is how neatly the napkins are folded with a branded ribbon around it reminding me that I am in "Pinto NYC."  The super nice server comes over, brings water and takes my order - the super cheap $8 lunch special plus a $4 Thai Iced Tea.  $4 for iced tea would normally be a little steep but he came over with this wood tray holding a glass pot of tea, a glass with (iced tea) ice cubes and a silver stirrer and two small pitchers - one with milk, one with lemongrass syrup.  It was make-your-own Thai iced tea, and it was good. I wasn't so impressed with the salad that automatically comes with your choice of appetizer - not enough dressing, in my opinion.  But again, it was beautifully presented alongside my coconut milk soup.  For entree, I had shrimp pad thai, was was very good.  It was plated on a branded plate... again, reminding me I was at "Pinto NYC."  Still I didn't find this cheesy, it was actually quite classy. All in all, Pinto pays attention to the small details that really make a difference.  It's that attention to detail and the impeccable timing of courses plus the super friendly service that makes this place somewhere I will return.
