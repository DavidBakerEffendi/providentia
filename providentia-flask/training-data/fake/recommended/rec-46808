Loved this place!  We have been looking for a new breakfast spot and we found it!  I have been going gluten free for some time now and going to a restaurant where there are plenty choices is a big plus. Since it was a Saturday morning, we were expecting to have a little wait.  We decided to eat at the countertop.  The service was great! We ordered the muscle maker omelette, gluten free waffle and gluten free French toast.  Everything was delicious!   We will definitely be back!
