As I have stated before, when it comes to pizza and bagels in NYC, everyone has their favorites.  For many, including myself and my 12 year old, this is one of the better places to get a pie.  Yesterday's visit was no exception. First, sit in the "back" which is the old location and will take you back, not to 1905, but to the 70's and 80's.  Love the wall and ceiling, but I digress. Back to pizza.   My 12 year old will take it from here: "The sauce is great because it was tasty and not too much; there is not too much cheese but where there is cheese, it is very fresh.  There is a little fresh basil that you only taste on certain bites which is refreshing.  The pepperoni is not too spicy but it is a a little spicy to give the pizza flavor.  The crust was nice and crunchy but not burnt." I would add that the 1905 coal oven (go to the back and see it) helps give this pizza its yummy taste. You may say there are better places in NYC but you will never be disappointed at Lombardi's. Plus, they have been in business since 1905 and NO ONE stays in business that long in NYC without being great.
