i stopped in alone one morning recently and had a good experience. the place is super cute and filled with nice light. it was pretty quiet inside and had a good vibe. i ordered the corned beef hash with poached eggs, which was not quite what i expected, but even better. the hash was juicy cubes of beef cured perfectly -not the typical kind of greasy friend hash most places serve up. the eggs were cooked just right...overall the dish was a home run. i would definitely go back.
