For the amount of publicity that Phily cheese steaks get, you'd think the flavor would be on par with the fish from Tsukiji Fish Market or something.  It is sadly not even close.   I ordered the famous "whiz wit" and it was amazingly bland and lifeless.  there just wasn't anything to it.  If the king of steaks comes up with this, I'm happy being a pauper.   to top it all off, the fries were greasy and overall, it was expensive.  With more bun than meat, paying $9 for the sammich really didn't provide anything worth noting, except in a meh review on yelp.
