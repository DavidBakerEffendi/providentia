I just figured I would update a year later. I have returned to Nai with my brother for several birthdays and other various celebrations and we are always amazed with the fantastic food and service, keep up the amazing job. Also you MUST try their house sangria (I'm partial to the white) especially if you enjoy a sweeter sangria.
