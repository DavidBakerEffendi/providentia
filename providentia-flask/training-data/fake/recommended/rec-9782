Almost like a deli. Hot buffet food or cooked ready to eat little lunch boxes and side dishes. Good options. Depending when you go, may not always be fresh. But quite good considering they're just being kept warm in a little "steam room." You can also just sit in and have a few beers and soju. NO wait service. You grab, pay, sit. Simple; to the point. Enjoy.
