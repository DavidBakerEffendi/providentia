We had a pleasant enough brunch experience at Rex 1516 on a hot morning. The food warrants 3.5 stars, but I dug the vibe which bumps it up to four. No wait for any sized party at 12:30, a big plus. Rex's dark wood, metal accents, brick wall, and artistic light fixtures suggest a rustic but classy ambiance. The back bar looked elegant and interesting jazz played at the perfect volume. I wouldn't hesitate to bring a date here on atmosphere alone. Service staff acted nicely enough, though our waiter fumbled a bit with an order screwup (which was remedied) and a slow pace. Coffees were kept full, food came out quickly. Worth noting is that the cocktail list here seems killer, I will definitely imbibe upon return. A basic egg breakfast nailed it with lusciously textured scrambled eggs, delicious sweet potato hash, thick bacon, and fresh jam/toast. The eggs lacked a touch of salt, but I'm nitpicking. Sweet potato biscuits and chorizo gravy had palpable sweet potato and chorizo flavors, an interesting take on the brunch standard. Unfortunately, the biscuits were more leaden than fluffy or airy, and the eggs had too much salt. I should've gone with the delicious looking shrimp and grits my neighbors ordered. The damage was $12 or under a plate, portions were adequate. Rex 1516 is thus a solid option for a brunch in a nice, casual atmosphere. The food isn't 100% there, but you'll enjoy the ambiance.
