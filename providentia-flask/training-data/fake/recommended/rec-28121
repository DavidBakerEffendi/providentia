Came here the other night with my sister for dinner. She insisted we eat at Venturo because she was adamant about having the baby Jesus again. The wait on a Friday night for two wasn't so bad; 15 minutes or so. The host, Carlos, seemed like a sweetheart. We were seated and ordered our drinks; I'm not a huge fan of gin, I actually hate it but The Rose is a great drink. We ordered the clams which was a lot smaller than I thought but still good. I had the beef ragu and my sister had the fish. My beef ragu was amazing. At the end of course we had the baby Jesus. In combination with the whipped cream it was really good. This place is trendy and has a hipster-esque crowd. It's definitely not what I'm used to in the sunnyside area but this place is great and I will be returning soon.
