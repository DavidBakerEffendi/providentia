I reserved the private room with a party of 16 people for my birthday on a Friday evening. The decor was very beautiful, but everything else was terrible. We all ordered our food at about 7:30pm and our waitress Kristi was already swamped with a total of 11 tables by herself. I ordered 1 speciality roll and 2 salmon rolls. I never received my food until 9:30pm at this point I'm pissed off, annoyed and ready to leave the restaurant. I told our waitress that I did not want it and she said she would speak to the manager to take it off our bill. The manager came over and basically said there was nothing she can do about it and insisted I take it home. Our waitress was very apologetic and very nice and tried to be accomadating, but the manager was very rude and does not know how to manage a restaurant. They were short staffed and only my had 2 chefs who were backed up. Not only did I get my food super late, some of my party did not receive their food and the chefs kept insisting that they sent out their food! I was so disaapointed and would never recommend this place to anyone. I wanted to try something different for my birthday and it bit me in the a**. On top of it all their food is expensive and they had baby ants on the floor! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!
