We came early on a Saturday for Brunch. Were the first ones there but the restaurant filled up pretty quickly. First off, food: - Baked eggs: The flavor combination was just what you want with a sublime basil touch and the eggs were cooked to what I thought was perfection (not fully cooked through and the whites and yolk were just a smidge runny) but the beans needed to be cooked through a bit more. - Pork Belly Sandwich: this was the winner. It was DELICIOUS. Generous everything. Huge portion of pork belly and considerable portion of fries given the size of the sandwich itself. We split both dishes and both liked this one best. We also got red roosters - just spicy enough without being overwhelming. The only other things is that while the service was really attentive and friendly, we were the first ones there and it seemed the last ones served within the first wave of guests that arrived when we got there. Maybe it was because we didn't order apps, but it seemed a bit weird. Still, I think this is a really solid brunch restaurant and I'd come back to try some other dishes that I was eyeing (like the Rye benedict and some more lunch-y savory dishes).
