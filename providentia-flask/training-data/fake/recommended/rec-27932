i was meeting an old-time HS friend (hadn't seen her in nearly five years) for a late lunch, and i was starving by the time i met up with her. On top of that, we had to walk quite a distance to the restaurant. BUT, it was worth it. Hands down, Cuban food is good. It was a Sunday afternoon, and it wasn't busy at all. It would be a perfect spot for a date. Very intimate setting, and our waitress was really sweet. She highly recommended the picadillo, which is basically a meat hash. I was a bit leery because it contains raisins- not a fan of savory-sweet dishes. But, i decided to venture out and be adventurous- OMG!!!- it was yummy! The mixed flavors of the tomatoes, onions, and olives really come through with the addition of the raisins. it was amazing. Plus, it came with fried plaintains- so i was very happy. My friend ordered this butter garlic shrimp dish, which she raves about. It looked good too, but i was too busy enjoying my meal. The only reason why i didn't give it 5 stars is that i only tried this place once, which is such a shame. i wish i could have tried everything. Oh well!! It's a great incentive to visit NY and try this place again. Afterwards, we walked around and randomly found this ice-cream shop on Avenue B. So, perfect way to end the meal. ** Note- It's a cash-only spot.
