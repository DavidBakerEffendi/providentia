Pizza is great atmosphere is very hip and cool.  I don't have the funds to go here normally but on a special occasion it is nice.  Now on to the Mad Men review.   They advertised they were playing this and I have never gone to a bar to watch a show before but I've heard good things about it.  Do NOT go here to watch Mad Men if they choose to do this again.  You are at the bar and you are lucky if you get a seat, though the tables cleared out by about 10:15.  The sound is on but people are chatting it's just a normal night at a bar with Mad Men playing in the background.  I was next to an obnoxious couple who actually played a video with sound on their phone in the middle of the show so I got to listen to their annoyingness the whole hour.  Then the bartender asks them "Hey where are you guys from?!" and just has a convo the entire rest of the show. So they advertise that they are playing a show but the bartender talks through the whole thing?? Show ended took forever to get the check and I ended up paying $22 to watch Mad Men and drink mediocre wine...might as well pay for cable at this point!
