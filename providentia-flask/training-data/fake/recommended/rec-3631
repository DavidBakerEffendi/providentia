My middling review comes mainly from disappointment after waiting over three years for Umami Burger to make the jump from the Left Coast, where my memories of the sumptuous ingeniousness were first formed. Firstly, the burger itself was not as hearty or flavorful as I remember. I guess the standard "umami burger" is good for first-timers but I should have ordered one of the more fun, fully-loaded versions. Also the portions are definitely not sufficient for the average American weened on 1500-calorie dinners - you should definitely order fries, if at least to share. The atmosphere here is not as fun and original as, well, the original in LA; it feels like it could be any ol' chain burger joint. Service is prompt and accommodating. Not all it's cracked up to be, but maybe I need to give it another chance.
