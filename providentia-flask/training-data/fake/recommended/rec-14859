I have often found that if there is a nicer-than-average and pricier-than-average restaurant that I really want to try, its best to start out with eating brunch there. Brunch is almost always significantly less expensive and easier to obtain a reservation, without any lack in food quality or service. I was very excited to be invited to a birthday brunch at FDR this morning and it was fantastic. The interior is beautiful (actually, so is the exterior!). I love the subway tiles, old stools, and beautiful couch seating along one wall. It was crowded when we arrived around noon today, but it really emptied out and it was nice to take some photos without a crowd. I got fresh squeezed OJ, which was amazing, and then opted for the asparagus grilled cheese with a side of homemade sausage. You can tell that everything is made from scratch and so we probably waited a little longer to get our food than the average spot, but nothing was a bother at all. My sandwich was super good, with thick cheese and a runny egg yolk. The sausage came in a cute little cast iron pan with a striped dishcloth on the plate. I'm such a sucker for details like that! One employee (the manager maybe?) seemed to notice the birthday card on the table and brought us all a round of Brut on the house, which was so sweet. He had strange mannerisms and made us all a little uncomfortable, but I think he meant well. For me, the decor was 10/10, but the food was just a little too rich. While I really enjoyed everything, it sat in my stomach like a rock for hours later. This place is definitely an occasion restaurant, and I hope I have an occasion to return!
