I can't speak to anything beyond the baked goods, but just want to chime in that (as so many others have said) they are delicious. They are always moist and fresh and a "go to" for student celebrations. Even after leaving, students speak fondly of the coffee cake as a special treat that they miss from school. I've never had anything like it - and I'm typically not a fan of coffee cakes. It's just not your typical coffee cake - it's a coffee flavor mixed with a kind of cinnamon (and other spices?) that is unique. And the icing is heavenly! The other cakes are also great but be sure to try the coffee cake. Th venue is cute, but really most people get cakes for celebrations and don't spend much time there. Otherwise it's sort of your typical cute coffee place, which is fine.
