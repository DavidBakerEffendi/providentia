They say that the italian economy runs despite of its political shambles. Similarly Rye is a great place, despite its excessive endevours of hipsterness. I like it. I love it. The decor, the lighting, the table dressings, the cutlery, the cappucino cups (china), the nikel plated tables, the large period bar, the old fashion sterling coffee pots all fold into one inviting, cozy athmposhere that welcome you as you come in. You feel that you stepped in a different time and bygone era, you feel welcome, want to sit and have great conversations. As if you were in Cairo in the 40s in the officer's private lounge of the British foreign bureau. You only have to put blinkers to ensure that you tune out the yet-another-guy with extreme 'liam gallagher' bad hair syndrome, apparently required to qualify as a hipster. The service is innatetively attentive. The food (brunch for us) was carefully crafted to live up to the expectations. Freshly made ingrediants to justify the pretension of 'we are better' that the caf down the road. Is it overpriced? The brunch is not particularly pricey for an equivalent place less the Cairo feel.
