I was so thrilled when shake shack opened in Philadelphia.  As a former New Yorker I used to wait sometimes up to an hour and a half in Madison Park just for the privilege for being able to eat this food - - so it seems like a true luxury to wait maybe five minutes tops and have access to the same delicacies. The staff is friendly, the food is delicious and inexpensive, the environment is fun.  Why not five stars?  Honestly it's because there is not one healthy thing on the menu.  Not even one.  The closest thing is the chicken sausage but that was a grease fest.  For those of you reading this who know the menu - - no I did not forget about the portabello burger but let's not forget that is covered in cheese and then deep fried.  A super  fun place.
