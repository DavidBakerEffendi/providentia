Had the standard Philly Cheesesteak. I went to Pat's and Geno's on my first trip to Philly, and I must say Pat's wins hands down. They made what I asked for fresh unlike Geno's, the steak flavor was much better, and I like that they have many sides you can take with you. The peppers are essential, add a few to your cheesesteak to spice it up. Good Stuff here.
