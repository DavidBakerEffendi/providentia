I wasn't feeling the oxtail (mostly fat and gristle) but my husband loved the beef brisket.  The noodles were excellent, however.  Nice and chewy..Thick without being overwhelming.  The broth had a nice flavor which was enhanced with some Siracha. It is a treat watching the guy make the noodles.  It's like magic (or maybe I am just easily amused).  Service is very fast and but the place does tend to get very crowded.  And it's cheap!  Dinner for 2 for less than $12.
