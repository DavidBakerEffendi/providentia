Great food but the most awful service ever. They definitely have that 'home-cooking' vibe, but I really don't want to listen to decade-old club music at ear splitting levels while the staffs kids run around the tables. This is an actual dining experience here. So, if you're drunk in HK and looking for something better than McD' s to soak up happy hour cocktails, then you got the right place. And DON'T ask them to lower the music. It wasn't pretty.
