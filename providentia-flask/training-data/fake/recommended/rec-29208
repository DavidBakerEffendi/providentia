Great Ambiance... Overall, The meats were incredible.... a tad expensive i'd say but you have to expect that with high quality bbq... Really disappointed in the Broccoli Salad, wasn't a fan at all... Staff was awesome... The sauces on the table are killer... They had no cole slaw when i was there and the guy said they only have it a few days a week? thats a cardinal sin for a bbq place if you ask me, thats like serving people french fries and not having ketchup... Cole Slaw is my favorite BBQ topping. At the end of the day i can't wait to go back!
