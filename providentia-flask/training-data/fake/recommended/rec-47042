"Decent sushi in a strip mall" I was on the road for work and was in search for seafood for dinner. At the time of my search, Ginza was the most highly rated and still open late restaurant. Ordered the sushi combo and a special roll. The quality of the sushi was decent, however the abundant number of sauces really overpowered the special roll. Definitely worth the journey even if you are not shopping in the mall...or the one next to it...
