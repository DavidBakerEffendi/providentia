The is the best Brazilian buffet you can get in Astoria! They have the best sirloin and skirt steak. I always ask for medium rare, and it's perfect every time. I also get the whole skewer of chicken hearts! OMG, I can never have enough of these. The rice with fried shallot and okra are great too! On top of that, any dessert is good. Stuff yourself up! All of those for less than $20, and they take credit card as well. What more can you ask for?
