I love the wide-wok noodles dishes and their infamous thai iced teas.  But ever since they got popular and expanded downstairs, their service has really been compromised.  I went recently, and I saw three different parties leave because their orders took too long.  If you don't mind waiting, I'd definitely give it a go.
