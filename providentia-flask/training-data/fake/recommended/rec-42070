So I wemt to this place based on the Yelp reviews and I'm sad to say that I was underwhelmed :-(... I was so excited to try the food because I love cajun but it just didn't meet my expectations...the actual restaurant however is very nice...dimly lit, cozy, very nice hip decor. For apps I had crab cakes and shrimp cocktail...I thought the crab cakes were not bad the had good flavor of crab amd I could actually taste crab meat and the out side had a nice crunch...the sauce that was served on top complemented it well too. Â The shrimp cocktail had nice size shrimp..other than that it was just shrimp cocktail. For dinner I had the gumbo...I felt it lacked flavor...it was spicy as hell but that was the only taste it had...also the sauce was soupy...the sauce should have been rich and creamy...it just wasn't good...I couldn't even finish it. The place is nice, its kool, the staff was great...but the food IMO just wasn't good.
