Aww, I love the Abbaye! It's so absolutely chill. They have karaoke Sunday nights and it's really funny. It's not usually very busy so you get to sing a lot and get to know the other patrons. Quizzo is on Thursday night and I like the dude that hosts it. The food isn't always wonderful, but--- I think they make the best durned cheese steak in America. And paired with their amaaaazing french fries?? And a list of tasty beers I've never heard of before?!? Dream. Come. True. I'm also a huge fan of their mussels in white sauce with bacon chunks. (mmmbaconnn) The veggieburger is also very yum.
