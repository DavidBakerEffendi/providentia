Came with a friend on Sunday night at around 6 and there wasn't a wait, which was great. All the waitors and staff were very friendly and the service was good. However, the restaurant is super loud, table was on the smaller side and the seats were a little cramped. I didn't mind it too much because I was with just one other person, but I can see it being a problem for larger groups (anything over 5-6 people). We ordered bolinho de pescado and paella valenciana. Neither of us have much experience with latin food so we didn't knkw what to expect flavorwise, but we enjoyed both dishes a lot. The two tabLes next to us both ordered empanadas so I guess it's good (note for next time). Their drinks were pretty good too. There was a mix up because I couldn't hear the waitress over the noise so I ended up getting a mojito instead of margarita and I really liked it. Much better than some mojitos I've tried.
