overall the food was good but nothing to die for, but it was a fun experience. this is what we ordered 1.  nasu/eggplant: hm...this was ok.  bland by itself, needed some salt.  came w/ fresh crushed ginger 2.  enoki: this was delicious.  not sure what the sauce was, but it had something.  also had ginger 3.  chicken breast: not that tender, but their tane sauce is good 4.  tsukune: this was pretty damn good, i had with their tane sauce 5.  duck: really good, tender, lemon & salt 6.  lamb: also pretty good, tender, lemon and this sauce thing 7.  daikon beef rib soup thing: hmm...kind of bland.  but not bad.  i wouldn't order it again 8.  kamameshi w/ kani.  pretty good.  but i can see why someone would think it's bland. 9.  yakimochi: one order, 4 pieces, wrapped in seaweed.  needed salt and it tasted pretty good 10.  potato with salt & butter.  hmm...nothing special here. decent amount for 2 ppl.  be sure to get a counter seat if you can...it's more fun that way.
