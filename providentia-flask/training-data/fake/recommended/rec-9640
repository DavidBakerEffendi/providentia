Its amazing when you're wasted, & pretty good if your not.  Careful, the hot sauce is HOTTT. You'll def know which spot is which just by the long line every fri sat night. Overall, its def solid street meat but wouldn't travel all over Manhatten if i wasn't in the area. For the price of 6 bucks def will fill you up, i suggest getting the combo platter.  Lamb is legit. Def worth checking out if in the area, but wouldn't go crazy for it.
