Left Montauk to head to Philadelphia and found myself on Route 1.  Getting hungrier by the mile and having passed one of my favorites...Edison Diner...I acknowledge the marquis of this large stand - out diner from afar and pull in.   My initial impression of this stereotypical NJ diner was that it was clean, spacious, and aromatically pleasing. I was immediately greeted and then escorted to a table that was simply dressed and very clean.   Since it was about 1am, I decided to order a salad and omelet from their massive diner menu.  The food arrived promptly and the host was pleasant.  What impressed me was that that the salad was VERY fresh and the eggs were fluffy.   I went back a week later on a Sunday afternoon with a friend and experience consistent quality with their vegetables and their pastry ( something that I do not always find done well in diners). This Greek gem diner will see me return again and again to enjoy its offerings.  You should go to Omega too!
