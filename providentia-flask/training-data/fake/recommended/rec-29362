If you want to try this place during its peak hours, pop your head in and look at the grill first.  Trust me on this. I went to Dalessandro's on a busy weekend afternoon and it was packed.  Something catches my eye on the grill when we walk in - a huge (I'm talking at least a foot high) mountain of gray (GRAY!) meat.  They were grilling the meat ahead of time so they could collect the next customer's money and flip tables/stools as fast as possible, and not even bothering to remove the meat from the grill when it was done.  They just let it continue to cook.  And cook.  And cook.  And cook.  And cook.   That mountain of mediocrity the color of a storm cloud looked horrible, but I decided to give it a chance.  Big mistake. Maybe Dalessandro's actually cares enough about their customers to put in an effort when it's not busy, but I'll never know it.
