i waited 45 minutes for a cheesesteak on a saturday evening around 6.30pm. worth every minute of the wait. best i've ever had! i'm amazed at how much meat they give you. and it's the REAL stuff. yes, the various hustle-men and hustle-women will come in a try to sell you stuff (bootleg DVDs, tube socks, jewelry, etc). yes, if you're lucky to even find a parking space, it'll be on some sketchy side street. yes, there are 2 huge "no tipping" signs posted, while the dudes making the steaks motion to a tip jar and ask you to "help a brotha out". yes, they only take cash, and yes, they sell old english 40 oz. all that adds up to an interesting experience and an awesome tasting cheesesteak at a great price!
