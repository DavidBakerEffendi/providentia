Food was spectacular, waitress was very kind, but there was a table next to us who was absurdly loud. When I say absurdly loud I mean constantly, insanely loud, with a similar annoyance factor to nails+chalkboard or a cat screeching in a dumpster. When I pointed this out to the waitress and asked her to tell them to hush, she got a man whom I assume was the manager. He came up and offered to seat us at the bar (about 8 feet away which would not solve the problem). I said that not only were we annoyed by the noise, but also the tables next to and behind us were both staring at this loud table. It was disrupting the entire restaurant. His response: "this is a small place." ***YES, THIS IS EXACTLY why you should manage the sound levels of loud patrons -- being in a small place means it will disrupt everyone's meal!***
