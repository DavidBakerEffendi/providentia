OMG avoid this place like the plague!!! Seemed like a nice cute out of place restaurant on St Georges ,but lo and behold the bland overpriced so called "Mexican food" was not even comparable to something you would get at Chevy's. Was going to give it two stars due to the nice waiter service,but some unshaven gentlemen with an unwelcoming demeanor started counting receipts and doing paperwork a table across from our group. I hope that was not the owner or manager...definitely much better places than this.
