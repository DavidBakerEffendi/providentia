Ended up here by accident when I had some family in town. What a wonderful mistake! The food was killer! One of the best pork sandwiches I've ever had. The shrimp salad is super yummy too. The place is tiny, but we were there for lunch so it wasn't too cramped. Great food. Wish it wasn't byob though.
