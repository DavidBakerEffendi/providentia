THE REVIEW BELOW IS FOR THE OLD RUDY'S: I can't think of a bar I'd rather go to. Cheap. Wide selection of beer. Great jukebox. TVs if you need to catch an inning or a score. Outside chance you'll see a new local band that actually has an ounce of style. Above average burgers and frites. Patio as of a few years ago. And (usually) not filled with assholes.
