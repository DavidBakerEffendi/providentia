This cozy spot is delicious and I can see why there's always a wait! They don't take reservations, but the wait goes pretty quickly and they let you get drinks at the bar to have on the street while waiting. The caprese is delicious and we thought we ordered a pizza but it ended but being a unique wrap with cheese and toppings. It was really good! The knockout was the gnocchi. Delicious! The wine was good and prices were very reasonable. Highly recommended!!
