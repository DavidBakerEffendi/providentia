i had a memorable time here last night (valentine's day) with my date who surprised me with this dinner reservation. this was my first meal at the restaurant and we had a choice of 2 prix fixe meals @ $45/$65 each but were restricted to only ordering 2 of one kind and not 1 of each which was sort of a bummer but what can you do? i still was dying to try everything. my favorite dishes were the "Pappardelle With Lamb RagÙ  (ordinarily  priced at $16.00, english peas, piave vecchio, sunchoke purée) and the Pizza "Funghi", also usually $16.00 with maitakes, royal trumpets, taleggio, black truffles. -the noodles were broad, al denté but so inviting and the peas were so fresh i could imagine the sunshine that made them sprout. the lamb fell apart at the edge of my fork and was flavorful and not gamey at all. my only complaint was that i would have loved to have had a bigger portion of this dish. every other dish was also equally tiny and all in all our meal was almost $300 (i peaked at the check), so we could have been spoiled a little with some pasta lovin'! the pizza was lovely- great for mushroom fans:) i should have let it cool down but again i was starving and it smelled wonderful. about their great staff: i spilled my rosé all over a waitress' leg and she was so sweet about it! i could have died of embarrassment and she was only concerned about replacing my lost glass and making sure that all possible bystanders were alright. i don't know how i knocked it over- it happened so quickly! :( still, i was so impressed by her gracious attitude and accommodating service. i would love to go back for that lamb pasta or a shot at tackling some of their great cheeses.
