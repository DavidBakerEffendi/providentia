Great place!  I came with a big group for a birthday dinner and even though the place is small (we probably took up 1/3 of the entire restaurant), they were completely accommodating and didn't rush us at all.   Delicious drinks (try the caipirinha or the whiskey with coconut water), reasonably priced / tasty food and great music.  Make sure to try the pao de queijo. One of my new favorites!
