Haven't been here for about 2 years; but this was where our group of friends decided we should spend New Year's Eve.  There were 10 of us, which is indeed a large group. Our waitress was wonderful.  Other aspects of the meal, less wonderful. Food is good but portions are SMALL.   The other major negative is the sound level.  This restaurant is painfully LOUD.  We had to shout just to hear the person sitting next to you.  Forget about the other end of the table. The most disconcerting part of the evening was when the owner/maitre d' asked us to leave (at 11:15pm) so that he could send his staff home. It seems to me that if you are at a restaurant on New Years Eve, you should be able to linger over coffee and desert. Unfortunately, the warm, welcoming ambience of this place is gone.  I would not recommend a meal here under any circumstances
