I was in dire need of eating filipino food, went to grill 21 with my friend. Experience was horrible for lack of better work, waiter was not attentive at all. Food is way overpriced for what it is. I orderred Oxtail, and what they serve was chunks of beef with tribes and one piece of oxtails. I can think of one good thing to say about that place. I am being generous by giving Grill 21 one star
