The fourth visit here was as delightful as the first three. Love the friendly yet professional service, fabulously fresh and expertly prepared fish dishes, and of course the oysters (a buck each on Thursday!). The amuse bouche of fried corn kernels with the salsa verde is perplexing as you're not quite sure what to do, but I love them. (I just use my fingers for dipping and eating.) I travel a bit to come here--from foodie town Morristown--and it's always worth the trip.
