i'll never promise to drink you under a table, but i'll obnoxiously boast about my truly odd ability to stomach the spiciest drinks to ever grace that table.   i was challenged.  barrio chino's habenero grapefruit margarita almost won.  but it didn't - don't take it upon yourself to test it, i'm a rare species.  but i was delighted with the burn and will be back to enjoy the burn again and again... as long as i have the patience to wait for a table.  once you're seated, it's an authentic, rustic, really, really GOOD mexican eatery.  calamari salad was huge and flavorful, pollo tacos were small but packed a tasty punch with the perfect twist of cilantro, & the huevos y bistek were pretty great, after realizing there was 'bistek' under the eggs after all.  with eyes bigger than stomachs, we would've shrugged off the missing protein, but it turned out to be a solid rendition of medium rare and a nice finish to a long, languid brunch. so far, it ranks high on the scale of so-so to spice...but i'll always welcome a challenge, and the LES is filled to the brim with delicious competition.
