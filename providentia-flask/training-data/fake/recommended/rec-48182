I love this diner. It has been one of the best diners I've ever been to. Too bad I live in CA. :( The egg's benedict, new york broadway sloppy joe(turkey sandwich with coleslaw), and onion rings are fabulous. They are my favorites from here. They have really fast & great service. Although, I have gone when employees were arguing & one waitress was really lagging. Other than that, I came here 5 days in a row, just shows how much I love this place.
