Do not even waste your time on this wannabe hipster tapas "restaurant." The food was subpar and the service was even worse. The decor is fine but it just does not live up to the hype. We ordered a bunch of tapas and while I understand tapas is a small serving, it was too small to get full. I went to a deli afterward and ordered a sandwich. We also ordered a pitcher of sangria that tasted like bad apples/bad wine and couldn't drink it. We also had to hunt down the "waitress" for the check. Now, I don't know why my experience went so badly. It could have been because it was mid day and no one else was there so they had the worst staff on hand or they were just lazy and didn't care. I'm not sure but I wouldn't waste my time or money to go back and find out. Bottom Line: STAY AWAY
