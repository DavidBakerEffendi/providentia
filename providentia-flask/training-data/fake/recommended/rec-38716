We had a luncheon for our pastor at Backstage Pizza.  Virginia and Sean were really helpful in planning beforehand and they gave us a great price for an all-you-can-eat pizza, salad, and soda lunch. Pros: -Pizza was good, salad was plentiful -Right next to the parking lot so it was easy to find (if you knew it was behind the main storefronts) -Patio seating in good weather -Accommodating to different tastes and requests -Staff was very friendly Cons: -A little bit cramped (we had 20 people and we pretty much took over the whole dining area...except they still managed to have other patrons there (I felt kinda bad for them!) -They also have a take-out service, so that can make eat-in service a little slower with only one waitress. Everyone had  a great time and left full.  Thanks!
