We had a private dinner here for about 50 people and it was outstanding.  The owner Joe worked with us on the menu, courses, alcohol, etc.  He was very reachable through email and extremely helpful.   Food is fantastic, we had polenta cucchiaio and risotto fritters as starters, gnocchi and ziti as pasta, and chicken mattone/short rib/striped bass as entrees.  Got compliments for all, but gnocchi and chicken were my favorites. Great place for a private event or for BYO on a weekend night.  Recommend.
