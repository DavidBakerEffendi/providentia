I am very surprised by the experience I had at Tinto and not in a good way.  Our table wasn't ready when we arrived, but that was fine because we grabbed some drinks at the bar while we waited.  We ordered the "Iraty" (description reads: bourbon, muddled lemon, Campari, fizz).  As we watched the bartender make our drinks, we noticed he used Heaven Hill.  Now, this is a drink off their specialty cocktail menu, wouldn't you expect the bartender to use somewhat of a higher quality liquor for their drinks?  Especially at a Jose Garces restaurant and especially for $12.00 a drink.  The food was so-so... the short rib from the Bocadillos list was very dry, the Patatas Riojanas were very plain and the Entrecote was definitely not worth the price.  When we decided to order dessert and asked our waiter what the custard item was like, he had a rough time explaining it.  We decided to just go with the custard and I have to say...it was probably the best thing we ordered at Tinto.  Overall-- much better tapas, drinks and experience at Amada.
