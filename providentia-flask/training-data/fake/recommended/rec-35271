Stopped in for a casual lunch, expecting to order a traditional udon noodle soup. However, the Curry Kara-age (Fried Chicken) udon immediately caught my eye. Three of my favorite things combined! I just had to order it... Once it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by the tenderness of the noodles and the rich broth as a result of the curry. The chicken also had a great flavor to it. However, I have to say...fried chicken soggy with soup is not really high on my list of favorites. That was probably something I didn't think through too well when I initially ordered it. That being said, it didn't' take away from the overall noodle soup. But I would definitely ask for the chicken on the side next time! They gave 4 or 5 large pieces that I wasn't able to finish all of the chicken. Would definitely be back to try something else on the menu.
