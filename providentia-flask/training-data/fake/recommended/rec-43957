Well I've never been to Spain.... Or East Hartford before either.  This place is a time warp throwback drive-in a-la Arnold's in Happy Day's. It appears this was the place to go for breakfast, lunch or dinner if you worked at Pratt & Whitney a defense contractor plant down the street - way back in the day.  I only stopped in to get an egg sandwich and a coffee, I got a East Hartford Little League glory days baseball history lesson circa 1955 to go with it which was nice. Turns out E. Hartford beat Stamford 2-0 in the states even with only14ks to Stamford's 17. The art of conversation has died but it is kept alive here by the current proprietor by lineage Ernie, his lovely daughter and grandson all working behind the counter. I had the John Larson sandwich named after the Democrat congressman  (ham, egg cheese peppers and tomato). The sandwich was not bad. They don't use hardroll's - rather a soft kaiser roll and the sandwich needed some spicing up like a shot of Tabasco but I was jawing away with Ernie.   $5.85 for the sandwich and small coffee seems a little steep for a factory town but, the coffee was good and the company was even better. Even if Ernie is a fan of Linda McMahon.  Ask him to tell you about the foxhole I'm sure he will anyway!
