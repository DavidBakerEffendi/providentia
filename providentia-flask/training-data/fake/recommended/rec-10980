so i'm giving this place four stars. the bathroom was clean, the eatery and general digs were cool. the food was amazing and i've been wanting to go here for a long time, i heard things. But i'm giving this place four stars instead of five because I went while feeling a little under the weather and I couldnt figure anything out. There should be signage for those of us who are naturally blonde and on an sufficient amount of dental drugs that says the following: "You order in one store front. You then carry your food next door to the semi-adjacent store front and eat it. The bathroom is at the end of a long unmarked hallway." Besides my slowness, I strongly suggest you eat here. Like if youre in between here and the dreadful crab place down the road GO EAT HERE! The food is so good and rich it made me and my friend feel guily for eating it and now that I've figured out the logistics and I will definately be back!
