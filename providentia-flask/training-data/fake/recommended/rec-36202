How predictable, another 5 star review for Balthazar. This place is amazing. We absolutely love the french onion soup here. It's far and away the best french onion soup I've experienced. It's served at just the right temperature - hot, never lukewarm. There's a strong onion flavor, with delicous melted cheese. Most of the menu items are excellent. Loved the duck confit, benedict, foie gras. Amazing food, but almost as important, the service was impeccable for how busy the place always is. Also - another big plus is the Balthazar bakery right next door. Love those chocolate donuts!
