I've been to dinner at the bar a number of times and have always had a great experience. Creative specials, awesome wine, friendly staff and not over the top in price. Value for dollar is incredible considering many of the ingredients are local or farm fresh. Don't miss the deviled eggs or the duck empanadas!
