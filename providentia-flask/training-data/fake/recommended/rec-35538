Had my birthday dinner here tonight. Started the night off with tinto sangria, which was good but a little on the weak side that is a little watery. My husband and I shared the $75 chef's tasting. Delicious is an understatement. Might be the second best meal I have ever had. Courses included duck, cheeses, jamon iberico, olives, prawns, beef, clams, sea bass, delicious Brussels sprouts, etc. definitely over the four courses it advertises. Dessert was a heavenly chocolate torte with hazelnut ice cream... Topped off with the best cappuccino outside of Europe (extra for that, but so worth it!) will definitely be back! Service was Outstanding ... Water glass always filled and moved courses along not to rush but at a good pace. Ambiance awesome and not too loud. Very bustling for a Monday night - nice that Garces has a place open on Mondays as many places are closed. Speaking of which this place puts Amada to shame (although sangria at Amada is much better than here).
