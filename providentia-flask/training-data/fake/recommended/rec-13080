I think as a LA girl I'll never get used to the wait in NY!  We had to wait 2.5 hrs to share a table.  We couldnt even wait at the bar they had here because it was packed so we had to go down the street.  Once we sat down the food was good though so it was worth the wait. -steamed buns, what they are most famous for.  Yup lives up to the hype.  Yummy and the pork is moist and flavorful -pear kimchi, amazing! Love to combination of sweet and pickled, flavor explosion! -Whole boneless porgy, yum.  They poured the broth at the table and it was just a nice delicate fish with a light broth
