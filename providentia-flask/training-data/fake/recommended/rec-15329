Cheap breakfast. It's pretty standard tastin for eat coast Chinese food. The rice noodle with BBQ pork - noodles were way too think and squishy. Porridge was ok. The place is pretty grimy looking - hole in the wall place. Our waitor had a permanent grease stain all on the back side of his red vest. Gross!
