Nini's has a vision of what it wants to be, and it scores points for bringing the quaint bistro thing to New Haven.  The prices, at roughly $30 a head for a three-course prix fixe, are extremely reasonable and the location in 9th Square is ideal.  What small things I hold against it are not in its failure to live up to the standards of an entirely different type of restaurant, but in some small flourishes that it misses in executing its own concept. First, the fact that there is minimal wait staff was fine by me.  It seems to be run by a couple, with one guy in the kitchen and a casually-dressed waitress in the small dining room.  We were greeted, seated promptly, and treated courteously throughout our meal.  But, the fabulously crusty French bread that's served to each table in a cute, floral-themed gift bag unsurprisingly leaves its share of crumbs.  I had to brush our table and my seat off multiple times to get comfortable upon sitting down, and making sure things were swept up beforehand wouldn't have cost the waitress any major time. Second, because the dining room is small and tables are relatively close together, I think that it would add a lot to the ambiance to have just a bit of soft background music.  This bothered me enough that even as I was digging into my delicious shrimp croquettes and mashed potatoes and sinking into the plush chair covers, I was continually preoccupied by the thought that we needed some Edith Piaf...or some light jazz...or something.  Just a little touch, but it would have made me want to draw out my dinner significantly longer.   All-in-all, though, the foundation is there for a great little restaurant.  The food was creative and seasonally in-tune since it changes every week: I particularly enjoyed a chilled mint-asparagus soup as the first course.  (The waitress even gave us some to take home!)  BYOW makes it that much more affordable, and the owners are clearly excited to be doing what they're doing.
