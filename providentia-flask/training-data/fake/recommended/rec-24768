The Reading Terminal Market was founded in 1893 and has evolved into a major dining destination.  It is a food Mecca where you can taste just about any type of food you desire.  The Reading Market has something for everyone.  Every type of food to enjoy and ravish.  Prices are reasonable, but flavour and choices are abundant.  The Reading Market also offers something for FREE.  If you are like me, and addicted to your iPhone....your battery is always hot.  At the Reading Market they offer a service to charge your cell phone for free.  It is a locker that you can leave your phone locked up while you grab a bite to eat.  How cool is that?
