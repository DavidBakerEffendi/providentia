HYPE! Dull, bland food. No salt, no seasonings. Are they not tasting this stuff in the kitchen before sending it out? Cocky! Lunch entree: gummy, flavorless lobster risotto w/3 nubbins of meat. Baby food! Polenta looked good but had zero taste. Brussels sprouts more raw than cooked. Re: salt fail: sliders so over-salted, barely edible. The place's front door closes so slowly, the room was freezing. And cramped. ("Cozy" is a euphemism.) You can make more interesting dishes at home for a lot less money, & you won't be sitting inside someone else's conversation..
