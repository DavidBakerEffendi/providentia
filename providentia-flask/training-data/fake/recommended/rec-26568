I'd like to start off by saying nothing is absolutely terrible about this place, but it's definitely not worth the money.  We made a reservation for two and were seated almost immediately. It was a bit cramped and loud, but it was fine for a table of two, not sure how comfortable I'd be with a large group. Once we placed our cocktail orders, it took about 20 minutes to receive them. I have no complaints about those and really enjoyed the drink with cucumber, but that could just be my bias.   We ordered the rock shrimp and a noodle dish for appetizers. The rock shrimp was definitely the best part of the meal.  The noodles weren't anything special and were literally just spaghetti with some glaze sauce that we had to mix in ourselves.  We shared an order of Saigon Beef, which again, was fine, but nothing I couldn't have made myself, and I'm not a great cook. Again, not bad, but I gave it two stars for it just not being worth the price.  I probably would not go here again.
