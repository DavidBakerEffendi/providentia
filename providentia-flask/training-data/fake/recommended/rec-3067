This was one of the most hyped openings this summer and given the headlines on the long waits I didn't think I'd be eating an umami burger this soon. (This review is over a month late..) Well, my bf and I decided to check them out one evening after cocktails at Greenwich Project. The wait wasn't terrible but it was long enough to have a chai at a nearby cafe. Once seated I quickly decided on having the Manly Burger and my bf had the Original. We split them in halves so we got a taste of both burgers. They were delicious! Definitely one of the best burgers you can have in NY right now. And as far as the taste goes I'm tempted to give them 5 stars. And I might, if I'm consistently impressed after future visits. But for now the wait is too long. And yes, there's a bar and you can order a bottle of wine with your burger but it's still a semi fast food joint that's fancied up to correspond the hype. And at $15 a burger it's right alongside other gourmet burgers in the city. I'm sure I'll be back but there are plenty of other burgers that rival the quality and flavor of Umami Burger in NY, in my opinion.
