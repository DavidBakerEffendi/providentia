My food editor recommended the East Village location to me over the summer, and I was immediately addicted. I could not be happier that the new Brooklyn location is a short 5-minute walk from my apartment. This location has much more seating (I've waited at the Manhattan location for 45 minutes) and an authentic, artsy South American vibe. And since the new location has yet to receive its liquor license, it's BYOB without a charge. But, the sangria is a must-have once they can serve it. I always order one of the appetizers on the menu, most recently the Yoyos, fried sweet plantain balls stuffed with cheese: delish. For the entree, my boyfriend and I both ordered the special shredded pork arepa plate, but every arepa and empanada that I have had is savory, tender goodness. The ensalada mixta is also fantastic: a simple, fresh bed of greens with avocado, hearts of palm, and finely shredded carrots with a light balsamic. Of course, this Venezuelan cuisine would not be complete without the restaurant's special orange sauce, a mysterious -- we even tried to pry the recipe from the manager! -- blend of hot peppers, vinegar, and maybe mango because it has a sweet tang to it. We bought a bottle for $7 and have already topped it on egg scrambles and quesadillas. Perfect for a date or dinner with friends, Caracas will leave your belly happy :)
