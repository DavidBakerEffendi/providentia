Crowded and very noisy and lots of people lined up at the bar. The scene is probably one that poeple like, the food is just average. The boullabaise is bland, the mussels were dry, the desserts were good. Very expensive for what we got. Maybe the people eating the raw oysters and drinking matinis had the right idea. Â Probably not a reapeast place for me.
