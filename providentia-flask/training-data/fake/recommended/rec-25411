Had an absolutely incredible dinner here tonight. Luckily enough the restaurant is open until 11pm on weeknights and decided to go here. My girlfriend and I were brought bread which was delicious and a couple of spreads based on olive oil in as well as some seasoning from Turkey. We ordered an appetizer sampler which consisted of four different choices that we decided on. The best appetizer we had was the eggplant salad which my girlfriend loved. We split the mixed grill which was more than enough food for four people and we took home a lot. The chicken was moist and the steak was delicious. This came with a side of the Tzatziki sauce. Finally we ordered a dessert based on a Turkish delicacy of shredded filo dough as well as feta cheese melted with honey and it was delicious. The service throughout dinner with phenomenal with the owners consistently bringing water and replenishing our drinks. We would come here again in a heartbeat and we recommend this place to anybody looking for a great dinner out.
