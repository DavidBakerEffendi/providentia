It's a diner that uses high quality ingredients and consistently doles out great diner food.  One of the best burgers in the area and definitely the best hot wings within miles.  I come here every time I need a hot wings fix.  Crispy.  Spicy.  Add some fries with that and you will not be disappointed.
