Oh my gosh - you can not go wrong with this place.  The beef skewers and the sliders! wow.  You can't beat the prices either.  Love the diverse menu and the freshness of all of their entrees and appetizers (eg the Seaford Martini!) absolutely delicious.  Can not wait to come back again.  Took a large crowd here the other night and everyone had a great time and loved the food.
