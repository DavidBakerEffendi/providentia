Wandered in here with my friend on the way to best buy union square, very big space with a lower level as well, very loud/chatty NYC brunching crowd, but thats to be expected. Was seated quickly at 12:15 pm, but i think any later may have been a wait. The waiter was nice, and I liked the entrees included a mimosa or orange juice (non alcoholic for me during the day time :) . Â The complimentary OJ came in a smallish cup, I guess what you'd expect for free.I went with the egg white omelet that came filled with goat cheese and spinach, prob some of the best goat cheese I've had in a while. It also had home fries that were made in the the tiny potatoe cube style that I absolutely love. Overall, a fun-filled brunch. I will have to venture out East (East village that is..) more often :).
