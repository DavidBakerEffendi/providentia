I really wanted to like you. I did. The high praise from yelp and the success on Top Chef seemed like wise reasons to choose you to be the place to celebrate my 6 year anniversary with the bf. But alas. Another restaurant where the hype precedes the actual meal. The cons: the duck breast! Served in two huge thick pieces, my medium rare breast was just too chewy and had sinew running through it. Even the other two parts of the dish were disappointing. The duck leg confit wrapped in crepe was boring.  Although the flavor was good, the seared foie gras needed something other than the accompanying nuts to provide contrasting texture.  The bf ordered the hanger steak.  The creamed spinach was delicious, but the steak itself was also chewy. Is medium rare actually rare in Perilla's dictionary? So what made me almost give Perilla 3 stars? Well, the signature spicy duck meatballs were good and comforting. Tasted even better after I ate a piece with the delicious table bread.  Also great was the gingerbread cake with all of its components from the salty caramel to the roasted pear.  Another great thing - Perilla's service. After noticing that I barely touched my dish, the busboy asked me if something was wrong with the duck.  Upon hearing that I thought it was too chewy, the busboy informed our waiter who later kindly told us that my entree was comped courtesy of the chef.  So the night didn't end badly from that perspective. But I'm afraid it's unlikely that I'll come back for a second chance.
