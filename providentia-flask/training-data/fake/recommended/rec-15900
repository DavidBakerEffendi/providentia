Last night, I went to Uva for the first time with a friend of mine, he's been a regular for the past months. This is the first place in NYC I really feel deserves 5 stars. Here is why, Service: First of all, the best service in NYC I've encountered in a reasonably priced bar ($$). The bartender Joel was very friendly yet respectful, made me feel welcome. Ambiance: Sexy lightning, the place has candles to give a bit of light movement and also artificial light to keep you from falling asleep or dizzy. Good music at the right volume. I stayed all time by the bar, so I can't tell about the varanda. Drinks: Well they have a huge wine selection. I am far from being a oenophile so I can't really judge it from this perspective. Nevertheless they take good care of your the wine presentation and the pricing is fair. Crowd: The place wasn't crowded at all. However it seems to me their proposal is to provide good intimate time for small groups, not to mingle strangers. I only have been there once, so this may not be the case always. Still if you sit in the bar you open your chances to meet an interesting person to chat with. All in all, knowing what I want and knowing what this place has to offer, I will be back.
