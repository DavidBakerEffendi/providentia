The best brunch I've had in NYC. Full stop. My friend and I are obsessed. I've been back three times and gotten the Norwegian all three times because it's that good. The salmon is some of the freshest and best I've tasted, the eggs are poached to perfection, and the cappuccino is heavenly. The orange juice tastes like someone is squeezing oranges into my mouth. The pricing is pretty decent too, especially if you get one of the brunch specials. SO much food and worth every penny. I will take everyone I know to brunch here.
