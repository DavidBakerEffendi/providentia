Uh-mazing. Great menu-had such a hard time deciding what to get! Good thing my boyfriend's family didn't either- they ended up ordering a bunch of things for us to split in addition to our own meals. Everything was incredible. Baked oatmeal, yogurt with granola, french toast, turkey apple brie sandwich, and.. some other things I forget what. Bottom line, everything was great. We were a big group and we were probably annoying to take orders for because my boyfriend and I got there after his family had already sat and ordered. Waiter was totally cool though, very patient, and real nice. And quick! Went there for brunch. Was crowded but liked the energy
