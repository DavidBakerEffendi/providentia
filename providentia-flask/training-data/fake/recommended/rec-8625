Had breakfast on New Years Eve day.  The server was slow to get our orders, and then we waited, and waited for our food.  Don't order the turkey sausage, it tasted like a combination of soap and lead paint.  The wheat toast came out rye.  The help seems a little put out, not overly customer oriented.
