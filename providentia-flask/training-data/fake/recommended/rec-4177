Let me just say this upfront. I'm a southerner, born and raised. Getting me or anyone else from the south to pay very much at all for "upscale" southern food is about as easy as finding really good Thai in Philly; it's possible, but it really takes some work. When my friends led me to Rex, I approached the situation cautiously. "$15 for red beans and rice, you say? Okay, fine. I'll pay, but these beans better BRING IT." Or so went my internal monologue, more or less. Well, Rex brought it. It brought me several things, actually, the first of which was the best new cocktail I've tried in a while. It's called Harvest, and the blend of apple brandy, bitters, elderflower liqueur, and apple-coriander shrub was just phenomenal. I feared it would be too sweet after reading "apple" twice, but it was perfect. And more potent than you'd think, which is always nice. For the victuals, I got the crawfish étouffée pot pie and a side of potatoes. (I should note that I was having a tooth problem at the time and had to stick with really soft foods, limiting my choices.) I also helped everyone else at the table finish their salads, mac and cheese, fried chicken, and burgers. My pot pie was delicious, though the small size meant that the filling-to-crust ratio was a bit off. I had some leftover crust, but that's no biggie. The filling, though creamier than any étouffée I've ever seen, was amazing. Everyone else was very pleased with their meals, and we left happy and full. I look forward to going back and getting poking around the menu a bit more.
