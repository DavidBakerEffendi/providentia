Thoroughly enjoyed my second meal at La Mezzaluna.  The portion sizes were perfect, the ambiance was great, and the wait staff was very attentive and helpful.  I love the fact that it is BYOB, and it is very convenient to have a liquor store selling wine next door to the restaurant.  My table enjoyed the pumpkin ravioli and eggplant for appetizers - the eggplants was to die for.  We all had specials for dinner, and each of us loved what we had been served.  We were seated quickly without a reservation, and treated like we were the most important people in the room. I'd go back in a heartbeat.
