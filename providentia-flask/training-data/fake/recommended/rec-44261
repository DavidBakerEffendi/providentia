Food was deliciousssssssssss. My boyfriend and I come here as often as we can. The shrimp was friend in heaven and hand delivered by angels. The fish sandwich is enough to feed like 4 small children. The service wasn't so great and the food takes a while (assuming because it is cooked to order) but it is definitely worth the wait. Might go back tonight actually.
