As a big fan of the original restaurant, I was extremely excited about the new China Town location. I really really really wanted to LOVE this place.  I did.  The food is just as delicious; however, the service leaves much to be desired. I've been twice and both times the service was horrendous. During my first visit, my meal arrived 15 minutes after everyone else's food.  No biggie, right?  Well it wouldn't have been an issue if it wasn't the WRONG dish and I had to wait another half hour for my food.  Even so, I retuned thinking it was just an isolated event. The second visit consisted of confusing glances from the server as we ordered, which should have tipped us off immediately for what was to come. Even though she repeated the orders prior to returning to the kitchen, more than half of them came out incorrect.  This was AFTER a good 20 minutes of being ignored at the table (no greeting, no wine glasses, etc). The top off the night, the server put all the wrong amounts on our credit cards and just giggled (yes, seriously) when we pointed out the mistake.  You know, because it's hilarious when you have the wrong amount on your credit card and all.   Don't get me wrong, the food was delicious but the service is BRUTAL.  Maybe next time I'll get take out...
