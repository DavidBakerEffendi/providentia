I heard about this famous cart with chicken and rice that was a must when visiting New York. I also saw Wong Fu Weekends go there and the long line that they waited in to get the food. Just a heads up, there are multiple halal carts that are the original within blocks of each other so you dont have to go to this specific crosstreet for the Halal Cart. I passed by one but it wasnt the one that was the Yelpiest but just go to any of the Halal Carts with that big ol yellow sign. Most likely this location will have a long line so you can walk a block away for a shorter line and the same food. Hours are ridiculous....open until 4am? Wish they had these kind of places in SF or something. The chicken and rice bowl is huge! My sister and I split it and were completely satisfied. It comes with loads and loads of chicken on top of rice, pita bread, and the white sauce that is an absolute must or it is a tad dry. We poured that sauce all over and mixed the two together to create the goods. The chicken reminds me of the one you would find in Vietnamese sandwiches since they are cut up pretty finely. I admit the place is good but I was really expecting some crazy deliciousness since so many people have reviewed it. Maybe it is so Yelpy because drunk people go here after a night out. I admit it is good but compared to the other places I ate in NY, this would be 3.5 stars. It is good to try to experience it but I wouldnt waste one of my precious meals on this again if visiting NY again. **TIPS** 1) There are multiple locations seriously within blocks of each other. Go to any. This one will have a huge line but luckily I beat the crowd. 2) Cash only and seats are wherever you can find a spot on ledges or floors. 3) Hours until 4am. This locations opens later but the other ones are 10am-4am. Ridic. 4) Enjoy!
