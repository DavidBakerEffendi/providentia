The Little Owl to me is the perfect restaurant.  The space is so quaint and inviting.  There is nothing pretentious about it.  And the food is absolutely amazing.  They don't try to make things overcomplicated, or bring too many flavors together.  They take something that seems simple, and make it taste out of this world.   I came here once for dinner about 3 years ago and have considered it my favorite restaurant ever since.  I finally made it back to New York recently and going to the Little Owl was at the top of my list of places to eat.  I came for lunch this time (couldn't get short notice reservations for dinner), and it was just as perfect as I had remembered it.  I had the artic char and a side of the chive mashed potatoes.  Everything was lovely.  I found myself savoring each and every bite because who knows when I'll be back again. And so I must say good bye to this darling little owl again.  Manhattan, do take good care of her while I am gone.
