got delivery from here. Ordered cheesy garlic bread and sicilian pie. First, the garlic bread: nothing special AT ALL. More like bread with cheese on it. Second, the sicilian pizza: Looked delicious, but was undercooked. I ate it up regardless, and in the middle of the night boy did I regret it. I was awakened by the biggest stomach ache ever. I assume, though I'm no doctor, that it was caused by all the undercooked dough I devoured! If it was crunchier or cooked thru, I am sure this pizza would have been phenomenal. The sauce was good. Only mistake: undercooking.
