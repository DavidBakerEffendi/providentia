Hey does anybody wants the absolute worst Dog shit steak sandwich of their life? Go to Gino's in Philly. Nothing beats a Nerf football consistency bread, with Tendons and grizzle throughout the entire sandwich. Tasteless unflavored meat by-product, with generic cellulose filled government cheese. What a god damn let down, I was going to throw this pile of shit sandwich back through the window but my Bro, and Mike wouldn't let me. Threw the crap out after 2 bites. You want a good cheese steak? go to anywhere but here. Pat's sucks too. Fuck both of them assholes for charging 10 bucks for garbage food that is inedible with 80% tendon/grizzle rubber meat. What a Scam, the're both inedible. I don't have the faintest idea who can give this place more than 1 star, It's absolutely the worst I have ever seen or tasted, Trust all the one star's they are no lying. The 5 star people must be paid to put reviews up. I could never imagine anything more worse than the scraps they serve. TERRIBLE! !! ! !! Â !
