After hearing great things about this place, we finally tried it last night. I was excited to try the tapas plates and the wine selection looked great. Here's what we ordered and our comments: Risotto balls with truffle oil - these were delicious, I enjoyed them but I enjoy a softer and more delicate texture. Truffle oil is a nice touch Open faced short rib baguette - very tasty and very rich sandwich. Luckily I shared every dish with my husband since this is a fairly large plate True greens - very simple salad with a nice vinaigrette. Great to have some veggies to cut down on the rich food Spicy Shrimp Buns - I was really hoping for spicy but ended up with no spice at all. There were two extra large shrimp in each of the Asian buns. A little messy to eat and a little bland. Maybe they forgot to add the sauce? Chicken wing confit - very garlicky, gingery, and soy sauce mixed together with wings and scallion pancakes. Way too salty for me and I had a garlicky taste in my mouth until the next morning but my husband really liked it since the meat fell off the bones Wines - I really loved the gundlach bundschu mountain cuvee and the cakebread Cabernet. My husband tried the cote du rhone and also enjoyed it. Â They have a great wine list and I liked that you can try some expensive wines. Overall, the dishes are well done even though I wasn't a fan of everything we ordered. I was hoping for some more vegetable options on the menu. Service was great, the waitress was extremely friendly. Price on the other hand was a bit on the expensive side. Be prepared to pay $15 per plate and some are relatively small plates. This was expected since we were in blue back square but I think they are a bit overpriced - should be closer to $10 per plate for the portion size.
