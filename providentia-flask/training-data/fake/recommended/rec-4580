I visited this restaurant with my Brooklyn gal friend Hilary (hilarybg.yelp.com), after reading about it in a food blog I really love (smittenkitchen.com).  It did not disappoint. We each had a glass of wine.  Too expensive, obviously, as the cheapest glass was $9.  I know we're in NYC, but come on. I'd heard so much about the fried chickpeas, those were a definite order.  We also ordered the patatas bravas, the gambas al ajillo, and the pan con tomate y tres salsas.  All were amazing.  Those fried chickpeas are addictive.  We chose to share chocolate flan for dessert (it was a special that day), and it was so rich and delicious I almost cried when it was gone. The bar area -- we ate at the bar -- is open to the street.  I never really saw the back of the restaurant, except a quick peek when I went to use the restroom.  It is incredibly narrow, and they try to make too much use of the space.  The walking room between the people sitting at the bar, and the tiny shelf along the opposite wall where other people are waiting for their tables with glasses of wine, is minimal.  And not in a cute way.  It's a little anxiety-inducing.  Like driving down a one-way street and then feeling like you need to back out but knowing you can't.  That narrow.  It makes for a noisy, sometimes uncomfortable environment in the bar area. The food and service were great so 4 stars despite the physical discomfort.
