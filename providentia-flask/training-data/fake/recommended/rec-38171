I have been coming to Geronimo's for years and I could go on and on about how delicious the food is and how nice the ambiance is, however, what makes Geronimo's special to me is the people who work there.  Hugo, the waiter, is the reason why I have recommended the restaurant to so many people.  He is extremely friendly and professional.  At most restaurants you will typically find that the employees are usually one or the other, but Hugo greeted my table with a very authentic hello and smile.  He was extremely attentive to our big group even though the restaurant was crowded.  Whenever anybody wanted to order more food or drinks he was right behind us ready to serve.  His knowledge for the menu is also top notch.  I absolutely love all of his recommendations.
