I really like this place. The food was great. The service was supar, and the staff were very friendly. I went there with my 2 year old daughter. We didn't want anything too fancy because we had a child, so we just wanted something quick and good. The place is in a cute upcoming neighborhood. They were really nice to my daughter and gave her cute little sushi rolls for her size. She had so much fun there. They also gave us some extra stuff for free. Other than that, we had a great time as a family and will be there again to visit.
