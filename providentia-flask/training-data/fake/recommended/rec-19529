Not much to say here that hasn't already been said, so I'll say it a bit differently.  Oh. Mah. Gah.  This place rocks.  Came here on a recommendation from a friend.  I ran the Philly Marathon and was looking forward to a post-race brunch if my belly was up for it.  And it was (thank you, belly).  Called ahead 20 minutes and had to wait about 10 minutes when we arrived at 1:30pm on Sunday.  I ordered the stuffed challah french toast with a side of turkey bacon and scrambled eggs.  Too much.  I keep a list of "Top 5" bites of food, and welcomed the french toast to this list with open arms.  I feared that the filling would be too sweet and overwhelm the plate, but it was perfectly balanced.  The turkey bacon was thicker than expected, which made it delicious-er than expected.  My fiance got the eggs benedict florentine, which she said was good also, but couldn't finish (and by the looks she kept giving my way, she was definitely jealous of the french toast).   Have I mentioned the stuffed french toast is awesome?  I'll definitely be back here.
