This fun eatery is conveniently situated right in the middle of the swanky Walnut St neighborhood (street parking only). The storefront is unassuming, but you walk into a pretty big open space with tables all along the perimeter. We came on a Thurs night and just about every table was taken. The middle is just wide open space, which makes for a little bit of an awkward layout. The lighting is also very stark. Looks more like a cafeteria than a restaurant...but no matter. My friends each ordered the large traditional Mac, and I got the small white truffle Mac. Both were really good! Hot and cheesy with a light bread crumb topping. By the way, their paper menus do not distinguish between sizes...I only knew they had small and large portions from checking it out online. I think they should fix this. The small size was plenty for me. My friends couldn't finish the large (next day's lunch). Everything is served in tin containers - no plates here - but easy to pack up and take home. Also, no metal utensils. We only got plasticware. I think I'd prefer metal... I also got a side of the Manchego sticks, and my friends got the parm & herb fries. Not crazy about either. The Manchego sticks were mostly bread and oil (too greasy) and the seasoning on the fries wouldn't hold. It just falls right off. I will say, that the side of paprika aioli is really nice and flavorful, a perfect condiment to this menu. I give this place 4 stars for good mac&cheese, very friendly and attentive service, and an interesting menu. I'd like to come back and try out one of their grilled cheeses.
