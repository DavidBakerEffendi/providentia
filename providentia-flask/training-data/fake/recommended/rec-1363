Ok I am here to give you an honest appraisal of both Pat's and Geno's.  Being from out of town, I wanted to experience each place so my wife and I purchased one "wit whiz, wit" from each place.  You will find Geno's review on their site. Pat's was by far the more flavorful.  It actually had some spices working to flavor the meat.  The meat was tender and the onions were cooked.  Whiz is Whiz.  Not one of the best sandwiches I have had, in fact, we have Big John's Steak at home, a local chain, and their sandwich is far superior to either of these "Philly steaks".   Both of these establishments are in a really bad part of town.  The parking is difficult.  We were able to park a block away and walk.  The smells, how shall I describe it......we parked in front of a storefront that was raising chickens.  The smell was overwhelming and it was chicken crap.  There is garbage everywhere.  Someone needs to tell these Philadelphians that they need to put their garbage in a can, not on the street or sidewalk.  So much litter and garbage it was hard to walk on the sidewalk.   I would not recommend this place to anyone.  Go to Reading terminal market and find a good place to eat if you want a Philly cheese steak.  At least you have a place to sit and dessert is just steps away.   Have to give it 2 stars because I have to give Geno's at least one star.  I really think this is a 1 star place. Find a Good Place to eat, preferably outside Philly.
