Reasonable.  Went in ~20 min before close ordered an Italian Grinder to go and got a free can of soda.  Nice gesture.  Actually went light on the mayo for the grinder which was nice too...some places slab it on so much that's all you taste. Enough to do another round at some point.  Though seeing the pizza reviews (which I was considering) I'll probably stay away from that.
