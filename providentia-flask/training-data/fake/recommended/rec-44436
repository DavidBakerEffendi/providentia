This is not a place I will be dining at again. Food was just ok. Stay away from their balsamic vinegar though - I asked for vinegar and oil for cold antipasto dish - vinegar was so old it came out like slimey Â  bogers. The service was poor. We sat in a nice raised booth. Well at least we thought it was nice until we noticed the filth on the walls.
