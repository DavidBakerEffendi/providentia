[review for gourmet-to-go] I ate here both days I was in Philly recently. I also ate the chicken quesadilla both days. It was delicious when it was piping hot and it was just as delicious after it had sat in a cold car for 10 hours. An extra special added bonus to Govindas is the sweet treats! High fives to the assortment of vegan cakes and ice creams!
