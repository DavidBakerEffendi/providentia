Rudy's has been our go to bar food location for years. I have searched far and wide and have yet to taste better fries (sorry, Duckfat, Portland). The beer selection is eclectic, with a bit more European influence than other craft beer bars in the area. The other food on the menu is usually a hit, with the occasional misstep as they keep the menu seasonal (ask for advice, the staff will be candid). For those looking for a bar atmosphere, but not wanting fried food, there are decent salads & entrees that haven't come close to the deep fryer (beet salad and Caesar are both well done). Go to Rudy's - get fries, be very happy :)
