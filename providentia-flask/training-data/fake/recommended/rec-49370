If you're starving and you're on the brink of cannibalism, then Pisillo is your spot. The shop is small but its not a hole-in-a wall; it's an italian nest/haven for the oh-so crowded and industrialized FiDi. They have an extensive sandwich menu and everything looks incredibly delicious but I failed and ordered the vegetarian sandwich. Don't get me wrong, Â the sandwich was pretty good but it wasn't everything I wanted it to be. I'm a "practicing " vegetarian and was craving a good ol' sandwich but I'm realizing now that you can't order an Italian sandwich without meat and cheese. It just doesn't make any sense. The veggies were cold , which I hoped would be served warm but they tasted very good nonetheless. I don't think think Clifford the dog could finish this sandwich. It's HUGE. Such a plus. I'm set for Lunch+Dinner . WIN. I definitely plan on coming back many, many times. My only criticism is that it's cash only. Not that I refuse paying cash for exceptionally good sandwiches it's just inconvenient. Especially for the area.
