Visited this DEEEElicious establishment and was not disappointed! Arrived Friday morning for breakfast before the rush! The place is tiny, but did not expect Friday morning to be so crazy! Found a seat in on the counter in front of the window (great for people watching...watching you enjoy your food!!) We took our time eating our wonderful breakfast! Mexican coffee Spanish biscuit sandwich with chorizo Southern breakfast The fried green tomatoes with jalapeno sour cream..delish!! Sugar cured bacon..delish!! Cheese grits...delish!! No disappointments here! And if its tooo crowded..order to go and eat it on a park bench!! just as delicious!!! Just go EAT!
