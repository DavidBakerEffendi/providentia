We live nearby and was so happy to see this place open.  Finally tried their food today.  We ordered for pickup which was speedily prepped and ready in 12 mins.  We got the Memo burger, fries, Windy City (pork sandwich) and Quinoa salad.   When my husband went to pick up the food, we were pleasantly surprised when the guy threw in a freebie blondie in our order.  Thanks! Food was great.  We especially liked the burger, fries and the quinoa salad.  The pork sandwich was cooked well, tasted good but we would have preferred if it was a tad saltier and flavorful.   Overall, a great experience.  Looking forward to trying the other items on their menu.
