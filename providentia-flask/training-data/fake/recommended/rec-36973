Though I love the food and the people there, the service is really slow. But once you finally get the meal in front of you, you are in heaven. If you are into traditional Caribbean meals, or want to try them, this is the place for you. The owner is a doll and though the service is a little slow for my liking, it's definitely worth the wait.
