this place was soo good. our server Michael was the best server i have ever had at a restaurant. he knew the menu and wine list in and out and made perfect recommendations for me. I had the black bass which was absolutely delicious, and the asparagus appetizer and brussel sprouts were soo yummy. Â Definitely going back there!
