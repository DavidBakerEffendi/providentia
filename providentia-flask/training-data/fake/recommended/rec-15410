Nothing catastrophic happened at this dinner. Service was fine, they got us out in plenty of time for our curtain. But I was disappointed with the food. We got the endless pasta thing. The Caesar salad was fine but nothing special. Of the pastas, the gnocchi was very good, but the other two were a step below what I can easily make at home - a gemelli with broccoli and a pappardelle with tomato sauce. Price was right but I was expecting more from Lidia.
