My wife and I took friends from Texas there for authentic Italian dinner. It was an extremely busy night with a line out the door. We were seated in minutes and our waiter was fantastic - VERY attentive. The wine was cold and delicious. We got the artichoke appetizer which had a little too much anchovy, but was otherwise delicious. Just too rich to eat too much of it. For dinner, my wife had the Veal Scallopini with eggplant and loved it. I had the Pollo alla limone with shrimp and it was also quite delicious. Breading was a little soggy from the lemon broth but the taste and tenderness made up for it! Delicious dinner and great ambience for the feel of LIttle Italy. Our waiter was truly the best, especially for how crowded the restaurant was on a Saturday night near Christmas. We'll definitely go back.
