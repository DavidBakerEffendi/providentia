Pretty good. A little hole in the wall place with dated decor. The pho and crispy spring rolls were both sufficent. Two of us ate here for a total of $18. Service was good and quick. After we sat down and ordered, our food came out in like 5 mins!! My steak however was really fatty but my fianc√©'s was better... Maybe I just got a bad cut or something. We will return here again if we are in the city and need a cheap meal... Won't go out of our way however.
