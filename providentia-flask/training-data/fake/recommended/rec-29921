too f@#$%^&*in' good to believe.  off scale in essentially every dimension my personal fave is the whole boneless porgy.  Liked it so much I ordered a second. Was even thinking about a third... It's one of those restaurants that makes me wonder... why did I spend all those years not living in New York...? ;^)
