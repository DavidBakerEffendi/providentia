I just plain and simple really liked this place. I came with my husband and one year old and they placed at the the perfect little table outside out of the way of most people. It was a Sunday night but they were slammed so I assume this place gets crazy on the weekends. I started with a Watermelon Martini which was a little weak for my taste, but was delicious none the less. We ordered tapas and entrees (we pig out when we get the chance to go out) and everything was perfect. I got the Mahi-Mahi which was soooo yummy and we shared the croquettes. For whatever reason, the food just isn't that memorable (hence four stars as opposed to five), it was cooked perfectly and tasted good, our service was good, and the atmosphere was nice, but some mysterious factor was missing. I would most def come here again though...especially if I lived in the area.
