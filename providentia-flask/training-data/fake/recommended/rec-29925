Super owner and staff from Istanbul, Turkey.  So friendly and they give great service.  The Turkish wines are surprisingly good and the food is tasty too.  The downstairs seating lets you see a pretty tree line street in one of NYC's nicest neighborhoods and still close to the wildness of 2nd Avenue if you want to partake of it later in the evening.  Great for date night and their happy hour is a great deal.  The outdoor seating in summer and spring is the best in the area.
