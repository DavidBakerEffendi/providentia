Ok.. So this is the real Halal Guys food truck! Literally!! There's so many in NY but this is the right one to go to because the food is way better!!! They are also open after bar hours and thats the best time to have Halal!! Lol! I usually get the lamb and chicken mix! And please dont put too much hot sauce! Ppl who never tried halal guys should just have 2 drops or even 1 and that should be hot enough for u! Take my advice!! And please bring some extra white sauce with u, u'll thank me later lol
