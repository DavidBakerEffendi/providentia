Joseph-bartender server extraordinaire, was amazing! He made our experience so enjoyable. Timing was impeccable, suggestions were mouth watering (we ordered WAY outside both our comfort zones and loved it!) and he never felt rushed or distracted when at our table. My honey and I were highly impressed! The food was delicious and his wine recommendations were on point. All other bussers and runners were engaging and helpful as well. If you want to sit back, relax and enjoy, then come here and trust him. He clearly knows what he's doing. Bravo!
