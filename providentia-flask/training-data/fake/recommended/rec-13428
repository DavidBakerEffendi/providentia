Best burger of my life! We went here to try to get brunch but there was a 45minute wait and they stop serving brunch items at 3pm. The hostess was very friendly and took our cell phone number so that we could go get a beer somewhere while we waited as their bar was full. There was another bar about 100 feet from there. We were sat at a table upstairs. The tables are tiny bistro tables with white table cloths and butcher paper. The decor is super cute with a farm house feel. The waitress was attentive and friendly. We decided to order the deviled eggs for an appetizer. They are really delicious, the filling is the creamiest filling I have ever had in a deviled egg. One appetizer is two halfs of an egg. We decided to share a burger after seeing the size of these things it was plenty of food for my husband and I.The burger has Roquefort cheese and is served with shoe string fries. This burger was so delicious, juicy and pretty much perfect with its simplicity. I absolutely love french fries and these were delicious. They give you a lot of them and we were not able to eat them all. I will definitely return to the Spotted Pig!!
