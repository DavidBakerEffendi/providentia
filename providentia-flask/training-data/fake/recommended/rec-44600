I think that Penelope's thrives mainly on their location- random little cozy cafe in Curry Hill, that serves a decent brunch. I've been to Penelope's for both their weekend brunch and regular weekday breakfast. Brunch on the weekends is PACKED. They don't take reservations, and the wait can take forever. On regular weekdays, however, the place is quiet in the mornings and provides a nice atmosphere to relax and read the paper. As for the food, 4 stars for the Nutella French Toast. Everything else i've tried..from the eggs to the pumpkin pancakes has just been mediocre. I've only returned for their Nutella French Toast.
