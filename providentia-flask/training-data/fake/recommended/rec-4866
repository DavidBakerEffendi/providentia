I am totally digging the Hawthorne's vibe....cozy fireplace, friendly staff, fantastic food with a number of creative options and an amzing beer selection. The dude who works in th eBiercafe is extremely knowledgeable about their diverse beer selection. I have eaten here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and all three meals were awesome. My only con is that the hot chocolate was a bit blah. PS I luv drinking out of mason jars :)
