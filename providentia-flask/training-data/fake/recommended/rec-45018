loved the little owl!  had brunch with the girls on a sunday, and everything was delicious (sliders, brussels sprouts, eggs, coffee, etc.).  we did end up getting there before it opened to get a table, but were able to get seated right away, despite the line.  they also play really great oldies, which i dug.  so cute; can't wait to go back!
