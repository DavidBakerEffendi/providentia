Decor: ornate, tasteful, warm and regal.  Our waiter said it took 2.5 years to build because the furniture was shipped from France.  Of all the places in NYC, this is the most beautifully decorated restaurant.  The modern, sleek, contemporary look is usually my style, but Bouley does it so tastefully without being excessive that it makes it my favorite restaurant in the decor category. The other categories fair very well also. Service: attentive, helpful but not intrusive.  The staff is so friendly.  Several people happily taking pictures for us inside and outside the restaurant, striking up random conversations.  We had several servers for our table, so nothing to complain about service.  They were warm and personable, joking around with us a little.  We asked one server about the restaurant's different dining rooms and we ended up getting a tour of the restaurant, kitchen(!!) and got to see Chef Bouley working (!!!!). Food: AMAZING. We did the tasting menu and were so full.  But still managed to almost finish the extra dessert on the house because we were celebrating our anniversary.   It was a wonderful anniversary lunch.
