Unforgettable experience. My favorite restaurant hands down! Their***** spicy cucumber margaritas with spicy salt rim ******are TO DIE FOR. Order chips and guac for appetizer and don't hold back on anything on the menu because they are all delicious. I had the enchiladas and my friend ordered the braised chicken with plantain dish and it was amazing. We are going back from Boston just for my birthday soon to go back to Ofrenda. ofrendanyc.com do it When I give something 5 Stars, it is!! P.S EXCELLENT STAFF. COULD NOT BE ANY NICER!!
