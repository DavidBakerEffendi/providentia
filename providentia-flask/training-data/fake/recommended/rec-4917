I was there on a Monday at 11:45, we both ordered chicken dishes one being Pad Thai. The food came out in 5 minutes tops. The chicken was clearly reheated, gross reheated like microwaved with that fishy taste. They had only been opened for 45 minutes so either it was from the night prior or they make it all first thing so they can reheat. The vegetables were fine, but I couldn't get past the chicken.
