Needs new management!! With so many good brunch places in the city, I do not feel the need to go back to one where the management has no respect for their customers. We recently ate at Green Eggs, and had a terrible interaction with the "manager," Nick. The restaurant was out of the food that we ordered, but did not let us know until about 25 min after we ordered. The waitress took her time in getting us a menu so we could choose another item. In the meantime our food arrived, and the kitchen sent us food that we didnt order - but not to make up for being out of items- they apparently figured we could just eat that instead. When our waitress was unfazed by this we asked to speak with the manager. He didn't seem to understand why we woudlnt just eat what we were served, and his response was that we had three options: 1. wait another 30 min while they made something else, 2.eat what we were given or 3. leave. I have never had a manager tell me I should leave before. It was rude, uncalled for and an inappropriate way to handle the situation. With rats at one location, and a rude manager at another, I see no need to give this restaurant my money again.
