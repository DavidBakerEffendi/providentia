Get the Burger! Hurry up and get over there! This is the oldest place to get an authetic burger. No extra seasongs ect ect, just plain meat, juicy and perfectly cooked. Pickles, lettuce, tomato and a soft bun. Round and plumpy. I dont even like hambugers and I hadnt eatn red meat in 6 months and cracked at this place. CRISPY DELICOUS fries!
