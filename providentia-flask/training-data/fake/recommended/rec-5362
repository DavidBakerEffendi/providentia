Went here for brunch, and we sat on the rooftop area. The service was SO SLOW. Our waitress, Kelly, was pretty inattentive. Sitting in the hot sun without a water refill was not the best. We ordered a couple of entr√©es and some sides. The food was okay..a little on the saltier side. The atmosphere was awesome, and the decor was great. I think it'd be better to come here for a drink, not to have a sit down meal.
