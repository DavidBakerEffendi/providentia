My friend said that I HAD to try Halal food in NY, and so I had to try it from the original place that sold it! The food was delicious, and the white sauce was amazeballs. For $6, they give you a ridiculously large portion. $6 is ridiculously cheap in NY too. Highly recommend coming here if you want Halal food. So why the three stars? Well...as good as the food was, I actually threw everything up the night of a few hours after I ate it. I felt a little unwell a few hours after the food and I thought it would just digest. I woke up in the middle of the night and threw everything up. It might be because I'm from California or my family has a history of weak stomach, but regardless...I emptied my stomach. HOWEVER, with that said, IF you have an iron-cast stomach, I highly recommend it. I really wish it didn't make me throw up because it was delicious and every time I walk by a Halal food cart and smell it, it makes me feel a bit nauseous. :(
