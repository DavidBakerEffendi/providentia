It's the closest thing to time travel that Philly has to offer.  Walk in and enjoy a bar experience that is so difficult to find anymore (yet so often attempted).  It's like 60 or 70 years have melted away. Belly up to the bar and watch them mix their magic.  I challenge you to find a better place to get a drink in Philly. I've only eaten there twice, both times good, but the bar is the shining star.
