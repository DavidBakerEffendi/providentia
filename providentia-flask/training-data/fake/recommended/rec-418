Came here on a weekday, was seated promptly as it wasn't crowded. Their menu was pretty decent with different variations to choose from. To start we ordered the Mahi-Mahi Taqitos for the app. It wasn't bad, although it tasted like an avocado sauce fish taco. For the entrees my friend ordered the Paella, and I decided on Shrimp risotto. The dishes was good enough portion per person, but the price was pretty hefty. My risotto wasn't all that special, neither was my friend's Paella. Overall, just wasn't impressed with the dishes.
