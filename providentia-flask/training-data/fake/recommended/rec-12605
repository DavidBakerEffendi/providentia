Why is everything better in New York... I seriously want to move here just for the food. Anyway, I really enjoyed my first time at Ippudo. My bf and I came here around 10:45am, about 15 mins before it opened and there were 3 people in line ahead of us. By the time 11am came around, there were about 15 people. So many people have recommended this place to me so I had to try it out during my visit to NYC. I thought they would overhype it for me, but everything was so freaking delicious. We started off with their famous pork buns; SO GOOD. I would have ordered another if I didn't know it would make me too full. For my ramen, I ordered the Akamaru Modern with a soft-boiled egg and pork belly. Omg better than any ramen I've tried on the west coast. The broth was so flavorful and delicious. Also, their service is good and pretty fast. The tables inside are shared so don't expect to have your own, but it's pretty cool that you can watch the chefs prepare your meals as well if you're lucky enough to sit on that side of the restaurant. I highly recommend coming when this place opens unless you want to wait 2-3 hours!
