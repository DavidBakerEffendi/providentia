I would say overall I really liked this place and will be going back. I went this weekend for the first time. My friend and I got there early- about 7:15, so there wasn't a wait. But as we were eating a line began to form. We both got the Jalape√±o-lime margarita, since we both love food with a kick.. And boy did it have a kick. It wasn't enjoyable how hot the margartia was, it painfully burned the back of my throat. The regular margarita was very good though. We shared the chips and salsa, which comes with 3 types of salsa. They were delicious. The chips are freshly made, but be forewarned that chip refills are $2.50. We shared the chicken tacos and the enchiladas de mole. The chicken tacos were delicious and I will definitely get those next time and not share them! However I wasn't a fan of the enchiladas de mole, granted I've never had mole sauce before and wasn't really a fan of the taste, but I found the chicken to be very dry. The only reason I deducted a star was because of the service. It started out really well, the waitress took our drink order and asked if we wanted some chips and guacamole, we said we were still looking at the menu and need a minute. Our drinks were brought by someone else, but right away. Then our waitress was no where in sight for like 15-20 minutes.
