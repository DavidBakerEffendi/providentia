We had a horrible experience for dinner for two on a weekday night. Before getting to the food, I have to comment on the service -- awful.  It took about 10 minutes before the server even came and gave us water.  We then asked for bread and never got it.  There was a good 20 minute lapse between our appetizer and entrees.  We got the beef braised gnocci (too salty) and the linguine with (tiny) clams.  Linguine was barely al dente and nothing to write home about.  The server came by maybe twice during the entire meal -- the beginning and when we were ready for the check.  Oh wait, it was actually three times, the last for refill the water after we had asked 15 minutes earlier.   The food was nothing great (would go to La Viola any day) and to top it off, the service was just terrible for an Italian restaurant that earns itself one star.
