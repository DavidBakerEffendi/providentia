This is not the place for tourists, it's the real deal! The beef was done perfectly, the roll was moist and warm, the cheese perfectly melted. I had the vinegar fries, they were good, but could have been cooked just a little more. I came from Portland Oregon for this cheese steak sandwich and I'd do it again in a heart beat! Â Chef Barbie drove 100 miles an hour to get me there, what a ride, what a cheesesteak!!!!!
