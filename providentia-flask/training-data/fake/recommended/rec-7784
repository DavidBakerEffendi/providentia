I read about Tasty hand-pulled noodles inc. in an article about cheap eats in NYC and thought, "could the name be anymore obvious?" but it does make for a good laugh. Like the name says the place specializes in hand-pulled noodles. It's located in a random alleyway of Chinatown but its definitely worth it- where else can you fill up on legit food for a super cheap price! NO WHERE? the service wasn't even bad as i was secretly suspecting. My friends and I came a bit before dinner time and two ladies were sitting by our table prepping dumplings. I ordered the mixed beef hand-pulled noodles, i think i'd just stick with the regular one next time. But the lady even apologized explaining that maybe I wasn't used to the tripe- It wasn't a problem, more that I wasn't that hungry-but it was a nice gesture for her to chat with us and discuss the food.
