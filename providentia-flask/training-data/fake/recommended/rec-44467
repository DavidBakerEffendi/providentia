I went here for brunch on a Tuesday morning and every table was full so that speaks for itself.  After a short wait(~10 minutes) I was seated. The food came fast.  Everything was delicious. It was also surprisingly affordable. For coffee and breakfast for two we spent about $20 with tip. The staff was friendly and the place was unique. Would definitely recommend.
