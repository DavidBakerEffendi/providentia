I would say this place is more 3.5 stars or perhaps even 3.75 stars.  Alas, Yelp does not let you deal in decimals or fractions, so I suppose I will give this place 3 stars.  If I were in a better mood perhaps it would be 4. Anyway, I do recommend taking the ferry out to Staten Island and then walking the short distance to 76 Bay Street.  A fun day, to be sure.  The place is unpretentious and seems filled with locals.  The pizza is good.  I got half plain, half sausage and onions.  The problem with the toppings half was that there were too many toppings.  For some, that might be a good thing, but some times too much is too much.  The toppings completely overwhelmed the pizza and the onions were not cooked quite enough.  Still, it was enjoyable, and the plain half was even more enjoyable. The End.
