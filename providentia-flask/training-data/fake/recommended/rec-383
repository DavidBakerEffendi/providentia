The bar is totally a laid back, classy spot.  It's not divey, but nor is it super pretentious.  I was there last weekend, and Cuba Gooding Jr. ended up walking in around 1:00am.  I didn't expect that, but it's the kind of bar that you might expect to see a celebrity walk in like that. The drinks are great.  I had some scotch based drinks and tried some of their beers on tap (beers are not the usual suspects).  I had a Hefenweizen beer that was tasty and the various cocktails totally tasty. The crowd is made up of young professionals, generally above average in looks, who are generally dressed casual (but for going out).  Casual here is like jeans and a button up shirt or cool tshirt for the guys, and similar for the women.  I didn't get the sense it was the kind of bar though that you get dressed up for. All-in-all if you haven't tried Highlands, give a try.  It's a great mix of classy and laid back elements you would expect from a dive (w/o being a dive).
