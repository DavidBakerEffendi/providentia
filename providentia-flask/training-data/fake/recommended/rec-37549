Forget New York, these steaks are what dreams are made out of. You aint everyday hustlin' till you get some of this. (Btw, Rick Ross, aka Officer Ricky, is the police but he loves this place so we'll give him a free pass) Back to Max's. Best steaks in Philly. Edges out Chink's. I saw the massive amounts of meat they were piling on as I waited for mine, so I expected that to be good. But two things surprised me: 1. The bread - most underrated part of a cheese steak. This is where places like Dalessando's gets crushed by Max's (Pat's and Geno's aren't even in the same city as the conversation... uh... figure of speech). I can't even describe the bread Max's uses - it fits the meat and just gets it done. 2. The spice - I asked for some peppers and hot sauce on mine and this was pretty legit hot sauce. It hit the spot on hot. They do sorta take their sweet time making the steaks, but it is no doubt worth the wait. You can't rush art. Now the real question is... if this is the best steak joint in Philly, is it the best in the world?
