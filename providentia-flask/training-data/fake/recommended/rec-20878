Pizza for breakfast?   Sotto 13 has great brunch deals that comes at a prefix with drinks that you can make bottomless. Unfortunately Sotto 13 caps your morning drinkfest at 90 minutes but seems to be loosely enforced when it's your birthday. Came here for my big sis' bday, who wanted pizza for brunch and we came to the right place. Mushroom pizza with truffle oil and if you're missing breakfast too much then add an egg on top is delicious, especially to wash it down with your mimosa.   Don't care for pizza in the morning? The prefixes come with classic breakfast dishes.  Get the bacon well done if you like it crispy.  Lamb sausage was a bit too salty for me.  Skirt steak and eggs over a bed of crispy hash browns was on point. Very family style brunch, works perfect for bday brunch because you'll look forward to the siesta after all those mimosas!
