Frankford Hall was pretty awesome on my first visit! I loved the bench seating. With everyone, including strangers, sitting on one big picnic table, it was easy to make new friends and feel like you were hanging out in an open atmosphere. The beers come in two sizes. Large and Friggin' Huge! Half liter and full liter to be exact. Nothing feels better than carrying around a huge honking mug filled with German beer! Finally, the pretzels they serve were so good with the EXTRA spicy mustard. I'm going to be going back, hopefully to try dinner and not just going out to drink, but so far this place gets high marks for originality and fun.
