OMG, this is the best, most amazing falafel sandwich i've ever had!  can't wait to come back the next time i'm in philly.  and the fries are ridiculously good, too, and it's a huge portion -- definitely meant for sharing. gotta remind myself that they're closed on saturdays, so i'm not all falafel-deprived when i'm in the city.
