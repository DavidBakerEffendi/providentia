Just returned from a fantastic dinner at Ocean Prime. The decor and ambiance really helped make the night feel special. Wait til you see their bar--quite a colorful view. The service was a little erratic at times (our entrees came out while we were finishing our apps) but overall excellent. The food was cooked to perfection! My wife and our friends each had the Ivory Salmon special while I ate the Scallops and Short Rib app for dinner. Everything was amazing and the Baked Alaska was the perfect way to top off the evening. Will certainly go back again.
