Was hoping to see more stars for this since it's my home cuisine. Sadly, I've had better. Work in flatiron area and wanted some coworkers to try filipino food so an order was placed. First off at 12:30 the ran out of kare-kare...c'mon now! Fine so no tails today. Instead ordered lumpiang sariwa (disappointed with the mushed up pan wok-ed veggies and flavorless garlic sauce). It was a big lump but not worth $10 for 1 piece. Also ordered chicken adobo, pork adobo and pork BBQ sticks. The BBQ meat could have been a bit more tender and seasonings...what seasonings? Didn't even have the gumption to try the adobo cause I believed I'm better off not knowing and thinking I didn't let my friends down. Overall expected more authentic taste and better execution. Don't think I'll be back and stick to my own or family cooking. The resto in Westbury (Guiradelco) we go to is much better...didn't expect that from a place in Long Island versus NYC.
