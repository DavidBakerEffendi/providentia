I wish I lived closer! I have never had a bad meal here. My go to is the Turkey burger California style while my fiance usually goes for the burger of the week. Don't forget the bubbling crab dip to start. While the food is great it's the beer that keeps us coming back. With an ever revolving selection of craft beer there is always something new to try. Plus they don't have Bud or Coors on the menu!
