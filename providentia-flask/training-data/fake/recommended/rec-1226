Growing up in South Philly, 34 years, Â Geno's steaks were once a great enjoyable sandwich. Now they've gotten cheaper meat which is nothing but fat and charge way too much for a sandwich. They have just become more commercialized. There is nothing special about this sandwich except the name. Sorry Geno's, you're just not the same steak anymore.
