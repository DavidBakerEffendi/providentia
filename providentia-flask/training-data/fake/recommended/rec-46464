brunch was awesome!  great spot for my friends and i to work over a hangover by drinking more.  i am NOT a fan of sangria BUT this place has awesome sangria, the fresas I believe.  the food was ooook, i think i ordered a blaze dish, a quesadilla.....my friend had tacos from the taco cart and they were pretty good.  waiter was patient, bill was inexpensive, we had fun!  will be back and will try a different dish!
