My boyfriend and I came here after reading all of the positive Yelp reviews - pat on the back for all of you! The food was beyond amazing.  We ordered miso soup, maguro poki, cream croquette (omg, delish!) and chicken and king salmon katsu.  Oh gosh, I'd frequent this restaurant as often as I could if it wasn't for the thousands of miles separating us.  Katsu-Hama is just too good!
