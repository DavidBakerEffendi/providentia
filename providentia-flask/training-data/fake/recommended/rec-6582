Went here last night for the first time. The place was busy round 9 and even though we had reservations we waited about 15minutes, a good sign. Everyone from the Hostess to the Wait Staff were really nice, and welcoming (true Greek style). The Waiter helped us choose an amazing greek wine, and then it started. Dish after dish of amazing well prepared, hot food. We had the mousakka with grapes and pine nuts a def new favorite and The whole fish grilled with olive oil and lemon juice. (amazing) and the lemon greek potatoes. Plus a couple of other dishes that were equally as good. By the time we hit desert, (make sure you try the yogurt with honey and walnuts and cherries and topped off with Greek coffee) we were full even though we only ordered one entree. Will def go back and highly recommend this place. Make sure you make reservations. BTW i never tried the lamb but it smelled and looked amazing
