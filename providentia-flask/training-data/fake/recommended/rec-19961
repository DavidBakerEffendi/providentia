Stars have to be given in a context: does the place excel at what it wants to be and at meeting guests' expectations? The little shrimp does, definitely. Brooklynesque, no attitude, wonderful food and flavors, affordable (while not cheap). Everything is very fresh and it makes the whole difference. They care about the atmosphere in the finest details while keeping the feel of a neighborhood joint. Dont hesitate to take a whole fish (Branzino): it is to die for. Neil Ganic was more than friendly and went out of his way to make sure our 3 year old was enjoying herself. Try the adjacent sister bar (Flying lobster) whose is already among my top favorites for its dar, Â laid back and sexy ambiance that makes you feel you are in a hidden social club. Even the bar tender's tattoo is a piece of art.
