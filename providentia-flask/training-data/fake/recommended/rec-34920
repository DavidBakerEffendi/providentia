First timer here...but I'm impressed. We had a long wait but thankfully the dirty hot martinis are good and the bar staff is fast. Once we were seated, we received excellent service and the food way great! It's a little expensive but not too bad for NYC. Our entrees were delicious and the portions were big. I could only finish half and unfortunately I was staying in a hotel so I couldn't bring the rest. I was disappointed the next day when I woke up because all I could think about was how badly I wanted those leftovers:/
