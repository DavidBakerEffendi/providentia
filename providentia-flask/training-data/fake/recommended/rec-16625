4-5 stars... 5 for atmosphere, beer selection, quality and price of bar food! Next time I go I will have a burger! They looked and smelled so good and I was told by the friendly New Yorkers sitting next to us that the burgers are famous!!!!! 4 for cash only (although the prices are so low it's not a big deal), seating is limited in the bar area. If you're eating and watching the game, expect to keep buying beers if you plan to sit. I'm keeping this joint bookmarked. Oh, it's NOT a bistro.
