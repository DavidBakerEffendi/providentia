Whenever I'm in the mood for a delicious dessert, I always think of DISH first. I love their deconstructed chocolate cream pie! A lot of imagination goes into their desserts, and it's not the same thing that you see in every other restaurant (like lava cakes! I'll be a happy girl if I never see lava cake on a menu again). We ordered a Brooklyn Lager which was delicious, as well as their Tickled Pink cocktail, which I thought was good but not great.
