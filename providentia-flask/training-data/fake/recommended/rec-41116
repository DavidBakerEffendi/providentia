Yeah that's right. I just gave it five stars.  I have a love-hate relationship with this place.  The food is wonderful.  For years I would come here after a day at the park on Sat or Sun only to find it closed.  You see IMO ramen, esp chuko ramen is the best cure for a mid winter hangover.  But I would always seem to show up after 3 and before 530 when it was closed.  So that's on me haha and not their fault.  Just wish they were open for more hours.  It is small inside, and there's usually a line, but people know it's good and it's worth it.  The Ramen itself is delicious, filling portion of noodles, I usually do soy or miso broth, pork belly is always good.  Oh and if you're there when they have bone marrow don't even think twice.  Chuko is a warm bowl of savory, serotonin loaded goodness.  It will bring your mouth and stomach and eventually your brain to a higher ground and state of ecstasy that you deserve.  God bless.
