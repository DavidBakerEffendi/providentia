The food is truly delish here but I just cannot give a rating above 3 stars to any restaurant especially a real Italian place when they do not drain the pasta well! Please realize that the water in the pasta kills the sauce !!! Makes for a very unpleasant eating experience. Otherwise this place rocks the food. This visit I had the shrimp and veal parm combo. Veal was very tender and flavorful, the shrimp a bit over breaded and not as flavorful. Also tried the plain cheese pizza and it is good old school Northern Jersey pie! Will come back again but will ask the server to make sure the pasta is well drained before sauced!
