This place is awesome! American Flatbread in Burlington just has a wonderful vibe and always seems to be full of life, even on the quietest nights. The staff is prompt and pleasant. Great pizza, great beer. I only wish that they would change the menu a bit. I'm sure keeping it the same, with two specials a night, is a good business move, but after years of patronage, it would be nice to see things change a bit. Overall, a great place for dinner in BVT.
