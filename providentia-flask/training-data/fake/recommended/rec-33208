Malagueta will not disappoint you and the local flavor of the servers is so charming I am willing to overlook some aesthetic shortcomings.   This isn't  the kind of Brazilian restaurant  where you have meat offered you until you flip over a coaster from green to red in surrender.  While I have no expertise in the matter, I imagine this food to be what a person in Sao Paluo might order when they visit their favorite eatery.   We have tried several of the appetizers, but most favor the Salada de Lentilha Com Queijo: warm lentils with pepper crusted goat cheese over a balsamic drizzled salad greens.  We have tried chicken dishes that are never dry and consistently flavorful, fish dishes that are subtle and surprisingly complex but we make a point of coming Saturday afternoon for the Feijoada Completa.  Order a Brahma beer and savor this dish, you wont leave wondering why its the national dish of Brazil, its fantastic. Lastly, I don't know if I can put words to the sheer unbridled delight of my first bite of Malaguetas Mousse de Maracuja.  Sure, passion fruit mousse didn't sound like much to me either, but  I'm a changed man for the experience. Truly the most amazing taste my palate has to this date enjoyed. I have to balance this by sharing that my sweetheart found the tangy ,sweet and creamy dessert only alright.  She raves about the flan... try one of each, you'll be certain to find satisfaction ;) This is an unassuming spectacular little restaurant less than a mile from my apartment, and I'm still regretting having waited so long to try it. Don't cheat yourself the way I did, find time this week and explore the culinary riches Malagueta has to offer.
