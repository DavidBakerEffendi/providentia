AHH!!! This place is le-fcking-git! Stumbled upon this place via Yelp (thank you) and what a gem!! I ordered the Hawaiian, Ground Beef and Nutella while hubby ordered Spicy Beef, Tomato and cheese, and Chirizo...Oh my. I loveeee loveee lovee the Hawaiian...the moment I came home and bit right into it, the regrets came stormingggggg for not ordering like 10 more. The ground beef was so-so as the meat was a bit dry. I liked the Nutella cuz seriously anything with Nutella is yummy. Will definitely be coming back to this place! YAY for new food ideas!
