The food is tasty but some of the portions are small and for some of the prices i would expect a bigger meal. I do however love their chicken quesadilla very huge and feeling, their Mexican sangria's are good(but I always tend to have this weird stuff in my drink once i reach the bottom. I assume that it comes from the fruit or the shacker.) the fries are good too nice and tasty. I would say go here if everything is to crowded.
