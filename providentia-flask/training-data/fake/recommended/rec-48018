It was fairly genius for the Traif people to open up another place on the same block. We wandered down to Traif a little before 10 last night and they had a one hour wait, but sent us four doors down to Xixa where there was abouta  5 minute wait while they cleared a table for us. It's quite busy for a place that has only been open for a month, probably largely because of this clever overflow scheme. The food was wonderful! We ordered 7 small plates, a bottle of wine, dessert, and two tequilas.  Everything was delicious, services was great, and the price was very reasonable for the quality of the food. In short, they have everything one wants from a South Williamsburg establishment including a lack of sign on the front door and a carefully curated selection of tequilas and mezcals. Treat yourself! You'll love it!
