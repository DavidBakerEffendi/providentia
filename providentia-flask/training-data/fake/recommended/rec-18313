Small, trendy bar with a huge selection of whiskey and a large drink menu. We didn't get any food but we were pleased with the sangria made with white whisky and the cask beer. They don't take reservations and there are only about 8 tables inside and maybe 8 or so outside. The wait on a Friday or Saturday night will be over an hour to get a table if you don't get there early.
