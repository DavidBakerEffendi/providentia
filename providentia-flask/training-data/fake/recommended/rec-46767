I was skeptical that the famous name would kill the charm but they delivered a simple, straight-up pizza with great flavor at a good price. Speedy service that was polite but not chatty. We had lunch there. Entered and were seated in 3 minutes. Easy location on Lower Eastside (we'd come from the Tenement Museum). Pleasant surprise.
