I'm on an oyster kick, so I had to come here for the Red, White and Blue special. We went with the white, and it was tasty.  Oysters, also pretty good though my dude said they were a little bland. Geoff G and I also went for the all you can eat crab special, which is actually $21.95 and not $19 as yelp indicates.   The crabs are piled on a large tray, and they give you a bucket for the shells. The guy and I are whole crab novices so it took a little bit of getting used to getting the right meat out of those things, and determining what was safe to eat.  Towards the end of the one tray we had, Geoff says "I'm still hungry but I don't want to work anymore". I agreed. So we quit after one tray. Both decided we would come back for the RW and B special and to try other menu items, but the crab special, once was enough, no need to do that again. I'm the type who likes her food completely prepped and ready to eat. I should have known better.
