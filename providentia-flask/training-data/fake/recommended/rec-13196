I traveled to NY for a friend's wedding and stopped here to have breakfast.  It's a small cute place...love it because it has the total local feel.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros.  It was a different spin on this traditional meal and it was tasty!  Glad to have made it to this eatery once...not sure that I will visit here again if I get back to NY.
