Mom's is the perfect example of how a South Street bar should be (or at least how they all used to be!). Downstairs is a warm and comfy lounge/bar area to converse, drink and eat with your friends or complete strangers.  There is nary a bad vibe every in the building.  The menu is tasty bar fare including cheese fries, chicken fingers and possibly south Philly's best pirogies. Upstairs is a different world altogether.   Upstairs looks of the long, lost dream of Punk Rock.  2 pool tables surrounded by old couches and walls littered with graffiti welcome you as you come from the downstairs lounge.  There's a jukebox on the wall that is sure to have even the most tightassed of music critics favorites listed.  To your left are a few steps leading to the bar, which is always packed, but everyone is nice enough to let you through.  The bartenders are also very aware of the area and will often yell over the crowd to get you a drink if you can't get to the bar.  Drink pricing is standard Philly style.  Imports seem to run upwards around $4-$6 while drafts and domestics are cheaper.  There are always specials going on, mostly involving PBR's for a couple bucks. If you keep walking past the bar you come to the upstairs lounge.  This is classic South Philly Punk style and reminds me why I love this city.  A few ratty couches and low tables are interspersed with tilt-a-whirl and bumper-cars.  Lets not forget the graffiti here either.  Everyone from Elvis to Joey Ramone to Jesus is drawn or hanging somewhere on the walls.  This room also has access to the upstairs bathrooms which people seem to have a hard time finding. So come down, bring your sharpie, your friends and a good time.  Tattooed Mom's is one of the last bastions of what South Street used to be.
