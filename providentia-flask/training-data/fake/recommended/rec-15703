Atmosphere and service was excellent. Boyfriend and I each got the mushroom ravioli with lobster. I am not a huge fan of red sauce, so I asked if I could substitue to pink cream sauce and the waitress kindly obliged. The ravioli was definitely homemade, which I certainly appreciate when I'm eating in NYC, but I had VERY VERY little lobster on my plate. 2-3 little, little pieces (pictured... although I did eat one ravioli by the time I took this photo). It was good enough, but I wouldn't get it again. Some tips: -Skip the ceasar salad. -Order the short rib either as an app or even meal. Portion size is excellent and it is very, very tender. Neither of us have a gluten allergy, but this restaurant absolutely caters to it if you do. In fact, I will probably try some of these options next time, since I'm prone to stomach aches anyway. We will be back.
