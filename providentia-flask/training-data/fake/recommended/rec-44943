I hated this place! It was three of us and we went for Sunday brunch, what the hell!! First we went in there and was seated by the hostess right away, I was surprised it wasn't packed.. The waiter came and was looking at us for some reason as if we were aliens..wtf ? He said it was to early to have a mimosa ( apparently there is a rule you cant serve alcohol before a certain time on Sunday's) WHAT? Anyways, fine so we ordered non alcoholic drinks and ordered our food. By the damn time our food came 45 minutes later I saw the damn waiter serving alcoholic drinks to other tables! I was so pissed off, if I would have known my food was going to take so long we would have waited on ordering our drinks. UGH! and the food was gross, I forgot what the other two people I was with ordered but how could they mess up my chicken salad? The chicken was terrible and heavily breaded/ fried. WOW.. I seriously doubt I will be coming back here ever again. Blah! =(
