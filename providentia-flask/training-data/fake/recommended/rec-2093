I have gone here probably 6 times over the last 10 years never had a good experience here. I have had better ones at Geno's but not by much. The bread is better at Geno's and i prefer where Geno's slaps the Cheese on. I use to find the attitude of the workers there funny but not any more since they are are charging $8-10 for a plain cheese steak. And even if you don't want fried onions you will get some on your sub. These people either need to lower their prices or be friendlier. The sad thing is i can get better more consistant cheesesteaks at the mall I live near, which serves them consistently hot and with better cheeses. I would say that even a cheese steak without cheese from a mall place, would taste better then a cheesesteak from either of Pats or Genos with everything on it. If it is day time and you have option go to Jims on South Street or Wendy's or any where else $8 is too much money for either of those cheesesteaks and the wait in line is insane. Go Â to a restaurant and spend $12 and tip you will be more satisfaction from that then going and getting one of these greasy cheesesteaks with slimy cheese and soggy bread.
