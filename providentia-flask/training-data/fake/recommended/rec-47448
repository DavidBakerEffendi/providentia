I was here once after a long night out with friends.  That was two years ago.  I still have dreams about their eggs benedict.   It was crowded and cute.  We were seated.  I looked over the menu.  I voiced my want of an order of eggs benedict and my concern over how it can go so wrong.  My friends, who had been here before, emphatically said "Get them.  They are to die for."  I thought they were being over dramatic, but I ordered them anyways. My order came.  The conversation was flowing.  I cut into my benedict.  Took a bite.  And almost cried.  My friends turned to look at me.  I just closed my eyes and waved them away.  My tastes buds were exploding.  Ecstasy.  "They really are to die for."  My friends laughed. Really.  I do dream about their eggs benedict.  To this day.
