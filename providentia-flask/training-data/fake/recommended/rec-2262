It's easy to walk right past this little shop underneath the Philadelphia Convention Center. This unassuming space is home to some of the best soup dumplings I've had on the East coast. Meals are fast and cheap here. Somehow, though, it still seems very romantic to share a dim sum meal with your beloved in this tiny hovel, amidst the bustle and grit of Center City. No one cares who you are or how you're dressed. You can have your "When Harry Met Sally" moment. Visiting Dim Sum Garden is a great place to meet a few friends so that you can all order various dishes and share. My recommendations include the soup dumplings, cucumber salad, and scallion pancake. The soup dumplings are practically made to order because the restaurant has a continually operating dumpling assembly line in the kitchen. Some of the staff have very little English proficiency so don't get too technical with your menu questions - just try something!
