We showed up at 9:45 for some pizza and drinks. The bartenders, Henry and Stacy, we're the best. We had signature drinks made for us, laughs, pizza. My wife ordered a gluten free pizza and said it was the best she ever had. We had pesto and shrimp, the crust and cheese and homemade pesto with shrimp with so much flavor better Â than all the New Haven landmarks. I found a bar that had blue cheese stuffed olives to top it off for the martinis. Planning tobgo back soon with my friend, David, the pizza aficionado, for their wings and clam pizza soon.
