OHHHH the sangria, guac, and yuca chips. It's tough to get a table when you want to just drink and snack, though, so a star off for that, but I'm such a sucker for drunxican (drinking sangria/margaritas w/ Mexican food). If I was your average Yelper, I would take another star off for the time I was there and got hit in the head with the bathroom door, but I'm not about to hate because I know that not every customer has peripheral vision. NOT MY FAULT. I've come back since. PS. Sangria -- xox.
