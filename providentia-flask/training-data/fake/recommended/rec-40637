Everything we ordered was great.  The rolls were so tasty, and for once the pieces were just the right size!  I'm sick of eating ridiculously huge fancy rolls where you have to struggle and choke to get the whole piece in your mouth.. and of course to break it in half would be insulting to the sushi chef... so this was just perfect.  They managed to pack a ton of flavor and variety into perfect bite-sized pieces. Also the sashimi and sushi fish were so delicious and fresh. We eat sushi often... most commonly salmon sushi/sashimi and scallop, and this is some of the sweetest and freshest fish we have encountered.  Will definitely be back. Also HIGHLY recommend the Lychee Martinis as a perfect sushi accompaniment :)
