Great place for breakfast or lunch. The staff is quick and helpful and always manages to find you a good table. The food is wonderful from pancakes to sandwiches, to everything else on the menu. The French Toast is particularly good and goes so well with a large cup of coffee on a sunny morning then you have time to enjoy unhurried breakfast
