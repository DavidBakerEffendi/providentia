Wine and breakfast food on a late night? Pretty cool. This was a nice atmosphere with dim lights and jazz on the PA. They had fine wine that came at a discount, which seems like they often do for their spirits. I wasn't too enamored with their country fried steak - being a bit flat and the meat detaching itself from the fried bread skin. But I did order the mac & cheese which was excellente. It was cooked with white cheddar along with bread crumbs. This went well with the chardonnay.
