My very first.... I was 11-12 when I came her with my parents. It's still a favorite. I love their curry lamb. In fact, I can blame this place for single handedly making me an Indian food addict. Â Granted, I often cook my own Indian food these days. But this is still one of my favorites. Especially the little metal bowls they serve everything in. And the service is always as if you were at a four star restaurant instead of some place affordable. Catch the lunch buffet for a bargain.
