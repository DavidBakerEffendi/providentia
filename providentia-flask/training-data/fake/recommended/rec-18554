Americans like to be coddled, pet on the head and told we're wonderful. I should know, I am one, and I appreciate all of those things in my dining experience...most of the time. You can't blame me, I'm of the "entitled generation." So, if you're looking for obsequious, over the top customer service, this place just isn't for you. One reviewer even gave a one-star rating based on this, which is unfortunate. Is the owner gruff and not the friendliest? Sure, I'd say he's as warm as a grizzly bear after he's eaten (better than before a meal, eh?). Is the place the size of my pathetic studio? Probably smaller and that's saying a lot. Is, however, the food tasty and satisfying? Phenomenally priced? Yes! Yes! And best of all, is this a BYOB, with no corkage fee? YES! So if you don't mind getting your ass ever-so-slightly handed to you (depending on the owner's mood), and if you appreciate some Euro-disco-pop tunes while you eat the most delicious mushroom cigars of your life, GO HERE. Nook is awesome!!
