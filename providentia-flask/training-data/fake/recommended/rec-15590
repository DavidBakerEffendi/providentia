I wanted to love this place but was so disappointed!  After having this on my must try list for a while my bf and I finally went Saturday night. The atmosphere is really great.  We got to sit on the top level which was fun and I can see how it would be a fun spot for groups, however we were SO disappointed in the food. Brussel sprouts were definitely the highlight and I understand the hype Lamb meatballs were ok at best, dry and not flavorful at all Mussels were decent but the sauce was lacking and as a mussel lover I was really disappointed in these.   Tuna sirloin was bad! We both were most excited about this dish but the sauce was weird and gave it a horrible aftertaste Shrimp and chorizo Kebobs were good and my favorite dish but yet nothing too exciting. I'm not a picky person at all so maybe it was an off night but we both were really disappointed in the flavor of most dishes.  Will not be back and won't recommend unfortunately!  Plenty of places in NYC with atmosphere and great food.
