This is one of my top 3 restaurants in staten island!! (da noi being another fave).. this place is truly a gem in staten island.. the decor is goregous.. wish the bar was bigger, it only seats a few so if u want to sit and have a drink while u wait for ur table, the bar is very small, but BEAUTIFUL!!! .. i once had a pumpkin martini there around halloween and it was amazing.. ive had etoufee there twice, delicious.. white sangria is great.. dimly light, romantic, great food & service.. unique cuisine for staten island. luv it
