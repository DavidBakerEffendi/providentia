I like to think of this place as a delicious magical treat in the west village. The ambience is cool and laid back with a dinner and drinks menu to match. I recommend you sit at the chefs table if you're just going with a friend, the chefs will give you a few freebies to taste and they'll keep you entertained with recipes and stories. From the moment you walk in your ears will be greeted with some old missy, a little Aaliyah perhaps some thievery corporation. I have extremely high standards for mixing tunes with my dinner-- JL definitely meets this. Start off with the best drink on their menu, the shadowkiller. If you don't taste this amazing mix, you're truly missing life's elixir, just sayin... My other MUST at JL is their dessert. Listen to me, if you don't go for the salted caramel pudding, then just leave and never go back. Forget your grandma's pudding-- this pudding is so homemade it puts all grandmas recipes to shame.
