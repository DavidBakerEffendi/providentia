I went here to carb-load the night before the Philadelphia marathon. I am not from the area, so I choose this place based on reviews and a recommendation from a running forum. I was pleased with my decision to go here. It was within walking distance of my hotel. They had a large menu but not overwhelming. The portions were large which and a good value for the price. I had the shrimp fettuccine and was pleased. It had lots of shrimp and great flavor. The Italian bread was good too. My only complaints were the noise level and the wait staff was slow. It was probably because they were so busy but we had to get their attention to get menus, order, etc.
