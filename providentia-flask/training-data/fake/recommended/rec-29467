you know you're a tourist when you roam around a new land and keep looking for a piece of home...yeah smack my face and give me the kool aid already. Corner Bistro is a solid bar that made me miss home less as its a No bullshit, good burgers done better with a shot of whiskey and a beer chaser kind of place so that i can feel mighty homeys ats.;p Dress casual, or in a suit ready to face sentencing, in uniform or feather jock strap getting ready for pride( or maybe not..don't quote me;p) its everybody's bar, check your uppity sense of entitlement at the door and just be another joe/jane in search of quenching the throat and quieting the pre-culos. cheers!
