My husband and I attended a bday part here and the party was in the billiards room. The food was great, drinks were good. Bar was a nice big bar. Having the billiards room reserved was great, and it was nice to have that area. Â It all went downhill when I went to the bathroom. There was no toilet paper, no paper towels, and thats probably because it was all on the ground. I know its busy, and there is a lot of kids but the bathroom looked like a bomb went off. Then I told two guys that it needed to be cleaned and restocked, and they looked at me like I had ten heads. I never went back to the bathroom, I chose to hold it. Then my husband and I decided to go and check out the games. Mini golf was fun. However we tried to play various games and 1/2 of them didn't work, and ate our money. We wanted to play air hockey pretty bad, but they only have two tables and one was missing the puck. So we would of had to wait a while to get a chance. Needles to say we wont be going back for the games. Like I said the billiard room, food, and drinks were great. I just think they are so busy and they cant keep up with it so games stay out of service and nothing gets cleaned.
