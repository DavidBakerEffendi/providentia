This review is only for the dinner menu.  Breakfast/brunch may be better. Hubby found this place and so we went there for an early dinner, hoping that they had their breakfast menu all day. They didn't.  So that made me sad.  I didn't find anything on the dinner menu that looked all that exceptional. If I had more time in the city I'd have suggested going back for breakfast instead, since those choices did look good I had the curry chicken salad. It was ok. Slightly too salty.  My 6 year old really enjoyed his mac and cheese, which made me happy ... but since his favorite is Kraft, I'm not sure if that's really saying all that much about the quality.  (I actually tried it and found it extremely bland.  I wouldn't order it.) The place was really super loud.  I could barely hear myself think.
