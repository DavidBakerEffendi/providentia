I come here on Friday nights so I can get my salsa dance on.  It's free, and DJ Funkshun spins great latin music accompanied by instruments.  Not the best space for dancing, but a great atmosphere nonetheless. For drinks, try the raspberry mojito (if you like sweet).  I really need to dine here sometime.  When I'm dancing, the smell of seafood enters my nostrils, and I imagine it to taste good.
