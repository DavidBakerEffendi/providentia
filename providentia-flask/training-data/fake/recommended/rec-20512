I came here with a group of people after attending a funeral.  When I walked in I immediately thought "Call Chef Robert Irvine; this place belongs on Restaurant Impossible!"  The lack of care is evident in the decor, which obviously hasn't been updated since the place opened - not a good sign. When a place looks like this you know how the food is going to be... My niece ordered chicken fingers, which came out soggy and dry, I examined them and came to the conclusion that they were probably freezer burned and thrown into a microwave.  Who the heck can mess up chicken fingers?!?! Needless to say my poor niece refused to eat them and I didn't blame her. The salad was a nothing but a couple leaves of iceberg lettuce (the cheapest kind on the market) thrown on a plate.  I ordered the chicken parmesan and the sauce killed the entire dish. When they brought out our desert I couldn't believe what they did!!! They brought each table a heaping mound of orange slices thrown on a platter... It's almost comical. Robert Irvine would have a field day with this place... maybe I should contact the Food Network- hahahaha!
