I love this place my go-to spot for panini's. My bestie introduced me to this place and I can't stop going here. The salad with baby arugula with bacon and egg is so delicious. I still yet to try the crostini but the sandwiches get me full. I love the various cheeses and meats they have to offer. A must try in Astoria!!
