We have a Christmas tradition...take home Indian food. This place was recommended to me by a student who is from southern India. So my husband and I decided to give it a go after finding out Shah Indian had closed. The owner told my husband, when he went in to pick up our order, that is will be the best Indian food you ever had. I like that. Well, I can honestly say it was definitely one of the best we've ever had. (and that is a small list) We has the saag paneer and paneer makhani. They gave us big portions with lots of cheese. And the favor and heat was perfect. My husband found it a little hotter than he would like, but they will adjust that to your liking. We also got plenty of rice and naan with our meal. Okay, so this is now our new local Indian place. So convenient to the gym, which is right in the same shopping center.
