This place makes me wanna drive 3.5 hours to nyc just to get lunch. Really awesome kathi rolls...seriously, really awesome. My fav: unda shaami roll. I would eat these endlessly had i not been limited physiologically beyond a certain point. The unda (egg) chicken roll & unda beef rolls were also super.
