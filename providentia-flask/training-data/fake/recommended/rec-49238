Really nice staff but do NOT get bacon eggs and cheese here. It was the worst egg and cheese sandwich I have ever had. The whole thing tasted like cardboard. The eggs were obviously fake powder and not even warm. The bacon was probably microwaved it was not crispy. The cheese was not even melted. I cannot say anything about the rest of their food but I will not be going back to try.
