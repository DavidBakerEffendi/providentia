I voted "not good for groups" because, while they do take reservations, it's one of those places where they insist that your whole party is there before they're willing to seat you and in fact threaten to let your reservation lapse if one of your guests is more than 15 minutes late. I admit it, with the one person late, and one person canceling but then later another adding on, I was a bit of a high maintenance guest, but they only did an adequate job handling it. Â Sigh, I'm spoiled by Zingerman's in Ann Arbor, I can't cope with this frosty service concept. The food wasn't mind-blowing, especially for the price. The cornmeal pancakes with fruit were satisfying but a little straightforward. The white cheddar grits tasted like a Starbucks latte, don't ask me why. Nice mimosa.
