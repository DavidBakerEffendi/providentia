Avoid at all Costs. Three months ago I spent a long 24 hours in the hospital visiting a family member, we needed a break outside of the building and made a reservation at Hot Tomatos. We enjoyed a reasonable dinner, but because I gave them a phone number for the reservation, I now get endless constant SMS SPAM. 99000: HOT TOMATO'S: Make your week HOT with dinner at Hot Tomatos! Show this text to your waiter for 1/2 OFF one appetizer! Available until 3/28 99000: HOT TOMATO'S: Don't forget, MOTHER'S DAY is Sunday, May 12! We will be offering SPECIALS in honor of Mom. CALL NOW for reservations. 860-249-5100 4:12 PM I don't live nearby, I never gave them permission to use sell my information to a marketing company. Â Business must be terrible if the are resorting to the same marketing tactics as male enhancement pills, and cheap Viagra. There are plenty of classier establishments to give you business too, that treat their customers with basic respect.
