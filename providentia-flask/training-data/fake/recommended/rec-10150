The atmosphere for this place is pretty amazing, whether for lunch or dinner.  I came during lunch time with a few coworkers. After we walked in, we felt like we stepped into a different world.  The lights are dimmed, very classy, but overdone.  There were mirrors all over the walls and ceilings, and the decorations had a very roman/italian/classical feeling. The food was also outstanding.  My Pomegranate Walnut Duck was very good, the green tea drink I had was memorable, it was definitely different than other green tea drinks that I've drank, I wouldn't say it was better, but it was different.  My friends order Lard Nah, Lychee Fried Rice With Shrimp, and something else.  All four dishes were good to outstanding.   Would definitely recommend.
