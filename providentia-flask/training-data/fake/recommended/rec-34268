Such great people! Started working in New Haven in June and was shocked at how nice and welcoming this place is! Love love love their roasted red pepper bisque! Can't get enough, ordered 3 containers today so I could eat it all weekend! Love them! Their salads are also amazing and all fresh. Their pizzas are also rich in flavor and full of fresh ingredients.
