Yes, this place is famous.  That is why I went there.  I had to see for myself.  I selected the cheesestake wit onions, peppers, mushrooms and provy.  It was very good.  The four others with me enjoyed theirs as well.  I took a few minutes, read the signs and watched how to order.  They guy taking the orders was not paitent with newbies like me and I didn't want to get kicked out of line for not being ready.  :)   Overall, very good.  Best cheesesteak ever?  I don't know, the jury is still out.
