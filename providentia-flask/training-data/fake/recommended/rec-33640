Mac and cheese, and a 'behind the knees'...both delicious, both a must. The mac and cheese is one of the best I've had - I want to go back right now just thinking about it. I also ordered the chicken which was wonderful. Very moist and flavorful, not too salty. The lemon potatoes were too strange for me, but all in all, a lovely dinner.
