Continental Midtown is the BEST place for a girls' night out, hands down!  I've been here on multiple occasions - brunch a couple of times, lunch once, dinner once, and drinks/apps in the lounge about a million times.   Their food and service are excellent - I have yet to be disappointed by anything I've tried.  However, the best things about Continental are their drinks and the atmosphere.  The restaurant has seating on the first and second floors (like normal restaurant seating, except it's a Stephen Starr restaurant so of course the tables and seats are really fun and random). On the second floor, behind the bar, is an awesome lounge area with couches and these super funky bear/cow/horse chair-things.  There's also a roof deck, but I've yet to go up there as I seem to have a knack for going to Continental on rainy or cold nights.  I've heard it's pretty nice, though.   The drink menu is spectacular.  All their drinks are very unique, with retro names, and they are sooo good!!  My favorites are the Melon Drop and the Astronaut, but I've had others and liked them, too.   In addition to regular girls' nights out, I've gone here with two different bachelorette parties (we were bar-hopping and this was the first stop both times) and it was a huge hit with everyone.  I've literally been here countless times with a wide variety of people (girls and guys) and have yet to hear anyone complain about their drink or food.   The prices are little high, but totally worth it!  The drinks are very, very generous - they are served in shakers and you can easily fill your glass two times, so each drink is really like two.  And if you are drinking, you HAVE to get their edamame!  At $5, it's a steal, and it is so, so good.  (Darn, now I am craving it!)
