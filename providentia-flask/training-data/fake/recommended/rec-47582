New, impressive fit-out with incredible views. Our server was very sweet, but overall these guys have a long way to go before summer. The salads were not impressive, drinks took 15+ mins and one main meal was entirely forgotten, despite the dish being specifically recommended by our server. As a local, I really hope the service improves!
