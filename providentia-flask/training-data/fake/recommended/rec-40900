What a wonderful place to eat and have some friendly conversation with Sara.  She made me feel right at home even giving me a sample of the freshly roasted nuts that had just come out of the oven.  Delicious! I had the poached egg with thick asparagus.  It came with a side of some fancy greens with s slight balsamic dressing.  In town for a few days and will be back to try something for dinner.
