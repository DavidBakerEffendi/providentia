We made a reservation for 4 and were seated as soon as we arrived.  The waiter was knowledgeable and friendly.  We asked if the collard greens (a side dish, $6) was delicious and he offered to let us try them before ordering. We ordered a lobster roll, catfish sandwich, mussels, collard greens and a bottle of wine.  Everything was incredibly fresh and we thought that the collards tasted great (quite the surprise given their southern heritage) :-)
