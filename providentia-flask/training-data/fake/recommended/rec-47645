I wanted to like this place, I really did.  But my experience here led me to file a report with the local health department. When I walked into the restaurant, I was immediately hit by an aroma of hot garbage and spoiled fish.  I figured that perhaps this smell was wafting from one of the other rooms in the building.  However, I eventually realized that the smell was wafting from a pail of trash and rags against the wall in the eating area. I ordered the beef pho and it came quickly.  However, I was surprised by the meat.  Pho is traditionally served with thinly sliced beef, and this is what the menu promised.  However, the soup had chunks of beef that was incredibly chewy, fatty, and low quality.  I'm used to low quality meat, but this was beyond disgusting. The problem came when I asked for siraracha.  The waiter, who was seated, pointed me to a shelf under the register.  I walked over and saw several bottles of Hoisin and Siracha Sauce.  Each bottle had aged crusted sauce around the rim of the top of the bottle, and one of the bottles of siracha sauce had mold growing around the hole that the sauce comes through.  Another one of the bottles had several flies on the crusted junk. This place clearly does not follow sanitary precautions, and I highly reccomend staying away from this place.  There are plently of other cheap eateries in the area that do not leave foul trash in the eating room and allow their sauces to grow mold.
