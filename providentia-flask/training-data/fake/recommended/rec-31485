This restaurant was recommended by a local friend as well as having good reviews on yelp. I had the best gnocchi that I have ever experienced , tender and light, Â with an asiago cheese sauce that was just perfect. There was a salad special that had a ball of mozzerella that was so creamy- unbelievable!. The service was attentive and very timely. Do yourself a favor and try this restaurant.
