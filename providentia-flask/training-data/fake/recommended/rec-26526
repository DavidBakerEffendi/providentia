Great food and wine.  The place is unique because it has an outdoor patio which is a great place to dine in the summer/spring.   Half star removed because the staff always seem to be in a hurry to remove your plate even when the place isn't too crowded.  The staff is very friendly though, so it makes up for the urgency:).  Will definitely dine here again and recommend to friends.
