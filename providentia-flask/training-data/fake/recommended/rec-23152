Stopped in for a quick lunch on the way home from VA. Heard about the place from a dinners drive-ins and dives site. It was very good. For us, the standout was the bread. I had a veggie panini. It was as good as I think it could be. The cheese was flavorful and salty, with roasted peppers, basil, and garlic spread. It came with a side and I asked for home fries which were really super crispy hash browns. Husband had grilled chicken Caesar. It looked standard and he enjoyed it as did our daughter. She had a breakfast sandwich; egg, cheese, pork roll (looked like Canadian bacon) and it came with fruit. None of us were in the mood for pancakes, etc. but they looked really good. The desserts looked very good as well, but we were too full.
