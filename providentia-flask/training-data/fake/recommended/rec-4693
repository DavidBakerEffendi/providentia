After reading many good reviews, we decided to try this place with one of my foodie friends on yelp. The dining setup itself is minimal but what's on the plate makes up for all else. Hassan does a very good job of taking the chaat experience to the next level with his creativity. Multiple varieties of namkeen, papdi, fruits and even dry fruits like cranberries! No two bites of the plate are alike in flavor or texture and yet it all comes together very well. Trippy stuff! The lassi varieties are exhaustively long and if you have a problem picking one, he will suggest you one based on your preference of flavors. If you're vegan or lactose intolerant, he has you covered too. I thought that Lassi was forever off the list for me, but he had a unique and yummy take on the drink using coconut cream. Just when all of us thought we were stuffed to the brim and could not eat another spoonful, he offered us desserts on the house. His nature reminds me of an aunt who really likes to pamper everyone with her generosity and good nature. Quite an experience overall. Worth the 5 stars.
