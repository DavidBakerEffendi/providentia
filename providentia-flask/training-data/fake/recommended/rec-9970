So I came here expecting the same selection as the agave tacqueria cart but expanded. The server's lack of enthusiasm should have tipped me off as to how our experience was going to turn out.  As soon as we were seated the server asked if we wanted guacamole. I told him that I would need time to look over the menu and decide what I would be eating and he quipped back "is that a no?" Since I don't like being rushed I told him that was a no.   When I went to order my food I was told that the actual restaurant doesn't carry the same toppings as its food cart and there was no chipotle sauce available. I was also amazed at how long the tables around me remained dirty.     Overall the food was subpar and so was the service. I will stick to the food cart
