Very loud, long wait usually, but good bar food (read: unhealthy) and great beer. Occasionally missing a good double IPA in tap. The owner has no clue how to manage his seating arrangement or else this place would have 5 stars. If you're reading, find a way to treat your dinner guests better, try to make them comfortable instead of uncomfortable and people will return more often than they do now. I'll return but expect to be inconvenienced.
