I found this place under brunch listings & was sooo happy that I came! I am a coffee lover and the mason jar iced lattes (caramel and pumpkin) were both amazing! The Cuban sandwich panini was yummy as well! They're fries and onion rings have distinct flavors composed of honey and spices! Anddd, the atmosphere is very welcoming and gives the coffee cafe vibe! Definitely coming back :-)
