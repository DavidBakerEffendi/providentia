Think of a Mexican Restaurant and a BBQ joint had a baby it would be called Tres Carne.  The small place has amazing food.  I ordered the Burrito bowl with the brisket and it was delicious.  It was nice and smoky, cooked perfect. Staff is super friendly.  Warning get there during the lunch hour the line will be out the door.  The line itself will prove that this place is great.  Definitely worth the wait.
