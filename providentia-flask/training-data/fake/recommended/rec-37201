One of my favorite restaurants in the Hartford area. The grilled calamari and octopus are AMAZING melt in your mouth delicious. I pretty much get the same thing every time I go......Red sangria, Â the octopus, and the Seafood platter I forget what its called but its $60 for two people. More seafood then you will imagine swordfish, scallops, calamari, shrimp, clams, and prawns (with rice) and if you have room try the flan.
