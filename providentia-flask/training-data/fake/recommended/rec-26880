My husband took me to Bistro Les Amis for my birthday dinner last night, and it was wonderful.  We had an 8pm reservation, but they were a little backed up, so we sat at the bar, chatted with the lovely bartender and drank some nice rose for about 15 minutes until our table was ready. It was a nice way to start the evening.  We were seated next to a man who had been coming to the restaurant for 16 years, and we took his recommendations to order the lamb shank, hangar steak and french onion soup.  Everything was cooked to perfection, and our waiter took care of us like we had been his customers for years.  The room is small and cozy, and the tables are up close and personal with each other - welcome to Parisian dining!  The prices are very reasonable, and the bread they serve with the meal is fabulous.  Make this your next bistro stop in NYC.
