Go to this place, it's an experience....and the food, amazing. Try the deviled eggs.  Not your average deviled eggs, these are deep fried, with a crispy light batter and a dollop of hot sauce.  And bacon in the middle.  Damn. Next we had steak tartar.  My friend had recommended we try it.  Really delish, served with little crouton nuggets.  Will definitely order again. I had the salmon, my boyfriend had the beef tenderloin.  Same deal, super yummy! I honestly want to try every single thing on the menu.
