I have successfully cleared my plate twice at Cafe Luluc, once for dinner and once for brunch. Portion sizes are large and the wait staff is very nice. For brunch we sat in the garden space which felt like sitting in your backyard. I ordered the turkey and brie sandwich and a side of fries. The fries were delicious, crispy, and covered in salt and pepper (my favorite). The prices are just right and I left feeling more than satisfied. I will definitely be back again.
