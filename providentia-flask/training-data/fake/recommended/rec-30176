Great for brunch. Reservations almost always seated immediately. If not, less than a 5 minute wait. Food is solid. Prices aren't crazy. Service is always solid. Bacon bloody mary is the best. I've been here multiple times and friends have always enjoyed it. Obviously I enjoy it since I keep coming back. Get the bacon bloody mary.
