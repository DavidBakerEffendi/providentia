This place is a dump...I should have known that it was bad when we pulled up but my family wanted to eat there. First there was a HUGE break/hole in the concrete directly in front of the door. Then the bathrooms are gross and the toilet would even flush, the restaurant smells sour and to top it off I tried to order turkey meat instead of pork and they wanted to charge me $.69 extra PER PIECE of meat. So if the combo came with 3 pieces it will be $1.80 extra...CRAZY. Do yourself a favor and go to the diner down the block instead. I didn't eat...I refused. TheWorse.com
