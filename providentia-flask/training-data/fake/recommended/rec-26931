Went here for my birthday dinner with a group of friends.  This was my first time at there.  We got seated in the room downstairs which it seems as if they sat all the large groups.  The atmosphere at the place was pretty cool  It was mostly all 20 somethings out with a group of friends.  .  The service was great and the food was solid.  Nothing special about it, just overall good food.  I got the special lobster roll which about 3/4 the plate was chips but thats okay.  The burger looked really good, I'll probably try that next time I go there.  I'd give the place 3.5 stars if I could, but since I can't i'll give the benefit of the doubt and round up. Looking for a place to go with a large group for a solid, reasonably priced meal?  The Smith is a good choice.
