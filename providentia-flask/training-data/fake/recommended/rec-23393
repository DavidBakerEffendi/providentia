I think this is our favorite restaurant in Philadelphia.  The food is terrific, as long as you can deal with a limited menu that is predominently fish.  The menu has been totally different each time I have gone, but each time I found that there were many things that I wanted to eat. If there's anything negative to be said about the place it's that it VERY small.  It only holds about 25 people at a time, and even then you can feel sort of crammed in.  The guy at the table next to us wanted his space and some of ours, and unfortunately for us, he got it.  But I'm telling you, this place is worth any small inconveniences.
