Went there for a date we sat at the bar because it was super packed and we didnt make a reservation .Even tho we had a wonderful time if you want to eat Â I would recommend making a reservation . A+ on drinks & great customer service / the bartender was very attentive to us regardless of how packed the bar was. I will be back :)
