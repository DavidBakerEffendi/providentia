Service- We went kind of late night, it was after 12 and sadly my expectations are lowered the later it is. For 12 at night, the staff was friendly. One of the staff members was drunk, wasted and came to our table twice trying to make friends. Food- We started with the Oysters Half Shell and Green Tomatoes. For Dinner I had the special which included a Turkey Jambalaya, a gumbo, greens, and a pumkin crem brulee. I though my dinner was a little over seasoned but the dessert was great. Some of my green tomatoes were red :( Overall I would go back just to give them another try and for the beers on tap.
