I've heard that the Corner Bistro is one of the best burgers in New York, they even discussed it briefly on How I Met Your Mother. Now, I haven't had many hamburgers in Manhattan, so I don't think that it would be fair to say. But the Corner Bistro was quite delicious, cheap, and fun. It kind of had that college bar atmosphere. If you are in the mood for a good burger, in the area, and don't mind that your table may be a little sticky then Corner Bistro is your place.
