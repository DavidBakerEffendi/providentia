I've been hearing about this place for a while and the name was quite intriguing. My friend & I visited tonight (Friday) for happy hour between 5-7. The bar staff is very very friendly. the moment I sat down the bartender gave me a class of ice water and took my drink order. My friend and I ordered the $5 house margaritas and queso fundido. The margaritas were made with fresh limes and chilled w/ crushed ice. I am not a great fan of saccharine sour mix that you would most likely get at a chilis or applebees so this was perfect for my taste buds. The queso fundido was different than anything i would get at a chain hispanic restaurant which are more cheese whiz like. I loved the chihuahua cheese and grilled peppers. The tortillas were piping hot and delicious. The platter could have maybe used some stronger flavors on the plate like some figs or roasted garlic (not both) to go with the mild flavor of the cheese. The bartender Nick was also very friendly and a good conversationalist. Overall - a great time with good drinks over a nice appetizer.
