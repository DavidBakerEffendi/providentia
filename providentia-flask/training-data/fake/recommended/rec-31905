A place for the locals. Order in Chinese: they'll treat you better, and they'll do whatever you ask, like putting a fried egg in my noodle soup. My party ordered that one appetizer that comes with various different parts of a pig (no idea how to properly translate this into English) and were extremely satisfied: it was a massive mound of food and came with a bed of radishes to cut the strong flavor of the sauce. My beef noodle soup was great--their noodles are amazing, they gave a more-than-generous helping of beef, and the bowl was massive. Could've used more vegetables, but hey, it had to have a flaw, right? Ask for hot sauce for your soup, come with a friend and order two different things so you can share and taste, and order in Chinese.
