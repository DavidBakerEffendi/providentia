The food was ok but what really turned me off was the service. It's restaurant week and the waitress gave us the restaurant week menu which indicated that lunch was $15. We were going to order just off the regular lunch menu but she indicated that that it was not available over the weekends. So we ended opting for the restaurant week menu but when we got the check, each item was at regular menu prices. We would never have ordered that much food (and we ended up taking most of it home). So a lunch for three plus a kids meal ended up costing us $130. I called to ask for clarification as to why would they even give us the restaurant week menu if it wasn't valid on weekends and the prices would not apply. Had we known, we would have just ordered off the regular menu. Senioritas said they would give us at $20 credit towards future meals but we won't be returning because we really feel deceived.
