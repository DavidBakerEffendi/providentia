This place is magnificent i come here regularly  and portions and price are excellent. We always get the garlic chicken with bone with rice and fries and it never disappoints me. Other items are just as good my once ordered a paella and they just brought the whole pot out i was amazed that she will get all that food it was very good to take home and use as leftovers at home especially for the price. The sangria is magnificent .  All the waiters are very friendly but we always request Jason. Be prepared to get full with bread soup your entree and sangria because this place will not disappoint.
