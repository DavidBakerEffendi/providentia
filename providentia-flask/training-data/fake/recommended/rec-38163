Nice upscale place with awesome appetizers.  Exotic plates, such as quail eggs with tuna Tatar! They have specialties drinks.  My favorite was the strawberry mojito and dazzle martini! Seating area they have lounge style sofas, bar stools and regular dining seating if you want privacy. The ambiance is trendy!
