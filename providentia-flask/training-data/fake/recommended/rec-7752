It's pricey. Cost us about $45 each, and that was with NO MAIN DISHES. The service was great though, with our waiter, friendly, chatty, and always on the spot. I wish I could remember his name to single him out with a compliment, but it's completely slipped my easily slippable mind. (He has a Japanese fiancée. I remember that.) The main problem-- at least on the night we were there-- is that the good-looking menu reflects someone's imagination, and not the reality of the stock. Could I have a "bored housewife," I asked. (Yeah, it was embarrassing, but the first one tasted so good!) "Sorry, sold out." "How 'bout a refill on the Magners?" "All sold out." "How 'bout ANY cider?" "Sorry, none left." And so it went. We moved to the few things that were available, and they were very good. The lamb and shrimp skewers (three little ones for something double digit), and they were EXCELLENT as were the olives ($8 for a small plate). The atmosphere is  low key and friendly. Some single tables in the back seem quite romantic. Come with a full wallet, and pick a back-up item when you order... maybe two back-ups. --Drink Club NYC is a roving group of NY imbibers, a different bar every week.
