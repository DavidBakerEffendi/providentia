I really wanted to like National Mechanics -- it seems to have this reputation of being an amazing bar, but I've never really understood the hype. In the handful of times I've been there, I've had generally mediocre or bad experiences. There are a lot of other high quality bars in the area with better prices, food, and atmosphere. My first night there was later on a Saturday night. Drink prices were exorbitant even for the neighborhood ($6 for a bottle of Miller Lite is outrageous anywhere), and the bar was exceptionally loud and dark. The interior is some bad mix of old school pub/tavern and beer hall, but just seems dated and dirty. We left almost immediately. I went back last night to meet with a group of colleagues and was the first to arrive -- the bar was next to empty, minus a few people at the bar. I grabbed a table for our group and waited for service. Ten minutes later, no waitress, no indication about whether or not I would be served. I went up to the bar to order a drink and tried to flag the bartender who was busy chatting with two girls at the end of the bar. Without any luck, I called down the bar to get his attention -- no dice. Frustrated and out of patience, I reached for a pint glass to serve myself and finally caught his attention. He reluctantly served me with an attitude as if I was interrupting him. My apologies. When we were finally served and ordered food, I felt that it was a little pricey for the quality of the food. The food is hardly better typical pub fare -- it was enjoyable, but not worth the price. Several of our plates also lacked items from the menu (no guacamole on the nachos grande, etc). When we asked for some of these items, they either didn't have them or made a stink about the request -- is it too much to get salsa with fajitas? I would strongly recommend looking at other places in the area. This place seems to cater to a very particular crowd and doesn't seem to care if non-regular return (or leave happy).
