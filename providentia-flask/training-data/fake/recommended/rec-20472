I looked at the rating above and thought..."It can't be that bad." Then again the "worse" Chinese food I've consumed has been Panda Express and I grew up in the heart of San Francisco Chinatown. Well, unless you like American Chinese food (which is disgusting in my opinion) do yourself a favor and don't order from here. I had the string beans, chicken wings, rice, and lo mein. I literally took a bite out of all of them and sat there for a moment. I then proceeded to take the whole bag, toss it in the trash, and walk to the Mcdonald's down the street. Maybe I'm spoiled, but how can you mess up chicken wings and rice?
