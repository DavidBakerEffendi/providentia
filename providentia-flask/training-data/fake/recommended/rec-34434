This place is the real deal. The wait staff is courteous, knowledgeable, and attentive. They were sure to ask whether we were vegetarian or vegan. The menu was creative and eclectic. On our first visit, we had to wait a short time to be seated. We were comped our drinks for the wait. The food was plentiful, flavorful, and well presented. Well worth the price. Our new favorite restaurant.
