Good meal. Excellent service. Not noisy because we got there early on Sun ( 5 pm) but stayed two hours and felt hours. Excellent stuffed foccacia on the house. I had veal saltimboca which will take me 3 nights to finish and was reasonable and everyone else enjoyed their meals. Will definitely return.
