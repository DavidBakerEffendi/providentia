Unimpressed and disappointed. We got the tzatziki which needed salt, we could really only taste yogurt. Then we got the chicken kebab and the stuffed chicken breast. Both were substantial amounts of food but they were really lacking in the flavor department. Everything was saturated in oil and very bland. Really disappointing experience.
