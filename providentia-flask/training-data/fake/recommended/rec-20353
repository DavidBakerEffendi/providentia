Amazing. Food is EVEN, staff is even. This has been my fav spot for 8 years. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait for brunch, but it's totally worth it for a great brunch. i just get a tea from across the street while i wait. The dishes are very well balanced, the food is always done very well, very clean, the staff is very efficient, absolutely no attitude and no delays on requests. the atmosphere is really great, very european cafe feel. The bathroom is clean, the prices very reasonable. 5 stars for this place is not doubtful, it's a given.
