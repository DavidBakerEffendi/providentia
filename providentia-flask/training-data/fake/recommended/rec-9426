The most perfect dining experience I have ever had. From the food to the service to the atmosphere it was just beautiful. I took my boyfriend here for his graduation and they did everything to make it special. We naturally chose the tasting menu, accompanied by some delicious rose wine. They started us off with their bread selection which offer some of the most interesting types of breads. Pistachio being one of them which was wonderful. Every course (plus little extra surprise dishes) made my taste buds orgasm. I have never tasted food so amazing in my life. By the time dessert rolled around I was so full but kept pushing through like an Olympic champ because it would be blasphemy to leave anything on your plate there. As we were eating our chocolate souffles they brought us an extra dessert with "congratulations" written on the top of the plate in chocolate. SO NICE. I go downstairs to the bathroom, some gentleman, I suppose a manager of some sort asks me how my dining experience was and to send a congratulations to my boyfriend. This is a little embarrassing but I'll put it in anyway to just show how diligent their service is. The knifes were a very cool shape but a little confusing as to which way you cut. One of the courses (my mouth-watering duck to be precise) I was cutting the duck with the wrong side of the knife haha clearly having some trouble cutting and a waiter actually came over and very politely corrected me. They REALLY pay attention to you. Even though the restaurant was pretty full we felt as if we were the only ones there because that's how you're treated.
