I usually don't care for BBQ as a lot of places rely on the heavy gooey sauces to make it "BBQ" -- but this place really does smoke the meat overnight in the back, and the flavors confirm that! The brisket falls apart and has a great smoky flavor, the pulled pork as well, and the side dishes were terrific. The chili in something called "Frito Pie" is delicious - I would go there again just for the chili. The peach/blueberry cobbler seemed expensive at $8, Â but it was large, it fed three people, delicious, and they obviously used fresh peaches and blueberries. This is a great addition to the neighborhood - there's no BBQ equivalent for miles. Truly, the smoky meat is terrific -- and their sauce - incredible. I also predict that they'll bottle and sell it, it is that good. Every dish had it's own flavor; it wasn't the same piece of meat, covered by different sauces. I recommend it heartily. Two $$ is perhaps correct, technically, but each dish is so tasty that a little goes a long way. Highly recommended!
