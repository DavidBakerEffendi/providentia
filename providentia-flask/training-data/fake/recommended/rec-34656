This place WAS a go-to spot whenever in NY. But over the years they have gotten more expensive/stingy and the quality has gone down. They skimp out a lot more on the filling, if you want extra chutney, it is an extra charge, and it seems like they forgot how to make paneer because it tasted like tofu- all of that on top of getting our food cold. It is one thing if this is an isolated incident, but this seems like it is a trend. KRC - I want to like you so much, but you make it too hard!
