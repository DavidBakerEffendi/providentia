I'm sorry, but I'm not sure why this place is highly rated. Everything was super salty and mediocre at best. The tables were also so close we could hear other people's conversations and vice versa. The only thing we enjoyed was the dessert: olive oil cake. A must try. The sister restaurant Dell anima is way better. Ps. I don't give me much reviews.
