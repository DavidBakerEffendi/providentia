regular stuff, nothing to cry about i paid $40 for terrible service (the food was brought out when i asked for it and in the incorrect order) and i couldve made this at home in 5 minus. terrible alcapurrias. this is new yorican food not real puerto rican food ... waste of time try YUCA just around the corner ... so much more flavor and excellent service.
