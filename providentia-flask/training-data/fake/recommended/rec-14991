I'm hesitant to write this review, because it might make the lines at this lovely little food truck even longer. But I must share the joy. The hordes of students waiting in front of the truck usually steered me away from trying this place, but today I finally had the time and patience to sit down and wait for a delicious crepe to be made. Best decision I made all day. It was tough to make a final decision, but I went for the seafood crepe. Who knew imitation crab meat would go so well on a crepe? My dining companion went for the gyro. Both were lovely. For savory crepes, the slightly thicker, more robust crepe was perfect (as opposed to a delicate paper-thin crepe like you might get elsewhere). Delicious sauces, too! And they held up well for the walk home, too. No soggy crepes here! (Although we did ask them to go a bit light on the sauce). The guys working there were super friendly, willing to explain anything on the menu, and make modifications to our order. I have a feeling I'll be coming back to try more. Still need to try the dessert crepes that everyone raves about! Next time I'll try calling in an order so I won't have to wait in the cold with the smell of fresh pancake-y batter and meat taunting me.
