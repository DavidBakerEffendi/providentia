{ International Wednesday Post } This place is definitely delicious and fun!!! Â We set out into the city looking for a food adventure and I would say this place definitely satisfied. Its a dimly lit romantic spot with exotic music and tantalizing aromas. The flavors were super fragrant and fresh. I didn't recognize the spices but they were really yummy! I would totally recommend both my entree and side dish: Kabuli Palow: Delicately seasoned chunks of lamb or chicken under brown basmati rice. Topped with almonds, pistachios, carrots, and raisins. Buranee Kadu: Sauteed pumpkin pieces topped with yogurt and meat sauce. Definitely try the pumpkin! BYOB
