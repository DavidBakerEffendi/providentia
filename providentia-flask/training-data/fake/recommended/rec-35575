I've been here twice now. Each time I have had high expectations...and each time they're not quite met. I came with a large group a few days ago and arrived a bit early. While waiting for the rest of my friends, one of the waitresses came up and asked if we had precisely 15--and she meant precisely. Â Luckily we did, but it seemed so strange that we were grilled on this issue, especially since we weren't even the ones who made the reservation. The food itself is decent. It has a good selection, but it doesn't quite match up with the price point that I'm looking for. I ordered the linguine, which was good but not the kind I savor every bite of. I have definitely had better for the same price or even less. The decorations make the place seem cozy and warm, but there is an odd disparity between some who come to dine for a romantic dinner for two and some who come for a loud and rowdy BYO. Definitely saw both happening at the same time when I was there. I always leave this place a bit wanting and disappointed (especially after I get the check).
