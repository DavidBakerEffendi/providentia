I went here last Wednesday for dinner at around 8pm and the place was pretty empty.  The venue is cool and is part speakeasy and restaurant.  I had the classic old fashion which was delicious and made well.  The ambiance of this place is great.  Nice open space and a friendly staff. I ordered the duck confit and it was delicious.  It's technically an appetizer, but I ordered it as a meal and it was just the right amount of food.  The duck was juicy and tasty and goes down in history as one of my top 10 first bites.  It comes with homemade gnocci and mushrooms.  I highly recommend it.  My friend had the vegetable soup and she said it was just okay.  I would definitely come back.
