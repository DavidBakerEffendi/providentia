Wow... thats exactly what I was thinking when I was finished with my soup at Nanzhou. I had the duck with hand drawn noodles. It was so delicious, I don't think I put down my chop sticks and spoon until I was finished. I certainly wasn't conversing much with my friends while the bowl was in front of me. Everything that our table ordered seemed amazing, all of us were extremely satisfied. Everything on the menu is cheap and the portions are very generous. I'd suggest giving Nanzhou a try. Your wallet and stomach will thank you.
