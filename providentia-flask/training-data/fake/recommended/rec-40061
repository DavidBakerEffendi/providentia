NY as it once was...and it aint all great, but for time machine burgers with a slice o' Vlassic, this place is it.  Enjoy sigthseeing tourists emptying their Euros as they wolf down their freshly ground grease burgers the width of the Intrepid.  With the Scott Tissue-thick paper plates and plastic forks and the crusty waiters in their kitchen whites doing double duty serving and busing, makes me pine for Woolworth's...sorta
