We had heard about this place via various Astoria postings on FB and were excited to try a new place in the neighborhood. Boy, are we glad we did! Everything was fabulous: service, food, ambiance...heck, even the fellow diners! We had the arancini (cheesy, yummy with just the right amount of sauce), the polpetti (my favorite...they did meatballs RIGHT!), the La Porchetta (just OK) the ravioli (delightful little home made pillows of goodness) and the tiramisu (creamy, flavorful and delicious). The service was outstanding. Everyone was attentive, but not obnoxiously so. The owner made it a point to come by after each dish was presented to see how we enjoyed everything. Our experience was really enhanced by the people working there. Truly a memorable meal. We will be back!
