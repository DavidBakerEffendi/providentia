every city should have a music venue this cool.  i really really really love this place, and i get so depressed when acts i want to see get booked into the north star bar or the first unitarian church as opposed to here.   i should state i've never eaten here.  i'm reviewing this place as a music venue not a restaurant, and i've been there for shows probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 12 times.  i will go see bands i've never heard of, but hear good things about, i love this place so much. first - great sound system.  you can hear the band clearly from in front of the stage, up on the balcony, at the bar, and even a bit in the bathrooms - which is great because you can take a pee break and feel like you've missed nothing. second - great setup.  love the balcony.  one band i saw there, whose name i am forgetting but they were 5 guys from chicago, totally used the entire venue as their stage which i loved.  they had a trumpet and a trombone, and the musicians using those pieces strolled the audience, making appearances up on the balcony to play down to the crowd below.  it was beautiful.  also on setup & design of the place, the upstairs women's bathroom is a work of art.  i could seriously live in there.  the lighting in the whole venue is gorgeous.   service is awesome - there's a bar right there, but also roaming waitresses to take your drink order at the less-crowded shows.  and beers are cheap and local.  love it. i can't think of any reason not to love this place, other than shows sell out here a lot.
