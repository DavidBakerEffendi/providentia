This area looked like a total eating wasteland until I discovered this spot while visitng CUNY Law School.   The servers are friendly and knowledgable but not fussy.  The second time I visited, our waiter remembered what we had eaten two weeks earlier! The menu has enough variety to satisfy folks with dietary limitations. Although I've only eaten there in the Winter when there were lots of hearty, cold weather selections (and light fare for those who prefer it), I'm betting that there seasonal selections will hit the mark. I had the pulled pork sandwich at my first visit.  The sandwich had just the right combination of sweet and savory add ins to compliment the smoky pork .  At my next visit I had pasta with bitter greens and duck.  I can't remeber when I enjoyed a mel more. This place is worth a trip from anywhere in the city.
