Swing and a miss...but I'll be back. I came here based on the yelp reviews as it looked so good but unfortunately my experience just wasn't up to par. I sat at the bar which is a nice layout with great views of the lake. Ordered a local beer on tap before dinner which was great (clean taps, crisp hoppy brew at just the right temp). The bartender was great, attentive, educated on beer and the menu. I ordered the steak (med-rare). When it came out, it looked nice and smelled great but the steak was just way overcooked and didn't taste good at all. It wasn't "bad" but just wasn't good...mediocre at best. The bartender apologized and offered to have them do it again. Ok, I get it, I'm reasonable...so off it goes....back again...same thing....no good. Bartender again apologizes and offers for me to have something else. Nope, I'm good but willing to come back next time I'm in town to give it another shot as the service and other reviews warrant it. I'll post another review the next time I go in hopes it'll be better and this was just a fluke.
