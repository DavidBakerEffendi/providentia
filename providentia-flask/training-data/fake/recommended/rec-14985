My boyfriend and I tried this place this evening after my mentioning that I'd wished I'd tried the place during Restaurant Week. This restaurant is perfection.  The service was fantastic- every employee was polite and pleasant.  The atmosphere was absolutely lovely- very ideal for a date.  The food was absolutely divine.  I've never been a huge fan of hummus, but after my experience here I am a changed woman.  I will likely dream of that hummus tonight.  We will definitely be back.  I cannot wait to try the other delicious sounding dishes!
