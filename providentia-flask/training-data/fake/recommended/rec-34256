If you are in Princeton this is the place to eat breakfast!  It's a cool local place that has the history of Princeton carved into the tables.   As you wait for your food you can't help but wonder who has sat at these tables before you. is this the first version of social media?  Bring a pen and leave your mark to commemorate your visit. The food is good, here is a tip- when you're in a pancake house, order pancakes.  They are really good.  They also have a variety of eggs omletes and other breakfast fare, but don't be retarded, order the pancakes.   Bad reviewers-Go to IHOP!  This place is popular landmark , expect to wait in line if you don't get there early.  Also, expect that the staff is looking to get you in and out as fast as possible which may not be the most friendly experiance.  This is New Jersey, get over it.   You may not go a second or third time, but you should go once if you want to experiance Some of the history of Princeton.
