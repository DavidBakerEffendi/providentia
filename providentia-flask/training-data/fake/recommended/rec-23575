This is our go to restaurant in Burlington. We've probably been here more than 50 times. The food is always fresh and delicious and a real bargain. We always get the spring rolls (#4). My husband usually gets the vegetarian pho and I frequently get The bun with eggrolls (#15). We also both enjoy the szechuen eggplant (#21). The hot and sour Vietnamese soup is amazing and huge! In fact all portions are huge. Love the fact that it is BYOB--they provide glasses and wine openers. Â I almost hate to review this restaurant because the place is so damn busy ALL THE TIME! We used to try to go during the middle of the afternoon but even then they are busy. Anyway, don't miss it!
