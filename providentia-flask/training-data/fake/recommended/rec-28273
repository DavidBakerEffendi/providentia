Went here with my friend M. on New Years' Eve for dinner, arriving around 9:15. He was fueling up for a 4-mile fun run through Central Park. I was fueling up to... watch the fun run? Hey, it's not the same if nobody's there to cheer! We had to wait for a table, but this wasn't a problem - the wait couldn't have been longer than 5 minutes before we were seated. I ordered a panini with soppressata, hot peppers, asiago cheese, and basil pesto ($9); grilled, seasoned bread with more basil pesto ($2), and... the Smuttynose IPA ($6)? That sounds right. The panini was the star of the show. Not that there's a lot to say about it - anyone with a panini press could make the same thing at home - but something about this one just hit the spot. Il Bambino was everything I hoped it would be.
