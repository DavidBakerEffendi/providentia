I know you cook with wood and smoke, Mighty Quinn.  I respect you for that -- admire you, even.  It's very special. However.... Let's get down to brass tacks: I love BBQ, and I have only been to this place 3 times in the last 9 months.  Why? Because Mighty Quinn does things that make it harder for the customer. Getting one's food at Mighty Quinns requires one to go through a cafeteria style line.  Fine if the line is short, highly irritating if the line is long (hint to fellow patrons: the menu is not that big; just decide while you're waiting on line...).  Then, if one is eating in, one has to find a place at one of the tables.  First time I went there, I had to go through the long line, then had to stand around with a tray in my hand waiting for a table to open.  That stinks.  Take reservations, for crying out loud.  Or don't continue to serve meals when there is no space left for patrons.  Or something. I have been there twice to pick up lunch to go.  Each time, I got stuck in a long line (this after a phone call in which I was assured there was no line). Why? Because the restaurant won't let you phone in orders.   My local Smashburger also used to take an ungodly amount of time to get through the line, much less to finish up the order.  Guess what - we stopped going there right away.  When they started on-line pre-ordering so that you could just run in and pick up your meal, we started getting burgers there occasionally. Even though you cook with wood, Mighty Quinn, you might want to think about letting people order their "to go" orders on the internet, thus shortening the lines and the wait times.   Long wait times on line = fewer lunch-to-go customers.  Long wait time on line + waiting for table space with meal in hand (getting colder by the minute) = fewer dinner customers.  May want to think about this. Would have given 2.5 starts if the system allowed.
