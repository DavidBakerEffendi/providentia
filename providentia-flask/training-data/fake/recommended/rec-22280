Disclaimer: this review is based on one particular visit.  I WILL be going back for a full meal or happy hour and I will write an updated review afterwards. Friends and I headed to NIXS for a few drinks and snacks one night (a Friday night).  It was around 9:30 when we got there.  We found three seats at the bar, ordered a round of drinks, then placed a food order a little later.  The drinks were amazing, and the bartenders were excellent. At 9:55 (we hadn't received food yet as we'd just placed the order) the waitstaff/bussers came around and asked for our bar stools.  I was absolutely floored.  I told the young gentleman that we had just ordered food and asked if we could keep the bar stools until after we ate, he replied no.  I tried to be as nice as possible because I know it was not his rule, he was just the enforcer, but we were really not in the mood to lean over the bar top and eat while standing.  Maybe I'm being a whiny brat but if I find a seat at the bar I usually like to hang on to it, especially while eating.   The reason for clearing the bar stools was to make room for the sudden influx of nightlife happenings- a DJ, dancing, etc.  Literally, as soon as the clock hit 10 PM, it was a totally different place than what we first walked into.  The music was very loud, and I was suddenly standing too close for comfort to the next person. As I mentioned, I'll definitely be back for a full meal to get a full grip on it, but this first experience rubbed me the wrong way.  I just felt as though we should have been warned when we ordered food that "in five minutes you'll have to stand" or something of the sort.  I may be the only person who has a gripe with this, but so be it.
