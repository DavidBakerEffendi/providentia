Decent food, and prices aren't half bad. I ordered a bowl of tempura udon, which wasn't all that big, but it was fine because I also ordered a grilled fish roe rice ball. The rice ball I ordered was a little expensive (almost $5, whereas most places charge less than $3!), and it was a little dry for my taste. The tempura udon was good, but not unlike anything I've tasted before. The winner of the night was the ramen that my sister ordered. Oh my, everyone at the table started drooling as soon as it arrived because the smell permeated our immediate area. I ate some of the ramen, and let me tell you, that broth is HEAVEN. Though I could do without all the shredded ginger, I'd make an exception. This place closes late. We were here until almost 3 a.m. on a Sunday night, and there were still plenty of people hanging around.
