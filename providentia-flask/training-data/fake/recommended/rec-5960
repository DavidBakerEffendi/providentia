3 1/4 Stars.  I just finished writing a review for Tinto (the other tapas restaurant located in Rittenhouse Square / Center City, also owned by Chef Jose Garces), so this review may be redundant.  This place is much bigger than Tinto, and I like the layout, which divides a large space into different areas.  Again, don't come too hungry (or short on time)!  Mainly a fun/enjoyable experience to try little bites of each thing (best to share with others) and just linger, drink wine, have a nice time with your friends or your date.  The food is very good, but the service is just okay (like at Tinto) but better looking here, LOL.  Live flamenco is always a treat to liven up any dinner.  Refreshingly different from the usual Philadelphia Olde City fare. I will say, though, that the first time I came here, soon after it first opened, I was impressed not only by the food but also by the service.  My server was very knowledgeable, helpful, and enthusiastic about wine, which made for a great experience sampling not only a variety of food but a variety of wine.  Unfortunately, later visits were disappointing, especially after a great first impression.
