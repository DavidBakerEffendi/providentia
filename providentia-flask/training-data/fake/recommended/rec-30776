Disappointed We had a gift card and waited to use on a nice evening out. The prior reviews were not great; past years seem to be better. Our service was just ok, but since are not regulars, we were not treated special in any way. (We could have been future customers). We had reservation and seated in the only 2-person table in the restaurant that was crammed against the wall and in between two large parties. (Not large enough for two). At the table was a cold bread basket, and an eggplant spread. Nothing special.   We ordered one appetizer, and two entrees. The shrimp appetizer was ok; however, our dinner arrived over an hour after taken our order. I specifically asked for little/light oil for the pork chop with peppers. Not the case, Berkshire Pork Chop oily, but the peppers were swimming in oil. Instead of the potatoes, I asked for steamed spinach, out came a small plate of oily spinach.  The manager asks how dinner was, and when I told him, he said he could drain the oil.  I do not think so! In addition, my husband ordered the Chicken Milanese, the chicken was ice cold, and nothing else was served with this dish but the salad.  The prices are high and not worth it! We will never return. So many other places that the Italian food is outstanding and much better priced. I would not recommend this restaurant.
