Enjoy REAL home style Italian cuisine?  Then you will not be disappointed here.  While Gennaro's pizza is one of the top two pizza havens in the Trenton / Hamilton area, Gennaro's forte is its dining!   For those of us who have been long times fans of the fine homemade Italian dishes back when they were primarily a pizza storefront with a few tables in the waiting area, the awesome expansion and investments made by the Gennaro family's few years ago makes this establishment one of the most successful small business expansions in the area. The menu is pure Italiano. Many of the recipes are handed down from the "old country" from nonna and mama!   I travel often to Milano and Torino Italy on business and I joke with the owner that I always stop there for dinner to "get acclimated" to "get in the mood" before I leave. It's that good! BYO Fine Italian Vino and you'll be all set for a culinary voyage of your own.
