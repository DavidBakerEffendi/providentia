The first review I saw for Maddy's warns not to expect Bolo or Mesa Grille (sic). Why would you? Bolo was a Spanish restaurant, Mesa Grill a southwestern restaurant and Maddy's a Mexican restaurant. Three totally different cuisines! Maddy's is authentic. Good, homemade chips to start and a decent red table salsa. We also asked for, and were given, a green tomatillo-based salsa which was a little spicier than the red. Guacamole was good. A small order enough as an appetizer for two, it was nice and chunky with onions, tomato and cilantro. My friend's main course was a taco plate (4) of chicken (2) and pulled pork (2). They were small, six inch tortillas served open faced with onions and cilantro. I believe they called this 'Mexican' style, and did offer a few other dishes with the option of Mexican or American style. Burritos can be ordered 'dry' or 'wet' (Salsa covered). I had cheese enchiladas (4) with molé. The enchiladas came with yellow rice, a fairly large portion of somewhat bland pinto beans (whole, not mashed) and were covered with crumbled queso fresco. Overall, the dish was pretty good. The molé itself was ok. Discovered that tamarind soda goes GREAT with two shots of tequila in it. Service was good, although there were only two people working the front, a waitress and a waiter / cashier. Friendly and helpful. Our bill, with tax & tip was just over $40. I'm giving Maddy's 3-1/2 Stars based on good food, good service and authenticity
