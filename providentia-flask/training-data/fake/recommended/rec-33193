This place is amazing. 1- compared to other places of this caliber pretty cheap 2- the staff is very friendly 3- the food is amazing. I've been here 5 times I think, every time the food was super delicious. For appetizers yucca fries with sausage is a must - that sauce oh man! I'm salivating right now just remembering it. Â I usually get the seafood there because seafood is usually harder to make well and oh man do they make it well! (salivating again dammit). This fish (it had some special name - not a straightforward name like 'broiled something' - was the best seafood dish I have eaten so far. Their sangria is delicious too. They also make a special sugar can alcoholic drink which is pretty strong and is very delicious. My suggestion is take your finger, randomly stick it in the menu - and eat whatever it lands on - it will be good! (oh and some meat in shrimp sauce i think it was is very delicious too). Yeah it's pretty much my favorite restaurant.
