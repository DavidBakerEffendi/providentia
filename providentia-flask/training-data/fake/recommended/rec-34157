Been here three times...to be honest, probably won't be back, there are better options in the area.  There are some winners on the menu, namely the lamb nachos and truffle fries.  Beer and liquor selection is pretty good as well.  I think overall what drives my 2-star rating is that the service (two out of the three times we were there) was pretty weak.  Nothing outrageously bad, but they weren't friendly (server was definitely rude during my last and final visit), and the guy delivering our food literally tossed the plates down on the table.  I mean come on man, I used to work in F&B and there is nothing acceptable about that.  It's worth pointing out that at no point during any of our visits were we high maintenance (i.e., made no weird special requests, no complaints of undercooked food, were not loud and didn't linger without ordering anything, etc.).  If I notice great service and a nice staff, that's a huge plus...if I don't remember anything about the staff, that's fine as well...but for me to say that the servers were rude and unprofessional, really for no reason, that's enough for me to not want to spend any more cash here.
