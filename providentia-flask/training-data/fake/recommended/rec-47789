Fully sober visit & review! The Wenzel IS a great sandwich Fun atmosphere The sandwich offers an outstanding crust, great seasoning, full flavor, and is delicious overall...yet somehow, I don't think anyone needs the details on the sandwich.  If you make it in, you're grabbing one, and the proof will be in the proverbial pudding. I took a major detour to get into the neighborhood, was then re-routed due to what might be an exceedingly rare vehicular accident in the area as I approached the restaurant, and after I decided to make the rest of my way on foot, I realized Alpha Delta wasn't even open yet...and thus I might have been one of those very rare birds opening the place, instead of closing it down at the end of the night.  So began my tasting journey.  But a friend had recommended it as more than a drunken experience, and I wanted to give it a shot. Man, I'm glad I went.  It was quiet when I arrived, and the music selections that started playing were a hilarious melange of world music and crooners.  I had elbow room to enjoy my sandwich in peace, and the paper towels were plentiful for mouth-wipin'.  Plus, the sandwich deserves the plaudits.  I can only imagine it's better if it's 2:30am and you're tipsy, but that it stands on its own is good news. Get some good directions next time you're in the New Haven area, and keep this one bookmarked...if you're hungry.
