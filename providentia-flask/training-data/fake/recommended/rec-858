The cocktails and whiskey are on point. I had an awesome burger for lunch one day that a had green sauce on it and I don't usually like sauces on my burgers but this was good. Actually the sauce may have been brown or red but I couldn't tell because I'm color blind. Yeah I know it's a handicap but I don't let it keep me down. There are definitely people out there who have it worse than me but autumn is a confusing and sometimes depressing time. I sometimes asking myself why God made me this way? What is my purpose? Will anyone ever love me? Anyway those thoughts left me (only temporarily) while I enjoyed that burger with green (I think it was green) sauce and sipped their whiskey and cocktails.
