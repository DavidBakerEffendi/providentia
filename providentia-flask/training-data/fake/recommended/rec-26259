I can't say enough good things about bcds.  as you walk in, you are immediately greeted by friendly hostess.  the deco is modern yet has a twist of traditional Korean feel to it.   the wait staff is friendly and very attentive. soondubu is their specialty but other items on the menu is delicious as well. my fav combo is soondubu and galbi.
