The food was very good here. The menu had a nice number of options. Not too many that I was overwhelmed, but not too few that felt like my choices were limited. I ended up getting a greens salad with vinaigrette and the boar ragu. Both were quite tasty. I would try some different things next time (and there will definitely be a next time since this place is around the corner from me) - not because I didn't like what I got, but because there are so many other delicious looking things on the menu! The staff were also very nice and accommodating. Even when they were trying to close up and my friends and I were sill there gabbing, they were never rude and never rushed us. This is definitely a great, neighborhood-y BYO!
