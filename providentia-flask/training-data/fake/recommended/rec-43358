As good as Italian food gets outside of Italy. Don't confuse this cuisine with AMerican-Italian cuisine as you will not see any "parmasean" or "red gravy" on the menu. Instead your tastebuds will rejoice when introduced to thin crisp crusted, brick oven pizza with toppings of truffle, parma, etc (I recommend the parma and lombard, which has an egg crack on it before it is baked). Pasta dishes include wild boar, store made sausage, rabbit, quail, etc. If you are lucky, Â they will offer a special of roast suckling pig. For dessert I recommend the budinio (sweet polenta with caramel coated hazelnuts) and chocolate flan. Service is usually good and they have a good selection of Italian wines.
