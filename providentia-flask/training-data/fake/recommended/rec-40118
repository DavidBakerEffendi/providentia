I fully admit that I may not be qualified to write a fully educated review about Catas, but I'm going to do it anyway. After perusing the interwebs, I found out that Catas is the home of the Viking Army (New York Red Bulls Support Club).  I was intrigued and decided that I was going to stop here before heading to a Red Bulls game.  I'm glad that I did. Upon entering Catas on a wet and miserable Wednesday afternoon, I was immediately inundated by a horde of men and women clothed in a colorful mix of Red Bulls and Viking Army apparel.  These dedicated fans were enjoying their meals and adult beverages with the occasional chant breaking out.   Having recently eaten, my buddy and I decided to skip the food (first mistake) and go straight for the bar.  The bar was packed, so it was a bit difficult to get the bartender's attention.  If my memory serves me correctly, there were two bartenders working and a bar filled nearly shoulder-to-shoulder. Once I got the (gorgeous) bartender's attention, she agreeably rattled off the draught beers.  Having just flown in from Texas, I was quite happy to hear that they carried Shiner Bock on tap.   A few beverages later, it was time to head over to the arena.  Closing out our tab was a special kind of frustrating.  In the future, you can bet that I'll be paying drink-to-drink, I suggest that you do the same... unless you have a front row seat at the bar or have the undivided attention of a waiter at a table. I like this place, I can't wait to actually sit down and eat here.  All of the food that I saw, looked and smelled amazing!
