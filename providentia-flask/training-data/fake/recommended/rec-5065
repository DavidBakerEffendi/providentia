My first time to one of the Dinosaur BBQ restaurants in the City, and I thought it was really good.  I would have to say that Dinosaur is my #2 after Morgan's BBQ.  it's a large restaurant and good for groups.  The BBQ is really good, especially the pulled pork and ribs.  I also found their jalapeno coleslaw to be quite delicious, too!
