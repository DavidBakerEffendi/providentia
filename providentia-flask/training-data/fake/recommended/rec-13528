Wine bars are out, beer gardens are in.. so it goes in a shitty economy.   Its a typical Stephen Starr operation which means good, not great (German inspired) edibles and a cool factor that somehow seems to be lacking something.   It's a cool place, but it's definitely a contrived cool.. which makes it infinitely less cool.  Still though, you can hang out in the beer garden, drink liters of good beer, there's a fire pit to keep you warm in the winter and there's ping pong indoors.   It's a good time.  I would advise coming to this place with a few people you enjoy hanging out with though as- and granted I'm basing this off 1 visit-the crowd seems to suck.
