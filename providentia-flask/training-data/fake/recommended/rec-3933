I went here with a couple of my friends the other day for brunch. The service was less then good. They promote coffee with your brunch but our waiter never brought it till we complained. The food was not bad but the drinks were bad. I ordered a Bloody Mary and it had to be the most watered down drink I have ever had. For the price and service I would not go back again.
