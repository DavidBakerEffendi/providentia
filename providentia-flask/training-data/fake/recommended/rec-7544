The roast pork with broccoli rabe and provolone was excellent. The sandwich was juicy without being "soppy" and that contrast of flavors exceeds your expectations. I thought the last time I was there the provolone was "sharper" than this time...maybe a rose colored memory or maybe they changed suppliers. The sandwich was $8.50 + 1.75 for two toppings. There are no "sides" like fries or slaw or potato salad and frankly the sandwich is all you'll need. The sandwich is large, freshly baked rolls stuffed full of pork....everyone finishes because you can't bear not to finish ... though you'll walk a little more slowly and your clothes will be a little tighter and you'll smile a little brighter...all the time saying to yourself ....'I shouldn't have eaten all of that at one sitting.' Hype about any restaurant or meal can ruin your experience....your expectations for the food become unachievable; having said that, I don't believe you will find a better roast pork sandwich (with the provo and broc) anywhere. There is a counter with stools, there is an adjacent "plastic tables and chairs area" but seating is tight at the Reading Market. Â DiNics is busy from 'early' lunch time onwards....don't think showing up at 11:15-11:30 means there won't be a line....which explains why we went at 10:00 am and considered it "brunch." Even at 10:00 there were people already ahead of us eating at the counter. If you go in a group, have one or two people 'save' some tables and chairs while others place the order.
