Was In the Princeton area this week end so we thought we'd try Joe's since they are building one closer to us in Eatontown, Very busy Sat nite got the last parking space to be had...well this should be good I thought, the wait was thirty mins... not bad but all downhill from there. Server was nice and drinks brought promptly. Next came the appy garlicky mussels, It was served with a mealy under baked piece of french bread with some fake butter on it, the mussels were meaty but over cooked and and the broth tasted like the only ingredient was garlic. My date ordered the king crab pot and I the lobster and snow crab pot, although the crab was fine and the lobster was actually cooked perfect the portions for the price were small. I have never sent $105.00 on dinner for two and left hungry! I will not be going back.
