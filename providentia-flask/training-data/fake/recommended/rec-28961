Went here for a friend's birthday party. Really wonderful restaurant and great food, which lived up to the expectation. Tequilas with cactus salt (not Morton's). I ordered a veggie enchilada platter, which is a bit citrusy, but yummy. The cocktails go great with food. It is bit loud in the restaurant, because it is a weekend. And obviously the restaurant is full. Highly recommend to anyone, who loves authentic Mexican food and Tequilas.
