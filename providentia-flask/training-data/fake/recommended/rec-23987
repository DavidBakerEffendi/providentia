Yes I've tried them all, serveral times, and this is my favourite steak place in Philly. Hands down. Jim's taught me the way of the cheese whizz... being a Brit this just seemed very silly to me (I was a provolone die hard) but I was cajoled into trying it by the server! My weapon of choice is the mushroom steak. De-freakin-licious. It's nigh on impossible to get a cheesesteak in London - I miss Jim's so so much.
