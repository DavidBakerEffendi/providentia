Ah mood cafe, the food icon of West Philadelphia , and one of the gems of Baltimore  Ave. My favorite is that I am always greeted with a warm smile. As for decour, what stands off most is the menus, large chalk boards with all of the offerings. Seating is not the most comfortable, and they also offer outdoor seating. Finally if you are looking for the silverware napkins and straws, they are located near the exit... Hard to find for newcomers. Their offerings? Chaat, indian street food, served with lovely crunchy bits, dates, mangos, sauces, radishes, and other veg... So tasty and the basic chaat being 6 dollars, there is nothing to loose. Mood cafe also offers an extensive lassi menu... Probably the most verbose of Philadelphia with options like prune orange, cardamom, and of course the traditional mango. What's crazy is they just started offering other Indian  delights such as chicken tikka, paneer, Lahori, basmati, and naan. Excited to try one of these options next time. Gotta knock it down one star because they are frequently closed in the evenings when they are supposed to be open. Also, even though they open at 12 they are not prepared to serve samosas. I would recommend to start prepping the kitchen a little early to offer their full menu. Continuing, their chaat menu is quite intimidating because there are absolutely no descriptions for what you are ordering. Finally over the past three years their portions have become smaller... Check out some of my pictures. If you are an adventurous eater, enjoy a standard luncheon place, and want to be greeted with a warm smile mood cafe is the place to go.
