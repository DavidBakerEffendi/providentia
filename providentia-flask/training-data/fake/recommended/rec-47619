Ok, yes it is on Albany Ave in Hartford's North End. No, I don't recommend stopping in here after dark but when I'm sick of my work cafeteria's choices of over priced entries, soups, salads, sandwiches and grill offerings, I come here for the greatest lunch treat ever: the $5 lunch combination. For $5, I get a hearty helping of rice and beans, jerk pork, perfectly steamed cabbage and some extra gravy with a ghetto C&C cola to go. The rice and beans are nicely flavored and never soggy (you can get white rice as well). The heaping helping of jerk pork is well seasoned and so deliciously moist that no knife is required. I like the crisp crunch of the cabbage to mix with the spices of the pork and rice. I never think the jerl pork is spicy enough but luckilly for me, they have an array of hot sauces to chose from.  The portions for  a lunch size are huge and I usually can't finish so it makes for a good dinner later on in the evening. I also recommend the fried Plantains; my friend and I get an order and split them on the car ride back to the office. My one slight is that parking can be sketchy but the Hartford P.D has better things to do in the North End then worry about parking issues. McGreggors also prefers if you pay in small bills, some times the attitude I get from paying with a twenty makes me take pause about coming back but the food is just that damn good.
