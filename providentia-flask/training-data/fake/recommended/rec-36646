How good is Balthazar? 4 days in NYC, only 1 day in SoHo. Came here 2x on that day. Had such a great meal in the morning that I canceled the already-planned-way-in-advance dinner reservations & opted to come back to Balthazar instead. I'd definitely say this place lives up to all the hype, including the hype of prices. But whatever... I'm not in NY to save a few dollars here and there. Made Sunday brunch reservations 4 weeks in advance for a coveted 10:30am timeslot. Despite being packed, our reservation was honored exactly on time. Bravo, hostesses & TY for being respectful of your diners' time, unlike most uber-popular restos! (And please, don't even think of coming here for Sunday brunch sans resos - that'd be pure masochism.) Also, despite being packed, service was always spot-on, fast & attentive. Coffee refills happened before we ever had to ask. Everyone else has covered the oohs & ahhs around the food, so I'll just leave 3 quick tips: (1) For your sanity, absolutely make reservations not matter which meal; (2) Les hu√Ætres selection: opt for east coast ones only, save your west coast cravings for when you're on the west coast (logical, huh?); (3) Tables are very close together, so if you're even a little claustrophobic, dine only during non-peak hours. 10pm dinner on Sunday night was magical! I cannot wait to come back. Love this place!
