Delicious delicious delicious.  Thin-crust pizza, great topping combos, convenient location, quick service, decent prices.  I always recommend this to my friends who come to visit, and they have all been hooked.  They have a few other locations scattered throughout the city as well. Love!  And as others have said before, this is definitely my favorite pizza place in NYC.
