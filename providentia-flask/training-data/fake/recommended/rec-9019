After all the hype I heard about this place I had pretty high hopes.  My experience was just ok... but good enough to want to go back and give it another go.   I tumbled in after a loooong day of sightseeing and just wanted a nice stiff drink and some filling cozy food.  The place definitely delivered on those two things at least.  When I walked in there wasn't a host stand so I just sidled up to a stool at the bar.  My bartender wasn't overly friendly... but not rude either.  He took my order and that's about it. The service was kinda slow for how busy it was in there, but I wasn't in a hurry so it was ok.   I ordered: Bloody Bull--VERY good.  Thick, full of flavor with a nice kick. Romain Wedge--also VERY good.  Nice and big with not too much dressing. Meatloaf Sandwich--HUUUGE!!  I took half home.  A giant slab of meatloaf topped with mashed potatoes, lettuce and buffalo sauce on yummy Texas toast.  The chips on the side were ok.  Could take 'em or leave 'em. I'd definitely be interested to see what the service is like in the dining room though so I'll definitely be back!
