Is it possible I have not rhapsodized over you yet?  Corner Bistro, you are one of my oldest NYC acquaintances.  But there is no nostalgic gauze over my eyes, for your charms remain ever in tact.  After quite a long while, I finally had the pleasure of partaking in your always-juicy burger.  Cooked to order, a true medium rare, both the hubs and I moaned and sighed as we devoured our bistro burgers, nearly 6 inches tall at the start.  Flavorfilledousness, with lettuce, tomato, onion, American cheese, and two generous strips of bacon...I don't know if I can go on.  And crispy thin fries of course.  All at our cozy corner booth, undistracted by decor beyond a heavily plastered wall.  (Yes, you're a different species than my other beloved at Spotted Pig, but you know what you are and it is a burger joint buger.)  You're worth every penny. Note: A pleasant time is 7pm on Monday; if you go later or on weekends, prepare for possible hour-long waits and other patrons who might not be there to focus on just enjoying a juicy burger.
