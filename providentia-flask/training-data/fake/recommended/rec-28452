A very difficult place to find as it is located down a flight of stairs and shares an address with a sushi restaurant on street level.   Its one of those Japanese places that offers an array of appetizers / tapas type dishes.  I'm a big fan of this type of food. The skewers "sampler" plate was adequate although some of the meat was a bit dry and tough. The fried chicken was perfectly juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside.   The kicmchi tasted fresh. The beef tongue was very tasty. Everything was very affordable and the place is very popular.  Many people were waiting for a table by the time 7pm (Thursday) rolled around.  The acoustics are terrible and I had to scream to be heard.
