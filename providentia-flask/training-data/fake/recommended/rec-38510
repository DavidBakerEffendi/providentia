Long time repeat vegan to-go customer here with the real deal... Food is as great as ever!!!... Service staff is consistently courteous, helpful but often "new here." Keep in mind it is a cafe so one can see why to-go ordering is preferred by reviews online. Order food 30 minutes before pick up. Prices were raised as of this post. I ordered over the phone and saw the lunch combo meal's price of $6.50 freshly erased from the board. I was told my two combo meals were $9.00 each (thats a half-sandwich & fries). The cake slice is now $6.00 not $5.00. They didn't have new menus reflecting that price increase or the price increases for all the other items. For now one should ask the price of items before ordering as the board, print menu and online menus are currently inaccurate.
