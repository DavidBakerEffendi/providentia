Dropped in for dinner ,what a disaster ,the place has a very nice feel and in a beautiful part of Brooklyn ,but the food ,don't bother. Salad was dry and disgusting with canned beans ,entrée was short rib steak? What? a lifeless cold piece of stringy meat with almost no sauce that was one of the worst ideas I have ever seen ,when I was asked if I wanted to take home this disaster I said no throw it in the garbage ,I don't know why but I ordered dessert ,I was still hungry ,tarte tatin is caramelized apples on inverted pastry it is not 5 or 6 pieces of poorly cut barely cooked apples on raw puff pastry ,couldn't eat it ,they took nothing of bill even though I didn't eat entrée or dessert I tipped the waitperson well, the wine I had was good and I will never go back, too bad pretty place
