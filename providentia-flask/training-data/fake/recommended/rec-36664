We were suckered in by the $25 wine list. Turns out the wines we saw on the online menu were switched out for the same makers but different vintages on the actual wine list. This changed our decision a bit but we were able to come up with a decent selection. The wine was good, a decent tasting easy-to-drink but not that great of a value. Before we sat down, we went to the bar because our table was not ready. The proseccos we bought were $12 each. I did not expect to pay that much for a glass of prosecco. Now for the food. I got the all-you-can-eat pasta. It was ok. I liked one of the 3 dishes more than the others -- the bowties with tomato and basil sauce. The spinach and ricotta ravioli was very oily and not that flavorful. The linguini with clam sauce was just okay as well. Other food we tried was the bowties with butter sauce which we liked. We also got the short ribs which were done well. The caesar salads were good. We got an appetizer which was mozzarella on thick toast. The toast was a little over toasted and the flavor overpowered the cheese -- but it was a decent appetizer. The cheese was very fresh and good. They also serve bread sticks and a bread basket with a ground chick peas and oil dipping sauce which we enjoyed. They have a dish of good olives -- green and black -- on the table as well. The waitstaff was great and very attentive.
