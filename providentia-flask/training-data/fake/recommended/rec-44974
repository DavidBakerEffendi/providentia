for a large midtown restaurant, the food is fantastic!!! i love italian restaurants that don't have 10000 pasta dishes, pizza, and chicken parm. The bartenders were a riot! very friendly and let us try a bunch of different wines before we got the one we liked. And what a selection of wines! Because the place is so big you will run into every type of person. Tourists, business people, people on a romanic date, families, etc. I don't see myself eating there often, though. It's too big of a restaurant and good for once in a while with family from out of town.
