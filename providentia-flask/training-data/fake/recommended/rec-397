Went to Nai for my birthday with 13 people. They could not have been more accommodating, responsive and helpful. The experience was well beyond expectations and I will definitely be back. In fact, I bet all of my 12 guests will go back on their own. The Flamenco is not cheesy, as some might think. It's a real surprise in an otherwise mundane city of restaurants with no oomph. What to order... Gambas Ajillo - shrimp in garlic sauce - superb! Croquetas De Jamon - Serrano Ham croquetttes - a very nice dish! Croquetas De Pollo - chicken croquettes Albondiguillas - meatballs in brandy sauce- so delicious! Patatas Alioli - potato in creamy garlic sauce Patatas Bravas - potato in spicy tomato sauce Tortilla Espanola - Spanish omelet Churrasco - skirt steak sauteed with spicy cherry peppers and garlic Chorizo Plancha- grilled Spanish sausage Bacalao Frito. - fresh cod loin lightly fried.
