I largely agree with Tori on this place - went here for dinner and the food was just ok.  They didn't screw anything up royally, but nothing was that impressive either (tried the foie gras, the pork belly, the trout, and the oxtail ravioli, which are actually oxtail dumplings btw).  The dining area decor is modern.  The other guests are as pretentious as many of the staff.  The bar was easily the most active spot in the restaurant (coat check was a close second).   A modest proposal: airlift Public to the meatpacking district - problem solved.
