I stopped in for lunch. Very friendly woman took my order. Great look to the place with wood picnic table and yellow and red painted walls. I ordered the chicken breast on a whole wheat baguette. Excellent chicken and house aoli with tomato and lettuce. The bread was not as good as the chicken, but good. I'll certainly go again!
