Went on 2/2.  Best BYO experience that I have had in the city for some time.  Had both the antipasti special with clams and the pasta course special of raviolettis stuffed with veal and rabbit.  For an entree, I had the guancè.  Veal cheeks may not sound appetizing, but it was one of the greatest tasting dishes. Chocolate flourless cake was a little too flourless for my taste buds.  The tiramisu was done to perfection. The complimentary shot of sambuca at the end of the evening was a welcomed digestif to keep us warm as we headed home on a cold winter night.  We cannot wait to go back!
