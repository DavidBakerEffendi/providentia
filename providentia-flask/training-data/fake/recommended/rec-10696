Soooooo delicious!! I ordered the lambchops medium and they were grilled to perfection to the T! enough juice, wasn't overcooked at all. It was tender and so tasty. (The best part? It did not have the "gamey" after taste :) ) The flavor was WOWWWWWW! The portion was definitely pretty generous, for the price. I mean the dish had FOUR pieces!.  The rice that it comes with is average - nothing special. If it was lightly seasoned I would definitely be to my liking.  My friend her hubby ordered the assortment of seafood and the scallops were soooo amazing, no fishy flavor whatsoever.  It was plump, tender, moist and naturally flavorful! You could definitely taste that it was FRESH, not the frozen kind. They ordered the lemon potatoes as the side dish and that was also very good. I normally don't like any citrus-y flavor in my food but it was a pinch of lemon flavor so that it wasn't overpowering. yummmm! Oh and the dessert that came with the meal was very delicious as well.  Nothing tasted like just SALT, it had its natural taste with light seasoning. Just how I like my food. YUMMM. Service: It's a little bit RUSHED since they're so busy.  It was a little annoying to have to tell the waiters that we weren't ready to have our dishes removed yet.   We also ordered the grilled octopus appetizer and it was too charcoaly.  We told one of the servers who in turn told the manager.  The manager didn't even need to ask us what the issue was so instead, he just came over with another freshly made order.  I mean, nothing really beats that.  The second time around, was sooo much more better. Will definitely come back! Will probably try to come back on an evening that's less chaotic.
