Every time I'm here is after a night of too many beverages at the point you lose control of what you're eating and you devour pretty much everything in sight. I also end up here with colleagues, equally ready to fill that belly, which is why we end up ordering half of the menu. I know I have some definite favorites here but to be honest, it's hard to hit a miss with this place - all is delicious. Not to mention the sake. Turns out this is the place to be for late night food. It's been so busy every single time I've gone, one night we ended up leaving b/c the wait was going to be too long.
