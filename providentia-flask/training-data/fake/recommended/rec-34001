Not to condescend, but I was surprised to find a restaurant of this caliber in Winooski, VT.  I'm having a hard time trying to recall anything we ate here that wasn't at least tasty.  Standouts included the old bread and young onions, a fresh ricotta with bee pollen, crispy chicken skins and a perfectly cooked hanger steak.   Ordinarily a place with a sandwich named after Kurt Vonnegut would vex me, but I'm sort of immune to this apparently ubiquitous nonsense after years of living in Brooklyn.  Plus, when the food and drinks are unassailable and the service is excellent, hip retro fetishism is something I can easily look past. If you spend a night in Winooski and don't stop by here, you're making a mistake.
