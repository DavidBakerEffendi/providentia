A friend of mine introduced me to this place a few months ago. I have only been there for brunch, but I loved it! The atmosphere and servers have that cool and quirky flare which I have never managed to achieve myself. Their "Dill scrambled eggs with feta" and the "creme brulee battered french toast" send me to breakfast-food heaven. The place is relatively cost-effective with a total of around 11ish (with coffee, which is also very good.) I am a breakfast food-o-phile in that I could eat breakfast food 24/7. When I say I really like this place, I mean it! Only downside-it's cash only, so stop by the ATM!
