We went because I had heard wonderful things about Ola - I love authentic Mexican food.  I only wish I had been forewarned (by coming to this website!) about the pricing.  We did not have a reservation and were told, "No problem" by the host and promptly seated (too close to the cold entryway) at a table with a 'reserved' sign on it.  If it hadn't been below freezing outside, I probably wouldn't have minded the table.  We were given the drinks list (but not the wine) with no pricing listed.  That's always a tip off.  We asked for the wine list.  A young lady put a small dish of something down on the table along with a biscuit for each of us.  I suppose this is a Latin thing (the place is NOT Mexican).  We received the wine list, ordered two glasses of cabernet, and I requested a menu (had to ask?)  I saw guacamole for $12.50 and realized this place was nuts with their pricing.  Then I saw skirt steak for $27.50 and said to my spouse, "Let's get the hell out of here!"  This was NOT Manhattan, but a basement in a freakin strip mall in Orange, CT!
