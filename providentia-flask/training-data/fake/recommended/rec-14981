El Camino Real was a lot better when it opened; recently I've found it less and less interesting. They have a few veg options so most every time I've been there I've had either the veggie "wings" or the seitan taco salad. There definitely used to be an additional option that they got rid of, and they aren't good at making a simple substitution when it's something simple like seitan for chicken in a burrito. I would still stop in and get my favorites if the service were better, but it never is. From a waiter talking about 1/2 price margaritas but then failing to tell us that the specific one we ordered was not discounted, and not adjusting the price when we pointed this out, to waiting ten plus minutes just to get a bill, it seems like nobody here wants to work. I just can't tolerate such poor service.
