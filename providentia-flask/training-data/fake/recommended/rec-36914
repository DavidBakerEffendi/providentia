So the reason I was brought here was for a huge "can you survive this?!" by a guy and I have to say, I passed with flying colors--with the greatest of ease--and how could I not because Corner Bistro is a little slice of Americana right in the West Village. This place is very middle America--no menus just 5 or 6 options, 1 of them being fries, another being chili and the remaining variations of classic burgers. The burger was delish and the wait time wasn't that bad at all for a Tuesday early evening. From what I've heard, there is always a huge line! Bon Appetit (on your paper plate!)
