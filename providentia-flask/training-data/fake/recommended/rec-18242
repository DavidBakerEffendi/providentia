My boyfriend and I went there for the first time this weekend. Overall, the atmosphere is awesome, as I am a huge fan of colonial homes. Wish I could say the same for the service. I ordered the Soup of the Day, which was a "Brooklyn Clam Chowder". When I asked what made the soup "Brooklyn", the waitress informed me "well, it has clams in it". Um, doesn't clam chowder always have clams? Along with not being very knowledgeable, our waitress kept disappearing, and when she did re-appear, she had to keep asking us what we ordered. Food was good, but pricey. I will definitely give Lucky Lou's another chance. Hopefully I will have better service next time.
