There is something to be said for a beautifully relaxed space serving up affordable snacks and beverages. This was the spot for us on a cool yet comfortable fall weeknight. I was in need of a long, overdue chat sesh with a girlfriend and this was perfect. The wine by the glass selection was extensive and their food sounded all very tempting. Plus, without a wait we were immediately sitting outside and enjoying the catch up convo. After what seemed like hours of chatting, two rounds of drinks, and snacks - we were over the moon with this place. I especially loved how everyone around us that night were in the same mellow mode. It was refreshing not having any distractions while we were there. I can't wait to make my way back to this place.
