This place is amazing.  I went there for the first time yesterday and we arrived 15 minutes before happy hour, and they didn't pressure us to order before HH started so that was a nice way to begin everything.   We ordered the vegan wings and a grilled artichoke and spinach salad that was a special for the evening.  The food was AMAZING!!!  I have attempted to follow a vegetarian lifestyle for the past few months, but I have this terrible weakness for buffalo wings.  So when my friend brought me here to try their vegan wings, I am happy to say they were way better than I ever expected them to be!   The protein was like the crunchy pieces from real chicken wings and mixed with brussel sprouts and it was served with an apricot horseradish sauce.  I admit the sauce sounded like an odd choice but when you try it all together...phenominal. The salad was this delicate, delicious mix of grill artichoke hearts (which slightly warmed the dressing, and it was lovely), baby spinach, capers, red onions, and a citrus vinaigrette.  I recommend this salad as great option for sharing before jumping into the other yummy food.   The happy hour times are great for people who are traveling from a distance (like myself) who want good food at reasonable prices.  They had a great selection of beer that was part of HH, and overall this was a very satisfying experience.  I will be back, and hopefully often!
