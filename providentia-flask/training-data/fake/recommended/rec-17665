Village Inn is located in a lovingly restored wood frame building. Atmosphere and ambience abound, and it is a lovely setting. Unfortunately the owners who did the loving restoration have sold it and moved on. The new owners have ideas, but the execution is lacking. The food does not live up to expectations. And there are some curious lapses..... if a restaurateur is going to have a wine list organised by varietals, he/she should learn to spell varietal. ( not v-a-r-i-t-a-l). The lounge is a nice place to have a cocktail. But as a restaurant.... it's a nice cocktail lounge.
