At the recommendation of my brother, whom we were visiting from Hawaii and lives within a couple blocks of this place, my family and I ate brunch at Bistro Les Amis at the corner of Spring and Thompson. The perfect spot when spending a day in SoHo. Interesting fact: Apparently brunch in NYC lasts till around 4pm. The restaurant opened at 11:30 which was perfect timing after our morning Canal Street adventure. Touristy, yes I know, but fun!  We walked in to find a charming little restaurant with a classy atmosphere.  It was nice to be in the warmth of this cozy bistro after walking around all morning in 40 degree weather. The food was awesome and the price was reasonable. I was happy to find a fresh, warm loaf of bread waiting to be buttered and devoured. The omelets - my brother had the salmon and herb with sour cream and I had ham, apple and brie were delicious. The side of shoestring potatoes, crispy and thin were the perfect compliment to our eggs. However, the star of this place was the goat cheese and sun dried tomato ravioli with saffron sauce, which was a Special of the Day.  PLEASE make this as a regular menu item just so I can order this the next time I visit! Hands down, my favorite eatery this whole trip.
