Very very happy. Ordered seemingly boring rigatoni but it was SO good that I can't figure out how they did it with maybe 5 ingredients. Fantastic. The fact that a waitress interrupted me ordering a pear-and-whiskey crumble to be sure that I knew it was not a parrot-whiskey crumble made me laugh so hard I was crying. Easy choice to eat here.
