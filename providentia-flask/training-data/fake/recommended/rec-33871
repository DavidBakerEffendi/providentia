We had dinner with friends a couple weeks ago and were pleasantly surprised. The place looks bigger from the outside but inside is very homey. We were seated immediately and had a bunch of questions which the waitress politely and patiently answered. She even told us that portions would be huge and recommended the half portion. She was right. We ordered the half portion and even that was massive. Needless to say this place is an excellent value and delicious.
