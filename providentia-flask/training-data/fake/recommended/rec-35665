Very good food, very friendly owners. And, like I said, REALLY good food. The reason it's getting 4 and not 5 stars is because even though the food is always good, it's fairly inconsistent. While I don't ever dislike my meal, I can order the same thing 3 times, and the 3rd time it's the same dish, but isn't the exact flavor I was expecting. I'll chalk this up to it being made by true homestyle cooks, who do not measure but cook by "feel", and just continue coming here for great Ethiopian food.
