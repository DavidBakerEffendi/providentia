If you are having brunch in Astoria, have it here. Hell, if you're having brunch in general and don't mind the trip to Astoria...HAVE IT HERE!! I'll get right down to it this place is amazingly priced, has a friendly staff and the food is DARN good. 15 bucks gets you TWO mimosas/belinis a hot drink of choice and food item. I'm not sure I can contain my excitement for this place. PROS - Inexpensive -Great food! -Fast service! Nice staff CONS - The only con I can conceive of is that this place isn't closer to my home. Now if we can only work on that..
