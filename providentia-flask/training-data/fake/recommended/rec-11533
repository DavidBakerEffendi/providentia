Ok, so first let me start by saying that we did NOT have the pizza here. I'm just not a pizza for dinner type of person (weird I know).  First I'll start with atmosphere and waitstaff. Atmosphere was surprisingly better than I expected. Cozy and casual and VERY clean looking.  The waitstaff although very young was good. Very polite and no complaints. Now onto the food: I got a house salad, chicken piccata, and spaghetti with marinara.  The salad had nice greens and lots of sliced carrots (which I love) but the dressing was "off".  Too much pepper which overpowered the balsamic vinaigrette and gave it a spicy flavor (not in a good way).  The chicken piccata was good, chicken was moist and well-cooked.  Sauce was good, nice lemon flavor without being overpowering.  I was disappointed with the marinara sauce, it was very runny and on the bland side. My husband had baked ziti as his side and he liked it. Overall, I'm not in a rush to go back, but now that I know how to order, I "might" go back in the future and try the pizza (for lunch of course).
