Having never had a cheesesteak at Pat's or Geno's, my husband and I randomly chose Geno's over Pat's (yes, we're from out of town). We got there around 4pm on a Saturday before going to see a Phillies game and waited in the line, which wrapped around the building, for probably about 20 minutes or so, which wasn't that bad. When we were the next to be served, we heard someone from another window say something along the lines of "Can I help the next person?" so, thinking he was talking to us since we were next in line, we took one or two steps to the left (out of the original line) and toward that other window and then realized that the other windows were for drinks or sides only. So we stepped BACK to our original spot, and the older man taking orders said to us, "Line starts back there," motioning to where we got in line 20 minutes before. We proceeded to explain that we WERE in line, even asked the guy in line behind us to vouch for us, and he laughed it off and said "I don't know, I don't know..." Long story short, the man taking orders was RUDE, accusatory, and embarrassed us. He did eventually take our order, but not before making a scene. I understand that this is Philly and all that, but customers are customers and should not be made to feel insulted. Other than the rude service, the sandwiches were okay. My husband and I each got a sandwich and a drink and we paid around $25. If I could do it over, I'd just save my time and money and get food at the stadium. Needless to say, we won't be back.
