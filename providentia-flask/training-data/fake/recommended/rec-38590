I really wanted to enjoy this place more because a friend recommended it to me but I wasn't overly impressed with the food. The chips appetizer was really good with the onion dipping sauce and the bread they provided was excellent. I ordered the grilled Caesar Salad, which was really good, if this were the only items I ordered I probably would have given it a much higher score but I was disappointed with my entree. My entree was the Grilled Tofu and there was a lack of flavor to the tofu, I could taste that it had a kick of spicy to it but that was about it. The quinoa was mediocre, I liked that it had bits of cranberry or grapes in it, but overall my dish lacked flavor. We ordered the Chocolate Souffle for dessert and I was expecting it to be amazing because it was so expensive and it took 25 minutes to make. Well I was sadly disappointed. It was very dry and not that flavorful. A friend ordered the Creme Brulee and I would have been much happier with that. I can't say that I would never go here again but it is unlikely that I would return. Also the music was too loud, it was obnoxiously loud at times where it was hard to speak to people at my table. If I wanted to listen to obnoxiously loud music I would go to Fridays or a bar, I don't really care that it's live music, people are trying to have dinner and it was irritating.
