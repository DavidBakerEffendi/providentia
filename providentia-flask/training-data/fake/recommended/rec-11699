This place gets 5 stars for its GIANT buttermilk biscuits and apple butter. I had to take my friend's biscuit home with me (who takes a tiny bite of a biscuit this good and STOPS eating??), and the waitress was nice enough to pack the butter for me as well without any judgement on her face. Mmmmm. OH, the brunch food is good as well - I got the corned beef "hash" with poached eggs. Fresh chunks of corned beef and potatoes made it much more delicious and (feel) healthier than the usual diner version. I was eye-ing all surrounding dishes as they came out - seems the kale with sunny side up eggs is a must try.
