Compared to Geno's, Pat's was a wash. When we got up to the window, there was no greeting. The guy said "What do you want?" and when my husband hesitated over onions or not, the guy leaned forward and said "Next in line!". Â Wow, okay. So we ordered finally after the guy took another order. If you don't know what exactly you want on your sandwich and the lingo to speak it in, things go downhill fast here. Totally different attitude than Geno's. When we got our sandwiches, we were really disappointed in the stale bread. Lots of toppings, but the bread was incredibly tough and hard to chew. There's only outside seating, and napkins and such are self service. The sandwich wasn't bad, other than the bread, but it was the rude customer service that has kept us from returning to Pat's.
