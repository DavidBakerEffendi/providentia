A bit pricey but the lunch special is reasonable and changes day by day. "Today's Toast" is $10 but has a wonderful topping that also changes depending on the day (salmon is my favorite!) Their various choices for tea sets (choice of tea, meal and dessert) are fun! I've had the chrysanthemum, jasmine, matcha and orange pekoe tea (all recommended.) For dessert, try the black sesame creme brulee. The bidet toilet in the restroom is wonderful! There is a soft incense scent in the bathroom.
