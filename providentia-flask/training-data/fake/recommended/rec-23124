Love it !   Great food,  warm cozy atmosphere,   Great service and the best desert anywhere .... The white choc bread pudding .... Worth every calorie! My suggestion if you want a nice relaxing meal that the place can offer don't go after 9pm on a Sat.  The band is too loud and you just can't here yourself even in the dining room ....too small a place for those loud bands.....too bad they can't sound proof the dining area.  The work around is go before 9pm .      Definitely go - you won't be disappointed !
