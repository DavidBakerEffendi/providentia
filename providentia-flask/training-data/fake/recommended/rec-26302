I needed a restaurant reservation for a Saturday night and La Mezzaluna had availability and yelp reviews I read were generally positive. The waiter was on the ball - very attentive and provided a good overview of the menu and the night's specials. I had the chicken tartufo which was a bit on the salty side and the chicken was a bit overcooked but no real complaints. The rest of the foursome had the seafood fra diavolo which all seemed to enjoy. They were able to adjust the "heat" so the food was enjoyable and tasty for all. It would have been nice to have the lobster shelled as an option as no one wanted to splatter over their nice clothes. Speaking of dress, I was surprised at the super casual dress of some of the patrons but they were at least clean and neat. Overall, a nice place but we would consider the many other choices Princeton offers before returning.
