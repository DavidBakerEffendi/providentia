New York Pizza and Pasta in Vermont? Juniors is what most in the area call "the best pizza around". I can't back that up since I was in the mood for some carb loading and pasta was #1 on my list. After a recommendation and a friendly call from the hotel front desk I was on my way over to Juniors on a weeknight after 9pm. The building seems brand new and stands out with it's huge reddish glowing sign above the door. Once inside the Italian eatery is split into 3 sections. Pizza/Bakery, bar and the Vino/Dining room. Walls are decorated with Italian Terra cotta colors and paintings. The vino room has built in wine racks with many bottles of wine. I pulled up a chair at the bar ordered a beer and dove into dissecting the menu. Pasta, pasta where are you???? Choices to say the least.....any pasta with any sauce you want. Like it! My choice- Angel hair, mushrooms, light cream sauce. Not the best ever but not bad either. Hit the spot for dinner with a small garden salad and some bread sticks to munch on. Next time I will try the pizza.
