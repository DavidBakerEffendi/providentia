Ambiance and decor great. Food-ok. Â Would definitely come back for drinks and sit at the bar but the food is overrated. The bread looks very appetizing but is served cold in the center (wouldn't think this is on purpose). I ordered the pasta bolognese which was just ok. My friend had the risotto said it was just ok too.
