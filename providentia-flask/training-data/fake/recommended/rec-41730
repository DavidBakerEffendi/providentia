My mouth is watering as I write this, as I long for the pork buns that were once on my plate. If I could order them to go, I would order them by the dozens and freeze them for later consumption. Alas, you do not allow take-out... all the best, as the anticipation grows when I wait for a table for 2 hours makes these juicy buns feel like they dropped out of heaven and were made just for me. The ramen is d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s. (Though I would fast on only pork buns if I could....) It has this yummy soy paste, which you should definitely order extra. If you're really hungry, get double noodles, but be prepared to unbutton your pants when you walk out of there with all the liquid and pork bun goodness. Absolutely worth the wait. Haven't yet tasted a better ramen spot in NY with the same quality of food and service. Now who wants to go to Ippudo?
