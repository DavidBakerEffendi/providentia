Conte's pizza is pretty good for the Princeton area. They do a true thin crust. I don't get why some people below me are bashing the crust: its thin crust people! The crust is not the star of the show, it's there so you don't have to hold on to cheese and tomato sauce while you eat. Get the pepperoni pizza, this place has always had the best pepperonis - they are thick sliced, small, and curl up into tiny little grease saucers in the oven. Conte's has been in Princeton forever, and for good reason.
