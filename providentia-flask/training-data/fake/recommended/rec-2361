As far as sushi and sashimi go, Izumi is tops. The staff is always super friendly and accommodating. And it's a BYOB, which makes it even better. They almost always have a rock shrimp tempura as a special. The first time I tried this dish, it was graciously comped by the chef because the waitstaff asked us to move tables. Now it the dish a staple, ordered every time I go. It is melt-in-your-mouth good. The tuna sashimi is always incredibly fresh. The atmosphere is relaxed and casual. I like dining there in the summer when the windows are open and Passyunk Avenue is bustling. Izumi is consistently very good.
