i usually don't write about places so saturated with egos and center city arrogance but my brunch at parc on sunday was decent and surprisingly acceptable. it was a typical gorgeous phila sunday and my friend and i wanted to eat somewhere fun. so i suggested parc, only because you can sit outside and overlook the park, not so much because of the food or the ambiance. i enjoy the location of the restaurant, i do believe Mr. Starr chose a very good plot of land, however as i mentioned before, i do not like the center city/ NY wannabe, mentality behind this restaurant. Yes, it is kinda expensive and random show-offs do pull up in front with their range rovers and Lamborghini's but this is phila and that extravagance isn't as widely accepted or condoned as it is in NYC. My friend knew the hostess so we skipped the 35 minute for a table outside and sat at a nice clean table on the corner of the park. within minutes we had a waiter who recommended the steak and eggs entree. however my friend wanted eggs benedict and i chose the cheeseburger. after about 10 minutes 2 men pull up in a loud Ferrari and idle outside devon/parc pretending like they can't find a parking spot and in doing so leave their engine running for 10 minutes. not only is this annoying but i felt like getting up and going over there and telling them that there is a consensus that no one cares about their car/ opulence. AS IF THAT WASN'T EXPECTED. the food was decent. my cheeseburger was tasty, came with a surplus of fries. my friends eggs were cooked well- she asked for lox instead of the usual ham and the waiter seemed fine with the request. overall i am happy with the brunch selection. it was a great day to sit outside in center city and until i find maybe a less expensive place to eat brunch near the park, unfortunately parc will have to do.
