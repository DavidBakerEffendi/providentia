Good restaurant good atmosphere - everything is there but tasting food - New Yorkers we are spoiled we know super food the only reason you come here is because of reviews - if you are looking for service and Borgua food delivery to your table with cool names for the dishes and presentation come here - my opinion if New York your better have a better menu to lure us!
