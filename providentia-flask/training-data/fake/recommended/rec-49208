Rock solid. Up front, no reservations here and the space is very tight so if either of those bum you out don't go. Bartender could stand to tone his act down a little bit, but overall the staff is great. Wide variety of menu options from chicken to fried pork shank to seafood of the day to a steak. Oysters are great news, and bad news -- great news is every day they have a selection of 3 different east coast oysters for $1.50 (that's ~50% of what most places charge) -- bad news is that what appears to be ice that they are serving it on is really rock salt, that just doesn't cut it. I love oysters but don't order them anymore because room temperature isn't how oysters were meant to be served. Their explanation is that space constraints do not allow for them to keep enough ice on hand to use it with the oysters, bogus. Get yourself a bloody mary with a beer backer, they know how to make a good one. Good selection of beers on draft and in the bottle.  Wine list is passable but they don't have a corkage policy -- that's kind of weak.  There just is no plausible explanation for the lack of a corkage policy. Bottom line is this place has excellent food, a solid staff, and a great vibe...give it a shot.
