The food to say the least was amazing my girlfriend had the fish and grits which to our surprise was made with catfish ( very rare ) I had the smoked pork hash served with eggs; potatoes and salsa. This dish was pretty good "I would love to see it served on a plate instead of a bowl. The place is rather small and the staff are like robots not rude just busy due to the high traffic and the limited space. Yes I would go back... and ps the biscuits were amazing.
