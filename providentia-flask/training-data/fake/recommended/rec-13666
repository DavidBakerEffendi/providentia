I now better understand a Michelin rating. We were seated right away. I like the decor and am not sure why someone would go off on the library feel, postal boxes and everything else. All of that worked for me because I was there for the food, not to actually read or mail a postcard. The flowering trees outside really added to the overall atmosphere. A friendly waitress is always a plus. I had the parsnip soup (fantastic) and my wife ordered the grilled scallops which she really liked. Then I had the mushroom tortellini (whoa) and my wife had the duck (really delicious.) Then for dessert I had the carrot cake (really inventive) and my wife had the sticky toffee (so good). The wine was very nice and our total bill was $126. Great crowd, nice bathrooms, attentive service, and overall a great evening. Oh, and the selection of bread at the very start was a nice surprise. I think a selection of four different kinds. Just really, really great.
