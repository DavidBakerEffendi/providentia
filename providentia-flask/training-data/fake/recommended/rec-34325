Should be 2.5 stars. Had the penne vodka, mediocre, friend had a sandwich, mediocre, but what really killed it was the clams Oreganata. I love clams Oreganata, and I've had ALOT. But the dish here had wayyyyyyyyyyyy too much breadcrumbs. Like caked on. And the sauce was ok. But the excess of breadcrumbs ruined it.
