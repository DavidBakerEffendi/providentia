Based on past experiences for lunch and dinner, I would have given this place a three star.  Everything is good, but nothing out of this world.  But after my last visit, they get an extra star.   I finally tried one of the Hungarian dishes - stuffed cabbage with a light sweet and sour tomato sauce, served with a side of spaetzle (little dumplings).  WOW.  So, so good.  The portion was so enormous, it will be my dinner again tonight.  I have no idea if it's "authentic" Hungarian, or if a Hungarian would even think it was good.  Other Hungarian offerings include beef goulash, wiener schnitzel and sauerbraten.  In addition to the Hungarian dishes, they do offer fish, chicken, veal and beef dishes, as well as dinner salads and sandwiches. There is a large bar if you just want to grab a drink, in fact it's the only bar right in town, and outdoor seating on the porch in the warmer months.
