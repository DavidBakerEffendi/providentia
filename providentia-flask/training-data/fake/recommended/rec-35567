Service was spot on and the food was delicious!! Went there for the big 1 year wedding anniversary last month and it was nothing short than perfect. Strongly recommend making reservations and we were encouraged to order 5-6 plates per person in true tapas restaurant style. Don't forget to order the chocolate torte for dessert as the Nutella ice cream is to die for!! Will come again!!
