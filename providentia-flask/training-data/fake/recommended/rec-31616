This small local restaurant is well worth the wait. The portions are large, the food is excellent, and the prices are low. I ordered the mixed grill and I was astonished by the amount of food on the plate, this is easily an entree that you can share. The gyro meat is more authenticate Greek then most Americans are accustomed which will disappoint some. This place does not serve alcohol but is BYOB and there is a liquor store a couple doors down. If you can catch this place when it is not packed jump on the opportunity you will not be disappointed.
