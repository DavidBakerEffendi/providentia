I have eaten here many times over the years...specifically for the half priced sushi, which is now a staple on their menu.  Even the specialty rolls are half priced, which is a steal!  I LOVE the treasure island app...yummy tuna, salmon and yellowtail wrapped in a layer of sliced avocado with some sauce and tobiko on top...so good!  Have tried most of their specialty rolls and love them all.  Some of the more basic rolls are pretty standard and plain but can't complain for $3-$4 each!  Hibachi is good too, although I usually go for the sushi and sit in the regular dining room.  One complaint is the slow service.  Most times I have visited, there are only 1-2 servers covering the 15 or so tables...although when I visited more recently, they were attentive...almost too attentive, even tried to snag our plates before we were finished.  So, I guess it just depends on the night and how busy they are.  Either way, I plan to continue to eat here on a regular basis.  Atmosphere is pleasant...hibachi room (noisy), bar area (classy/upscale feel) and dining room has nice couches and large tables for groups.  Parking is mostly on the street, although there is a small lot adjacent to the side entrance off State st.
