A few friends and I were just checking out Princeton and were looking for a bite to eat on Nassau Street.  After passing some potential little restaurants, we came across this place and for some reason I looked at it and said let's eat here. The place is clean and well decorated for a small hole in the wall place.  I'd assume it's family owned.  And the food is delicious.  I had a chicken and pesto slice of pizza Chi-Town style and it was one of the best slices I had in a while.  Very tasty.  And not too pricey.  The slices are a good portion too. I definitely recommend this place for people visiting the town.  Since I don't live in Princeton, I don't know how it compares to other places nearby.  But it's a quick place to grab a bite if you're looking for something that's not a nice sit-down restaurant, but not fast food either.
