Went to Max Fish today...again. For appetizer we had the rock shrimp maki roll, it was ok. not bad but def not up to the standards of everything else i've tried here. For dinner we had the lobster ravioli and atlantic cod w/ gnocchi and chanterrelle mushrooms in sage butter. The cod was topped with a roasted beet salad. This was an amazing dish. I LOVED IT!!! The gnocchi had such a great consistancy, different from the usual gnocchi I've tried. I think they use some kind of rice/mochi flour instead of regular flour to achieve the chewiness. The lobster ravioli was good too but to be honest I think I still prefer Pazzo's version. For dessert we had the cucumber mint sorbet. Very clean and refreshinging, a very light dessert.
