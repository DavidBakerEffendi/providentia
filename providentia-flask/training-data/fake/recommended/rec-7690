Does this restaurant think it is in midtown NYC?  Or even directly in center city?  The prices were ridiculous for being right across the street from the Eastern State Penitentiary.   Food was ok, however it used too much oil for everything.  Tried the blood orange marinated seitan, the grilled octopus salad, and the truffle oil fries.  Was not very impressed by the restaurant at all.
