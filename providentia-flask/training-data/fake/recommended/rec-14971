Large, rotating & often rare selections of both draft & can beer draw me here. Creative & diverse food menu with new additions every couple of weeks keeps me coming back.   Earlier this year, I bought my first house just a couple blocks away from American Sardine.  As anyone else who lives in Point Breeze is aware, there are very very limited selections (and by limited, I mean 0 selections) on a neighborhood pub/restaurant in the immediate area. Sure, north of Washington Ave. is walkable.. but I don't always want to make that trek. This makes me love the Sardine that much more. The menu changes just enough to keep it feeling like new for me; the staff & service remain consistently great. Also -- the portions of the fries & onions rings are pretty enormous, best for sharing. Some nights it can be difficult to find a table, but then they will open up the 2nd floor for more seating options.. although I always prefer sitting at the bar anyway because the bartenders almost always make good company. When my parents are in town, they don't love having to get up to look at the chalkboard menus... but I can't in good faith deduct points for that as I personally don't mind at all. The patty melt is to die for... and almost literally, my poor arterties. Get a sandwich Pittsburgh style if you're up for the physical challenge. Happy hour 4-6pm offers 1/2 priced cans.
