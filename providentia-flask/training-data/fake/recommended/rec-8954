Came for a birthday dinner with my family before heading out to see a show. As we were being seated, it was explained that Print is a farm to table restaurant, with ingredients being sourced daily and locally. Very cool in my opinion. SERVICE: I usually do food first, but the service we had was top notch. Our server gave us wine recommendations, and when we still hesitated, he gave us tastes of several to help our selection. His recommendations for food were also delicious. And the entire staff is very unobtrusive while still being very attentive. They removed the plants on the table when they noticed we kept reaching around them. Our server quietly confirmed cooking preferences that he forgot to ask about for the rabbit dish - not disrupting our table's conversation. Last, they waited to clear dishes until everyone was done - and never interrupted to ask if they could clear. Really just perfect. FOOD: Now the food was also really great. I got the gnocchi and my sister got the octopus. The gnocchi was really delicious and the octopus was tender and not chewy at all. Highly recommend both. Also portion sizes were pretty large. For my main, I got sea bass. It was a nice dish that felt filling but at the same time light. For dessert we split a chocolate s'more cake. It was good but comparatively to the rest of the meal, I could have done without. ENVIRONMENT: We had a really early dinner to catch our show - so the restaurant was almost empty when we started. By the end though, it was packed. However, acoustics didn't make it overly loud. Lighting was pretty dark. The restaurant was a bit hard to find - but there's not too much else on the block so you can't really miss it.
