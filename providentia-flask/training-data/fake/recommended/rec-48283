This place is hit or miss with its food and desserts depending on what and when you order them. Thier cakes are often stale. You can find out which cakes were recently made and are fresh by asking the counter person. Be sure to whisper it so as not to draw attention to yourself. This has worked for me many times. Well that and maybe because I give a death stare as if to say, "This cake betta be fresh!" Cakes aside, the Tonno is excellent but ask for the sauce on the side. They are notorious for drenching the entire dish with the it. Also their brunches are great. Now for the most important part: the Baba Rum. I was religiously going to P.B. for their Baba Rum because they were the only people that made it on Staten Island and made it well. One night I order it and the waiter brings over a mutilated Baba. It was sliced down the middle and filled with some sort of cannoli cream or other custardy mess and was topped with a cherry. I spoke to the waiter about the changling and he called over the owner's son who explained to me that they had to alter the Baba Rum because the traditional one was not "moving." I wasn't moved by this explanation and was torn between crying or slapping someone in hopes of feeling better. So I am again Babaless in Staten Island because a) Staten Islanders wouldn't know authentic Italian food if it jumped up and slapped them in the face and b) because Staten Island restaurants must cater to the under-evolved palates of most Staten Islanders. Che` schifo!
