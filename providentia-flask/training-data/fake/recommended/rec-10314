My wife and I simply love this place.  We've been there perhaps two dozen times in a three year period and have always found the food to be good or better.  The service has been consistently good (and often very friendly) although when it gets busy things do slow down a bit which is to be expected. The raw bar is second to none as far as variety is concerned in my opinion.  The desserts are reportedly home made and always good. I've also hosted several private business meetings at Max's with great results. They have an really nice small meeting/dining room tucked away in the back.
