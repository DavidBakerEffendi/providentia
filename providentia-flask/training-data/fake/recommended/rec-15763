i went there based on YELP reviews. The place is very cute, have a nice quite ambiance to it they play buddha bar music so you can have a decent coversation without screaming. food was very good, service was excellent!! quite BIG portions as well. Make your own Thai Ice Tea was a highlight. Mushroom appetizer, Green Curry,Pad  Thai, Tom Yum Fried Rice ( sour as tom yum should be)  taste good. highly recoment this joint for a small group of 2-4. the restaurent is very small. Sunday speacial $15 for 1 appetizer, Main Course and a Drink. Great deal.
