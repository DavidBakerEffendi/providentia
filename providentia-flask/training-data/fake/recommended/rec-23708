Lombardi's is an institution and is the first ever to serve pizza in New York City. It's gotten a lot of hype and exposure so it's a bit touristy. Expect REALLY long lines. The shortest ever encountered by friends was a half hour on Monday night. Most the time it's an hour and a half or more. Their pizza is tasty though. Get the classic cheese. Simply sauce and fresh mozzarella. Cooked in a coal oven (rare) at 900 plus degrees its thin and crispy. Very yum. Also was told to have the clam pizza. This was first on the stop of four for a pizza tour I went on. I enjoyed it but to be honest, don't think it's worth waiting forever for when there are plenty of other pizza places in New York that are just as tasty with no wait.
