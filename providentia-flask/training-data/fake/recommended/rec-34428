Good enough product... a LONG way to go from being a functional establishment. My girlfriend and I have eaten here twice since they opened... or should I say attempted to... The first time we ate here, we gave our names and waited for a table. They forgot about us and nearly twice the length we were told we would wait, we (patiently) asked for an update on our table. They gracefully scrambled to seat us... Overall, the menu selection and the product is good... we had a few elaborate pizzas and they were delicious. Not the best pizza i've had, but solid. I will in no way knock the flavor. The second time we 'tried' to eat here, we were told it would be a 20 minute wait. We waited nearly 40 minutes and Â had a drink at the bar before asking for an update on the wait. They then offered us a shared table, which we accepted with some reluctance. They must have taken our unenthused reluctance as a NO and instantly seated the couple next to us (who came in 25 minutes after us) at said shared table, with nobody else there. At this point we left. I was disappointed, as I was planning on spending a pretty good chunk of change at Verita on some great food, but instead was forced to change directions but still went home happy.... after a stop at Kountry Kart. And it only cost us 20 bucks, including a 6 pack...
