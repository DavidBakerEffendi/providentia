Born, raised and currently here in Brooklyn and this past weekend was the first time I tried Grimaldi's (I'm 27).  Every other time I wanted to go, no one wanted to go ..they all said "it's not worth the 2 hour wait".. "there's better pizza just a couple of blocks a way", but still I had to try it. Finally, I was able to find a friend to drag here and to wait the line with me. We got to the line at 4:30pm on a Sunday, the wait wasn't too long - just 20 minutes.. but i've passed by when the line was much longer.   we got seated at the end of the row..but so close the people one table over, that I had to get up every time someone wanted to pass through. The waiter took our order right away and brought the pizza rather quickly. The pizza was decent.. Good but not great. and definitely not the best in Brooklyn.. or NYC in its entirety. .I wouldn't even consider it NYC pizza.  sure it was thin crust ( a little too thin even), but there are other factors that make a pizza "NYC Pizza", and this didn't cut it.  a bit pricey too, $14 for a Small, $16 a large and $2.00 per topping.  once we finished, they brought the check right away and before we could get up to leave, the table was already set for the next set of people.
