came here on xmas eve and I had a great time, this place is highly recommended. Its so inexpensive wont hurt your wallet at all we had: 5 beers, coke, skirt steak with 3 sides, a sandwich, 1 dessert, and coffee and the bill came to 60.98. Amazing!! pro: great atmosphere great prices great food great service easy parking con: restaurant is pretty small only wine and beer
