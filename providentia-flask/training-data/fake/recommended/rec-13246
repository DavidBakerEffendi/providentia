I don't remember how I learned about this place, but the yelp reviews had me salivating...couldn't wait to try it. The first attempt was shot down as they were closed for lunch that day...Lord, why me??? I didn't give up. My second attempt proved successful...The Lobster sandwich was delicious!! A few more peices of lobster meat would've been heavenly...but it was still on the money. So good, I had to go back. This time I had the samon burger...I've never tasted a salmon burger before and this one gave me life! It was seasoned to perfection. The third time I went there...which happens to be yesterday...I tried the shrimp sandwich...yummy, yummy, yummy was that shrimp in my tummy. So good. The chef/owner sent out some truffle mac & cheese for my toddler, he didn't like it too much..he's a simple little guy, but mama sure did. It's different than the mac & cheese I'm used to (southern baked) but it was good. Ponty Bistro has been added to my tried & tested lunch spots. I will be back...hopefully one day for dinner. Oh...and Amy (the server) is such a sweetheart!
