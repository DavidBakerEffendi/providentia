Really, really good. I had the Steamed Buns and the Spicy Pork Sausage & Rice Cakes. Steamed Buns were good. Not great though. I think I have had better from the Flying Pig Truck (in LA). I fell in love with the Spicy Pork Sausage & Rice Cakes though. It was sooooo good. All the different flavors that came from that dish were wonderful. Order this. Now. Ambiance is pretty causal here. Service was good.
