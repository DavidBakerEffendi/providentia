My girlfriend and I went here last Saturday night for dinner and I was very happy with everything! Our server was fantastic, very friendly, very helpful, and very fast. We never felt like we were waiting, and he was friendly and welcoming above and beyond what was required. It was obvious he took pride in providing good service and was not just going through the motions to make his pay. My girlfriend had something that consisted of Shrimp wrapped in bacon and stuffed with cheese and sausage. It was delicious, I tried some and thought it was great. I had the Burrito al Pastor and it was fantastic as well. The guac and pico de gallo were great as well. The Nachos Piquin appetizer we had was good, and it wasn't just nachos thrown on a plate - they were each delicately decorated with the ingredients mentioned on the menu and the serving was appetizer appropriate. Someone took great care in making these look and taste wonderful rather than just throwing a bunch of yummy crap on a plate with some chips. At the end of the night, this plus two bottled cokes and an iced tea came to only about $40, so it wasn't overpriced at all either. I would highly recommend this place. The selection is amazing!! There are so many options and they all sounded delicious.
