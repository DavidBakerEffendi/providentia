While spending the day in Philadelphia we decided to try the cheese steak challenge between Geno's and Pat's. After trying both of these sandwiches, in my view, Pat's won the challenge hands down. The reason we found Pat's to be better than Geno's was because the bread here seemed more fresh and the steak was better seasoned. We also enjoyed the fact that it was cut up unlike the steak at Geno's. In the end the staff here was polite unlike Geno's. The sandwiches tasted way better and the overall experience here was comfortable unlike the interaction at Geno's. The final true reason why this restaurant was better was because it wasn't filled with anti immigration propaganda like Geno's. This made our dinning experience comfortable rather than feeling as though we should be looking out for La Migra.
