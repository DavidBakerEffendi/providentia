This place has become my go-to when I need my Spanish food fix.  It brings me right back to Spain with the friendly atmosphere and delicious tapas and sangria.  The waiters are super attentive and friendly.  I went there on Valentine's Day and my boyfriend had bought me flowers so they brought over a vase with water to keep the flowers in during the meal.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a down to earth, yummy, night in the east village.  Good for groups as well.
