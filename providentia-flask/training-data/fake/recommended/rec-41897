My awesome Aunt and Uncle brought me here for dinner my last night in Philly before traveling back to Baltimore. If I had to pick one restaurant to eat all my remaining meals the rest of my life - Modo Mio would be it. Â We did the Turista menu which is definitely the way to go. I was nervous to try chicken livers - but, oh my goodness - they were delicious. The presentation of each portion was beautiful and appealing. The clams with almonds were so tasty. Scallops were perfectly cooked. My 2 favorites to try were the skate wing (wow!) and the special veal medallions in garlic wine sauce - I wanted to lick my plate (and everyone else's who ordered the same)! And thank goodness for Uncle Rays wine which perfectly complemented the meal :) Desserts were also delicious - I don't think you could go wrong and I loved the little cookie that came with the espresso/coffees. Service was fantastic. Staff were kind, friendly and very attentive. Best meal ever!
