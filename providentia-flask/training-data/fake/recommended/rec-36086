I was in there the other day and food was fine. What stood out was a strange experience in the bathroom. I was at the door and was going in but in the way there was a red headed horse face looking gentleman. Instead of moving aside or leaving the bathroom he seemed to be perplexed by the bathroom attendant who had just handed him a paper towel. The red headed guy was muttering to himself, seemingly debating something in his mind. He was about to reach for his wallet and tip the attendant but then thought about it some more. After a few seconds he said "do you want a tip?" Â To which the attendant said "it's all up to you sir". The guy then said "buy stock in twitter" and left the bathroom. I was a bit taken aback. I peed and went to the sink and the attendant turned on the water and I washed my hands and he handed me a paper towel. I then tipped him and said "whatever you do don't buy twitter stock".
