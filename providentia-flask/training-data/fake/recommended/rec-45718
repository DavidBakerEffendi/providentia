Il Bambino is my favorite restaurant in Astoria - and maybe even the entire NYC area. It's a sad, sad week when I don't eat here. Brunch is my absolute favorite meal and Il Bambino doesn't disappoint. Bacon Butty, Pork Chopper, and Big Booty are all incredible and delicious combinations of egg, cheese and meat. My boyfriend and I like to get 2 sandwiches and share because we just can't miss these amazing paninis. Service is always speedy and friendly, and while it can get crowded during peak brunch hours, it's always worth the wait. I think we go so frequently the staff has started to recognize us. Aint no thang. Love Il Bams with all my heart!
