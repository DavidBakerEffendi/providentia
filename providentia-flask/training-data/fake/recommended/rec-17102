It was ok, the service was slow, I had to end up taking my food to go. I think the owner should be a bit more flexible. My sister in law and I decided to check this place out. She ordered the Cheese Enchiladas and I ordered the Chimichangas but we did not want the rice and beans. We asked if we could replace the rice and beans with fries instead. They said yes, however, we would still have to pay for the side of fries. If anything the fries cost less than the rice and beans. All we wanted was an even trade, but they said no...Once again, just a suggestion to the owner be more flexible with your customers! After all that is why you have an open business!
