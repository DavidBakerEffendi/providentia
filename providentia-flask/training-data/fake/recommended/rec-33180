What a lovely restaurant! It is so warm and inviting! I loved the laid back vibe... The decor... The art... The service and the food was amazing! Everything melted in my mouth! Â I had the garlic shrimp and the salmon...both were amazing. The flan was also quite tasty! I love this place! Can't wait to go back!
