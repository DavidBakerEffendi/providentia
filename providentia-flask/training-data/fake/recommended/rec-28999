This is a good little place to see a band.  Small, very small compared to most other place, but that is good if you like a more intimate setting.  Pretty much a good view no matter where you stand/sit unless you are on the far side of the bar.  Acoustics are ok, but keeping in mind how small the space is, I guess they are really as good as they can be.  Bar staff are nice, which is also a plus, and they allow photography which is good for those of us who enjoy taking photos at shows.
