I discovered this place about 2 months ago, I was craving Mediterranean food and this place was close and had good reviews. My girlfriend has been before, but I was blown away the first time! the space inside is massive and you get seated within 20 mins even on the busiest of weekend (unless you insist on sitting outside). I've ordered Dianas breakfast everytime ive been, and I seriously dont think i will ever order anything else of the menu. I might be missing out, but Dianas breakfast is a mix of delicious hummus, eggs however you prefer them, incredible pita bread and Tabouli (best tabouli ive ever had). I probably missing other good things on the menu but i dont have the courage to try anything else... service is fast and its all worth its price, great brunch experience!
