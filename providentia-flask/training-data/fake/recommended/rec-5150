Loved it!  Went there during restaurant week for my brithday dinner.  The appetizers/small plates are substantial, the actually entrees less so.  The Ilili candy bar is crazy good.  The bottom is halva, the top is dark chocolate and there is fig jam mixed in there.  I reccommend to lamb pizza, warm eggplant, and fries.  For entrees the cod, lamb kebab and beef kebab were all really good.  Lebanese wine is also fantastic.  I'd skip the hummus.
