Pretty much all you could ask for in a neighborhood wine bar & gastropub.   Really strong beer and wine list, with a really knowledgable yet approachable server, intimate atmosphere, and some style. Highlight was the Lamb skewers.  None of us could fathom how they got that much flavor and crispiness (deep fryer anyone??).  Lemongrass shrimp was solid as was the paparadelle.   Croquettes very well executed.  Avoid the Banh Mi, not authentic and nothing really positive to say about it. Only downside is its tucked away in a fairly sleepy area West of 11th at the base of some hi-rise condos.  Places like this need to thrive, so go here.
