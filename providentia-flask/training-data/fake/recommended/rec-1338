They were Kung Fu cooking, hoagies fast as lightning... I order from these super nice guys every Saturday, and yes the food is that good. They have changed the way I feel about tofu. I have tried everything on the menu dozens of times and it is all excellent. The service is fast, friendly, and they are very clean. For them to get a review from me means they are something special because I only talk about the places I hate. Tomorrow is Saturday and I will be headed to Clark Park to get my hoagie fix.
