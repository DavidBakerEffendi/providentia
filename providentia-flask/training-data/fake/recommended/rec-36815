Briefly, this place is a let down.  The decor is beautiful, and the concept is excellent, but the food frankly disappoints.  It somehow crosses the line from "taste the natural flavor of the ingredients" to "this is just sort of bland and uninteresting."   It's weird, because right next door at the same owner's Sobaya, the flavors are simple, but still manage to be vibrant.  Similarly, all of the other businesses owned by Bon Yagi serve way above average food.  It's weird that this place is so off.  Some people might not notice though, because the space is so inviting, and the service is super professional. The prices don't shock me or anything--I mean, you're at a high-end japanese grill:  it's going to cost a lot, and have small portions.  That's just the reality. But for that high bill, I expect higher quality.
