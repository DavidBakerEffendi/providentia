My wife and I wanted to go to Northern Liberties for brunch. Ended up at Johnny/ Brenda's. That's a different review so I'll move on. After a great brunch we walked over to Frankford Hall. I never knew the place existed, Got a drink for her and a huge beer for me. Sat outside inside, if you know what i mean, and had one of the best afternoons together. The staff was great. The appetizers were great. But most of all the Jengo was great. Go there. Relax. Play. You will love it!! Thanks Mr. Starr. We've been to about 6 of your places and never seem to fail to please.
