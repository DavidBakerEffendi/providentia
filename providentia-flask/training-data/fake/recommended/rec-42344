I've had this on my radar as a place to eat for months, (ever since I saw Countess Luann stop through with her niece). I had no problem making reservations day of and went for an early 5:15 Easter Sunday dinner with my husband. Cute, cute, cute. Classy, decadent, exposed brick. The bar is nice, seats about 6-8 and looks like great intimate fun with a friend. I started with a Bellini intending to move on to a red with dinner, but loved it so much I had 2. Not overly sweet, as I find most are and chilled perfectly, not room temp as they often are. For apps, we had calamari and gnocchi. Both were fantastic. The calamari has a cornmeal crust and the gnocchi was a sweet onion gnocchi it was delicate and the most delicious I've ever had. Added to the dish were asparagus, thick shreds of proscuitto and parmesan in a light broth.   For our entrees we had the lamb t- bones (which were spectacular in flavor, texture, moistness) and the skirt steak which was cooked perfectly, but the flavor wasn't much to my liking, i think that was just preference. I suppose I was looking for a little sweetness, but I couldn't place the marinate but it mostly tasted like red wine. The grilled caesar that accompanied the steak was light and different and delicious it consisted of grilled whole romaine leaves with dressing and parmesan. We had no dessert, but my 2nd Bellini did the trick.  I'll definitely be back again.
