One of the best thai places in the city! The decor is really unique, it looked like a mix of Versailles and Thailand while the bartenders all wear little corsets with feathers in their hair. Not sure what era they're trying to go for, but I think it looks nice. The service can be a little slow here but the food always arrives quickly. I think one time our food came before our drinks which was a little annoying. They do take reservations and I'd recommend making one since this place seems to fill up, even on weekday nights. The portions are decent sized and I usually end up taking a little leftover home with me afterwards. The drinks are also delicious and they have a unique selection too (a little pricey though so I typically only have one).
