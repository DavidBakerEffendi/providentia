The bf and I were craving tacos and ended up here on a scorching hot late Saturday afternoon. I've been wanting to try this branch of Dos Toros Taqueria because I like eating at hole-in-the-wall joints. We ate our order of guac and chips, carne asada taco, and carnitas burrito on the ledge by the open face window. The sun was burning down on us but it felt good and our cold lemonade cooled us down. My taco was small but very meaty. The steak was juicy and I struggled taking bites without dripping meat juice down my wrists. teeheehee. The burrito was HUGE. I took a few bites of it. I liked the ratio of rice, beans, shredded pork, and tomatoes. Tortilla was nice and chewy, and the cheese was steamed on before toppings were added. After we gobbled up our taco and burrito, we ate our slightly toasted tortilla chips with guac. The guac was good but I would have enjoyed it more if it had more acidity and spice. As we ate our chips, one of the workers sat down next to us to eat his chicken burrito. The bf started up a conversation with him about the ingredients and we learned that they use all local ingredients (which was apparent in the flavor of our meal). I'll be back to try other items the next time I'm in the area (or craving tacos)!
