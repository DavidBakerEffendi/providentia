Perhaps it was the easy intimacy in the woodsy, smoky, and dimply lit dining room that contributed to a dinner during which I actually sent a dish back being one of my favorite dining experiences. Was that a run-on? Sorry, readers. I really really REALLY wanted to try the anticuchos and I'm still mildly depressed over my husband trying to talk me out of it. We always try to order appetizers that we can share and this one was a no-no for him. I need a new husband, one with a penchant for inner organs! Sorry, husband. We ended up ordering tortillas and avocado (because I'm a sucker like that), a chayote salad, pan-roasted chicken, and heritage pork chop w/black bean sope. The appetizers were as tasty as somewhat predictable yet very tasty things can taste. Which is very good! The chicken, cooked in bacon fat, had incredible crisp skin and fit in with the appetizers in it's somewhat uninventive but perfectly tasty execution. The pork chop however, the fatty sweet/salty bone-in piece of pork I was expecting... it tasted like cardboard stapled on top of rubber. It was so darn disappointing that I actually kindly asked the waitress to take it back, which she did, and just as kindly she offered to have the kitchen either cook me another pork chop or whatever else I desired. We had a nice chat about pork chops (quality, fat content, bone-in v. bone-less) and I decided to have picante de mariscos instead. It was spicy, flavorful and all around excellent. We finished off the meal with a creme brulee and despite the kink in the road, both of us left thoroughly happy (and thoroughly tipsy). 3.5 for food pushed to 4.5 by the ambiance and great service.
