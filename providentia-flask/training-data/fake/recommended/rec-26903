Great small place. We were actually going to "Vin et Fleurs" down the Thompson Street but it was closed and we decided to look for similar place nearby and found this one. The service was great. We ordered: French Onion Soup - tasty and with a good amount of baked cheese Mixed Green Salad Â - nothing special Crispy Salmon - nothing special Oven Roasted Monk-fish - OMG! definitely will have it again. My wife actually ordered Salmon but I ended up eating it because she liked Monk-fish more and took mine. Cheesecake - wow! it was soft, creamy and just enough sweet
