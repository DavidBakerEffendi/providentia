I've been to a few tacos places in NYC and I have to say this one isn't as good as the reviews claims. I've only been there once but their menu is limited to very few options. I decided to try out the Beef burrito and I actually wanted to give it back after the 1st bite. Now the burritos use flour tortillas and any real taco lover knows you use corn tortillas. They cooked their wraps on these electric grills which give no flavor to the food. Next came the beef. It was under cooked with little seasoning. When you order something make sure they can cook it properly. Finally no options of cilantro, onions or limes to add to my meal. I was disappointed.
