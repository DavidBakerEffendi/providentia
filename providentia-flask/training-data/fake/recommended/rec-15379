This visually appealing, bustling, busy, and slightly "overly Upper East Side-ish" restaurant features pretty good Italian food. We enjoyed some cured meats and cheeses for starters and slipped into a somewhat pedestrian fettuccine with shrimp and squash and a tasty veal cutlet with eggplant dish. We finished up with a surprisingly delicious almond tart which honestly was probably the thing that helped push this review from a solid three star to a wavering four star. The service was decent...though our waitress seemed kind new and unfamiliar with the menu.
