This is my 2nd time at Mercato & even though I enjoyed most of my dinner last time (risotto)  my wife didn't like hers but another couple asked us to go so we wanted to give it another try.  Cramped and loud is an understatement, I am all for getting as many diners as you can into a restaurant but we literally were elbow to elbow with the diners next to us, maybe an inch or 2 at most separated our tables, it was uncomfortable b/c you had to yell so anyone could hear you so having a private conversation was not a possibility.   Apps - None of us liked our apps, the brushetta trio was the worst, the bread was so thick and hard that you had to cut it which made the toppings topple right off the bread and there was no seasoning on any of the toppings, at one point we were going to ask for salt but then just decided on not finishing it.  The arancini, you got 1 little ball and the smokinness of the mozzarella was overpowering. You would have thought the waitress noticing most of us didn't finish our apps would have questioned us a bit on if we really enjoyed everything, no. Entrees - Salmon was delicious, Pasta stuffed with lobster and shrimp was just as disappointing as our last visit and I even asked the woman next to me who had eaten it how it was before I ordered and she just kind of shrugged her shoulders, I took that as she wasn't wanting to talk to me but now I think she probably just didn't want to flat out say that it was horrible, the pasta was overcooked and thick & the filling had no flavor. Veal was literally pounded & dropped into a deep fryer, nothing different than I would have gotten at a diner and lastly, the chicken was dry and the polenta was lumpy. Dessert - Gelato was returned as it was sour even though the waitress came back and told us the chef said it wasn't but then mysteriously we heard the waiters & waitresses start telling patrons that they had switched the gelato from Maple to blueberry hmm, my wife is a pastry chef so I think she knows when something is sour, the rest of the desserts were good.   If the food was better I might consider putting up with the uncomfortable cramped seating but I can honestly say I will never go back to this restaurant, not with so many better options in the city.
