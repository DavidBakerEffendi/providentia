Came here based on the ratings and the fact that they have BACON DONUTS.  I got a cocktail, fried chicken, and the bacon donuts for dessert. The good: BACON DONUTS.  Medium sized dough balls covered in dulce de leche with bacon bits on top (could've used more bacon or atleast real bacon...maybe it was...but it was all chopped up so who knows) and coffee ice cream.  I dont even like coffee ice cream but it was freaking good.   The bad: Took 25 mins to get served water and a cocktail.  Another 15 mins to get my food order taken.  I was brought the wrong dish twice.  All the waitstaff apparently hates each other and kept talking shit about each other the whole time.  (I was sitting at the bar near the cash register so I heard everything).  The restaurant manager kept bossing the waitstaff around and instructing them like kindergarteners.  Crowded as hell. Fried quail was greasy and just OK. $10 cocktail not great at all. Not worth the wait, having to listen to waitstaff and restaurant manager all night.  Took away all the enjoyment of my meal.  Won't be back.
