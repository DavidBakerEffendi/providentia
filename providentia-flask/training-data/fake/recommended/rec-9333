The decor and ambiance is rustic with some modern blended in. The food is absolutely delicious! I had this South American fish called Pacu in a orange and chiplote sauce with coconut rice. Very Amazonian! Fantastic! My guest had a short rib served with cauliflower pure. It was braised with malbec. Very delicious!  When it comes to food, chef Carlos Barroz and his kitchen staff is doing a great job, followed by the front of the house led by Victor Medina and his wait staff which is very friendly, attentive and helpful with the menu, wine list and the experience as a whole.  My new found restaurant!
