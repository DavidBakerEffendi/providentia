Great dinner - hearty portions and excellent service.  Waiter recommended one antipasto, primo, and secondo per person.  That's overkill. For two of us, we got one antipasto, skipped primi (pasta) and got two secondi ("entre") and a side of brussels sprouts.  This was plenty of food!  The Beef tenderloin was excellent as was the suckling pig.
