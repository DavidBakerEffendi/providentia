The food was delicious, although in ver small portions.  i could have eaten three of my plates. The service was another story with a rude bartender.  How do these people get jobs wuth these attitudes.  You are a freakin' bartender!  Put on a shirt that fits and covers your 40 tatoos, so every time you want to show off ridiculously shaking a iced cocktail above your head, I don't have to see your shirt ride up.  Drop the attitude, you are a bartender...you serve people drinks.
