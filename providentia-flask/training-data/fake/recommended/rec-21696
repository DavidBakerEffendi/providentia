I recently had brunch here with a couple of friends. I perused the menu online before I went and was very excited about it. We ordered the huaraches de pollo, the biscuits and gravy (added a poached egg) and the Mexican "eggs Benedict". The pollo was delicious and a nice size portion, the Mexican Benedict was also delicious, but the portion was so small it looked like an appetizer, the biscuits were odd... They were dense and a little sweet, they gravy came in a gravy boat on the side, it was tasty enough but as it cooled it started to break and look a little weird and the poached egg also came on the side I'm a bowl on top of a piece of lettuce. I thought the presentation didn't make any sense. Service here was also off, we had three different people serve our table, and not one asked us how our meal was or if we'd like anything else. I'll go back here to try some other dishes but I'm not sure id recommend it yet.
