Pricing may seem high, but once you actually cook like this and know how much quality fats like grass-fed butter and coconut oil cost, you understand the price structure. Unlike most restaurants that can use cheap fillers, HU kitchen uses quality ingredients that actually have a higher nutritional output to them. I had the Big Bowl Veggie mash with the Hu Joe, it was good and very filling. That's what you have to love about eating this way. It's more dense nutritionally so you fill up a little faster! Glad there is this option here.
