Ive been wanting to come here for a while now after hearing so many people rave about it. I finally got the chance to come & i was expecting long lines, but me & my friend got seated right away. We came around 6pm and there were a lot of people waiting outside and inside, so we thought we had to wait also, but they seated us upstairs, where there was no one. I didnt really mind. Our waitress was really attentive and friendly. The food came out really quickly. However, we got our burgers before we got our fries. I got the truffle burger & my friend got the cali burger. The truffle burger was sooo good even though it was only a burger and cheese. My friend liked her cali burger too . We got the truffle fries & those were good too. I liked how they give you an assortment of sauces & you don't have to pay for each individual sauce. I think our favorite was the garlic aoili. We finished our food rather quick cause it was just soo good lol. We wanted to get the cheesy tots too, but we were kind of full :( maybe next time!
