Stumbled on Rex 1516 by accident while walking down South Street last Saturday afternoon with our six month old. It was lunchtime and we were looking for a spot. Rex had just opened that week apparently, and was almost totally empty (one couple eating) so we figured we would try it. (Also, we spotted a stroller-friendly table!) What a treat. I love Southern/NOLA comfort food, so their style hits a sweet spot for me. We had a great fish stew to start, that a real spicy kick. Then I had blackened fish tacos and my wife had the Southern caesar salad. Two small quibbles - cornbread croutons added a sweetness to the salad that my wife was not loving; fish tacos needed had great flavor but need a little more moistness - maybe a remoulade sauce. Their selection of wines by the glass was great. Prices really reasonable. Decor is nice, sort of speakeasy style. And they plan GREAT vintage jazz on the fine sound system. All in all, a great find, and great addition to the neighborhood. Going back this weekend!
