This was my first, and last, visit to Sketch Burger. I kept hearing super great things about this place, so I decided to give it a try. The service was terrible, the staff unpleasant, and the food not that great. I ordered a turkey burger that had not an ounce of flavor whatsoever. I really could have eaten cardboard with more flavor. The chipotle mayo had no hint of chipotle spice or smokiness or anything at all. I think it may have just been colored mayo honestly. The bun was super greasy too. My fiance got a beef burger that was supposed to be medium rare and was closer to medium or well. He said it was ok. The fries were pretty decent, but for being a spectacular burger joint, I wasn't impressed. Also, for two burgers, fries and iced teas, the bill was $30. That's outrageous. If you're looking for a good burger in the Fishtown-ish area, just go to PYT. That's where I wish we had gone instead.
