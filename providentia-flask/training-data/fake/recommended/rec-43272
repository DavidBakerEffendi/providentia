I'm salivating just thinking about the chicken biscuit. It's soooo good. I went there during lunch and I only ordered the chicken sandwich. That was all I need to love this place. The lady behind the counter was really friendly. She let asking if my meal was good. Â Good service! I seriously just can't get over the sandwich right now. My only complaint is that the 6.50 chicken sandwich won't really fill many people up. It was the perfect serving size for me but I don't eat much. I seriously eat so little. Whatever, it's still amazing.
