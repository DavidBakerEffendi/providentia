This is one of the best cheesesteaks I've ever had in my life! Stay away from all the fancy commercial places you see on the Food TV shows, this is the real deal. I won't even try to explain the food. Come by and experience it for yourself! And an added footnote, the location and outside seating feels really Philadelphia! Great place.
