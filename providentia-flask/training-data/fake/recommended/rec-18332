I'm a bit of an Ethiopian food snob after living in DC for three years. This place isn't as good as my favorite DC joints but its pretty solid. It's a pretty inexpensive place to meet friends for dinner or a weekend meal. I like to get take out here (love the yellow lentil dish) which makes 2-3 packable lunches.
