I wish there was a 0 star.  Horrible.  We had delivery and ordered the buffalo chicken and the clams casino.  They were both SOGGY and WET.  The clams casino looked like it dropped because all of the cheese and toppings were on one side of the pizza.   Buffalo chicken was just plain old soggy.  The next day the 4 of us were feeling like crap and had stomach problems.  I am staying away.
