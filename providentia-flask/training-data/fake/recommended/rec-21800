Brought my girlfriend here for her birthday. This was our first visit to a nice French restaurant in the city. The atmosphere is very nice and great for a special date occasion. And love the fact that it is BYOB (nice wine store around the corner, Wine Hut). Our meal started off strong being greeted by our server and her taking care of our bottle of wine...very impressed so far. This impression continued when we got our apps...I got the goat cheese tart, and she got the mussels in the curry broth and both of us were very happy with our choices. The entrees: I got the filet with the foie gras and I thought it was very good, but it didn't reach my expectations. I was expected to be wowed because of all of the great reviews. My girlfriend got the duck breast and was displeased with it being a little too well done for her liking. The dessert was a very nice ending to an overall nice meal. We got the Chocolate Profiterolles and wanted to lick the plate when we were done. Great birthday dinner, but will probably choose a different French restaurant the next time.
