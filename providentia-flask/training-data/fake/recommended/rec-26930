This is probably my favorite place to drop into in Manhattan's Chinatown, and I've been going for over 10 years now.  Most recently they moved to Mulberry street, adding a little more room (though I was discouraged to see their recent "C" grade from the health inspectors...) Their noodle and wanton soups are EXCELLENT and CHEAP.  I defy you to find anything better when hungover.  My favorite is the beef tendon noodle and wanton soup.  Out of this world (if you're into beef tendon)!
