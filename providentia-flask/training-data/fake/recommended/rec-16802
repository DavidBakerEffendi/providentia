Well with all of the good reviews here I was completely surprised by the fact dinner was so absolutely bad.  The atmosphere is nice somewhat "soho-ish" with a cozy feel.  The service was average and since we arrived early and the place only about 1/3 full I was a bit taken aback. We ordered a vegetable appetizer which was only warm and the grilled octopus was chewy.  For entres the chicken with capers was overcooked and not a single caper to be found.  Reminded me of a boiled chicken breast tossed on a plate.   I had had the duck which was also overcooked and lacking in flavor. The wine selection was also average but with a heavy markup. A $25 bottle was about $100.  The Italian wines selection was better (as you would imagine) it was not great.   I don't think much about the cost of a fine meal unless it is sub-par.  This was just plain amateur bad. Perhaps it was a bad night but when dinner for 2 is over $200 I do not believe in second chances.  When you play at that level consistency is king.  Vetri should investigate why his kitchen is up and down. Pick someplace else.
