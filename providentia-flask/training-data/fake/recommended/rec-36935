Be prepared to wait 1.5 hrs for lunch on a Saturday but it's sure worth it!  We put our name down and shopped around.  The restaurant is right in the middle of SoHo so there are plenty of boutiques and shops around to kill time. We were seated promptly and the waiter came by w/ our water and took our order.  We had the mussel which was a good light starter.  My organic salmon came out perfect and my hubby ordered the steak frites.  It was good but he wished that he ordered something different since u can get steak anywhere else. We left the restaurant almost close to 4pm and it was still crowded. I would love to try this place out for dinner.
