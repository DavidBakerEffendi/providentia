Let me start by saying I'm not a fan of fancy pizza. I was born and raised in queens, I like my pizza by the slice with pepperoni or mushrooms, or sometimes plain with a jamaican beef patty (It's a Queens thing); not a fan of multiple-topping-specialty-pizzas like hawaiian pizza, bbq chicken pizza, or whatever else pizzahut/domino's comes up with. With that said, I was expecting this to be something like california pizza kitchen (which I hate) and in some ways it was. Example: white pizza. Yuck! I looked for what closest resembled "normal pizza" and to me that was the "Dellboy." It was fancy cheese that I can't pronounce, fancy tomatoes that I don't recall, and berkshire something which turned out to be sausage. In normal english, it was a 12-inch personal pizza with cheese, tomato sauce and fancy pepperoni. It was great! The tomato sauce was tangy and juicy, pepperoni-like thingy was pepperoni to me. It was good. If you're a classic pizza kind of guy, order this. If you're taking your dad here and he's one of those that likes what he likes and doesn't try anything new, order this. It's call the dellboy. My friends ordered something with bacon and maple syrup on cheese with no tomato sauce. It wasn't that great. It's not pizza without tomato sauce. Didn't like it. Oh and there's hip beer here. Afterall this is THAT part of Brooklyn.
