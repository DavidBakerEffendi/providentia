These boys put together one nice, comfortable place with excellent food and service. Stan (if he's still behind the bar) will keep you entertained and satisfied. If you really want a good time, just ask him what's good and what drinks best with it... he won't steer you wrong. In the winter months, nothing beats hanging Â by the woodburning stove. 5 happy, cozy, warm stars.
