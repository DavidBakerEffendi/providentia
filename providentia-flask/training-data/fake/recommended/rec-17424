Great lunchtime specials on the "El Cheapo Luncho" menu - they have excellent tamales, the tacos are also pretty good as is the salsa.  You should definitely skip yuca fries - they were definitely a bag of frozen ones from Restaurant Depot.  They have a diverse menu - even a "gringo" menu with chicken and burgers.  The el cheapo menu is really good and a great bargain.  They have a full bar too :-)
