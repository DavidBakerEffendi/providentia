I'm only able to speak for the sweets baked by Scratchbread, but they were totally worth my trip down to Park Slope. I'm sure it's a matter of time before they become more widely available across the city... The chocolate buttercream brownie: Made using Valrhona chocolate is, simply, quite awesome. Super dense. I'm not usually a brownie fan, but perhaps that's why I like this one. It's more a huge-ass chunk of chocolate truffle. Shortbread: Also yum. Very thick and moist, as opposed to the more crumbly shortbreads. Addictive. Scone: The one that knocked a star off my rating. It's very 'firm', which I usually like in scones, and splits wonderfully in the center to reveal a softer inside. There're just enough Valrhona chocolate chunks to satisfy, but it was simply over baked. The outsides of this scone often tasted burnt. Shame. Must try their savory breads next time!
