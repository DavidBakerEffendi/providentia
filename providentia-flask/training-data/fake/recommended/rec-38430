You just can't beat customer service and Sandra's is second to none in this category. The staff was very tentative and made you feel more like a family friend then a customer. I sat and talked to Miguel for quite some time while eating some of the best soul food I've ever tasted at any restaurant. Trust me this place blows amy Ruth's and Silvia's in NYC out of the water. If your ever are in the New Haven area and want to enjoy some of the best soul food period and customer services that is top tier I advice a visit to this place!!! They are receiving 5 star reviews on Yelp for a reason!!
