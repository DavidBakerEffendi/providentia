I KNOW RAMEN!  Having been brought up eating them.  The verdict... These guys are good.  Hands down!   Noodle, broth, the proportion, etc.   Did I mention, their service is to be admired.  The busboy, waiters, bartender,  were very pleasant to deal with.  And the price point.   Seldom is eating a one dimensional activity.  It's the combination of everything coming together with your tongue at the center!
