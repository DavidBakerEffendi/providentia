when in new york, do as new yorkers do. hits the spot after a late night of drinking. although i would prefer a cali burrito from sd or a bacon-wrapped hot dog from la, chicken and rice in nyc is pretty money. generous with the white sauce and just a touch of the hot. i ate here three times during my six night trip to ny, and never had to wait longer than 15 min. avoid the weekends!
