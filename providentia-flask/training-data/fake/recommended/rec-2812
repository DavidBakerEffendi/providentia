Ok, I used to drive a bread truck in Brooklyn so I know what I'm talking about when it comes to pizza. Now I drive in Jersey and I was passing by this place when I felt a dump brewing. Must have been the 6 cups of coffee I poured down my grill so I wouldn't run off the road. So listen, this place is fantastic. The Brooklyn Pie is the closest to NY I've ever tasted. I've tried some other local joints and the Brooklyn pie was a freakin' joke. I took a friend to one of these other pizza joints and when they served the Brooklyn my boy Paulie threw it on the floor. Ok, so to make it simple - Piccolo is good. Take your girlfriend, family or whatever. They'll love this dump. Bachagalupe!
