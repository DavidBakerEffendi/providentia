I grew up in this neighborhood, and only come back for quick visits with friends I miss from growing up....I kid. I only come back to eat, and Traif was on the list of places to go, but I bizarrely could not find it. Finally last night discovered it right by the side of Willy BB..... No res,so we sat at the bar, and in order to have the tasting menu you need to be at least a party of three, so al la carte with the following: Bacon wrapped figs with cheese- ridiculously good, more like a dessert really, loved them Broccoli rabe on Texas toast with Parmesan - also a yummy, artery clogging joyous vegetable dish.. Pomegranate and something glazed spare ribs- weakest dish for me...ribs fell off bone, yes, but a bit dry, not juicy like they looked when presented Fois gras with maple something- really, after my review of Bohemian last week, also with the cursed duck dish, I should get checked for gout...this was sublime and amazingly well prepared. Best part of the night was our bartender (NOT a waiter) he was adorable, and funny, would now only go back and sit at the bar with him... Fantastic meal and night.....
