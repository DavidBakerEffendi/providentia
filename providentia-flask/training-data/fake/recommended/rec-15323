This isn't BBQ, this is a joke. Went there after the Eagles defeated the Broncos with a little buzz looking for some good food. I was let down. The beer we got was cheap, only perk. The fries couldnt have resembled a toothpick anymore than they did. And the brisket on my sandwich was so UNBELIEVABLY dry! I couldnt finish it. I couldnt swallow anymore it was horrible. I have had alot of good BBQ in my short time on this Earth and this wasn't anywhere NEAR good.
