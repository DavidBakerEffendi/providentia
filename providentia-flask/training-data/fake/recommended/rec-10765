One of the best meals I've had in awhile.  I had the lamb ribs with a side of mashed potatoes.  I wish that a side was included because a plate of meat does not a meal make but it was delicious so no real complaints.  For dessert my friend and I shared the date cake and donuts, both delicious.   It's right near the train so it is noisy and the door being open didn't help but nevertheless the atmosphere is lovely and romantic.  Can't wait to come back
