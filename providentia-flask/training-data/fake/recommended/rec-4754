Went to this place for the first time last night with a friend who lives near the restaurant and is a regular there.  The food was delicious and the ambiance perfect for 2 friends catching up - not too loud, but not uncomfortably quiet, either. As we are both big seafood fans and were in the mood for fish that night, we both enjoyed the Enchiladas Del Mar.  Really great flavors and enchilada sauce, with the right amount of rice and vegetables on the side.  My friend had her heart set on the Ceviche Mixto, her regular order, but unfortunately they were out of it.  I can't wait to return so I can try it! Margaritas were very good and the service was great.  Serving of chips was a bit small, but delicious.
