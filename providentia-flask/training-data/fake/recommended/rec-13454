This place is the tiniest little hole in the wall ramen bar, but it serves an excellent, large bowl of noodles.  My only criticism is that they could serve a bit more meat in the noodles... I got the Miso Ramen, and there two slices of pork in it; at $10.50 a bowl, I'm thinking they could put in just a few more slices.  Still, one of the better ramen shops I've been to!
