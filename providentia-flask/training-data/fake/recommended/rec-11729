Healthy middle eastern food is always a hearty option. Ilili, one of the most trendy restaurants in its own category, produces deliciousness and creativity, which makes the whole dining experience as an art. High ceiling, mirrors all around... these are all catered to my taste. However, even though it's a bling bling kind of place, it's not pretentious at all.  I have a mixed feeling towards this. You will see what I mean, when you go into the restaurants and check out the people around. :) Anyway, what I really want to imply is that you'd feel completely relaxed and comfortable while enjoying a classy atmosphere there. Service is the best part. Our waitress is so sweet and knowledgeable. Prix-fix is only available from Sunday to Wed. Make sure u order the brussel sprouts- they are heavenly! PS: Ilili  is a lot better than Fig and Olives, in terms of food, cocktails and service.
