Came here for Cino De Mayo and it seemed like they weren't used to a crowd. It took a few minutes to get seated which was okay, but as we waited several groups of people came in the door creating a very cramped area near the door with about 10 people waiting for a table. The service was friendly, yet slightly aloof. I ordered tostadas, which for 15 dollars I felt it was a rip off. There were three tostadas which was fine, but I would have thought there would be rice/beans with the food. I will say that the chicken in the tostadas was cooked nicely though. My brother ordered tacos which had no toppings other than lettuce. Overall, it was okay, but I probably wouldn't return.
