This was an accidental find and a definite gem!!!! A homey little hole in the wall that I would've otherwise walked right past and never even thought twice about it. Great staff. Amazing food. Seriously dangerous delicious Brazilian drinks. So so good. Definitely need to bring a few different group of friends there. If u wanna be cozy, romantic, catch up with old friends- a must recommend !!!!
