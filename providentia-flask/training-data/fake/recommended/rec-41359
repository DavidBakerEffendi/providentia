I love this place.  The owner Danny was very hospitable to my family and I.  The food was wonderful and the drinks were awesome.  Their oyster selection is great too.  Overall, I have nothing bad to say about my experience there. I'm looking forward to trying their  newest location in Fort Greene as it's closer to my home. I'll be back.
