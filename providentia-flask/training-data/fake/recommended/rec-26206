If it weren't for the burgers here, Corner Bistro would be nothing more than a local, dingy dive bar. The serve the usual standard drinks and include McSorley's in their selection as well. What most people come here for is the burger. It's cheap and comes only a few ways: Plain, with (American only) cheese, or with bacon and cheese. No, you can't adjust the wellness. No, you can't have it with some other cheese. No, it does't come with any other sauce(s). Yes, you can get a side order of fries (although they may come mushy and cold). For just under $7, you get yourself a pure, standard burger. The beauty (and hype) revolves around this level of simplicity. For the experience, I'd say go for it. When you come here, you're experiencing old NY. (I mean, just look at the place). Would I be a regular here? Probably not.
