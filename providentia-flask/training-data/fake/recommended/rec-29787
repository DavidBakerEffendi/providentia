Wonderful and Delicious Maine Lobster Roll! Â I have had two now on separate occasions and both times consistantly amazing! Not cheap, but delicious. I bought mine at the Brooklyn Flea Market in Williamsburg (there every Sunday on the water). I think I paid $16 for it, so don't recommend it for regular eatting, but a very good treat. Easy to share - you can ask them to cut it in half and don't forget to pick up a fork so you can eat the pieces that fall out of the bun. Some always fall out. :)
