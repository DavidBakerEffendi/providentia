We've been here with friends twice, once for dinner and once for brunch. We had the same-- absolutely delightful-- waitress both times, and will certainly return for the service, atmosphere (60s R&B over brunch was pretty awesome), and proximity. The food has a ton of promise, but is generally a bit underseasoned. We are all a bit underwhelmed by the seasoning on our fried green tomatoes (though, admittedly, we may have all been over-excited), and my husband and I both had to salt our egg dishes. Still lovely, especially if you're in the neighborhood. They also have great cocktails!
