I had the oyster po-boy. Not great, a little mushy. However, after I ordered I decided to sample the gator gumbo... awesome. I wish I had eaten that. Really really good. The rest of what they have is as authentic as I have found outside of Louisiana (and I lived there for a few years). Good gator gumbo. Good prices. However, stay away from the Oyster Po-Boy. I usually love them, this was not good.
