Just perfect. A gem of a restaurant - friendly staff, lovely atmosphere, and of course amazing food! In July I came here every day to study for the Bar Exam, sitting outside with free wifi and being able to plug in a laptop and also get some sun and a perfect cappuccino was what kept me going. Every time I come here now with my family we are greeted with a smile. My shy toddler talks and laughs with the wait staff because they are so disarmingly nice. Favorite menu items include salad with avocado and and ginger dressing which is crisp and fresh, the salmon, avocado and goat cheese panini is a must try, so is the deliciously salty prosciutto with pesto, and of course the nutella and strawberry or banana crape, which is generously covered with authentic Italian nutella, is the is best way to end the meal. All in all, love love love this place.
