I know that this is hotly contested debate in New Haven, but I have been to all the famous places, more than once.  I have to be honest, this is THE BEST PIZZA in New Haven. Carefully crafted, unique toppings that add great texture, but down overwhelm your palette.  Not to mention the excellent service.  This is a New Haven MUST!
