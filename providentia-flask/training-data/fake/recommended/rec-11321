My wife and I have walked past Fare since it opened, (we live in the neighborhood), never went in until tonight. Had one of our best dinners in years. Beer was great, neat little list of drafts. Had the ceviche and watermelon salad and two seafood whole wheat pasta dishes. All the food to us was five star, the pasta, excellent including all fresh seafood included in the dish. Finished off with fig ricotta whipped desert, again excellent. Â  Our waitress was great, just cool and normal and very attentive. What a place that we have walked past a zillion times, won't do that again! Really want to try their weekend brunch which we hear is awesome.
