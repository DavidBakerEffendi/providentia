My fav restaurant in philly.  Simple as that. The food is eclectic, high quality and expertly prepared.  They dont over-do it, just take great ingredients and make delicious simple dishes.  Our party especially loved the chefs meat and cheese plate.  I got the scallop risotto for my entree and loved it. The atmosphere is inviting and casual.  Not too crowded or loud, and we were there on a friday night. The service is friendly and knowledgeable.  Our waitress Elyssa, was great. And the restaurant is a BYO with a PA liquor store inside it.  R u kidding me?? And its run by an iron chef!  What more can u possibly want? My only hesitation in writing this review is this place getting too popular...but it just deserves it.
