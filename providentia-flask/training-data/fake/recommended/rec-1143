Definitely overrated. It was not that great when i had it here a few weeks ago. Â The people were actually pretty friendly and they were very fast, but the broccoli rabe was far too bitter for my taste and the pork, though tender, was bland bland bland. Will not be back! Definitely not worth the $10 i paid.
