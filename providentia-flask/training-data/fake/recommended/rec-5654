calamari with the coconut was really good here, and the pad thai with the egg wrapped around it was a bit overrated. The chicken skewers were decent but could have had different sauces. Also my roomie didn't think his food was spicy enough. The place seemed more like a lounge club type of a deal instead of a homey dinner or etc on 9th but would be fun as a pregoing out place.
