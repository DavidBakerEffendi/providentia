Love this place! I work a block away, and the lunch options have gotten completely old ("Do you want a sandwich from here, or a sandwich from there?"), so this is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. I've had the lemon chicken twice now, which is great though the texture of the chicken seems a little packaged, and got the Loisaida Shrimp Salad today which was a really interesting combo of ingredients (spicy shimp, pickles, orange, fennel, and raisins, to name a few). Also, the staff is scarily friendly. I hope they never change (and that includes not raising their prices!).
