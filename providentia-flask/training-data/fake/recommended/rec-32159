Yes, you are reading that right. I gave this local favorite a one star, and before you start writing my review off as someone who is just picky and cannot appreciate this place as a great greasy spoon I have to tell you I am one of the least picky people out there and have enjoyed plenty of dives in my time especially living out of a small town. I went to this place on the recommendation of a local and was looking for a nice simple homemade burger and fries. What I got though was something I couldn't even, nor did I want to, finish. The outside looks like a typical dinner but inside is an odd take on a fast food joint. You go through this line that actually has metal bars guiding the line. You first give your order and money to one guy before proceeding in line to the grill. From the grill you tell them what condiments you want on whatever you order. When I asked for mayo, they simply put a mayo packet next to my burger. Weird, but if the burger tasted good I would go with it. I first bit into the fries and was not impressed at all. I was expecting good homemade fries with that crunch and salt. What I got was some greasy almost crisp fries with no salt or taste whatsoever. I ate a few and then gave up on them. I still held out hope though for the burger even though it was on the small side and looked beyond generic. The burger was a let down immediately with almost no flavor at all. Plus the bacon I requested was not what the rest of America considers bacon but actually the Canadian bacon (ie ham). This gave the burger a strange taste that I could have done with as well. Overall, i got half way through and just gave up on eating it. If you are a tourist, skip this stop and aim for one of the other local eateries. Yes this may be cheap but will leave you unsatisfied and probably still hungry. For the locals, I really am sorry that this is what you are accustomed to. You deserve a better burger experience.
