My sister and I used Yelp for most of our meals during the week we spent in New York and it did not steer us wrong with this little hole in the wall. Honestly, I am so fussy, I would have walked by if the reviews had not been so favorable. The lady (Lali?) was super friendly, I mean, genuinely wonderful, wanting-to-help-you kind of people. It was obvious we were tourists (if the Aussie and Irish accents don't give it away!!) and the lady helped us figure it all out. The food was delicious, the community was wonderful; isn't that what good food is all about? Places like this are what make NY such a fabulous place to visit.
