Stopped in to Aldine on Friday night for a post-dinner drink and ended up getting a preview of some items that are now on the tasting menu. Atmosphere is minimalist romantic. Drinks were superb - interesting concoctions that actually were coherent (unlike other high end mixology-based bars in Philly). Smoked scallop was perfection, and the garnishes (fennel cracker? YES PLEASE) were creative and well executed. The carrot cake??? Â Delicious! Also got to try the butter sundae and chocolate mousse, both were excellent. Chef George (and his entire staff) was gracious, informative, and clearly is cooking at the top of his game. Just GO, order the tasting menu, and enjoy! I will be back soon and often.
