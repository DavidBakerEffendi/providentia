My second visit to The Bosphorus was nothing short of perfection. Though the restaurant was at capacity, service was quick, and our appetizers and entrees came out impeccably timed. We tried the labneh appetizer this time. It was delicious in all it's lemon-y dill goodness, but they also serve a smaller spoonful with their entrees, so it was a bit redundant. We will probably order the hummus next time for the sake of variety. For dessert, we had pistachio baklava and Turkish coffee (which is a must! so delicious!). This has become our go-to Turkish restaurant and we're so happy to have found it!
