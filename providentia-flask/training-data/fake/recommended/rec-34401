If you need to be gluten free and dairy free, DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!! Basically almost nothing on the menu I felt safe eating. I was meeting a group of people that had decided on this place for lunch (definitely not my choice), so against my better judgement I decided to go for the company. The waitress said they could accommodate me, but they did not have any gluten free products with which to make substitutions, as better restaurants do. I ended up getting an overdressed salad (balsamic vinaigrette) that consisted of a pile of field greens with some slices of beets and a couple of small mandarin sections. It was supposed to have cheese on it (goat, I think), which I had to have them leave off, and I had them add a grilled chicken breast to it, which was a bit over cooked and dry. I couldn't get any kind of starch to make any kind of a complete dish. How much for all of this? $12 for the "salad", plus $6 more for the chicken breast (it was pretty small too, by the way) = $18. I only had water (they never even offered lemon). Automatically added 18% tip because of the group size and TA-DAAA!!! - almost $24!! All for a lousy salad missing a main ingredient (which they did not lower the price on) and an overcooked chicken breast. I'm not a rich person, and it really pissed me off that i paid that much and left there still hungry. I had to go spend more money to get some better (and less expensive) food to eat elsewhere. TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT!!!!!
