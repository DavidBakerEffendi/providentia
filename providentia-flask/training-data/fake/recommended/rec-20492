Honestly I've been going here since I was 4 since I live 2 blocks down but as of recently I feel like the food isn't as good as before. I ordered a penne vodka sauce pasta and 2 slices. Fist of they ended up giving me spaghetti with burnt tasteless chicken and the slices well the crust was burnt black. Then to top it off the workers were drinking beer which I found unprofessional and disgusting. I honestly don't know what happened to the place I feel like they've let go.
