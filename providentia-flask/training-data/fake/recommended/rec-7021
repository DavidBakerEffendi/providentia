As a southern girl, I'm always in the hunt for good southern-style restaurants in the city. This place hit the spot! I went for bunch and was greeted by John and his wife. They are both lovely and make you feel really welcome. Their food is incredible- I ordered biscuits and gravy, grits, bacon, and eggs and they were all delicious. I'll definitely be coming back!
