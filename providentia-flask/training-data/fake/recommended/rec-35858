The wine was better then the food but the service was superb and the Creme Brule was nice.$400 for dinner for 2 people I was expecting better food and real truffle not truffle oil... gross. I can understand how people who think truffle oil is gourmet would think this was 5 star quality food but it is far from it. Excellent service though. The ambiance however too cramped for my style. We were stuck between 2 parties eating a lot of food on a tiny table we ordered more food and wine then we could fit on the table... but we still managed. Â The people here didn't really care about the food more then they cared about checking in and being seen there. I wouldn't go back even though I live on the same block. It was definitely an interesting experience though.
