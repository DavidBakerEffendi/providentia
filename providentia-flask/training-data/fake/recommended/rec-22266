Great place!   The menu isn't expansive, but I like that they are focusing on a few key dishes.  I'm never sure what to order, so this doesn't bother me!  The owner was welcoming, witty and made us feel at home.  Our service was amazing at the bar.  Bridget really made the experience by not being overbearing, yet making conversation in a way that made us feel like we really belonged and were welcome!  Overall, a delightful experience!  My wine was just fine, I'm not snobby about wine, I enjoy a $10 bottle almost as much as a more expensive bottle.  But I do know wine and if you are a wine connoisseur, you will most likely find something that you will appreciate but your socks won't be knocked off.  Our food was very, very good.  I had the special and husband had penne with meatballs.  We both were very pleased with our food and felt offered everything but not pressured into anything- some places just try to sell you sell you sell you.  Bottom line-we'll definitely be going back.
