My boyfriend, who is French, came to NYC for a weekend. He's your typical baguette lover, with a pride for all things a la francaise- so when I told him we were going out for a real American breakfast, he was doubtful. To sum up our breakfast at Clinton St. Baking Company America- 1. France- 0. We started lining up at 8:30 AM. They open at 9. We waited 30 min to get in the door, BUT they had no space (this place seats only like 40), so we waited another 30 min ... total wait was an hour and we were early. But the waiting is notorious. Its worth it if you're willing to be patient. Go around for a stroll in LES, take a coffee, or two or three. Its worth it. We had the French toasts in banana caramel sauce which was to die for. We also ordered the Spicy Chorizo omelette breakfast. It was excellent, but nothing out of this world. And for the grand finale- IF YOU GO HERE, YOU MUST ORDER THE SUGAR CURED BACON. Im no bacon fan, but this stuff is heavenly. Its crispy-sweet and crunchy like candy. but if you're turned off by the sweet-savory enigma, have no fear- becuase this combo works perfectly well. I don't know how to explain it ... for that, you'll have to ask God. We walked away with full stomachs, and I had the satisfaction of telling the Frenchie that we Americans can do breakfast better anyday (some days). We also walked out 2000 calories into our day.
