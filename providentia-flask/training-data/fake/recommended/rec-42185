I wish I could give an accurate review. We called to inquire about delivery and we were directed to postmates.com to order from Blue Ribbon. We tried for over an hour to place an order, only to be repeatedly informed that no couriers were available. Then the kitchen closed. Hopefully they sign up with seamless or another reliable delivery source.
