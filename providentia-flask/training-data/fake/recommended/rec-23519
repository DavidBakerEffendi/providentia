Absolutely the best around for Italian food. The meatballs, the seafood salad, and the Italian cheesecake are all home runs. If you are lucky enough to go, it is 150% worth it. You might even see a New York celebrity or two. Â Frank and the staff are so welcoming and it's so cozy it makes you never want to leave!
