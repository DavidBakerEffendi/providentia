Eulogy is one of my favorite pubs in the city. Their lavender chicken is heavenly and the beer list is remarkably comprehensive. All of the waitstaff I've had were able to make fantastic beer recommendations based on my mainstream preferences. The atmosphere is dark and tavern-like, but the music never seems to loud and I like cozy dining. My other half usually gets an obscure bottle with a sandwich or burger, and it's always a great date-night. My only gripe about Eulogy is that it is quite small and on busy nights the experience can be ever-so-slightly sub-par with over-stretched waitstaff and unavailable food-items. Also, we've never tried to go with a large party, but there is a back room upstairs that seems able to accommodate a lot of people.
