Wow! My Mom and I stopped here yesterday for lunch, not knowing what to expect. We had patronized earlier restaurants at this location. I love Latin food, so I was immediately won over by the free plaintain chips and obviously home-made sauce served with it - amazing flavor. My Mom, a plain eater, nevertheless tried the plaintains and loved them, too! Our main courses were sandwiches--Mom's was ham and cheese on grilled flatbread--she wanted the lettuce and tomatoes on the side, and they thoughtfully added a lovely vinaigrette, which made it a side salad. Mine was pork and swiss cheese, with all the fixins including a great hot sauce! Again, everything seemed home cooked and authentic, loaded with flavor. The menu looks as though they have great breakfasts and dinners, too, and what's nice is that if you go with a plain eater, like my Mom, there are lots of choices, but if you want it spiced up and Latin, they can do that, too. We go out to lunch a lot and we will definitely go back. A wonderful addition to the Woodbridge local food scene. If you're tired of restaurant chains and their "packaged" food, this is the place for you! Reasonably priced, too. One thing I'd change: Make the music a little bit less loud....
