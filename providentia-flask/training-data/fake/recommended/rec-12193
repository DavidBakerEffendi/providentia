If you're going for the burger and duck fat french fries, know that they're better at Supper. But by all means, pick this place if you're in the mood to feel rushed into scarfing down your meal for fear of having it snatched out from under you. My friend and I had to keep telling the three different people who came for her half-eaten burger that, again, she was still "working on it." This was on a Tuesday at 6pm, so I can only imagine the onslaught on a Friday night. Â Jesus. Overall, I was underwhelmed.
