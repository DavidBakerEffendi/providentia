Went for brunch on a Saturday and was one of the first people in the restaurant so we were seating right away.  Nice atmosphere and friendly.  The waiter left a little to be desired.  Tables that got sat after us and were being served by a different waiter got their drinks and food much quicker than we did and, since the restaurant was only a third full, it wasn't like he was slammed.   The food was amazing though and so were the drinks.  I would definitely go there and again and would like to try their dinner menu.
