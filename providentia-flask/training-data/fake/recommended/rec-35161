Unbelievable.  I ordered take out on 12/4/14 and signed the bill for $21.78.  Afterwards, they processed my credit card for $26.14.  When I spoke to the manager there, he claims that my "1" looked like a "6" which is bullocks.  THEY ARE FRAUDULENT.  They processed a tip which I didn't authorize.  I did not give them a tip because I wasn't served--it was TAKEOUT.
