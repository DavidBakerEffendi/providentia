We were very pleased with every aspect of our visit to Momofuku Ss√§m Bar. We thought the service was expert and excellent and the food just outstanding. The prices were surprisingly reasonable as well. We arrived at opening and so had no wait on a cold Monday night in late December. I assume the pace picks up as the evening continues. Seems like to perfect place for a meal on a cold night in Manhattan. Our 12 and 10-year-old daughters were very adventurous and tried everything and really enjoyed almost everything. For us the standout dish was the sardines on toast with the Test Kitchen invented Hozon.
