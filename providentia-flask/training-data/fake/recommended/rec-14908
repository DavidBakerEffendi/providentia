Went to Tashan with friends for restaurant week and we were very pleasantly surprised by how many options we were given on the restaurant week menu, how big the portions were, and how delicious everything was! Yes, this is clearly an Indian restaurant, but the food is not just standard Indian.  Great flavors presented in some interesting ways.  This was especially true with the appetizers. The best were the Samosa Chaat (samosa buried under a pile of yogurt, chickpeas, and other things) and Palak Tikki (a kind-of spiced spinach patty).   The Tandoori Shrimp  and the Spicy Kakori Kebab were also good, but was good but not as much if a flavor highlight. The Butter Chicken (same as tikki masala) was great, especially the creamy rich sauce.  My friend had the Kashmiri Lamb Shank and raved about the dates in the sauce.  Another had the Goan Masala Dusted Lobster (yes, lobster was on the restaurant week menu!) and said it was very tasty. Naan came as a part of the meal (maybe just for restaurant week but regardless, it was nice to not have to pay extra for it) as did complementary sparkling water.  Rice came with the chicken and was the one downside, food-wise.  The rice definitely needed some seasoning, and the blandness took away a bit  from the butter chicken sauce.  Sauce definitely tasted better on the naan than with the rice! Service was SUPER attentive: we started off seated outside, but when it got cold after the apps course they moved us inside, then switched tables again on our request, all with a smile. Very impressive.  The downside was that we had to wait a long time for all of the mains to come out (chicken came first, lobster 5 minutes later, lamb 10 minutes after that) but the fact that the delay in the food did not affect our enjoyment of dinner says a lot about how full we were from the apps and how nice the overall experience was.
