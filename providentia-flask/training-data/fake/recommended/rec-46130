Had a family reception here recently.  About 25 people attended.  The Elbow Room and its staff did a great job.   We rented out the private downstairs room.  Waitresses were attentive to everyone's drink orders, we ordered drinks from the upstairs bar with a tab with no problem.  Drinks were great (good whiskey sour, ya'll). Booking was easy, setup was easy, food was ready when they said it would be, and their prices are very reasonable.
