The first thing I noticed about the Smith was the young hipster crowd that was here on Sunday brunch last week. It's got a cool vibe and the place is actually a lot bigger than you initially might think. We sat in the downstairs area, which was just OK; I think it was because we were a large group. The downstairs was decorated with cool stuff, but it just felt a little dingy and boring. There wasn't any natural daylight and nor was there a bar down there. I would Â have much preferred to be in the upstairs area. Having said that the brunch special where you can get a "free" drink with your order of eggs is always fabulous. I had the Huevos Rancheros which was exactly what I wanted. My only qualm was the fact that it was served with a soft taco; if you've read any of my other reviews then you'll know I like them hard and crunchy! The blood orange mimosa was good, I don't see them too often so it was a nice change from peach. The service here was good, our waiter wasn't rude or unhelpful. I suppose he could have come to check up on things a little more, but other than that I was happy with things. Prices are moderate for brunch, I actually saw a couple of things that were intriguing, but obviously I could only pick one! I would come back here for a brunch, but I would recommend just coming with a small group of say 3/4 and make sure to be seated in the upstairs dining room! Pros: bunch drinks with eggies! Cons: downstairs area isn't that exciting
