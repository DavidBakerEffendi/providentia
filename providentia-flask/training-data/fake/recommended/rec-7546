Tucked away in Princeton, the Tap Room has the looks of an old tavern, huge portions, and mediocre food. The menu is very standard American - salads, sandwiches, burgers, and steaks - and the prices range from about $10 to $25 an entree.  My group shared crab cake sliders, the steak salad, and a French Dip sandwich.  The steak salad was the best of the group - very standard - and the rest of the food was just okay.  Nothing seemed very fresh and all the flavors seemed one note. The service wasn't very good either.  The waiter got our order wrong, and we were the only table in the restaurant.   We left the restaurant full, but not very satisfied.  When we're in Princeton again this won't be our place for a meal.
