Ineptly-mixed drinks and overpriced Irish whiskies served by a grumpy old bartender who's simply given up;  overpriced food badly-made by a kitchen who've obviously never been trained in how to dress a salad or slice corned beef for a sandwich, all in a quiet, unhurried, rather pleasant old school tavern setting.  A fine choice if you're a teetotaller and you've had your lunch.
