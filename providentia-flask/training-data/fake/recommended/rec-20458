Lunita's is my go-to spot. The space and staff are charming, the coffee/food excellent (especially Â the Fulton, egg sandwich on cheddar chive biscuit), and they always play delightful music. Also, in the back there are children's clothes/toys for sale (will definitely hit that up for friends' baby showers and kids birthdays) and a nice spot for bigger groups to sit.
