The best strategy for eating here is to put your name on the waiting list and then prowl for seats at the bar.  The wait is usually mega-long and they don't take reservations, and that's probably the worst thing about this place.  Going with a group would not be recommended.  The food, however, was great, and the drinks, though a little steep, were good as well. The Kentucky Hot Brown was amazing (bread + turkey + bacon + cheese + butter + cheese), and of course the burger was great.  The fries were good but not excellent like I'd heard.   The only problem I had at Village Whiskey was that I ordered a Terrapin (misspelled on the menu) Big Hoppy Monster and it definitely wasn't a BHM.  Spending 5 years in Athens, Georgia and drinking Terrapin right from the source on a much-too-frequent basis, whatever IPA they had on draft wasn't even close.  The bartender was helpful and agreed that it didn't taste like the Terrapin I ordered--nothing else was said and the drink was free, so I really can't complain.
