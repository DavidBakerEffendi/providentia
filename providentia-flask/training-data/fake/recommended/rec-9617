Walked right by this place looking for it.  Pretty discreet from the outside.  Glad it didn't give up as the food was worth the stop.  Obviously, this place might be hidden from view from the street, but it's no longer a hidden gem with its 700+ reviews on Yelp.  And well deserved.  Nice decor, subtle food, good techniques.
