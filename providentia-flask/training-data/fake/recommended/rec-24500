Funny story, I passed by Umami Burger in a Sunday afternoon when I was shopping near by. It is not exactly a lunch or dinner time, but since I heard really words about this burger place, so I decide to walk in and order myself a Truffle burger for a sunday afternoon delight. It turns out to be a really good decision. The bun is super soft, the meat is cooked perfectly. Outside is crispy and inside is super tender and moisture. It is also very flavorful and rich. The size is not big, perfect for my afternoon delight. Will come back again!
