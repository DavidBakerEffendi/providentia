I've had the pleasure lately of meeting a couple of new friends who seem to know me right away - and I am humbled, shaking in my little boots, in their presence. I wish I had such skillz (but I try... I try). So when my new co-worker and I decided to get drinks after work this past Monday, she took one look at me and said, you like whiskey? DO I LIKE WHISKEY!? Well, slap your gramma. We proceeded to spend the next five hours indulging in (at first, happy hour priced) deliciously well-crafted bourbon cocktails. I have to say, the sazarac was spot-on - deliciously smooth and not too sweet - and the Noreaster (seriously? How could I NOT!?), made out of ginger beer, lime, maple syrup (yessss) and bourbon, was refreshing with a kick. Such a kick that I had at least six more of them. Note: Happy hour is an excellent time to come here because the cocktails are cheap. It was a great night. I even ran into my friend who I'd just spent the previous four days in New Orleans with. So random! He bought us yet another round. And the bartenders were totally chill and awesome with us as we got drunker and drunker... actually though, with fine bourbons, I don't usually get tanked, and was able to hold my own because... When I got home, my other friend who also seems to always intuitively know what I want surprised me with that other thing I love.* It was an amazing night, and it all started because my coworker and new friend thought I might like whiskey. And yes, I looked as rough as you can imagine at work the next day. Killin' it! I was just looking at the whiskey list and I see they have Kings County corn whiskey (aka Moonshine)... oh, I'll back back, Char No. 4. Even if your name is hard to type out, I'll be back. *Hint: I love, sex, booze, and rock n roll, and I did not see any rock n roll on Monday. \m/ Party on, Yelpers. Party on.
