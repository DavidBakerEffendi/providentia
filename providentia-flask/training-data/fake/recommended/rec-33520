With the lines at Maggie Brown being too long, OLEA was a great alternative.  While my $5 Greek red wine tasted like mediocre sangria and reinforced that its hard to find a good glass of wine for $5, my entree was wonderful.  The savory French toast was a combination of savory toast in an egg batter with two very runny fried eggs and lots of green onions.  A really great combination that I'd love to try again if I make it back to Fort Greene.  The side of potatoes was better than most of I've had and very soft.  Everyone else really enjoyed their different egg and scramble dishes.
