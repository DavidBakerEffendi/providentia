I love this place.  It's a simple restaurant in Sunnyside with friendly service.  The food is incredibly delicious, and seasoned to perfection.  The dining experience starts with complimentary bacon fat popcorn.  From the menu, I recommend the Fried Brussel Sprouts, Fried Chicken, and Striped Bass.  The meal ends with a complimentary shot of a Korean yogurt for dessert.  All in all, Salt & Fat makes for a great meal, and a great place to eat with friends or a date.
