There is not one dish that I would not order here! I have been here twice and have tried almost everything on the menu: razor clams and cockles ham croquettes blue cheese croquettes lamb skewers anchovies and olives lengua on toast squid in squid ink and rice patatas bravas mussels escabeche deviled eggs chorizo in sherry chorizo and chocolate pork loin sandwich suckling pork - BEST EVER! Anyway, you totally get the point that the food was simply amazing.  Anyone that complains about portions must read the definition of TAPAS.  This is among the top tapas restaurants in NY.   Service was awesome and bottles of wine were very reasonable. Totally a restaurant I would recommend!
