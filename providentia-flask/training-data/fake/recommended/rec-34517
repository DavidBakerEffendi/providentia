I really liked visiting this semi-Indian joint in the center of a hustling bustling city. Since we visited during lunch time it seemed too crowded but we still wanted to try the rolls out so we stood in the line.. And as a matter of fact, these guys were pretty good about their process control so there was not much of a wait. About the food, I will say we were not at all disappointed. Although, it was good but not great. They Â also offer various healthy roll options too and the prices are also on a lower end. So it's a must try!
