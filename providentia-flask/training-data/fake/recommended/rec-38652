[Review for Gourmet to Go, the cafe part] I've been here many times, mostly for the desserts.  They get their cakes, brownies, donuts, etc from Vegan Treats which makes the best cheesecake ever.  Seriously, I think I've converted people to veganism just with those cheesecakes.  My favorites are the rhasberry and peanut butter bomb kinds.  They're so good a cheap bastard like me will pay $5 a slice. As for their sandwiches and all, my family loves their famous chicken cheese steaks, I know their seafood wraps are veeeery realistic tasting, and the split pea soup was good (if a little too peppery when I was there).  Oh, and the zucchini melt was good, even better cold when I finished it later. There are some tables inside (by the counter and in an adjacent room) and outside which is nice.  And there are some awesome, very friendly people who work there.
