Get this: The kitchen is visible from the sidewalk, through big glass doors. Major kudos right there. Rex 1516 is just starting out, yet our dining experience suggests it's already hitting its stride--and if this is Rex's stride, that's good news for the culinary vibe of the city. The space is laid-back with enough retro decorations to recall another era, but it doesn't resort to kitsch. The service (and server attitude) varies from humble to cocky. Dishes appear quickly but well-timed, and they are taken away smartly. So ... The burger is as good as you've heard. The bread pudding is riotous. You can sit at the bar and watch Hitchcock's Vertigo in uh, black and white. There's no sign out front; not even a street number. Heh. ... maybe that stride is part skill, part attitude. I can deal. And return.
