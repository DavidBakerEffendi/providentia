Quick and tasty, came here on a Sunday evening for a light dinner.  Shared the hummus and feta sandwich with a side of arugula/salmon salad and it was just the right amount of food.  Everything was flavorful, fresh, and simple, I left feeling full and healthy.  The staff behind the counter was helpful and friendly.
