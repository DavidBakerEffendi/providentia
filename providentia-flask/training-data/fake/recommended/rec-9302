Finally able to make the trek over here for lunch after the considerable Yelp reviews on the burgers. For a Friday afternoon, I was able to sit down at the bar, which was a plus. I got in just before a big group of people came, so got lucky. Ordered the Bistro burger and a McSorley Dark ale immediately. The Bistro Burger: A thick patty burger with bacon, cheese, two pickles, lettuce, and tomato. The patty was juicy and perfectly cooked, with the bacon and melted cheese a perfect compliment. The bun barely held on around the patty, and there was no sauce on top (had to add ketchup). The fries were fine, nothing special, sad they don't come with the burger. **No vinegar available to put on the fries. $8 burger, $2.75 fries, $3 beers. Not terrible, but my biggest complaint is that I was STILL HUNGRY after all that. Maybe it was my appetite for the day, but I want my burgers big enough so that I don't want to eat for another 5 hours.
