I had to pass on the chicken and waffles as the idea makes me a little bit quesy. Everyone else at our table ordered it anyway so I tried the chicken... & it was fried & it was good.. We surmised they use Italian dressing seasoning packets to flavor the gravy which is, like the idea of chicken & waffles , unusual, but it works for them. I had baked catfish with the steamed okra and mac & cheese sides. The catfish was okay... I think it probably would taste better fried but i was trying to be 'healthy' (probably not a good idea when going out for soul food) but the okra.... mmmm yummmmmmy... Mac 'n' cheese was good,  not the best I ever had but good. And definitely an extra star for very sweet service... My one friend told our waiter she had come all the way there from San Francisco for their biscuits and they usually stopped serving them after breakfast but he brought us out some special... then as we are leaving first one person's credit card was declined then we gave them another credit card & then took off to go to the bathroom forgetting to sign off. It turned  out her credit card was declined as well so we looked like we had been skipping out on the bill. They stopped us but were very nice & practically apologetic to us for the whole thing.. Oh & I think that guy waiting outside is a host not a bouncer... i think that's called being courteous! But that's just my opine... Next time we go back we'll bring cash & I'll be trying the collard greens...
