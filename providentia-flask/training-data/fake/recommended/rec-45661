Quaint little breakfast joint with good eats. They make their own ketchup, and serve every meal with marinated apples. I ordered a fritata and it came with the biggest crustiest, Â fluffy biscuit ever. You can get grits with your meal too. The staff is young and dreamy, and the restaurant includes an outdoor patio.
