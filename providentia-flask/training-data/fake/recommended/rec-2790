Growing up in the Trenton area, having had an uncle that worked as a chef for Manetas I've been coming here for years. The overhaul was quite welcome and the food as always is delicious. A Â few negatives that I've found is their portion sizes vary depending on wait staff. A large juice today may be the size of a small coke tomorrow. The dining area is far too cramped. Also many staffers seem confused and unable to perform tasks given outside of their immediate job description. Example: Last night myself and a few family members stopped in for a bite but found it far too crowded and decided to order to go. The seating hostess and cashier were completely puzzled. Apparently the To-Go waitress had gone home for the evening and they were at a loss as to what to do. They scrambled for several minutes before the cashier fumbled to take our order. Unsure he returned several times from the kitchen for clarification. The food was decent; however, the baked potato was swimming in a pool of liquid. To be perfectly honest, if I could rate this place a 3.5 I would. Many places have "off" nights and the food and service are normally good; however, there's obvious room left for improvement.
