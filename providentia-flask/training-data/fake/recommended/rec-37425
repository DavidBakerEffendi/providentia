This place really hit the spot today. Just wanted a light snack and got their papaya salad and long bean dish, along with the tomate sambal. All of it was dynamite good. Sambal could have been more fishy but can't complain. Had a lovely flourless orange cake with strawberry basil compote. Loved the record player playing Beatles songs. Felt very Zen when i left the place.
