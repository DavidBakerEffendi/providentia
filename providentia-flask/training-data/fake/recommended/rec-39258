The food: delicious The service: just OK. The manager walked around to each and every table and talked to the people, except for us. It was a special valentine's day dinner and we were paying over $100 a person to eat there. We were also the youngest people in the room by about 15 years. I felt like they didn't take us seriously because we were in our early 20s. It seemed like they didn't care how we liked anything, or else they would have made a point to ask us about it..
