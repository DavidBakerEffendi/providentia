I wanna say that i really really loved DIZ PLAYCE. Really. I have lived in Japan a bit and I would say this is pretty darn close to what you get over there. The price is right and the quality beeeee HIGH. I got the tonkatsu curry rice with a bowl of udon. The broth was especially good and the noodles seemed perfect. My only small complaint was that while the udon was crayzee taystee, the tonkatsu curry rice was missing that special something. Don't get me wrong, it was excellent- just lacked that weird special something you get with Japanese food in Japan. It's like they have this crazy magic spell that isn't available for casting on food over here. For me, it's a little hard to find really good Japanese food outside of Japan but this came pretty close. The waitress was friendly and even chased me down the street with my phone charger I left on the bar. Thanks waitress, i'll think of you every time I plug my phone in. I will definitely be back. Mata ne!
