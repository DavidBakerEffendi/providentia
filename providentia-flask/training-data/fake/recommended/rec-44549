If I could just give the halal guys 5 stars and walk away without saying anything else I would. It's that good. Halal guys is the epitome of New York City in an aluminum bowl, wrapped in a yellow bag with red writing. You'll feel as though Christmas morning is being handed to you. +CHEAP. ($6 a bowl y'all, and the generous portions lasts me two meals. ***CASH ONLY***) +QUICK. (Don't fear the line, it goes by super quick, you'll get to the front before you can go through your entire instagram feed, trust me. Perfect opportunity to make some new friends, NYC is such a diverse place!) +DELICIOUS. +SPICY. (if you want it to be, but don't get too cocky with the red sauce... they don't play around with spicy here.) +SAUCY. (that white sauce is boss, don't forget it!) +SEXY. I can't ever leave NYC without paying a visit to my favorite guys first. ;)
