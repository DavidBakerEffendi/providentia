Way too expensive for what they offer in both food and ambiance. The food is excellent, no doubt about it. Â But for the shack it comes out of and the lack of ambiance, the prices shouldn't be as high as they are especially when you can take a trip down to Westport and hit Bobby Q's which has everything going on in terms of BBQ and for Westport, their prices and portions are amazing. Uncle Willie has to realize that when people like me pull up to his shack, we are expecting cheap food and nice portions without the Westport prices!!!
