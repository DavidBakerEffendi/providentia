Place is filthy and the 2 (and only 2) ppl working the front are about as efficient as ny traffic at 6pm during the week. I think most ppl exaggerate the wait cause they traveled a long distance for it. This account is 100% true. Walked in. One person was in front of me. 10 minute later they asked for my order. The wait for 2 slices was "an hour....at least.....(as he looks at a list) ...probably more." Pie was a longer wait. If there's more than 10 ppl infront of you your in for a 2 hr wait at least
