It's your home bar on someone else's turf, unless you're local, I suppose. A great end to a great Saturday in Philly: live music at a pretty cool venue. I'm a junkie when it comes to lesser-known bands at dive-y type bars. I can't help myself when I see a cheap ticket and a sketchy address and Stornaway at JB's was a double-match. The staff appear to have zero tolerance for customer BS and that works perfectly for me at a live music venue: I want my drink, I want it quickly and I don't want to share any part of my life with you, nor vice-versa. A quick couple of orders, a couple of decent tips followed by a "Cheers" and I was in the good books. You should do the same. As for bar, the sound quality was great, the crowd was totally chill (yet Â appreciative of both bands) and the atmosphere was perfect for tucking away in a dark corner, sipping on pints and taking it all in. Not bad for a $12 ticket.
