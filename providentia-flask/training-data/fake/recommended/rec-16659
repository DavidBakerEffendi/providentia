House made hot sauce...$2 Pork buns...$8 Spare Ribs...$10 Bowl of Akamaru Modern ramen with pork belly...$18 Not being able to take home what you paid for...priceless My first trip, not knowing the reputation of Ippudo, I was unhappy with the wait time and sticker shocked by the price. For the second time, I went in with a much more prepared mindset. Spare ribs and the pork belly was definitely the highlight (therefore 2.5 stars). The pork buns could have done without the mayo. $2 for "housemade" hot sauce (we easily overlooked it), but I've had the same exact hot sauce all over Chinatown. And guess what?...you CAN'T take home what you can't finish. I understand that doggy bag is generally found in Europe, but we're not in Europe! Thanks for the lame excuses, Ippudo. So for $18 ramen, I sat there, unbuttoned my pants and finished my ramen. Thanks, Ippudo! If there's a next time, I'm bringing my own tuppeware and hot sauce.
