A gem of a restaurant in an area with very little soul. Remarkably fresh ingredients, great atmosphere and friendly service. Pad Thai shrimp was very good, papaya salad was very fresh (a little too spicy, but you can specify) and I also was happy with the kabocha squash tapioca for dessert. Will definitely be coming back. Update: Second time around (the next day) I ordered the vegetable dumplings which were phenomenal... perfect texture and extra peanuty
