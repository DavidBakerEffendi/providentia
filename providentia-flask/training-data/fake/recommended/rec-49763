I went here with a girlfriend on friday.  After hearing great things about this place I was really excited to try it.  Generally i like to ask waiters for recommendations when i've never been there just to see what they are known for or if they have any favorites.  The waiter was basically not helpful.  He just kept saying everything was good.  He ended up recommending a special side dish of roasted ramps.  I ended up ordering the rabbit caviatelli, the lamb entree with a side of fries and the roasted ramps.  I was pretty disappointed... everything was on the salty side...the ramps were so salty i couldn't eat more than a bite.  Nothing wow'd me.  Only thing that was interesting was the fries came with cocktail sauce which was a refreshing change to the normal ketchup.
