A burger joint for people who like to sketch! The place itself is nothing to write home about.  In fact, I think they paper the wall with all of those sketches to hide the fact that the inside of the restaurant is in fact, a little sketchy looking. That aside!  If you like burgers and are, like my fiance,  in a constant quest to find the best burger in town, then you should definitely check out this Fishtown spot.  I got the "cyclops burger" with provolone, bacon, and a fried egg on top.  Ooey-gooey, meaty goodness! +     Fantastic, juicy burgers +     Fun, witty Sketches of things like the Heisenburger +/-   Good spot for hipster watching if you're into that -      For a burger joint, I was surprised by the long-ish wait for our food -      CASH ONLY (annoying)
