Pros: Friendly, accommodating service, good (though pricey) food. Cons: Server didn't seem to know the wine list I had dinner here during an overnight visit, and I loved the lobster macaroni and cheese ($19) as well as the mango sorbet from the nearby Bent Spoon.  The generously-sized mac & cheese was rich, creamy, full of chunks of lobster meat, and covered with perfectly crisped bread crumbs.  My dining companions' seseame-crusted seared tuna over edamame and pea shoots and steak salad also looked delicious. My only complaint is that our server wasn't able to recommend any glasses of wine.  The rose would have been a horrible pairing with the tuna, and it wasn't at all dry, which is what the person ordering had said she would prefer.  Fortunately the server brought her a small tasting, so she hadn't been stuck paying for a whole glass.
