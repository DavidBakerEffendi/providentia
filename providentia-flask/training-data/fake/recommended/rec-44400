delicious crepes, so many new ones and such an extensive menu, there's something for everyone. but it makes it damn hard to choose one each time. if you go savory, it's on the sweet side, often with nutella, fruit, confectionary sugar, honey, real whipped cream, etc. savory is more of meal-type crepes, sometimes completely vegetarian (spinach and feta is great), or sometimes with various meat. there's breakfast crepes as well, often with an egg included, and then there are some for kids (pizza crepe) or salads (no crepe included). you can sit outside or inside, where it's cozy and there is great art on display. wine and beer is also available, and they play music in the evenings on the weekends. very busy place, so you might have to wait a while, but it's so worth it! my go-to is the lovemaker, which has nutella, real whipped cream, strawberries and confectionary sugar.
