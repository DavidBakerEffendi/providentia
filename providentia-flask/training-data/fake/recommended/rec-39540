I love this restaurant!  The food is authentic Cuban and never disappoints.  The drinks--from their cafe con leche to the delicious mojitos--hit the spot every time.  The live music adds immeasurably to the ambience, and the cigar roller at the table by the window is a crowd pleaser even for passing pedestrians and really takes you back to a time when life was simpler, and people really appreciated the little things. Great for a full dinner or to grab a drink at the bar with a buddy or the love of your life.  I really wish I could give it a full 5 stars, but every time I've been there, space has been really tight.  "Intimate" is an understatement.  If you're wearing a coat, be careful taking it off or putting it on or you may take out a few place settings.   This is a terrific restaurant that has outgrown its space, but once you're there and acclimated to the tight quarters, you're in for a fantastic dining experience!
