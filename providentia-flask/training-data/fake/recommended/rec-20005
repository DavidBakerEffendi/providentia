The food was good... do I think it's the best pizza I've ever had?  No.  Do I even think it was worth the hour and a half wait?  Absolutely not.  I think I possibly just don't love thin crust pizza like this, but if I had only ordered one of the cheese variety, I would have been very disappointed.  The small cracker like pizza couldn't even fill me.  However, the special pizza consisting of lamb and yak meatballs, garlic and caramelized onions had amazing flavors. So why the four stars?  BEER!  The beer selection is absolutely superb.  And I really appreciate their use of organic and local ingredients. I would go back for the beer alone.
