This is one of my favorite places in Astoria.  Their grilled cheese is uh-ma-zing, and I love that each sandwich comes with a fancy side dish.  I was SO happy when they debuted a gluten free bread option this year, especially because unlike most GF bread, it doesn't taste like a) a dense brick, or b) an egg brick.  I wouldn't have known it was different!  I also love that they have an extensive beer + cider list; when I was still eating gluten I loved the beer tasting, and I'm excited to try their ciders.  Their brunch is also AWESOME... so many interesting items.  The coffee is delicious, too. My one complaint is that they limited their grilled cheese selection, and their old combos were so good!  But I always leave a happy camper.
