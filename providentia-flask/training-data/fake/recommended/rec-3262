I really, really wanted to love you Rex but honestly a change has gotta come. Pros: gluten free menu with a lot, lot of choices which I love and makes everything much easier, portion sizes are great, making a reservation is key because this place is tiny and fills up quick. Cons: our server legitimately was pretty terrible. As a service industry employee myself, it's important for me to expect good service across the board. She forgot a guests drink at our table 3 times which was just annoying (there were 2 tables at this point in the restaurant), she was pretty miserable and charged my credit card twice without telling me which was even more annoying. All in all: the seafood stew and gluten free wings were honestly delicious, but the rudeness of the aloof waitress is enough to make me not run back here.
