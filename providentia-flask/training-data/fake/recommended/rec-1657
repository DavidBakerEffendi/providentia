When we arrived at 3pm the restaurant was still or already mostly full, but they accommodated us nonetheless with the provision that we be out by 4:30pm when their reservations start. When we left, close to 5pm, the wait was already an hour and a half. They have several cozy dining rooms that seat more than you might expect, but alas, it's New York. I had the Caesar salad / all-you-can-eat homemade past combination (~$22), which hit the spot. I know that sounds a little like Olive Garden, but this is the real deal. Nothing here is flash frozen. The salad and pastas are intended to be starters on the way to the $20-30 main courses.
