I went to Trenton Social last night to attend an open mic. Since I was there anyway, I figured that I might do a few minutes of stand-up, even though everyone else performing was a musician. I was planning on doing a set about the tedium of commuting, but as the night grew longer and I continued to be reminded of much I hate Trenton, I decided that I would just go up onstage and talk smack about the capital of New Jersey for however long time and the patience of the host would permit. Turns out, it was only about five minutes max. I started off by commenting on the historical significance of Trenton, and how George Washington crossed the Delaware River on the night of Christmas with his ragtag army to slaughter the Hessian forces sleeping peacefully in their quarters, probably after a night of religious observance and celebration. Heroic? Or cowardly? I suggested cowardly. Everything kind of just went downhill from there. While I was on the mic, I even made reference to the review that I'm writing now. I said I would give this place either three or four stars. Now, apparently the owner was standing there listening to me the entire time. I think that was his opportunity to secure a four or even five-star review from me; he could have offered me a free drink, an appetizer, a discount, etc. But no. When will business owners learn to bribe me? I am a pretty righteous person, but come on -- it's like they're not even putting any effort in to corrupt me. Anyway, I like this place. It's much better than most of the rest of Trenton.
