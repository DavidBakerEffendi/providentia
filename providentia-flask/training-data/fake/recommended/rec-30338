Service was excellent!  The waitress was very attentive and checked in often.  I will say the Steak was overpriced. I have gotten better for a lot less money at other restaurants but the other dished my party got looked and tasted great.  The Apps and Desets were very good.  We got 4 different deserts and I tried them all.  Very good! Will be back.
