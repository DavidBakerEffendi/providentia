Great pub in Montclair. The food is also very good and it's a all around good time. They play good music and have a separate area for dancing in their club section. They make good drinks and they are not shy. There is a bartender named Stu that works there. He is excellent. Its a fun place to also catch a soccer game when Ireland or England teams are playing. I been here may times with friends and each time we had a great time. The crowd is very friendly. In the springtime, they have the outside open in the back. It's get very crowded in the weekends, but they did make it bigger so you don't feel that crowded. It's a place good for all ages. Def a place to hang out in Montclair. They should have more places like this around the area. If you go here just for dinner, you wont be disappointed as well.
