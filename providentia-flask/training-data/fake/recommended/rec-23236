Hmmm...I seriously don't know what the hype was about. I went with my family for an early Friday dinner. My wife ordered the sturgeon, I ordered the cobia, and my mother the bass. Â I also ordered 2 oysters and the octopus for appetizers. The oysters were tasty, and the octopus ($16) was burnt. Quality of the fish is indeed high, but the execution was subpar. The seabass and the sturgeon was raw, the sauce with the cobia was unpleasantly bitter (and the under cooked veggies didn't help). The pesto with bread was the tastiest part of the $150 meal. The service was good, the atmosphere was pleasing. Maybe the cook had an off day when we went, but the prohibitive cost makes me hesitant to give them another shot.
