i hate to give a bad review ..but i was kind of disappointed with food.. nothing special and prices are to high ..umm staff was great and very friendly tho ..and i went around lunch time and i was the only person in the place... i kept seeing people going across the street to the other spanish restaurant .. maybe i should have gone there instead .. just being honest
