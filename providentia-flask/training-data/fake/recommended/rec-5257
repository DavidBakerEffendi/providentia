Americanized Tex-Mex is the best way to describe this place. I wouldn't call pretty much anything they serve Mexican food, but with the proper expectations it is "alright". Lets start with the good, the namesake margarita's they serve are actually pretty good, the chips and salsa are free+plentiful and have a nice flavor to it (if you like the salsa the exact same recipe is available at local supermarkets like the Co-Op), and they have several vegetarian options, and the overall decor and ambiance is pretty nice. Much more refined and finished than say Gusanoz. The bad is that the food is very bland and relies on massive quantities of cheese (which can be a bit greasy) to make things taste good, to their ubiquitous chipotle mayo or guacamole. Dishes lack flavor and spice and sometimes aren't really cooked through enough. One example are their veggie fajitas which often times come out practically raw. Expect a straightforward protein/tortila/vegtables presentation to all the items with essentially all the same ingredients. All of that being said its usually consistent in terms of service and food with no big problems. My main gripe would be the whole place being inauthentic as a Mexican restaurant. Mediocre food aside this location in Centerra has seemed to finally beat the curse which has surrounded this building because every restaurant prior such as the pan-asian Moonsoon had failed after a short time. I attribute this to the fact that the Upper Valley fails to have any solid Mexican options. The other two options Gusanoz and The Lil Red Barron are actually no better and maybe worse than Margs. It takes traveling to Manchester (NH or VT) to find the good stuff.
