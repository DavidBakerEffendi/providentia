Great atmosphere, long waits though, believe 2 of us had to wait 45mins for a table on a Saturday night and they say it wasn't even that busy that nite so who can imagine what it is like when it's busy, so you've been warned, make reservations!!!! We were initially seated near the door and it was freezing, cause people were coming in and out, also we were next to the bar so we had sooooo many tipsy people bumping into our table, thankfully our waitress was able to move us to a better table It's a very modern atmosphere with dim lights and candles lit on each table, very loud place tho but it's pretty neat, they have a wide array of alcoholic drinks but we were too exhausted to have a drink We ordered the guacamole with pistachio as recommended by the server, btw they are know for their guacamoles here, think was the highlight of my nite, very thick and rich guacamole, one of the best I've had, as for our entree we got the taco sample platter which came with seabass, Mahi Mahi, steak, carnitas and chicken....didn't really taste that good, seabass was difficult to eat in a taco cuz it was in a cube shape, Mahi Mahi was too overpowered by a spicy tangy mayo and when the tacos get cold they didn't taste too good, so eat it quick when you get it, also found the tacos to be a bit too soggy....the oxtail enchilada was nothing special, very tangy flavor, came with a boil of rice and beans Overall food didn't impress me Probably come back here next time for drinks and the guacamole
