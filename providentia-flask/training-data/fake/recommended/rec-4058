We came for Dine in Brooklyn (Brooklyn Restaurant Week) and the deal included 3 courses for $23 per person.  I think it was a great deal, considering most entrees are normally priced around $23 anyway.  The only thing is that they fill up reservations VERY quickly for Dine In Brooklyn with only odd times left if you wait 1-2 days after the event is announced, crazy! The complimentary bread and assorted spreads were fantastic and a very nice way to start.  I tried a blood orange soda which was good, if not a bit too sweet.  We both upgraded the appetizers from the prix fixe offering ($6 and $8 extra for a better appetizer?  That's kinda shameless and the only reason I'm taking off a star.)  I had a pork terrine appetizer that was very big and definitely rich enough to be split by 2 people.  However, the real star was the entree of hake - perfectly cooked and delicious.  One of the best fish dishes I've ever had. The desserts were also generous and very good.  Check it out for a great, but a little pricey, meal!
