Food was great, waiter was great. They ran out Lambrusco red wine on a Saturday night ! Then we  specifically watched the waiter inform the manager that we were not happy about this. After all we are in Times Square, the restaurant is supposed to be well prepared. The manager looked at the waiter, shrugged his shoulders and said to the waiter,  "we are out of it, what do you want me to do about it". Did not even bother to come to the table. No apology,  Nothing!  Well manager, our bill was over $800. How about offering us a different bottle of wine on the house for your lack of preparation ? Taking care of your guests would've been something nice you could've done...
