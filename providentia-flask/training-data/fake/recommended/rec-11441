I don't like to experiment with brunch food. When I'm on the verge of vomiting and still feeling drunk from the night before, the last thing i want is a burrito stuffed with eggs and avocado. I like omelets covered with ketchup, toasted bagels covered with cream cheese and endless cups of orange juice.
