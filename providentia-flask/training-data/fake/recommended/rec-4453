I used to go all the time in the old location and loved it. .  I think they closed down a few years ago because UNH wanted to use the building for a clinic and I figured we had lost a great one forever. I spotted the new location a few weeks ago and went down there tonight. I swear it seems even better than before. Taiwanese food is very different from the usual Cantonese, Szechwan, or Hunanese (?) fare and  should be experienced to really appreciate it's subtlety.  Our party of three asked for the chef to make us anything he wanted and my friends and I were really pleased with the results. Shredded pork soup with mustard greens, spicy crispy-fried short ribs, Chinese eggplant with garlic, whole fish in a really nice orange-colored sauce, and a plate of broiled short ribs with vegetables in a thick brown sauce with a hint of five-spice powder. This place must be supported so that we don't lose them again, so do your culinary duty....PS The place was spotless, the service warm and friendly, plenty of  parking out front.
