DEFINITELY TRY THE GREEN TEA MILLED CREPES! FOOD: This time we tried the Miso soup and one of their specials, Katsudon. The soup was okay. I didn't like it that much. Katsudon is some form of deep fried pork cutlets served with rice and shredded cabbage. The food was tasty. But the real surprise was the dessert- green tea milled crepes. I have no word to describe how delicious it was. I totally loved this very innovative sweet dish.
