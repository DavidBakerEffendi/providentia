As a southerner in NYC I have to say this place gets the comfort food/bistro thing down. The drinks are amazing and every time I go there for brunch I thank God I live in the neighborhood so I can just roll home. The service is decent but if you sit at the bar be prepared for a lot of ATTITUDE. I thought it was me at first, but having been there several times and having to eat at the bar twice I am sure some of the bartenders are just jerks. My boyfriend is a spender and very sweet and they are always the worst to him. Go, eat, and be merry. It is very cramped but not claustrophobic.
