"Are you open?" is always a cause for concern, but it was allayed once I was greeted and imploded once I ate. Stopped in for some tapas with a Blackboard Eats code as dinner commenced (would I have stopped in otherwise? probably not...would I have missed out? yep); sat at an empty bar and checked out the minimalist menu. They do what they do well, proven with some excellent deviled eggs & stuffed peppers (though both were delivered by a fellow from the back who scratched his undercarriage on his walk back into the kitchen both times). There was a private/employee party of some sort going down at the only large table in the back, which got loud and fairly unruly, but the wait staff was very friendly and helpful, without being irritating. The restroom was half for giants and half for shorter folk, but not in bad shape. Water was plentiful but room temperature, and they were piping in a great soundtrack. Bottom line: Quick in & out, very reasonable prices, solid tapas, & perfect service.
