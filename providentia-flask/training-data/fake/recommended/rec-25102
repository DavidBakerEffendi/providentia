I've tried this place twice now, both times for lunch & take-out.  I tried the BBQ Pork Curry Ramen noodles.  The meal was separated with the noodles in a styrofoam container, and the broth with everything else in a quart size plastic container.  The curry flavor was strong, but can quickly be diluted with the broth.  Overall, it was good for what it was... but I will likely try a different ramen noodle next time. I also tried their Grilled Eel Fried Rice (see pic). This came with a good portion of delicious stick Japanese fried rice, which was quite flavorful.  The grilled eel, with it sweet sauce was a great addition to the rice.  There was 1 breaded and fried piece of squid, not sure the proper name for it, but it was delicious.  I would definitely order this dish again.
