I have been hesitant to write a review/give them 5 stars because I don't want more people to go- there's already enough of a wait to be seated!  My BF and I save this spot for special occasions and for taking out if town guests (because it's not cheap) and we are never disappointed.  Our absolute favorite is the Cherry Jones (we're veg so we get it with vegan sausage instead of prosciutto; side of hot honey for crust dipping).  They seem to change up the menu seasonally, adding new pies (like one with kale in winter, figs in fall) but always keep the staples.  Great for vegetarians and meat eaters alike.  Paulie himself checks on you to make sure all is good.
