The decor and atmosphere alone are worth it. You top it off with large portions and an incredible drink list!! And if you can believe it... it's affordable. The second you walk in, you feel as if you are whisked OUT of hell's kitchen and into the allure of the successful haunts of the meat packing district. You MUST try the Detox cocktail on the specialty menu. Â The spring rolls are refreshing and filling. My only complaint would be the spiciness of my entree. The pumpkin chicken curry... was WAYYYY to spicy. Made my eyes water and my nose run. BUT--- the experience was so amazing, it still gets full stars. I wanna go back. Like now.
