What an outstanding delivery experience we had tonight from Uzbekistana! We had just received their menus at my office in Mountain Lakes. The menu is nothing short of impressive, complete with many vegetarian (and not marked, but many gluten-free) options, both of which are very important to us. There is also a nice catering menu and an impressive assortment of exotic teas and kebabs available. Mira, who answered the phone, was very pleasant and helpful. Our rather large appetizer order was comprised of Dolmeh Barg (grape leaves), hummus (if you like it thick, this is for you), veggie samsa (homemade baked filo dough stuffed with vegetables), baba ganush, and falafel (standard size). The highlights were the brishmi paneer (herbed tomato sauce and delightfully prepared cheese cubes) and the basmati rice with raisins and carrots. Accompanying the meal was some pita. We loved this meal. Sometimes when we like a place (like Caffe Delhi in Denville or Mesob in Montclair) we start taking everyone we know to that place. Uzbekistana is our next new place. We can't wait to visit in person. We are so lucky, in New Jersey, to have such cultural diversity. People bring their customs and cuisine from all over the world to our great state. This place is a treasure and it is right on Boonton's artsy, always improving Main Street. We wish to thank everyone at Uzbekistana for a wonderful experience. You'll hear from us Â again very soon.
