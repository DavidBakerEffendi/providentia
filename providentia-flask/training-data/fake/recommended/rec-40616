TRY: Crispy black striped bass (All my friends got the steak except me and they did NOT enjoy it as much as i enjoyed my sea bass~ They said it was hard to chew and lacked flavor - order BIG RED OWL BURGER instead if you want to have meat cause i heard their burger is good....dessert? eh. ) SERVICE: Great! our waiter was super nice :) AMBIANCE: Upscale tavern - since it's a part of a hotel and there is NO BATHROOM inside the restaurant so you have to walk towards the hotel lobby and down the steps and walk more to get to the bathroom!!
