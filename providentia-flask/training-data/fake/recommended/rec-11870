Good service, crowded, bland food. Went here because I saw it had 4 stars, but was pretty disappointed. Got the Sunday supper - salad (nothing special - could have made it myself in 5 minutes), Roast beef (bland and flavorless), dessert (pretty good). Also split the meatballs, which were ok, but clearly lacked some seasoning and salt. Not the quality that justifies a $10 glass of wine.
