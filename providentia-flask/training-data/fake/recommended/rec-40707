I stopped by Amis late on a Thursday evening to meet a friend. It was absolutely packed! Being extremely comfortable at the bar, we managed to grab a seat and decided to eat there as well. He ordered various dishes for us to share (normally I'm not one to let this happen, but when in Rome...right?). The first to arrive was the bruschetta, which was quickly followed by an escarole salad and the infamous "Sals old school meatballs". Honestly the best meatballs I've ever had. (Sorry, Gram.) We then split the gnocchi alla romana and capped off the night with the walnut apple cake. Every bite was amazing...and extremely filling, I think I literally waddled out the door. Fortunately I didn't have to pick up the check, but I would undoubtedly pass up a few nights at my local pub to be able to indulge in this Italian delicacy again. In addition to the food, the atmosphere is modern, yet cozy and the waitstaff was extremely friendly. It's the perfect place to bring a date or to go for a night out with your girlfriends.
