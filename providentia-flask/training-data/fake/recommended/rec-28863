It is just OK. This place is just across the street from where I work.  I usually go to Angelo's Pizza in the Bellevue Food Court, however, Angelo's was out of eggplant today.  I called in a order for an eggplant parm sandwich.  They told me that the sandwich would be ready 7-8 minutes.  I stepped out, crossed the street took a picture of the place, went in side and they were already boxing up my order.  They package their sandwiches by using styrofoam boxes.  Even thought this isnt great for the environment, it is good for my sandwich.  I hate when places wrap up my cheesy sandwich in paper and the cheese sticks all over the paper when you unwrap it. Eggplant parm sandwiches are usually a bit greasy.  This one was especially greasy. The bread was nice and fresh and crisp.  Overall the experience was OK to good, however the sandwich was just fair in flavor.  If I go again, I will probably just try the pizza. I like Angelo's eggplant parm better. When I looked over the stock of ready to eat pizza slices, they had a nice variety of plain, veggie, tomato, pepperoni....As I write this I am getting a bit uf a tummy ache.
