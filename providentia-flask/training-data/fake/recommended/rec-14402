Is this a joke? I'm rating delivery food- they served me a bag of wet oily fries. Right in the trash - inedible. The burgers have some spice on them, strange taste. I guess some people might like it but I like salt and pepper only. It must be better when you sit in bc we ended up throwing out our entire dinner. Waste of money, they shouldn't deliver food that doesn't travel well. Sorry, wanted to like it but couldn't even believe what they sent over.
