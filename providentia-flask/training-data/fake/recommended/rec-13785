First off.. I'm gonna start this by saying I do not eat the artichoke slice here.  I am a traditional Italian that does not like anything out of the ordinary on my pizza.. which a heaping glob of artichoke dip falls into that category.  I've tried it.. and don't like it at all.  So you would think that would influence my opinion of this place since that's their specialty right??  Wrong!!   Their regular slice.. or Sicilian which is the same base.. is my favorite slice in the city.  That's all you need to know.  If you are a fan of great brick oven pizza with fresh sauce and the right touch of sweetness, patches of fresh mozzarella cheese with a dusting of grated cheese, and fresh basil.. then this is for you.  If you want an oily greasy slice smothered in shredded mozzarella cheese that gets stuck in your throat when you eat it, on top of some nasty pizza sauce with too much oregano in it that gives you instant agita.. then go to Ray's. Once again.. no comment on the artichoke slice.  But as for the regular and the sicilian.. best slice in the city.
