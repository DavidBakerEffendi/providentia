There is nothing more exciting in my book than finding the perfect restaurant half a block from your apartment - and lucky us, Rucola is right on the corner! I have been anxiously watching as the restaurant came into being and waited for the perfect night to try it out. We went on a Friday night and it was super packed. No problem, the super nice guy who greeted us took our name and cell number and called us when our table was ready - perfect! First bit of excitement was the intriguing cocktail list - rye with sage? Yes please! We tried 4 different cocktails and all were really unique and tasty. For apps we had the stuffed artichoke and asparagus with shredded egg. Enjoyed both a lot, but not as much as our mains - soft shell crab with pancetta and peas and a delightful lamb special with fresh greens. All was very flavorful, seasonal and fresh! If it couldn't get better... Then there was dessert: some of the best tiramisu I have ever had. A very generous slice with great flavor and not overly sweet! The service was really friendly even though they were very busy. The only negative is the space is a bit small for how popular Rucola already is proving to be!
