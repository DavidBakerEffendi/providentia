I like this place because the food is fresh and I feel full and satisfied after eating. I'm only reviewing on the different kinds of stir-fry because I've never tried the salads or smoothies. It gets three stars instead of four because it is overpriced and I can't find any nutrition information anywhere. One other bonus is they have a phone charging station!
