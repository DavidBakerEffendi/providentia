Jadis is the perfect place for a supper of small plates and bottles of wine.  I love coming here with a friend or my boyfriend for some(times too much) wine and light food and great conversation.  As a previous reviewer stated, this is the place to come for enlightening tipsy philosophy and conversation.   The cheese/meat board is delicious -- you can pick two of each (I recommend their country pate) and it comes with grapes, mustard, a little bit of salad, and bread.  Their escargot is great as is their quiche and scallops.  We've also had the paninis which are delicious. Basically.... you can't go wrong here. The wine list is a perfect length -- big enough that there is variety, but also short enough that you don't feel overwhelmed.  Also, the prices could not be better.   THe service is always attentive, especially if you sit at one of the tables in the front, since it's right near the bar.  If you can get the table in the front that's behind the door, you've hit the jackpot.   Definitely go here.
