Katsu-Hama is still the gold standard for Katsu. I try to stop by whenever I'm in Manhattan for lunch or dinner, and still find the katsu and great dressing near perfect.   Any place that my old Yankee fave Matsui-san eats in has to be good, too.   Seriously, for what it is -- a katsu focused specialty shop--Katsu Hama is the very best. Wish we had places like this nationally.
