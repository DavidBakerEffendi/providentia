I crave Orangeside's square donuts!  Often on Saturdays, my dog and I and our Dog-People friends and their dogs take a "pack walk" from Wooster Square to Orangeside on Temple for our donut fix. This donut-pack-walk has been a weekend traditions that began about two years ago, before Orangeside moved to its current location. Tony and Michelle are always friendly and take time to chat with us. They sometimes even offer treats for our dogs, who wait patiently outside while we owners take turns gawking at the generous selection of donuts and trying to choose a flavor. My favorites are the yeasted glazed, the blueberry cake, and the chocolate cake. I've also been to Orangeside for sit-down breakfast, and it is traditional diner-style cuisine.  Great to support a local donut shop!
