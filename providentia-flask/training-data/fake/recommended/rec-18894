A good diner to count on. The service is good and the food comes out fast and always in large portions. They have good food that are not too greasy or lacking in flavor. It's a good go-to for a diner. Their omelettes are huge and delicious. They definitely give you your money's worth. I like the waffles as well as their eggs Benedict (though the sauce is slightly sour for my taste, still good). Sunny is the best waiter there! But all the wait staff are super nice and friendly and you can strike up a conversation with most of them. The decor is very old fashioned looking... I think it's for an older crowd. It's traditional looking with its dark greens and maroon colors... But like I said, it's dependable overall.
