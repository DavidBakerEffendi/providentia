So, this place is awesome. I went on Friday night for the first time and was amazed at how big the back yard was. My BF and I tried 2 hot dogs...I was definitely a bit drunk so I couldn't tell you the exact name of either, but one was a ripper and the other had pineapple relish on it and holy sh*t, they were both really, really good. Beer selection is awesome - they have Ommegang Hennepin on tap, one of my faves, as well as many other great beers. It was packed, but service was still quick. Also - relatively cheap, especially considering the beer selection/what you would pay in the City. The only downside is that you can't smoke in the backyard, but I get it, I get it. Doesn't really matter in the end. This place is great, and it's really nice to have a bar like this in Bay Ridge.
