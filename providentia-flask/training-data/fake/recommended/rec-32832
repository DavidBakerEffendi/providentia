Here's the low-down: $5 Self Parking Fee... what? Oh okay... $5 Cover - what the f#@k! Come on! lol $10 spent and no food or booze in my system? No bueno. Food: Nothing very memorable. Grilled shrimp in garlic sauce was okay, along with the fried mozzarella sticks - all bar food 'grade' and prices. Drinks: $40 for a self-serve glass keg of beer. This thing was a monster and looked pretty cool. Music: Salsa/Cumbia/Merengue, Top 40s, and Electronic/House. DJ did a great mix across all these genres. I went there on a Friday night for the World Cup qualifiers. This place was a mad zoo at 9PM packed with people, mostly Colombians due to the game I assume, drinking and dancing. It was difficult to move around much but my group was able to secure a spot at the bar. Traumatizing Moment of the night: Drunk Hispanics, emotions running high, and a fight breaks out! No one is surprised. What sucks is the bouncers decide to remove the toxic people outside.. but the group of rowdy guys pretty much beat the daylights out of these two other guys. It was brutal and a bloody mess. The bouncers pretty much let it all go down in the parking lot and didn't give a damn since it wasn't going inside their venue. Oh well.. a large gash leaking blood from the forehead never killed anyone... right? Anyways... On a separate note: The bartenders and waitstaff were easy on the eyes so the management did do something right. Bottom line: If you think this is your scene, it's worth swinging by yelpers! I'd consider going back there on a more calm night since I heard they have billiards there.
