I really enjoyed my dinner here. Went here on a saturday night with a reservation and there was no wait (5 stars just for that!) The interior is very cute and french--everything works well together and the place felt very intimate. I got the salmon tartare appetizer, which was amazing! It was SO good, and it came with a very well-dressed side salad with veggies and even some fruit (i think mango?). For my entree,I got the salmon, which was cooked to perfection with a very crispy layer of skin on top. The restaurant is on the high end of mid-range, and perhaps even a bit pricey, but I thought the food and service warranted the higher price. Definitely would recommend this place and would love to come back.
