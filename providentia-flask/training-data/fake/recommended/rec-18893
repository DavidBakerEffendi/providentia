First things first, everything is relative. You have to consider where you are at and what else you're dealing with.   In Philadelphia, there aren't many good Asian restaurants let alone good Vietnamese food.  Cafe Diem, for instance, does the job if you're craving for some Vietnamese food.   Some people crave chocolate, other ice cream, well I crave Bun Bo Hue.  On my last visit in Philly, my friend took me to Cafe Diem to fulfill this uncontrollable craving.  We ordered the following: 1.  Bun bo hue 2.  Mi bo kho The bun bo was decent. Had good flavor and a healthy portion. I wouldn't say it's the best bun bo I've had but it was pretty good.  The mi bo kho was pretty good too.  It's a family owned business and the lady serving us was really friendly and nice.  They welcomed us with open arms.   Those of you in Philadelphia looking for some good homemade Vietnamese, I'd totally recommend Cafe Diem.
