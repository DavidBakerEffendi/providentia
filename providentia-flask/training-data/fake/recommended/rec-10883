Can't say anything negative, from the second we walked in, nothing but pleasantness. From the bartender to the host/ hostess, to the waitstaff and even the bus staff everyone made us feel right at home. Food was amazing, kale salad was perfect, as were the zucchini blossoms. French fries with curry mayo is incredibly good, striped bass with sweet corn is almost too tasty and the flank steak was cooked just right. Dessert of almond brown butter cake was warm and friendly along with its blueberry compote. Will definitely be back
