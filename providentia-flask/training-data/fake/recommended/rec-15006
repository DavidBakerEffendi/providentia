AMAZING!!! I love this place. I am at the point now that I actually go here more then Cantina. I KNOW, I KNOW, I can't believe I just said that but it's true! The menu has more variety and they have FRIED PICKLES!! Better drink specials too. Cantina will always have a special place in my heart and if I was strictly in the mood for Mexican I would still choose Cantina but if I was undecided and had a bunch a friends with me, El Camino all the way!
