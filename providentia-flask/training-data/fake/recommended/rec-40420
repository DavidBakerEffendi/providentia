Six of us here. Everyone had lukewarm soups. Spiders falling down from the ceiling.  Tempura batter mediocre.  Will not be back. Would not suggest to even try.  Not sure how this place stays open we ate lunch and they maybe had us with 2 additional guest. Service trying the best with the tools their given which isn't much.
