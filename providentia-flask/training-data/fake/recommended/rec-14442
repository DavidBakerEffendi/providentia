Absolute BEST pizza in NYC. I've tried about 20 places so far (supposedly the very best), and although there is great pizza out there, Prince Street Pizza is the best in my opinion. What's great about this place is that they have amazing sicillian-style square slices in addition to the typical round thinner-crust slices. The square slices are just ridiculous, they are PERFECT-tasting. Plus they have speedy "to the point" service and if by some miracle you would find a line, it will advance very fast. I hope this place lasts forever and, hopefully, open a couple of more locations.
