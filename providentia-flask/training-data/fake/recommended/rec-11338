This place was the first restaurant meal for my girlfriend and I after we moved to Philadelphia (and has been our 'go-to' takeout place more than a few times since). We actually came to eat here on a Saturday night because most of the other places to grab a bite during Beer Week were annoyingly busy for walk-in service. We certainly were pleased we ended up here, too. The atmosphere is a bit "different," in that you'll see a random collection of things that will remind you of New Orleans, 70s pornography, Lord of the Rings, Dracula, and a number of other categories, but in a non-obnoxious way. It was fun. The service was good. The waitress seemed sincerely friendly and timely. Now, the food. Wow was it good! I had the crispy chicken sandwich (juicy chicken breast, covered with bacon, guacamole and tomato) and my girlfriend had the burger with herbed goat cheese spread. We were done. Both sandwiches have had us coming back again and again. While the dine-in food is decidedly better, the takeout food is more than adequate, too. DEFINITELY a place to eat if you're in the Northern Liberties area. It won't be as obnoxious as other places (especially along N. 2nd), but will probably be even better.
