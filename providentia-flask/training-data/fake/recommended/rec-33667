This place always seemed bustling when the places around them were quiet so I figured I'd try it out and see why. Decided to stop by on a random Monday night and get a table for 3. Big mistake. NEVER try and go here without a reservation unless you want to eat at 10pm. That said, after 1 hour we scored a table. I was hungry and grumpy and praying this would be worth it. My first bite of the sheep's milk ricotta crostini quelled my fears...it was excellent. A sip of the dry reisling further confirmed I was in for a tasty evening. Let's not skip over the free bread which was a carmelized onion foccacia roll-type item. Very light and oily which meant it was hard to stop eating it. I've been there 2x now and can speak about a few menu items: * Crostini - order any of them, they are all great! * Lamb sliders - excellent * Scallops - excellent. you only get 4 but you are full * Duck - OMG, out of this world * organic spinach - nicely done, not at all soggy or glumpy * kids meal of pasta with butter & cheese ($13!) - not on the menu - done to perfection. Even my fussy toddler loved it. * lemon tart - light and creamy, very very good * mango upside down cake - I dislike mango and yet thought this was delicious * coffee - excellent My only small gripe is that the menu doesn't seem to change often and does not have many non-meat options. There was 1 chicken dish, 2 fish dishes and all the rest contained beef or pork. As for kid-friendly...there's no kids menu but they do have highchairs and were very tolerant of kids in general. I found the waitstaff friendly and attentive, music not so loud that you couldn't hear yourself talk, and lighting high enough that you can see what you are eating. There is a lovely hotel lounge right next door that you can wait in before or after dinner, and the atmosphere is tasteful, upscale casual. Highly recommended for visiting guests, a date or a treat for yourself.
