One of my favorite bars in New York. I don't think I've ever come here and not had a good time. The drinks are delicious (Amelia and ginger smash are personal favorites). The bartenders are all really friendly and hilarious--they're super entertaining to watch Â (especially since several of them are really cute) and talk to. It does get quite crowded and the bar area is very narrow so you will get knocked into if you don't get out of the way. There is also definitely the occasional douchebag, but all in all, those things are definitely worth it to putting up with. The bar is just all around a great time.
