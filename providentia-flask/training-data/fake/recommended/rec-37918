This place is spot on, great pizza, they're doing adventurous stuff so if you're down for some Dominos style, or that stodgy old stuff your grandma makes, stay home, or order Dominos.  Instead they're making exciting pizzas, playing with cool ingredients and knocking it out of the park with service.  We had the greek pizza, with the pistachios, the name escapes me, it's dynamite, they could change the name to that.  We also had the Joey or something to this effect, again, excellent.  We got that mushroom one as well, also great. The service was friendly and funny, she laughed at my still water joke.  Is there a downside to this place? Maybe it's too small, it's on one of the best corners in town for an eatery and it can get jammed.  They do a great job though once they get you seated.
