I've re-typed my review 5 times already because I can't think of anything memorable to recall.  We hit this place kinda early for brunch so we thought hey a grilled cheese sandwich might be cool. Sticker shock...$11 for a small cheese sandwich? And to boot,  I could have wolfed that whole thing down in 2 bites like Kobyashi but I didn't want to embarrass myself.   I literally had to nibble 1/4 inch pieces to keep pace with my table-mates.   I was still very hungry after mowing down the "sandwich" and that cup o'salad.   I like "cool or hip" food and am willing to pay for it.  But this was not worth $11 no matter what golden cow they milked to get this cheese.   I went immediately to McDonald's and got a real meal for under $7.
