Well, I thought the name was a little deceiving.  Definitely not comparable with the best of NYC pizza.  Good enough.  Better than mall pizza for sure.  But quite greasy, without the payoff.  I mean, good NYC pizza is pretty greasy as well but it's so good it seems worth the potential myocardial infarction.  But I didn't feel like risking my life for this pizza.  Good enough for a quite bite but not really as good as I was hoping for.
