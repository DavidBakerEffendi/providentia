I am editing my review. 4 stars for the sound quality in the live venue upstairs. Minus 1 star because the bar can get so damn loud during the more quiet musical acts. 0 stars for food. the food sucks. 1 star for after work beer. But i would go to Kung Fu Necktie if only it was open before 5pm. We'll split the different and say 3 stars.
