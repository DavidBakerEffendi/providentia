Eat-in experience may have been good for a lot of reviewers, but not so for delivery. The one star is given for delivery right on the time requested. All the dishes were lukewarm to cold. The crispy pork was over-salty, tough and flavorless. Couldn't finish it. The basil chicken was insipid and bland, but mercifully not laden with salt. The squid was also bland and the dipping sauce had a weird, chemical aftertaste. The stuffed whole grilled tilapia was the biggest disappointment: tough, almost cold, tasteless; the flesh a dull translucence that indicated not too fresh of a fish, overcooked or sat for too long...ugh. Haven't had a meal so disastrous for so long, we just could not find a single positive thing to say about it. I would say try it and see for yourself, but I would not wish that experience on anyone!
