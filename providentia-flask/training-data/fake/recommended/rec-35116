Delicious! The perfect brunch spot. I'm the person that typically doesn't go above 125th Street, but these 10 blocks North were absolutely worth it!!! I had the French toast with eggs + turkey sausage. The Bellini is perfection. The staff is so warm and welcoming + it's black owned which is always a plus in my book! Happy Eating!
