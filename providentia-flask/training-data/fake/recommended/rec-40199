Delicious, no-frills, Philly BYO.  Perfect date place and also good for larger groups!  The gnocchi is unreal, the servers are always friendly, and Giorgio is a joy. Reasonably priced & relaxed atmosphere. Call for reservations because they're not on OpenTable.   The only negatives are (1) the noise level (it can get really loud in there!) and (2) the wait time.  Because it's a small and charming row house, you frequently have to wait a few minutes for your table even when on time for your reservation.  But, these are minor gripes.  I recommend Giorgio without hesitation!
