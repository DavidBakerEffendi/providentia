Simple great concept, they do one thing and do it great!! Tasty bbq brisket, nice and succulent... and well priced, my only complaint is Â they where out of ribs both times I came in over a couple weeks.. Their home made sauce really rocks and is the amount of taste without to much sweetness. My rating 3.5 cause of the lack of a very popular menu item RIBS... I dont get these places that sell out on items regularly mean success and you should have more in stock = mo $$
