Overall deliciously awesome! Cozy, sexy, and sophisticated environment completed with unique, flavorful dishes and great vino. Can't get much better than this! I am already excited for my next visit back! I went with a friend on a weekend night without a reservation and we waited only for a drink or two at the bar before we were seated. Not sure if I would brave the no res with a larger group however....and now that I think about it, not sure this is an amazing place for a big group....the space was pretty limited and the larger dining tables looked a bit crammed and uncomfortable.
