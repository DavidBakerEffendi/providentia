I wish there was a zero star option. I've only been here twice but it was a terrible experience both times. The servers and the customers are all huge douchebags. So many rude negative people. Not the kind of place where I want kick back and relax. Maybe it's called devils den because this is where devilish douches hang out. Get an attitude adjustment you assholes. We wanted to take a shit on the bar to make sure everyone knows what a shit shop this place is, but it's not worth our time or the effort.
