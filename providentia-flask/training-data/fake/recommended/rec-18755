This place would receive 4.5 stars if they would do something about the noise level.  Seriously, this is a very nice wine bar with a delightful menu, not a loud pub for the 20 something crowd.  I used to love to come here, but I stopped because of the noise.  If you are not sensitive to people screaming over blasting music, then definitely stop by.  All wines are wonderful, as are flat breads, salads, cheese plates, flourless chocolate cake, etc.
