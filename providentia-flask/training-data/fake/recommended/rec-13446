This damn cart is delicious and amazing.  Been several times, drunk and sober, and my sober experience was probably the best because every time I've gone and been drunk I've thought to myself, "I wish I was sober so I could truly appreciate the magic of this halal."   I go with the mixed every time, and I'm not even a lamb person.  But trust, just go with the mixed, it's the best of everything.  The rice is divine.  I always have some leftover and eat it the morning after, it's even good cold! Like others have stated before: careful with the hot sauce!  It's no joke.  That stuff has made me cry before.  Real tears people.  Real tears.  But even then, I was shoving halal down my throat as tears rolled down my face, it's that good. I know there used to be imposter carts but I went a few weekends ago and it seems like the cart across the street is the same people? Have they...expanded? I could have sworn I saw them wheeling foodstuffs back and forth between the two carts, anywho, the second cart had a much shorter line so maybe it's worth checking out.
