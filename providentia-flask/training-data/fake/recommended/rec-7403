I went here to get one of grubstreet's 101 best sandwiches: the pork with spicy meat sauce and provolone plus one of the best desserts according to village voice, the brownie cookie sandwich. Great recommendations. Both were fantastic and very very reasonably priced. If you are planning on going then I don't know if there is such a thing as an off peak period. We went on Saturday night and it was a 2 hour wait for the 3 of us.
