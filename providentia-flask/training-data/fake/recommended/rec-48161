My girlfriend & I decided to escape Manhattan for the 4th of July and selected Chester, VT as the perfect small-town getaway. Having visited Vermont several times for ski trips, I can honestly say that I did not plan on eating any Japanese food during this trip. Surprise, surprise! After spending a night at the Old Town Farm Inn and reading a couple reviews through its website, we had no choice but to give the acclaimed Japanese restaurant a try. I could write a novel about the eating experience I had there, but I will limit my review to a few words: AUTHENTIC, QUALITY, DELICIOUS, and most of all GREAT SERVICE. The ambiance, unusual location, attention to detail, and kind service provide for an unmatched culinary experience. Highly recommended!
