I came here for a friend's birthday. Decor was nice and simple. I liked the outdoor patio in the back of the restaurant. Good thing people living in the apartments near the outdoor patio don't hang their clothes outside their windows. I wouldn't want someone's socks or underwear falling on me. I ordered a medium bacon royale with gruyere cheese. But it came out medium well. From first sight, I was disappointed because I thought it was going to be dry. BUT it was still very juicy surprisingly. The brioche burger bun Â had a nice bite. It complemented the patty very well. It's not your normal soft burger bun. I was going to order onion rings but my friends who got there earlier told me they were too greasy when they had it. Service was great from the waiter to the bar tender. One of the female bartenders really knows her whisky. Plus we had a nice conversation with her. She let us sample the difference between two whiskies. That's probably because we were drinking a lot too.
