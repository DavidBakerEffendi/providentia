this place probably doesn't need another 5 star review. but ippudo is really THAT good. both the food and the ambiance delicious ramen (i got the akamaru ramen) i also tried the tako wasabi (octopus and wasabi) and the tori karaage (fried chicken). both were delicious menu is on the pricey side.. but i would definitely return again. i'll just have to prepare for the long long wait again... i had a yebisu beer at the bar while i waited last time. pretty damn good
