i am not usually a fan of meat but wowowowowieee after seeing this on food network i pesteredy my girlfriend to go and celebrate my new singlehood and it was soooo worth the commute.  she got three sliders(the most memorable was the spicy pork with marinara) i got everything but the kitchen sink with spicy pork balls in pesto sauce and it was so much! for 8$ u get an salad and pickled veggies with a side of broccoli and something that resembles broccoli rabe plus three ginormous meatballs! the pesto sauce was so yum you could really taste all the herbs, garlic and nuts in there,. their mashed potatoes were also delish and we finished it off with their infamous ice cream sandwhich beware this place is packed even on weeknights.  we got there fairly early like around 7ish and were seated right away but as we were eating the line started piling up.  there is only one bathroom because the establishment is tiny. do yourself a favor go get some balls
