Echo-ing the other legions of Sunny and Annie's fans, the Pho #1 sandwich is fantastic!  Although this place is technically a bodega with a sandwich deli inside,  you would think it was a sandwich shop that conveniently sold other bodega-y staples by the reviews. The sandwich: Delicious.  This sandwich isn't kitschy or one of those try-once-to-say-you've-tried it sandwiches.  The flavors work wonderfully, and the execution is spot on.  All of the main flavors of pho are there + the avocado is surprisingly nice.  The roast beef works well as the protein component, and wasn't overly smokey.  The veggies tasted fresh and the bean sprouts added some awesome texture.  I ordered the sandwich warm, and would suggest that you do the same.  Keep in mind, this sandwich can be a bit messy to eat, so I'd suggest sitting down properly, unless you like living life on the edge, in which case, by all means, eat while walking (like me). The store:  Sunny and Annie's looks like a standard bodega, with all the necessities + some fun items like French fruit preserves, pop chips, etc.  The store is clean and the signs clear and well written.  The cashier and sandwich guys were nice and the service in general, was pleasant.  Keep in mind that they do have a $10 credit card minimum, so bring cash. Definitely check out Sunny and Annie's if you're in the mood for a sandwich.  Seeing as how they're just around the corner for me, I'll definitely be back!
