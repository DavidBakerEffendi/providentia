In terms of food, I wonder why places like Olive Garden, Buca di Beppo, and any other generic brands of Italian restaurants exist. I have, hands down, experienced the best pasta I have ever had at Bar Ciccio. Their deliberate and considerate food simply makes me happy. The tagliatelle al pomodoro makes you realize how truly great and beautiful a seemingly simple dish can be. The tomato sauce, so sweet with a nice crisp finish, caresses the beautifully textured pasta. Subtle notes of herb and garlic arouse your taste-buds, leaving them begging for more. The ravioli ricotta e spinaci will make you rethink your life. So often as a diner, I find myself pounding dishes with more salt and covering dull, plain pasta dishes with cheese. This ravioli dish is the perfect marriage between upfront aroma and alluring subtlety that will make you slow down and savor every last morsel. The meatballs, oh the meatballs. Their tenderness, they're flavorful... it seems impossible and improbable that they can be as good as they are and yet, they are. Although they may be smaller in size, they make up for it by gracefully singing a duet of deliciousness that can only be compared to Claudia Mori and Adriano Celentano. The staff is outstanding, friendly and fun, they stand in contrast to the snooty wait and serve staff of other South Village eateries. Bar Ciccio places food before everything. They make high quality, fresh food for very reasonable prices. In Manhattan, if I'm craving Italian, even when I'm not, Bar Ciccio is where I want to be. Â  Fare Scarpetta!
