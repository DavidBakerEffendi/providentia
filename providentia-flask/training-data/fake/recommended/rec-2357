I have never seen a chinese buffet with so many different items. You have American, Italian, Sushi. All included in the price of all you can eat. There is also a Mongolian Grill where you can put together your own variety to be cooked. They even have a good assortment of desserts which is rare these days. I can only take this place once in a blue moon as I tend to get glutonous when I visit here. Very cheap but good quality food.
