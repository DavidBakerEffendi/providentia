My friend and I went here for Philly restaurant week (3 courses for $35), and we try to pick somewhere new each time restaurant week comes around. Delicious beyond belief. I had seafood in a curry peanut sauce for my entree and a peanut butter mouse with a chocolate shell for dessert (can you tell I like peanuts?). My friend had the pork chops with a sweet potato puree on the side, and she loved that as well. I can't remember what my appetizer was. The atmosphere here was intimate and peaceful on a nice little side street in the city. The staff was very polite and friendly. Coffee with dessert came in your own personal french press, which was a treat!! I'd definitely recommend this place if you need a quiet change of pace.
