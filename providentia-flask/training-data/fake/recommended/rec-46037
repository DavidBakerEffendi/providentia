My second restaurant week review, and my opinion has improved! Again there was great service and again I thought the menu had many great options. This time I was much happier with my dishes. I started with the house cured Atlantic salmon, which is a fairly simple dish.  It was somewhat generously salted, but that only encouraged me to eat their bread, which is quite good.  I also enjoyed the slightly briney cucumbers. For my main course I ordered the merluza, which is a white fish served with heirloom tomatoes and faro.  At the tableside, tomato consumme is poured on top.  I really loved this dish. It was light, fragrant, and perfect for summer.  The tomatoes provided a lovely accompanying acidity to the flakey fish and the texture of the faro was on point. There was nothing to complain about. For my dessert, I considered trying the peach cobbler, but I had so enjoyed the basil cream puffs with raspberry sorbet he last time I was here that I wanted to order it again. It did not disappoint. The service here is very warm and the seating area outside is beautiful. Even when it is hot out, the breeze coming off the water and the shade from the building keeps you cool. I think this restaurant has earned a spot on my list of NYC favorites!
