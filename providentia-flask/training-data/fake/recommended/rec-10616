Decent. Went with my brother on a f**king FREEZING night, honestly there are about 100 other places I would have prefered to go, but what the hell, I'll shoot the shit, people watch, play some cheesy games.  Maybe it would have better if it was more than just the two of us. It felt almost like a novelty - Steven Starr does the German Biergarden.  Oh, what a clever restauranteur, just latching onto the next hot thing while simultaneously charging NINE dollars for a Bavarian pretzel served to you on a paper. plate.  Yeah, whatever, I understand it's all drunk munchy food, and quite frankly it is a pretty damn tasty nine dollar pretzel...but paper plates, really?  I'm not drinking out of a Styrofoam cup (although this is a favorite past-time)...don't serve me your decently good German food on a crappy, flimsy plate, it's bullshit, quite frankly. I will go back in the spring, and possible bump up the rating a bit, the outdoor/indoor dilemma is always an interesting one.  Beer pours cold and tasty.  Yummy.  In beer mugs.  Cling, cling.  Nice mix of people.  Zero servers, zero fuss, that also means you do everything yourself - I was feeling lazy, but again, this is another quirk that may appeal to you.
