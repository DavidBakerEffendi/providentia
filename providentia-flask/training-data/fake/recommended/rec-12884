After reading the other reviews I decided I have to try this artichoke pizza while in New York.  I made a special trip to get it and boy am I glad I did!  I got a slice of the artichoke pizza and a Diet Coke.  The guy who was working was cool and friendly.  $6 for pizza and soda and I went on my way.  It is so good!  The crust is thicker than other NY pizzas but I guess it has to be to hold the artichoke goodness.
