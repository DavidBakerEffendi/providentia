I'm writing this strictly as someone who has had breakfast here - breakfast sandwiches and bagels - not the large hungry man sandwiches. I have passed this place for 2 years and its convenience made me stop in. The bagels weren't very fresh; they were hard and tasteless, but the egg sandwich was decent. The place looked super depressing, even with its bright colored signs and sandwich boards. It just had this lonely, dark feel to it. It also had the cooked meat smell; not the one that makes your mouth water, but the one that makes you want to gag. I also think it's very overpriced. We paid $12 for a stale bagel with tasteless veggie cream cheese and a mediocre egg sandwich. Note: they have a cash minimum.
