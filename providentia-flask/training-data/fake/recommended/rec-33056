Ajihei is the best sushi place in Princeton and the surrounding area.  The fish is always fresh.  I love their quirky "rules."  I'm happy that they don't serve large parties as those parties tend to get very loud and obnoxious, especially when you are talking about certain Princeton University students who come out in huge drunken groups.  I also love the fact that there aren't any screaming, out of control kids running around.  The kids that I have seen there are very well behaved, probably because the parents know they won't be allowed to eat there if their kids don't behave.  When I go out to eat, I like to enjoy a quiet dinner, and this restaurant offers just that on top of quality food.  It's a rare thing in this area.  The place is small, but it never feels crowded even when all the tables are full.   The prices are reasonable so I don't know why others have complained about the $20 minimum.  That's not a lot of money for sushi.
