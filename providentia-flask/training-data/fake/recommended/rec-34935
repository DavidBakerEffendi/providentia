This place is fantastic. I've eaten at various Indian restaurants, and I have to say this is without a doubt my favorite. I end up going just about every weekend for the lunch buffet. They have a decent sized assortment of hot food (both vegetarian and non-vegetarian), as well as soups, salad, deserts and tea. My personal favorite would have to be the chicken tikka masala, and lets not forget the freshly made naan, followed by a nice hot cup of tea. More often than not I find the chicken tikka masala that I try at other restaurants to be a bit lacking. However, the blend of spices and balance of ingredients the chefs use at Jyoti are absolutely perfect; the taste, texture and consistency are all generally flawless. The staff is very friendly and professional. They are also extremely attentive, no matter how many people they may be waiting on at any given moment. It's not often that I find a restaurant where I don't have to ask for something at one point or another. Moving on to the atmosphere; the overall ambiance is very nice. It's dimly lit, and nicely decorated. They recently changed the layout of the buffet to create more space for some new deserts that they now offer. All in all, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone I know! Especially the lunch buffet- it's hard to pass up such a great meal for $10.
