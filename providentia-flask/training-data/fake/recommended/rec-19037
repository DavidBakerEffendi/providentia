Very very elegant restaurant in the West Village.  Everything I ate was great. (beet salad with goat cheese, lamb shank, and a chocolate pie) We had a frumpy waitress, but I think she was irriated because we kept on talking with our friends and not ordering.   The reason why I am giving it less stars because I felt we were rushed out of there a little bit.
