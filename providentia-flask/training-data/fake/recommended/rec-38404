My bf and I had been searching for some good soul food since having an amazing po boy sandwich in Colorado when we stumbled on Sandra's. The food was absolutely incredible! We ordered the cajun catfish sandwich, mac and cheese, fried okra, candied yams, and creamy grits- all were delicious.  The free cornbread that comes with your meal is drizzled with warm butter... need I say more? We kept jumping around tasting everything as we couldn't decide which of our choices we loved the most.  And if the food was half as awesome, I would come here for the hospitality alone. All of the people here treat you like family and allow you to taste whatever you like before ordering. Sandra brought us over the oxtail when we mentioned wanting to order it, which was the best I've ever eaten.   Such an amazing find- we'll definitely be regulars here!
