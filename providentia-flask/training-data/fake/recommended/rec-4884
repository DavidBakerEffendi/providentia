2.5 stars. The truth is that this place is no better than the string of other mediocre Thai restaurants in West Philly (ie, Lemon Grass, Pattaya, etc). I started with the Thai Coconut Soup. It wasn't bad, but it lacked the subtle tartness that makes good Tom Kha good. I always judge a Thai place based on the quality of their curries--a fundamental aspect of Thai cuisine. I ordered the Green Curry, and it can be described as a few carrots and broccoli stems floating around in a soup of watered down coconut milk. With tax and tip my bill was $18, and I don't see any reason to go back. As my friend said at the end of our meal: "The search for a half decent Thai restaurant in Philly continues."
