Me and my boyfriend went to the location on S. Orange in Newark. It was fun trying something new, but overall it was disappointing. The space was tiny (2 small tables), the staff was mildly friendly but not very professional, and the flavor was mediocre. We had the curry goat and had to pick through a heap of bones and shards. The serving size (large) was plenty for both of us to share though. And we did really like the Jamaican sodas. A new experience, but not one I'd repeat or recommend.
