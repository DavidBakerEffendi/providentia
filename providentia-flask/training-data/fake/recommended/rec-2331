Seriously, what is the hype about? The cheesesteaks are average (at best) with regular bread, regular meat, and cheese that tastes like processed nacho cheese. On top of that, the guy at the counter is SO RUDE. We sat near the window where guests were ordering, and we probably saw/heard 20 transactions. From these transactions, I gathered the following: 1. He's racist. NOT nice to Asians (even those that speak English PERFECTLY). There are a handful of signs that say "This is America. Speak in English." We asked him what the score was for the Eagles game (the game was playing on a TV right behind him), and he said "I see cheesesteaks, I don't tell people what the scores are." 5 minutes later, a Caucasian guy asked him the same questions, and he told him what the score was. He also gives out pens/souveniers, but not to Asian people. 2. He's rude. One guy asked for mushrooms on his cheesesteak, and he said they didn't have mushrooms. The guest paused for 2 seconds, and the guys goes "so, do you want it or not? yes or no? make a decision? come on come on." There was NO ONE behind this guest waiting to order... I don't know why he was in a hurry. I'll never go back here again!
