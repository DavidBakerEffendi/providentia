I stumbled upon this place while wandering around the city randomly with my friend and her family.  The food was delicious, everything they ordered.  I really loved it and will definitely come back at some point. The drinks were super tasty too which is always a great thing. I have absolutely no complaints about this restaurant. Go check it out.
