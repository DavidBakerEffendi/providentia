My family usually goes to Iberia Peninsula for Portuguese food, so we decided to try something new this time around... thoroughly enjoyed my mariscada in green sauce.  super delicious.  Sangria was superb too and such a steal at only $25/pitcher.   This restaurant will be added to our rotation for sure.
