Delicious and affordable would be the two best words to describe this place. We ordered about a half dozen appetizers to share between two couples, and every last thing was delicious. The grilled octopus though was, by far, the highlight. Perfectly cooked, slightly tender and well seasoned, it was maybe the best grilled octopus I've ever had. Two bottles of wine and a table full of food, and our bill was less than $130 total. We'll be back.
