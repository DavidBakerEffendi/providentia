I ate lunch at Luna Pizza, with my wife, on Saturday, 05/12. It was a beautiful day so we ate outside. Service was prompt and attentive and the restaurant was clean. I had a chicken parm grinder and my wife had a meatball sandwich. The food came out in a timely manner and was hot. The bread was soft, fresh and very good. The piece of chicken in my sandwich was very thin and the sauce was bland. My wife said her meatball sandwich was also bland. Over all the sandwiches were just ok and with the good service, Luna Pizza gets a 3 star.
