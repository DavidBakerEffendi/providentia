Went here for appetizers for my boyfriends birthday. The Calamari was amazingggggg the best I've had! The sesame coating was delicious. I ordered the Truffle devil eggs and we also ordered truffle fries. The appetizers were all very good. The decor was very nice and the staff was very good as well. Next time I return I will have dinner and dessert as well!
