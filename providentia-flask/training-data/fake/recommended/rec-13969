First off, this place is gorgeous.  It's romantic and sexy, but still classy and professional.  You could grab a lunch meeting here or bring a hot date on Friday night.  Or bring a group of friends.  Or do whatever.  Just get here. About the food.  There are no words to describe how fantastic our brussell sprouts were.  Hands down, the best brussies I've ever had.  Perfectly roasted with the sweet flavors of fig and the balancing texture of chopped walnuts. The warm eggplant appetizer was also delicious.  Smokey eggplants with a little tartness of tomato and a hint of tamarind.  So good with the hommus over bread. The lamb chops got rave reviews, as did the lamb kebabs and my lamb makloubeh, which was a gigantic portion.  Pretty much, lamb dishes all around.  Lots of thumbs up. Too full for dessert, we declined the menu.  But the server must have recognized my co-worker, a relative of the executive chef, and brought us a caramelized banana bread pudding that was absolutely divine.  We all tried to be polite and not descend on it like a pack of wolves, but I can tell you now-- we all wanted to. I'm excited to go back for Restaurant Week.  I already know what I'm ordering for dinner: the ilili burger with warm eggplant and moujadara.  Counting the days...
