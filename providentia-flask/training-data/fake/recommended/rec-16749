I really enjoyed Perilla. I got there early so I had a chance to study the wine list a bit. It's a really nice list, especially if you decide to get one of their bottles. I had a glass of the Oregon Pinot Noir '05, was really nice. We ordered the edamame falafel to share which was good. Surprisingly very filling and comes with a lot of falafel so it's a good dish to share but don't spoil your appetite! I also had the squash ginger soup. It was excellent. So tasty and just the right amount of ginger. Very rich too. For my entree I went with the waitresses suggestion and ordered the duck. I don't usually eat duck but it was superb. I had it medium rare. Perfect. Also very heavy but a nice balance with the pomogranite topping. A very interesting combination that definately works. We were all too stuffed for dessert but the check came with a small cookie for each of us which was a nice touch of sweetness to leave out palettes with. The atmosphere was also very enjoyable and felt intimate and warm. I would definately go back!
