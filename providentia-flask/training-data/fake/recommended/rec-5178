This place was a very nice find! The service was excellent, he wasn't over bearing but very friendly and attentive! I had the portobello tower, which was egg-cellent! ;) I was torn between that and many of the French toast options, I would suggest that they offer a French toast sampler as they all sounded well worth the calories. My boyfriend enjoyed his traditional eggs Benedict, which was exactly as he expected! Will come back!!
