They weren't kidding when they said "This out of the way spot". I came from my place in Hell's Kitchen and made the mistake of taking public transportation, 2 trains and a Filthy Dirty Bus later I arrived. Two words if your coming from NYC " ZIP CAR ". Being a fat skinny kid and having a girlfriend with me that eats like a 300 lb linebacker Â I had to order everything on the menu. The Hot Lobster Roll was with out a doubt the best thing about Red Hook and for that matter Brooklyn. You can probably cop a bag in that hood, I suggest doing so and then order everything on the menu. Don't worry about making a mess in the "Dinning Room" because it's a barn next door with a few park benches for tables.( Ghetto Brooklyn Park seating ) I would have given this place a 5 STAR rating but I'm Irish and there was NO BOOZE ! and my cheap ass didn't take a ZIP CAR!
