Came here with a party of 12. We were having a surprise bday dinner it couldnt have gone any better. They let us decorate the place and play our music. (Egyptian music). The food was fantastic and we all had a great time. Total came out to 25 dollars a person for drinks apps and entree. The tip was included (we left 50$ tip. Without even asking they bought out fried pound cake and icecream and even searched the happy birthday song on youtube to play...in Arabic. When the place cleared out the blasted the music and let us have it all to ourselves. Awesome staff awesome food.
