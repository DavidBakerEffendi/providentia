Absolutely my fave spot in K-town. I like the fact that I could mix and match all kinds of Korean cuisines and dishes together. I could be as "creative" as I want in terms of mixing my dish. I also like the wide variety of choices offered in front of me. The quality, of course, is going to be different from an actual sit-down meal. However, they are not bad at all. The menu is also constantly changing. The cashiers have always been really nice during my visits here. They are patient even when there is a super long line. I remember there was a down pour earlier this summer in the city, a lot of people were waiting inside this place who may or may not even be customers here. Still, the restaurant was tolerant enough and let all these people stay in to avoid the rain for awhile. You can always count on this place when you are short on time and don't have time for a sit down meal.
