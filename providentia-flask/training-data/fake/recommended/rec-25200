I was craving a salami sandwich for whatever reason and La Panineria fit the bill perfectly. It's a tiny place with one table and a couple of stools; great if you want a quick and quiet lunch or dinner. I got the Diamant√© panini, which had spicy salami and provolone cheese on a baguette. I added their fig mustard which was outstanding and gave some extra kick. At $10 for a sandwich and drink, it's a little pricey for such a simple sandwich that doesn't load on the toppings but the guys here clearly care about their craft and the quality shows in the ingredients so I'd gladly get my salami fix here again.
