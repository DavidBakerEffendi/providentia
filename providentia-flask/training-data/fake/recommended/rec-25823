I just went here for the first time.  I really wanted to love this place but I thought it was just good.  not excellent but very good.  the pork buns are good but nothing like momofuku's buns.  The ramen I got was extremely rich and salty, nothing that special.  Perhaps I got the wrong dish, I'll def try it again and see whether it lives up to the hype.
