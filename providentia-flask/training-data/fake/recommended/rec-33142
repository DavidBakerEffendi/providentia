Lamb over rice with extra white and hot sauce!!!  This has got to be the best halal food in NYC!!  The line's about a block or 2 long and people patiently wait and some would eat their food right there and then!  I love their food so much that if given the chance, I would eat it every effin day!!  To top it all off, its only $6!!  You can't really beat that, its cheap and delicious!! =)
