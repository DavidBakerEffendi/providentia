Huevos rancheros is the only dish I have ever had at the Yuca Bar. I drink nothing but coffee; I go there just after opening on Monday mornings when there is no one else there. Still, I give it five stars. In my 80 years, I have never had better Huevos Rancheros. On weekends the place is full of young folks having a great time, drinking, eating, checking each other out. Fine. But for me, I like the quiet of a Monday morning. I've lived in the neighborhood since 1971, The Yuca Bar was a Ukrainian greasy spoon called Lesko's but the earth turned and Lesko's fell off, its neighbor, down the street, Odessa stayed on by duplicating itself. For many years there was an old guy who lived year-round on the street. He was known as the mayor of 7th Street. He wore a hat made of untold layers of paper bags. He kept the area around 7th and Avenue A clean of litter. The people who worked at Lesko's fed him outside; don't know where he went to the bathroom. He slept out all winter long in the same clothes he wore in the summer. Sometimes I saw him asleep between a snowbank and a garbage can. He died and one of the funeral parlors on 7th Street took him away.
