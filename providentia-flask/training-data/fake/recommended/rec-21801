Ok, 2 stellar brunches in a row doth a 5-star trend make. Rose Water sometimes has a bit of a wait, and the food is never speedy coming out of the kitchen, but that's what you get when everything us made uber-fresh to order...and when it does come, it's nirvana for the belly. My only complaint is that it's so tough to decide between the fabulous sweet, fruity pancakes and the equally stellar savory dishes such as the fritattas. Solution: go with a larger party and order another dish to split. The real winner this past weekend was the fresh corn cakes with eggs and possibly the tastiest salsa verde ever concocted north of the border.Oh, and grab a side of bacon, becasue brunch isn't complete without it, and theirs is some of the best.
