With the bar being across the street from my apartment I find myself here pretty often.  The wings are great and the beer selection is solid.  It's what a corner bar should be.  There's typically only 1 bartender/server so when it get busy you'll have to wait a while for drinks.  It's definitely worth visiting, try the wings, you won't be disappointed.
