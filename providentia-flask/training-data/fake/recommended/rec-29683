Great restaurant! Our server was great and the food was delicious. We had the three course lunch special for $12.95. I had talapia, delicious. Others in my party had chicken Parmesan, sausage and pepper, all meals were delicious. Lentil soup and minestrone were freshly made. Highly recommend this place!
