Phenomenal- ambiance, food and service. We did the 7 course tasting menu and you def can't go wrong with that- one if us didn't eat meat and hey accommodated it perfectly since the menu is seafood heavy. currant cilantro naan, fluke sashimi, avocado seaweed salad, diver scallops, chicken and veggie lettuce cups, steamed snapper and ice cream. The naan was surprising and unique with the currants and the scallops was heavenly and caramelized perfectly. The lettuce cups had great use of different flavors and the fluke sashimi really was mouthwatering. I appreciated the server introducing each course and actually knowing what it was, and that the chef really knew how to layer unique flavors and ingredients (lily bulb, for example). We started with a round of cocktails, all just as impressive and then when I asked for a glass of sauv Blanc which they don't have our wonderfully charismatic and friendly Aussie server suggested a dry Aussie reisling. I'm typically not a fan but decided everything else they sent us was great so this wouldn't fail, and it didn't. The wine was exactly what I wanted and I was very impressed. He pulled out a Pinot noir suggestion for my sister that was equally as on point. Refreshing to have a server who actually cares about what is on the menu, and capable enough to make those suggestions. Doesn't hurt that he was also one of the nicest servers I've ever had in NYC- just a fun happy guy. The manager, bartender and all the servers were great- seemed to genuinely enjoy working there and what they were serving. We didn't have a reservation but they graciously squeezed us in. You can't go wrong coming here for either a date or dinner with friends.
