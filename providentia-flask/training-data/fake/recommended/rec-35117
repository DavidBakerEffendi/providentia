Food was very mediocre. Had the chicken and biscuits and was not impressed at all. The chicken was very plain tasting and dry. Waitress we had was also rude and nasty. She didn't know the menu and got an attitude with us when we corrected her. There are a thousand places you can go for Saturday brunch better than here. Place is in a great location and is a great space but the food and some of the staff needs fixing. Won't come here again.
