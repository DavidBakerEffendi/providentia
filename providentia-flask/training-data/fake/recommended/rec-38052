I was traveling in the area for work, had an itch for sushi and found this place.  Saw their menu online and their prices looked too good to be true and was a little nervous as to the quality of the food I would be getting.  I got the regular sashimi special, which I think had 20pcs of sushi.  The sushi was fresh and it was a great assortment of fish.  I also got an order of unagi sashimi, which were 3 large, well cooked pieces.  I didn't get anything else, but the it was enough to get me stuffed.  The staff was incredibly friendly, and I loved it so much I came back the next day.  For the food I had, I'd normally pay $10-$20 more than what I paid here.  I'd definitely recommend it!
