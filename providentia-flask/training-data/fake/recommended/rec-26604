Just visited this new spot in Newark.  First I liked the decor and even though it was small, it was well designed.  I ordered a pasta dish and it came in a small bowl.  For the price I really expected a lot more.  Might go back to try out the nepolitano pizza but for the money I think it was not enough food for me.  I will say the staff was very friendly and attentive.  Overall a good experience but a bit pricey for very little food that really didn't impress me.
