Robatayaki, Japanese barbecue basically. At lunch with a few friends, I just wasn't very impressed by the grilled saba mackerel ($22) that I got. I make fish pretty often and didn't think the mackerel blew away anything that I could have made at home. It might have been cooler if I had watched them cook it, but that was not the case. One thing that I really liked about this place was that the menu had about 12 items entrees to choose from. I hate large menus and this was a nice reprieve.
