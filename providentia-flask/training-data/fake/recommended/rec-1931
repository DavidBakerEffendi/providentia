While I was extremely disappointed by Geno's Cheesteak across the street, Pat's Cheesesteak was quite simply the bomb!   In fact, I was so enamored with my sandwich that I went ahead and ordered a second one even though I was completely full.   I figuratively stuffed my face with this bready meat & cheese goodness.   I'm salivating just thinking about it...
