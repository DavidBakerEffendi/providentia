I am as perplexed by all the glowing reviews as I am about the 90 minute wait we had (which we were told was 60). I don't get what is so good about this place. The service left something to be desired. The cinnamon bun was SO dry with hardy any glaze, and the French toast was completely cool. Our food came out so fast, in fact, I wondered if they just made batches of this dish in anticipation of an order. Really bizarre. And the bread tasted stale or something. The silver lining was the BBLT. It was delicious (although how can you mess up a BLT?) The fries, however, were soggy and poorly seasoned. I want to give this place another try (was it just an off morning?), but with my meal so blah and the wait so long...I think I will go elsewhere.
