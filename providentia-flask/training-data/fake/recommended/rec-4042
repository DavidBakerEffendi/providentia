Oh Barboncino, how have I not written about you yet?! Drinks are delicious, staff are extremely attractive but the pizza tops it all. The crust is chewy and tender at the same time. The mozzarella is milky and the tomato sauce is fresh and not too sweet. It's even better the next day, if I have the self control to save a slice for leftovers.
