love this place!  came here for lunch on a Thursday with some friends.  The blue cheese French fries are.to.die.for.  We got a slider sampler of pulled pork sliders and pulled chicken sliders...both were great!  We also got the mac and cheese and that was amazing as well.  I can't wait to come back!
