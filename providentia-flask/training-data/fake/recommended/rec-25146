Very disappointed by the yelp reviews that led me here. I realllllly wanted to like this place but the taquitos and tacos were extremely bland. I was so upset that I brought my date here, raving how it MUST be good. The service was friendly and the ambience was good, but unfortunately I did not finish my food and ended up leaving hungry.
