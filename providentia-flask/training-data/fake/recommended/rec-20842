really wanted to like this place. so much so i gave them a 2nd chance. 1st time the lasagna was hard as a rock & grilled swordfish was so overcooked you had to use a knife to cut it. also the soap dispenser in bathroom was broken & no one could properly wash their hands!!!! owner tried to accomodate us by comping inedible meal. 2nd visit was worse!!!! to begin they fixed the soap problem in bathroom. we never made it to our entrees for the apps were not as ordered. we waited 30 minutes for 2 apps.....quite a long time imho. we ordered the riccota/proscetta crostini & grilled asparagus w/out any salt. they gave us a crostini w/sopprasetta not proscutta & didn't think we'd notice!!! also didn't have the decency to inform us. they served us grilled asparagus full of salt although i specifified no salt. when we tried to return inedible apps, owner scurried by & comped us in a not so gracious way. you see we each had 2 bites of the apps prior to realizing the errors. there are 2 owners & both wait tables. one is friendlier than the other. food orders take incredibly long & are often overcooked. i personally believe they need to retrain their chefs and hire an expeditor for the kitchen. i don't believe they have one. also they need to buy candles from the 21st century that work to enhance table lighting. they need to buy more bread baskets so wait staff doesn't ask for yours prior to even getting meal. also they need to work on their bread making skills for on both visits it was extremely dense & doughy. once they resolve these issues i believe they can succeed.
