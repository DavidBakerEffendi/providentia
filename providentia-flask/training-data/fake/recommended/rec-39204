Visited the truck at the Manayunk Streat Food fest. The Jagerschnitzel was extremely tasty and it was made very well. The coating was crispy and light and the meat was juicy. I was hesitant to order because it required a fork and knife which makes for difficult to eat street food. But I certainly recommend taking a few minutes to find somewhere to sit if you come across this truck.
