An authentic Japanese restaurant some place other than St. Mark's! Awesome sake options.  Great prices.  Overwhelmingly large menu, and always always consistently great food.  I have never been disappointed. Only warning I have, waits for this place can get ridiculous, especially on weekends (not Ippudo ridiculous, but an hour/hour and a half at times).  However though, you can put your cell down on their wait list and they will call you when a table is ready.  So just put your name down, grab a drink around the corner (not at Tonic..) and come back when you're called!  Definitely worth the wait.
