Let's start off with the good. They have an awesome beer selection, a fantastic seasonal tap, and even spiked hot cider in the winter months to warm your bones. The staff is super friendly and courteous and it's always service with a smile. The bar itself is an old beautiful girl, complete with gorgeous wooden rafters. Ok, now the bad. Man, was it packed. I've been there about a dozen times and every time I cannot even begin to look at a seat. They shouldn't be penalized for their success, but wow, it's ridiculous. Secondly the food was very meh, and extremely overpriced for what it was (friggin bar food). There are at least four other bars within 3 blocks that offer this kind of elevated pub grub, but actually do it successfully. All in all it's a great spot, with a somewhat pretentious crowd, great beer, and some seriously overpriced bland food.
