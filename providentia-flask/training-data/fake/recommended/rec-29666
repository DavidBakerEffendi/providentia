I soooooo wanted to love this place after reading all the reviews. It just didn't hit home with us! :( Summary: -Service: excellent- server was attentive, courteous & helpful! -Food: mediocre- Pastas were under seasoned & overcooked... Entrees were Luke-warm, all but the lasagna. **My guess is that all of the rest of the plates.. were sitting at the window before getting to our table. Calamari was chewy, overcooked and again under seasoned. -$$ value: mediocre- Calamari & fried mozzarella= overpriced. Both were just about $13-$15 each... But portions were enough for one person. Entrees were priced fairly so no complaints there! Bottom line: just another spot I'll never remember.
