So we missed breakfast by like 10 mins, so that sucked. And then they wouldn't allow us to order it, so minus a star for that.   Got there at 11:10 am, party of 3, 20 min wait. OK.  Seats opened up at the bar so we snagged em!  Sweet! Place is very small and even when you sit at the bar your chair is constantly being bumped into by someone walking past.  Suggestion: keep your party small like you and one other person, I think eating here with more than 3 or 4 would be a nightmare. We all ordered chicken noodle soup to start.  I liked it, but it wasn't phenomenal it was soup, def can get better chicken noodle soup in the city fo' sho. I finished mine, my other friend ate half of hers, and the other one only ate like 1/5 of hers. I ordered a sandwich that was turkey and cranberries, so I thought. It was more like an oily cranberry vinaigrette that soaked into the spongy ciabatta, but didn't make it any easier to eat.  On the 2nd half of my sandwich I did away with the bread altogether, way too heavy of a bread I think for trying to eat.  My 2 girlfriends did away w/ their bread too and we just picked at the innards to make it easier to eat. So this place didn't score any high acclaims from me, maybe breakfast would've???
