Forget the long wait, forget that they sat us by the bathroom. They moved us once we said, no toilet pls. this was the second tapas restaurant of the night. (My hubs and I are meant to be obese, we just haven't gotten there yet. See my review of Txikito for the first tapas restaurant of the night. you may be shocked or amazed.) 1. Croquetas de jamon - not so much croquettes but nuggets of creamy goodness with the perfect crunch 2. Chorizo al jerez - big time value for money dish, must get, what are you gonna do complain about a whole dish of perfect chorizo? 3. Montadito de crema - most delish pur√©e of fava beans that would make Hannibal Lector proud. I should have gotten more than 2. 4. Fucking blow your brains out, this one is amazing. I would fly my mom here to eat this. Txipirones en su tinta. I love squid ink, this is the perfect combination of fish stock (I think there is shell fish there, they wouldn't reveal more info tho) with soft squid heads - I wouldn't mind some tentacles there though. With a tiny thimble of rice cooked in seafood stock. I think the dish can be served with much more rice cuz the ink is just so damn bomb but they wouldn't even let me buy more. I asked for bread to dip in all the black goodness. Next time, I am getting a mouthful of black ink and taking a picture. 5. My hubs had some anchovies on a toothpick. whatever. I don't care. Squid in ink sauce is all I care about. Our lovely server also recommended a wonderfully complex red wine which was in the high 30 or low 40 range which was perfect. I am PISSED he returned without me since our last visit. I lived in DC for 4 years which is a joke of a town for tapas. ya gotta love new york. tapas actually exist and are what they should be.
