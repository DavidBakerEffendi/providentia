When I first saw this place, I was surprised by how small it was.  It was a typical diner, seating up to (roughly) 15 people.  Once we saw seats open up, my friends and I sat down and waited for a menu. Once the food was in front of us, we now knew why this place got as good of a review as it did.  The food is delicious!  The pancakes are so wonderful and prices are SO cheap!  Never would have I imagined paying only $6.50 for breakfast (a plate of pancakes and a cup of tea) in Manhattan. Most of the people who were there, seemed to know each other.  The servers (total of 3) were very friendly.  However, it was a bit dirty, but nothing too bad.  This was a very quaint and delicious place.  I would come back here again.
