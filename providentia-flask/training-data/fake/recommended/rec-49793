I was in New York from Los Angeles, staying in the area. I found this little gem of a restaurant around the corner and ended up eating there three nights in a row. For someone that's dairy-free and gluten free, but eats fish and chicken, I was surprised about how they could adapt their dishes for me. Â Most of the Som Tum papaya salads we excellent (very spicy so watch what you order). They adapted all the chicken dishes I ordered to steamed or grilled white meat and I was in HEAVEN. So don't be afraid to ask. Excellent green tea as well, take some to go.
