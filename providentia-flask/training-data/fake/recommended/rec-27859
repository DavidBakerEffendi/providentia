Delicate savory well thought out food for the neighborhood . It's smart food. Ingredients put together to make a dish that has a new twist I would say is comfort food a la 2010 The menu changes every so often but the dishes remain in the same great caliber And if they have pot de Creme as dessert, get it! The personnel is friendly and nice the ambience is cozy, dim light, warm atmosphere...also a good place for date night
