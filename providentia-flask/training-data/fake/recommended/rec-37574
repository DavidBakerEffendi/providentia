Tried E Mei for the first time this past Saturday, and we are psyched about how good it was. We love Szechuan food, especially the heat and peppercorn, and this place did not disappoint. Though we like Han Dynasty, the crowds are problematic and an obstacle not worth dealing with, though we do love Han himself. This food was just as exciting but without the hype. We did make sure to explain that we wanted the 'real deal', not some Americanized BS. There was a pretty strong language barrier, but I think our ordering the cold spicy dish of 'beef' and tripe got our message across. Â The Ma Po Tofu was excellent. The service was very attentive and they were very pleasant, wishing us a good evening and inviting us to return soon. We definitely will!
