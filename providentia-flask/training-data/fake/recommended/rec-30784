This place was simple and it was all about the food. My family and I went for their lunch special and it was the best by far in Essex county. Most places that are decent have a lunch buffet but this place does not. However, it is still a lot food. I had the Korma sauce with fish and it came out with rice, lentils and creamed spinach with chickpeas as well as the homemade Naan, dessert...for only $10! Â The dish was flavorful without being too hot. Reminds me of the spots back in the Village in NYC in the nineties! Its BYOB and toddler friendly given that during lunch there were two of them throwing peas everywhere, but that's okay. I have a little one that I would bring here for lunch. I doubt it would work for dinner since its not very big to tolerate a active toddler.
