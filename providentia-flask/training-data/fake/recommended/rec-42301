Ugh, this place is so tasty it's obscene. Awesome beers on tap, friendly staff and EAT THE MEAT! No joke, I usually go for the Kasekraner with cheese inside, but if I want to dump that lovely der kommisauce they have on something it's most definitely the weisswurst. Gives is a nice tangy kick to a relatively mild sausage. I live upstairs, still not sick of the food here. Beer is great here, and their house white wine has something to be said, its quite decent if you're not a big beer drinker. They also have the ONLY proper selection of shnapps I've seen in park slope, they're small pours but still really fun to have for a cheers at the end of your sausage nosh.
