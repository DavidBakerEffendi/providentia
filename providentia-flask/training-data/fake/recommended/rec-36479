This place was amazing!!!!!!!!  A friend and I were visiting from Boston and were in the mood for some good thin crust pizza.  We had both studied in Rome and were in the mood for some pizza from San Calisto (which is in Santa Maria di Trastevere piazza)  YUMMMY!!  We had been shopping all day and decided to try this place out. I love how small it is but actually if you walk further in the back there are a ton more tables.  We ordered a salad with arugula, pecorino, radish and fennel with a light oregano and lemon dressing...AMAZING!  reminded me of salads from Italy (nice and light but tasty)  We were definitely people watching and someone sitting next to us ordered the spaghetti marinara, so we decided to take the plunge and try it out.  We shared it and the tomato sauce was ridiculously good.  Now my mom is from Southern Italy and her sauce is too die for (obviously she's my own but its sooo light and doesn't have too much stuff going on- just plain old fresh tomatoes)  Maybe we came to Rubirosa on a good day but the sauce was great.  We licked the plate dry!! We continued on to the Pizza Magherita which was soooo tasty I didn't want to stop eating.  My friend and I were enjoying every bit and were sad it was slowly diminishing in size...hehe Everything was great here except the waitress was a little off.  Maybe she was having a bad day (which everyone has) so I'm not going to have her ruin the wonderful meal we had.  I am definitely dining here again the next time I'm in NYC. Perfect place for a quick delicious pizza and maybe a bowl of spaghetti!   Buon appetito!
