This seems to be the go-to place for almost every bachelorette party i've been to. (including my own!) its a great place for a group, as all the items on the menu are great for sharing.  And they have really delicious drinks.  I've been to both this location and the atlantic city location.  I've never had a bad experience.  The decor is really cute, and service is great.  Although, i was bummed when they took the fattoush salad off the menu... It was one of my favorites!
