Okay people, I walked in here after a VERY long day of work MEANING: 12 hrs of endlessness. Basically I entered the store front and was greeted by what I assumed was a mother and son combo at the counter. I asked what I should get and was directed (by the 'son' half of this combo) to the pepperoni Sicilian. Unreal. There is, clearly, a reason is one $ gem is still thriving in this Â $$$+ neighborhood. Anyone who passes this place up should be barred from foodie-dom all together! Go! GO NOW! Basically the only thing missing is a buffalo slice.....so, dear Mother/Son....please? Pretty pretty please???
