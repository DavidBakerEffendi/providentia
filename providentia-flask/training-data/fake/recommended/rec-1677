A lot of the reviews are based on the fact that the reviewer doesn't like Geno's stance on Speak English.   Well I ate here so my review is based on that.  It's gwady themed placed and the building is shaped like V.  All outdoor seating only and its open 24/7.  It's a stones throw from Pat's and I bet stones have been thrown. You order on the left side of the building and it's cash only...don't worry there's an ATM directly across from the right side of the building.  The first window is for cheese steak orders.  Plain, with provlone, whiz or American cheese.  You can get onions or not.  The second window is for soda, a full line of Pepsi and Coke products.  I think you also order your fries here.   We went just after a Phillies game and it was packed.  The line to order was about 80+ but it moves fast.  Seating is limited but you can sit on the edge of the basketball court outside of the fenceline. I got the cheese steak with provlone and my boyfriend got it with whiz.  I got the provolone. Gee Zus, they were both great...but I liked the one with whiz better!  Worth the trip, long line and everything else.
