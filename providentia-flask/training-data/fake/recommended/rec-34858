Been there twice so far. I liked the atmosphere alot, but to be honest wasn't too thrilled with the food, until my second time. This time I ordered the salmon , asked to cook it to meduim. It was amazing! really tasty and the sauce and vegis it came with complemented it perfectly. If you go there - take the salmon!
