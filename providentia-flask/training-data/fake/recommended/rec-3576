We were super excited to have dinner with friends at Maharlika when we visited NYC. Being Filipino, we're always on a look out for good Filipino restaurants.  We read great reviews about this restaurant and were ready to try it out.  The place itself is small and intimate.  It had a bar, but at the time it was not offering cocktails d/t pending  alcohol license renewal.  That wasn't going to stop the fun. We were seated in the back near the kitchen. We were able to see the dishes that we were coming out which was cool.  The menu looked good.  It offered your typical Filipino dishes but with a upscale twist.  I had Bangus, garlic fried rice and fried egg. It was pretty and it tasted good. However, I wish the bangus had more meat to it. My husband ordered the chicken and ube waffle dish. That was delish too! Who would've thought UBE waffles!!! The next time we visit, we'll definitely have to order the sigsig! Great restaurant!
