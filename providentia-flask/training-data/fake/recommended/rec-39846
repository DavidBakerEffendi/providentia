BarBossa is one of my favorite places. It's adorable and quaint . I try to score a seat by the window and people watch. Â I've been waited on by the same woman most of the time, and she's always lovely and patient. The food is really vibrant and fresh. Good cocktails. Decent prices. One star off because the cappuccino was a bit watery.
