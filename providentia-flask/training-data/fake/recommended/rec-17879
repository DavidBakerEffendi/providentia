Good stuff and super nice staff.  I came in after a long miserable day, I was not in the best of moods yet this nice lady helped me and was super nice.  I like seeing family run places too, it was a Sat night and she was there with her kids sitting in the restaurant.  :)  Buffulo chicken pizza was delicious so were the regular slices.
