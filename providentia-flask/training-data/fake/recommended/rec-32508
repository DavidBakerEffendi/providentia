The brunch here is wonderful. It's light and tasty and the prix fixe menu for Brunch is pretty reasonable. ($14 for coffee and (a tiny) juice or just a Mimosa). I had the salmon wrapped poached eggs and they were perfect. I am definitely planning on going back. (maybe a bit earlier to avoid the long wait). The only reason I'm giving this place 4/5 is the wait. Yes, the food here is wonderful, but we waited for an hour (we were told an hour and a half) A place with a wait as long as Penelope's should at least offer coffee (that they can add to your bill) while you wait. I've been to plenty of other brunch places that do just that to sate their hungry brunchers. Because honestly, after an hour of waiting you could have put any form of breakfast in front of me and I would have been happy
