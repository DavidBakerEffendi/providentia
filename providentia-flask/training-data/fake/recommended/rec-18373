Despite living in Philly for a long time, I haven't been to this well known to Philadelphians place until this month! Now onto the food! I was lucky to have a friend that was well familiar with the menu and recommended what is best to order. We had the Village burger, tater tots, pickled tomatoes and shrimp. Everything was simply ahhmazing. Just a heads up, the burger is huge and can get messy. If you don't want to get splashed with the juicy goodness, then fork and knife would be best. The patty had a nice smoky flavor complimented by the sauce and toppings. Where do I begin about tater tots? I've had grrrreat tots, but these guys have found a way to make them better *gasp* They are crunchy on the outside and creamy smooth on the inside. Mind you, the crunch is not a mere shell. When you bite into it, you can see the gradient of the crust from outside in. It's a culinary tater tot art. I recommend the pickled tomatoes. The acidity of the tomatoes was a welcome palette refresher. Definitely coming back!
