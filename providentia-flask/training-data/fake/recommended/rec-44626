I LOVE this place!!! It is very clean, modern, bright, right prices, DELICIOUS!!! Everything is made fresh on the spot and can be customized for all you picky eaters out there. I like the thought of getting something for lunch that is actually good for me. They have daily specials as well as lunch deals, which is perfect for all of us who are running out for a quick bite to eat during work. Try the bison burger and their hummus!!!!
