Average for a Halal Cart.  These carts are all over the city and I've had better.  I work near this one and was always curious by the extremely long line (always at least 1/2 a block).  Finally I lined up, and about 30 minutes later ordered a chicken and lamb combo over rice.  The portion was very large, but the taste was nothing special.  You can get the same style of food for the same price at countless carts nearby without a line.   I was most surprised by how slowly they served; they have 4 people working the cart but seemed to only serve about 1 person per minute. I can't help but wonder if they intentionally slow things down to keep a long line and get more folks curious.
