Great quality all around. Great food, service, and atmosphere. Recently opened for lunch which is what we had. Make a reservation for dinner. Our waitress was very friendly and happily gave us suggestions on other places to visit around town. Don't forget to check out the giftshop next door, one of Barbuzzos several sister shops in the hood.
