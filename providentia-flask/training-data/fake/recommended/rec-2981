Great beer, fun games, great ambiance. Â I have never eaten here, but I do enjoy the outdoor area in the fall. The fire pits are great if you enjoy s'more making and drinking with friends. It can get crowded -so use the bar on the back left hand side if it is open. You'll get your drink a lot faster :)
