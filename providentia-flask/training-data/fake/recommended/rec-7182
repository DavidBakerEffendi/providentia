This place is great if you're looking for a gourmet burger. The last time I cam here, I got the truffle burger and it was delicious! However, I thought that it was overly greasy and salty. The oil on the burgers here is insane. I also got the sweet potato fries which were awesome! Love the dipping sauces - they all taste so unique. The wait can get long, so make sure you come during non-rush hour times if you are looking for a seat fast.
