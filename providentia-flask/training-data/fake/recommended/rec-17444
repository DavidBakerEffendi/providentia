Extremely busy and crowded in the evenings, so I've only gone there for lunch.  Great food! The pizza is delicious and the mushroom truffle risotto was exceptional.  I never had a bad experience with their service, in fact the very first time I went there the manager was very pleasant and even had one of the servers run to the liquor store to get a bottle of wine for us so that we didn't have to leave.  They seem very accommodating.
