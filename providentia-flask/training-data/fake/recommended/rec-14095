I came here for brunch recently, and though they were serving plenty of customers during prime Saturday morning brunch hour, the large seating area in the back and adequate waitstaff was able to accommodate the pack.   The food, I have to admit, was fairly unremarkable: my omelette special left me without any major complaints, but with no major raves either.  What's bumping my rating up to 4 stars from 3, however, is the complimentary the complimentary croissants and pains au chocolats. Free pastries in a New York restaurant that doesn't charge $20+ for brunch feel like a giant bonus, and worth coming back for on a hungry morning. Like the food, the service and atmosphere were fine but nothing special.  The french bistro theme, as CAFE D. pointed out, is lost with the giant space in the back and games table, but it's quaint enough and didn't bother me too much. If you're in the neighborhood and want a decent brunch with some free buttery pastries to start with, give it a try, but don't trek across town for this one.
