We wanted to go to Blue Ribbon for brunch, but since the wait was 45 mins, we decided to come here instead.  We were just passing by and the food looked good.   I had the french toast and my fiancee the burger, which was nominated the "best burger in NY" by Tony Magazine.  (What?  Never heard of it.)  That's what the chalkboard inside the restaurant said anyway.  We were both starving, so as the waitresses brought out other people's food we stared at the food and said mmm that looks good - I wish I ordered that.  Eggs benedict looked good, came with a side salad.  So did some sandwich.  Everything looked good. The french toast was decent, it came with carmelized pears and glazed walnuts which added a yummy dessert-like quality and fruity crunch.  It was good but nothing to rave about.  My fiancee said his burger was one of those where the bread is really buttery, but the meat wasn't too juicy or flavorful.  All the taste came from the bread.  It came with lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles on the side, and fries.  The fries were pretty good.  I decided to get a cup of coffee just because the brown sugar cubes and milk set on the counter in front of us looked so delightfully picture perfect.  The coffee itself was good stuff.     The restaurant had a clean, fresh morning ambiance, with sunlight streaming in the windows.  Overall, an ok meal.  Brunch entrees average at about $10, and sides are kind of expensive at $6.  Our meal totaled around $27 or so: french toast, burger, coffee and coke.  Average all around.  Oh yeah we saw A-list 2 celebs and a supermodel having brunch at the table next to us.
