Delicious Vegan Options! I have been to Kyber Pass Pub twice now when visiting Philly, and both times, I have loved the food and the experience of being there.  I am a vegan who normally eats only healthy food, but when I go out with friends, I enjoy going to a place like this that caters to meat-lovers and vegans and everyone in between.  Their prices are reasonable, especially for the quality and quantity of food they serve.   You can tell they care about the quality of ALL the food they serve, including the vegan fare - unlike Campo's Deli, where I recently had the most tasteless mock cheese-steak one can imagine.  Kyber Pass serves a delicious mock pulled-pork sandwich with vegan coleslaw on it.  It is made from seitan, seasoned and prepared correctly so it tastes very similar to actual pulled-pork, which vegans have a right to expect.  On the other hand, Campo's Deli, which makes a great real cheese-steak, doesn't  care about pleasing their vegan customers.  When they served me and a guest the vegan version of this sandwich, it was like eating moist cardboard on dense white bread.  It was tasteless, even with the chunks of undercooked onion and green pepper added, and cost more than $10 with nothing on the side, not even a pickle!  No ambiance either.  That very bad experience made me realize just how special Kyber Pass Pub truly is, so I thought I better tell everyone that I highly recommend it - especially to vegans - and whether one drinks or not.   I am not a drinker, but I am very comfortable in this pub.  They have a great selection of beers for those who enjoy a cold one, but it's more than a pub.  I have been with friends who have ordered different foods and various beers, and all have been very pleased with everything, including the service.  Definitely a great place to try!
