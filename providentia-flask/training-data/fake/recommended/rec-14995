Yay sushi! This place is super good. Everything is fresh and awesome, they also have a lot of vegetarian rolls, even some speciality, fancy rolls which I usually don't get to have! It's fun to be a part of things. Only possible fault would be that the service can be a bit slow, but it's always packed when I go so I can't really be too mad about it, especially since when the food does come it's really exciting and you forget about how long it took...mmmm sushi
