Couldn't leave NY without trying David Chang's highly acclaimed pork buns..  So we came, we ate, and decided it was good.   The pork belly was prepared exactly how you would find it in a Korean dish called Bo Saam, which you can find in alot of Korean restaurants.  It was fatty, tender, and perfectly moist..  Think peking duck wrap but replace it with pork. We also tried the tendon plate and it wasn't very good.  Overally, It was very gelatinous and the only flavor was from the cilantro that they threw on top.  Not recommended! So yeah, while the pork buns are the talk of the town, I think having tried them once is enough.  I'll stick with my tradition Bo Saam, but congrats to Momofuku for doing a great job fusion-ing it!!
