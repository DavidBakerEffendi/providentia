From the outside, you wouldn't even think there was a bar inside. It looked like some sort of antique shop looking at the outside through the front window. When you walk inside you can't help but be in awe at the beauty of the place. It's like a work of art. When I went here in the middle of the week, it wasn't crowded which is what puts me off of places. But we sat at the bar and enjoyed the music and our drinks. FOURSQUARE USERS: - They also have a foursquare newbie special for your first check in "free pint of Lillie's signature beer or glass of wine". It was pretty good, it reminded me of a blue moon. - Also get a free draft beer or glass of wine for every 5th check in. Overall, loved the atmosphere, service was good, gotta love specials, and their prices are decent for the area. Will definitely come out here again.
