The eggplant with garlic sauce is amazing! OK, with that out of the way, everybody raving about the pork soup dumplings is correct. Definitely order some. I will say, though, service was only so-so, it was a little dirty (the first chair I sat in was wet with mystery liquid) and the decor was what I would call casual corporate. In fairness, my wife and I were there pretty close to closing, but we were far from the only people there. I'll have to give them a second chance and come back later to check then out at a different time. But, and I repeat, the eggplant with garlic sauce is amazing!
