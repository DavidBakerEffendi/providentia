we arrived at this interesting place....  very pretty and great decor... the gardens were a nice relaxing walk. although it was cut short by the rain... :0( onto the food.  the appetizers were small portioned but tasty.   the main course , has a lot of faults...  the chicken was poorly cooked and a small portion.  our table came to an agreement that none of the main dishes had flavor.  low on salt and any other spices.   for the prices, i would expect a french dish that actually tastes like french food...   i have had better food and service. any time you have to ask three different people for a place setting,it is not a good sign... i give this place two stars for the dessert and environment....
