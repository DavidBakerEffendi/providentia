Went here for dinner on a Friday night, really nice set up, crowded but not overly so. Had the cold noodles & thai egg rolls for a starter. Cold noodles were excellent. I had the yellow curry with coconut milk for dinner and dinner which was excellent. Generous portions, brought some home. Waitress was prompt and attentive, answered questions easily. Overall a great dinner and lunch spot!
