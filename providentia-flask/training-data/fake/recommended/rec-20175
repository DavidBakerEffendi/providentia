This is one of, if not the best lunch spots in the city. Dozens of different soup options daily. And better yet, they all come with a piece of bread and an apple. An apple. How cute is that? All of the soup is great, but the butternut squash and the lentil are my favorites. Expect to wait in line (outside), but it moves quickly.
