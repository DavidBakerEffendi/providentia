LOL! If you think chipotle or qdoba (or even guacamole) is good, clearly you haven't had a burrito at honest toms. A real amazing piece of food art. I could eat a burrito everyday (pork, steak and yucca, or chicken) from here and be perfectly content. I wish they had a steak without yucca option. DO NOT MISS OUT ON THE BRISKET TACOS. A special once in a while, that is truly one of the most amazing things I've ever had. If they would make a smoked brisket burrito I'd be in heaven.
