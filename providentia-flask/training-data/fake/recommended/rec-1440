Where do I start? Easy enough to find parking at the southwest end of Center City, this beauitful bistro is warm, airy, and spacious-feeling despite its limited seating. We had a table in the middle of the room and it fit four people. Dan was a great server. We started with a dry rose--bottle only cost $38 and that accompanies our apps and soups/salad. The veal and tuna tartare was delicious, and so were the oysters that we samples (with a delicious vinaigrette as an accompaniment). The beet salad, bluefish croquettes, frisee salad, and mushroom soups were all beautifully presented and satisfying. We barely had time for sharing since we were so committed to our selections. We ordered Founders Bolt Cutter (American barleywine, with an English flare) for the entrees. The Ozark pork entree was my choice. Delicious coco beans with generous portions of sausage, succulent pork shoulder, and perfectly crispy pork belly. To die for. The duck breast entree with an accompanied lentils was good too--some good tanginess too. The veal short ribs were succulent as well, fell off the bone, never need to use hands! Crab gnocchi was a hit too. Black and white chocolate cake was awesome and so was the pumpkin cheese cake. The apple pie was passable, but not profound (only flaw of the meal, I thought). Recommended, highly.
