This is your typical but good urban Chinese spot. Where the chicken wings and egg rolls are crispy, the wonton soup has strips of pork and the $1 ice teas in the plastic quart containers are always cold an extra sweet in the fridge. Started ordering from this place in the new year as I read a yelp review stating that this is the only place they order Chinese in Bayonne.  Being that other Chinese places in Bayonne were not good enough to win my loyalty I figured I would give this place a try. I've had the chicken wings, french fries, egg rolls, chicken & broccoli, wonton soup and the shrimp & scallops in a spicy sweet sauce. All were tasty and what I would expect from a good local Chinese place. The scallops though were somewhat gummy.   So far I'm happy. The only fault I see is that they do not accept credit/debit cards.
