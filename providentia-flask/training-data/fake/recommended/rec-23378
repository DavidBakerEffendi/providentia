Disappointing.  Vetri needs to send some trusted friends to have an undercover dinner and report back to him with 100% honesty.  Chef's are usually somewhat arrogant  and don't like criticism but as more and more reviews state--IT AIN"T ALL THAT! Pros: Cozy and rustic interior Good wine list Good grilled octopus and pizza---Good---NOT great. Cons: Server we had was rude, uninterested and just a sourpuss.  She needs to go NOW! Noise level is riduculous---must either repeat everything 4 times or lean across table and food. Menu---such a TEASE! Sounds really good but excluding really just the octopus does not deliver at all. Pasta---WEAK! Soggy, bland-- no distinguishing flavors in either of the Primi's we ordered. Pork dish---hillbilly rustic is more like it.  I am all for simple flavors and dishes but it needs to taste good.  All the dishes were lacking--it was strange and a bummer. Contorni's ( sides) ---seriously? 8/$ for 3/4 c of rsted pots? I didn't see any rosemary anywhere.  Polenta was whatever. Flan dessert--- what we thought would be a flan was actually the dessert du jour of the 90's the always good hot chocolate cake.  That is fine if that was what we ordered----don't mislead people on your menu or give them the heads up that it is not a flan. Prices would have been fine if the food was good but way too much for what we were served. Sad.   Vertri is probably a nice guy and great chef but staff in the kitchen and FOH are falling on the job and bottom line is Vetri's name and reputation suffer for it but he obviously doesn't read reviews or take them seriously.
