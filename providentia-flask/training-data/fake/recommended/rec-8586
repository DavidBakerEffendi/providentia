I had the pad thai for lunch and I really liked it. Very nice portion for $7.50..I was full by the end. And, I usually don't like the texture of peanuts in my pad thai and I forgot to tell the waiter, but they ground it up very nicely, so I could hardly feel the texture. My friend had the salmon teriyaki bento box. It was about $10, but it seemed like a good deal. (except, too many onions with the salmon, but only a minor issue; you don't need to eat them) We were the first ones there, so service was great =). The restaurant was well decorated; I really liked the interior decorations. I was afraid the price was going to be higher when I first walked in and saw the decorations, but the prices were fine. You can get a good meal for around $10 (or even under $10 at lunch). I also noticed the lunch buffet for $8.50 when we walked in, but that started at 11:30am. We got there are 11am. I would definitely go back again and would like to try that next time. As other people said, it is too bad that it's stuck at the corner of a strip mall that no one walks down. That location does not attract too many people, but hopefully one day, Sens will get out there.
