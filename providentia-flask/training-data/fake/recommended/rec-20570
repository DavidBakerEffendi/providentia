The food here is pretty solid.  It's not terrible like a lot of other diners in New Jersey.  At the same time, it's not inspired so don't expect to be wowed.  I can confidently say it's one of the better diners that I have ate at.  Restaurant seemed clean and pretty well maintained.  Service was fast and friendly.  And, the prices weren't crazy although they weren't cheap either.  Perhaps, a little on the high side. So, if you want to have a solid diner experience come here.  You won't be disappointed.  At the same time, don't expect amazing food that will blow you away.  (That's why I can't give this place 5 stars.)
