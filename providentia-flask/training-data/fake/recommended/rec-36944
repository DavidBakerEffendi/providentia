Exquisite wine list, with varieties from around the world including cava....yummy!  We all enjoyed everything from the duck meatballs to the curry chocolate ice cream.   Our server was quiet, but superb.  My water glass remained filled at all times, which is tricky with me since I drink like a fish.  We even tasted our wine, even though we ordered by the glass....I've never seen this before, and appreciated it.   BTW-Harrold is cute.  He didn't ask for my number, but I almost left it on the comment card. A truly enjoyable dining experience...clean private bathrooms approved for tooting.
