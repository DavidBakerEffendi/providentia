Two years ago, this place was featured in the NYC taxis' video system. It looked delicious. Ever since then, it has been on my list of places to visit when I come into town. You can skip it. It's your typical "fancy" take on "American" food. So you've got things like fried chicken and waffles on there. It seems like every hipster restaurant is now offering fried chicken and waffles. We had hushpuppies as an appetizer. They weren't bad, but the hushpuppies at Virgil's are way better. For dinner, I had the trout. It was served on top of grits. How cool.. Er... Hip! The person I was with got the uber trendy chicken and waffles, and she said they were good, but not as good as Roscoe's. I had a bite and agree. I thought it was interesting that the syrup was something slightly different than maple syrup. If you live in Manhattan, that means you are taking the subway and changing trains Â (as I did last night). Is it worth it? No way. This isn't worth leaving manhattan for. If you live in the area, check it out.
