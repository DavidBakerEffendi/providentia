We went this past Saturday. We sat outside. The waitress came over about ten minutes with three glasses of water, there was four of us. She then came back with another. She came back about 10-15 minutes later and asked for the order. Then we sat and waited and waited and waited. We were all done with our water and she never came back for refills. The manager came over and asked how we were and we said fine except we have no drinks or water. He came over and refilled us then the waitress came back and asked if we wanted bread in the meantime. didn't bring it. Our food came then came. I had to ask her for the bread. After that never saw her again. finally after about twenty minutes, we saw her and asked for the check. and guess what! she never came back. I walked up to the hostess and told her to get someone to bring our check. It wasn't even the waitress that brought it out. The manager was outside the whole time and knew we were mad and didn't even address the situation. There was no one inside and a handful of people outside with three of four other waitresses. she wasn't even helping someone else. It was obviously a problem
