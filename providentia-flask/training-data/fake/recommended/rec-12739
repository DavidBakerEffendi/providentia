One of my favorite places in Williamsburg. I came here 3 times, ordered something different everything and enjoyed everything. Â Mochaccino here is delicious. Its already sweetened so dont bother to add sugar like i accidentally did. For crepes, creamy mushroom and chicken is my favorite. You cant go wrong with any crepe that has chrizo or salmon in it. I forgot all the names but i remember they were all good. Dijon mustard penne pasta was also good. Strong mustard taste, just the way i like it. I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a cozy brunch or lunch with friends, family or a date.
