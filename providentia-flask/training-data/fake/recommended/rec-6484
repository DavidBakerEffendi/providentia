Best Thai in the neighborhood. Â Moderate prices and attentive and friendly staff. Having visited Thailand many times I know that this is as close as you can get to honest home-cooked Thai food in Manhattan. Slow cooked 5-spice pork dishes are obscenely delicious. Have tried everything on the menu and only found a few things "meh." Table spacing allows for decent conversation and they often have great beer specials. Took my young 9 and 11 year old nieces in and they loved the less authentically fiery versions of the dishes. Uncle John was a hero. Happy times always, here.
