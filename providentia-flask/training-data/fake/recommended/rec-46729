I've wanted to try this place for awhile. The day I went, I was so excited! Talk about a let down. The food is mediocre and it is covered in sauces to keep you from noticing it. You should always be wary of a place that smothers food, they are trying to cover up quality.   The service is something to be questioned too. I overheard one waiter talking about another waiter, within earshot of patrons, of how hungover she was and how she wasn't helping at all. I also heard the bartender swear, repeatably, while I was waiting for the valet. After the food and experience combined: there is no need to go back.  Too many other choices within walking distance.
