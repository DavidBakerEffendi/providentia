I loved this place.  Yeah, arguably it's nothing special, but I'd love to live near it.  I immediately got the feeling like this was a place I could run into people I know or just sit for a couple hours in the afternoon.   We were there between meal times so only ordered guacamole and drinks, but loved everything. I did have a grapefruit margarita and it was fantastic, but I liked the tamarind more and I suspect the real gems here are down amongst their list of mojitos. The guacamole is the best I've had in New York , which means it's not bad.  Sorry NY, you'll never dazzle Californians with guacamole, chips, and salsa.  But what was great was the portion.  I could make an awesome Saturday lunch just with some chips and guac and a refreshing drink.
