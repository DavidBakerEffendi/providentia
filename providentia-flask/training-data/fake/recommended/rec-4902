Yup, the food is as good as everyone says.  Love the flat bread and bright green olive oil, love the whole fish specials, love the sauteed mussels, love the hummus, love the desserts.  Things I'm not crazy about - the wait (we live nearby and will only go if we can get there by 6 on a weekday), the cramped quarters, the rushed feel you get from the servers occasionally. Hint - if you forget to BYOB, you can pick up something 'to go' at the New Wave across the street.
