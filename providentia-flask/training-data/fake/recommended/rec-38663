Walked in to a 5 minute wait turned 20 minute wait. No big deal. Grabbed a drink at the bar.....I dont know how a coke and a grey goose/cran turned out to be $17?? When we were seated we were given some bread in a neat little sack. I don't know but I was into it. I ordered the Frusta parmigiana and my sister ordered the Bufala pizza. The portions are huge and could def be split between two people. I think the crust could use a little oil and it would be perfect. Otherwise it was all really good. I'd go back.
