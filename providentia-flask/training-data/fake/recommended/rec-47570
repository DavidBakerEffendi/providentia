i really wanted to like beana's because it's so well-decorated and cute inside. plus, the staff is super friendly. the food just wasn't good at all. the salsa tasted awful. seriously, i think the salsa that they sell at the supermarket is ten times better than this salsa. the beans and rice had no taste. my burrito was completely soggy and tasteless. this is after waiting over an hour for my food. i cannot believe how much the food costs based on all of this. i definitely won't be going back.
