The karyoke and the interesting cocktail concoctions are the only things I can review - and both were spot on! The rooms, though expensive are perfectly set up for the fun, singalong kind of karyoke. And the aloe-tinis (thanks to Marissa M.'s suggestion) were to die. I felt healthy while gettin drunk, what can beat that.
