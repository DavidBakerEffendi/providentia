Rouge is the best when the weather is agreeable. Nothing like sitting outside with your girlfriends with a glass of wine with a great view of the square. The food is pleasing to the palette, I am especially fond of the cheese plate. Many times ive just sat here for hours chatting and drinking away. One of the best spots in the city. The inside is pretty swanky and the music is always agreeable.
