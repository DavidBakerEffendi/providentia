I have only been here once many months ago but all I can say is that I had one of the most memorable tofu dishes at this joint. The Sizzling Nyonya Tofu is out of this world! One of the reasons it was so awesome is probably because the dish also has pork and shrimp in it....What can I say...I am not a true vegetarian! Anyway, atmosphere is 3 stars but the 5 star tofu and 4 star roti canai make the experience very worthwhile. And it's cheap...what a combo!
