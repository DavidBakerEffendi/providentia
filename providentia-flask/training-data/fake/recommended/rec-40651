What the space lacks in size, it makes up for in... everything else! Come with a hearty appetite and be prepared to experience delicious comfort food with flair, large portions and a lovable staff. It's probably best to come with a small party to avoid a wait, but even so - it might just be worth the wait. The menu is loaded with familiar breakfast/brunch/lunch items, but always with an approachable twist. While I was so tempted to order the stuffed French toast with guava paste and cream cheese in a coconut dulce de leche with plantains, I actually opted for a little protein and went with the smoked salmon omelet, with cream cheese and scallions. When my food came out I was shocked by the portions - it must have been a 4 egg omelet and the chef was incredibly generous with the cream cheese and salmon, all blending together so smoothly wrapped in the heat of the omelet. The side of home fries - almost caramelized and perfectly crispy. They also had a check-in offer for a free order of french toast, so I thought "Why not?! I'm already in deep here!" Unfortunately, it was a little on the soggy side with an "eggy" taste, so not my fave - but it may have just been an off batch. Either way, a heaping side of french toast as a check-in offer is pretty outstanding. If you're in the area, definitely drop by! Not only did I enjoy my food, but from the looks of things, so was everyone else!
