Hands down the best comfort american soul fat ass food around. Just don't try to get fancy; stick to the classics and you'll be in love in no time. Get the catfish sammie, mac and cheese and spicy fries and see if you can walk a block. I dare you. But hell-all, you'll be back with a smile. The guy who runs it and cooks it is a fine specimen of old school new york, and is a lot of fun to be around. He's also a big supporter of BYOB.
