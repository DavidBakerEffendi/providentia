Trenton Mercer Airport finally opened up a restaurant and bar upstairs.  The food is your typical bar food.  The place was vacant for a long time but since Frontier came back, there was a need to have some kind of food establishment.   If you eat there, the burgers are okay and come with fries.  Not sure of the other items on the menu.  They do have beer and I think they are still working on their liquor license. They have two large screen TVs which will help when you are waiting for a flight or during a delay or for someone who's flying in.   The view of the airport runways is fantastic with a good view of the control tower and businesses across the way.  I heard they used to have weddings up in that space.   They have free wifi as well which is part of the main airport too so you can sit there and check-in, browse or do what you do while waiting around.  Stop by and give them your business. Parking is free outside if you can find an open space.
