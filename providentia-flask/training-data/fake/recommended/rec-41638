My brother recommended the High Note Cafe.  If you arrive prior to 7:00, you don't need a reservation.  Pizza looked great and I will get some next time, even if I have to take it home to the 'Fridge.  Their specials are the best to get, but the regular menu is just fine.  And, get this,  the waiter and waitress sing opera!!!   With live accompaniment on the piano!  Wonderful. It is better to sit in the first room and not up on the veranda (you'll see what I mean).  As for price, I'd say it was reasonable for the quality.  The three of us had two appetizers, three entrees (including two specials which are slightly more expensive), a carafe of wine, and one dessert (which was the cheese cannoli and may have been the best cannoli I have ever had although this will be met with a lot of discussion in South Philly) and the bill with tax was about $110.00. I'd go back anytime.
