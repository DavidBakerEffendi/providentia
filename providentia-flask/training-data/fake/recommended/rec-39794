So as I started writing this review, I instantly thought of Schwarzenegger's description of his post-workout pump "its as satisfying to me as coming is".  Random?? I think not...the first bite of that bo ssam was a total flavor orgasm.  It was a carefully lettuce wrapped combination of sweet crispy skin, tender pork, fresh raw oyster, kimchi, and rice.  My entire party of ten went silent as they each took their first bites into the bo ssam zone.  All I remember was lettuce wrap after lettuce wrap of pure porky deliciousness until all the was left was the bone...I guess it was the shoulder bone?? Ohh and the appetizers?  They were good too.  We got the fried artichokes which were crispy and delicious.  The sichuan beef tendon was tasty and tender; however we all were surprised by the LACK of heat in menu item with the word sichuan in it.  The fried pigs head was served deep fried as if it were a crab cake and although it was good, I felt that portion size was a little small to justify charging $15 bucks.  We also ordered the pork buns, same ones as at the noodle bar and good as usual.  I would definitely go back for more bo ssam...damage done at the end was only ~$40 incl tax and tip.  We had a decent sampling of appetizers and we each ordered one alcoholic beverage.  Small price to pay for such wonderfully delicious pork!
