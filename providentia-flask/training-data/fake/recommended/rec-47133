My absolute favorite brunch place.  They have a great specials menu that is always changing.  And no matter what you get you cant go wrong.  There are excellent sweet and savory dishes, my advice is to share and then you can get both.  And like everyone else said, the french toast is something not to miss. Oh,  and the secret is you can call ahead and put your name on the list.
