Went there almost a year ago with my sister and a friend for "New York" Pizza. it was good! i think my friend ended up eating like 3 slices. The bread was soft and just right amount of sauce. Not good for sitting and eating, but for a quick bite and street food, it's decent. Prices are bit on the higher end though.
