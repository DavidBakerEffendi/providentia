Went to Jones for first time last night with my girlfriend. I'm big fan of other Starr owned spots so I know I'd like this one. Showed up a bit early and was seated about 20 mins prior to my reservations even though place was packed. Took sometime to have someone come take a drink/ food order (only reason not 5 star) but the rum punch and pulled pork sandwich was excellent. Great atmosphere for anyone looking to have a good meal/drinks in a fun setting. Overall nothing made my second guess a visit back to Jones! Must go for any locals or visitors to Philly! I'll be back soon!
