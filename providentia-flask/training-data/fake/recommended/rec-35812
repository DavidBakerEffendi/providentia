If you happen to be in the Philadelphia area you may want to eat at a groovy new restaurant why not try TINTO..... It just opened (Friday 3/16) and we still managed to get a table as a walk in!  (REMEMBER Philly is not SF, you can just walk in and get a decent table without too much of a wait). It is based of the basque region of Spain -- although they take a a few of their own liberties..... One spectacular item among many was the DE PATO under the heading of MONTADITOS -- It was Duck with this amazing black cherry reduction.. in addition to a few aramena cherries on the plate......The service was excellent  -- once we had to remind someone that we were seated! I am going to excuse that since it is a brand new restaurant... Once the server did take our order the rest of the evening was lovely..... If you are ever in Philly, give it a try!
