Another after work dinner night with my kids. Sticky rice, sausage, bamboo soup, laad na and fried banana with chocolate drizzle. All of that food was all for me... lol. Thai ice tea to finish off my dinner. Got embarrassed that I was eating too much and had my food packed to go with extra sticky rice. Food was excellent. Service was great.
