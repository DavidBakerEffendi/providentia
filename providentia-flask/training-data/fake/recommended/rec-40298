Great place to watch a game... Decent food, beer galore. First time at the location by the stadium I had probably the bitchest bar tender ever! I think she might of been pregnant so that makes her the most miserable pregnant person ever! However after we moved down the bar we found a spot with a super nice guy bar tender and the experience was wonderful. I was in the mood for lite beer and I'm not a bud girl... Was happy to know that the miller lites are $2.00 during the game! The crab fries are delicious.. my new obsession is getting the mix... regular crab fries and the sweet crab fries. Oh so yummy.
