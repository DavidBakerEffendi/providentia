Turkish cuisine is rapidly becoming my favorite, and this restaurant serves it beautifully. For Nutley, this place is an extreme and most welcome switch from the ordinary. Comfortable and inviting, with very classy decor and an open home type of feel, this restaurant is located in an almost hidden place on a main street. Wonderful places often turn up where you least expect them. The staff was very accommodating, and the woman who greeted us and took our orders (I assume one of the owners?) was very enthusiastic about the food. She encouraged us to make adventurous selections, explained how we should eat our dishes to experience them properly, and was very welcoming and friendly. It was hard to make a selection...everything on the menu sounded like a must try, and the reviews I read here on yelp made certain items even more tempting. I'll have to return here soon to try some of the dishes that didn't make the initial cut. The halloumi salad is gorgeous, full of color and a great mix or vegetables, and absolutely delicious. Best halloumi ever. The manti (dumplings) are combined with the perfect blend of buttery sauce, yogurt and spice, and as I learned, are best eaten with a spoon to capture all of the flavor. The Turkish bread is artfully served with kalamata olives, olive oil, and a blend of wonderful spices for dipping. The feta filled pastry rolls are perfectly crispy, light, and tangy. All portions were very generous, making this a perfect place to go when you're very hungry (or willing to bring home some tasty leftovers). I look forward to coming back here for more beautifully presented delicious meals and friendly service. Definitely the best restaurant in Nutley.
