Food is not a surprise but dessert is good.  We had a group of 4 and managed to try most of recommended dishes but we ordered everything on the desserts menu. For appetizers and entrée, we had: Wild Mushroom Risotto:  just alrite, no WOW factor. Uni Mushroom Croquette: this is ok I was wondering if they use Campbell (condense mushroom soup) to mix with potatoes and fried for the croquette. Foie gras soba - I love this (the soup is a bit oily but it has a strong foie gras taste and I love foie gras) Baked fish and assorted vegetable - very simple, variety of veggie, broiled with whole fish with basic seasoning oil salt, pepper, anchovy and rosemary. Sashimi rice bowl - not that good. Rice is too hot and top with basic marinated sashimi Washu beef sashimi - this is raw but it has a cook beef taste....interesting. recommended Oyster - terrible We enjoyed the dessert very much: coffee flan, sweet potatoes Cream Brulee, green tea panna cotta, vanilla bean ice cream, organic cantaloupe with ice cream and home make blend coffee.  All of them are good. Overall, the food is ok but the diners are interesting.  This restaurant created privacy for those that may be famous or well know around the city that would like to enjoy a simple meal outside their home.     They have a nice bar and saw some interesting cocktail drink.  Since I'm allergic on alcohol can't comment too much on it.
