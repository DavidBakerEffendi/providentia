Cute venue! The pictures on Yelp make this place seem more casual -- the outdoor picnic table style seating may attribute to that. if you're seated inside, however, you'll find that it's got a more upscale vibe. Definitely would recommend as a place to brunch with family or close friends for casual but intimate occasions. (ie. Mother's Day, Father's Day, etc.) The food did not disappoint either... standard American fare. Both the fried chicken and trout were tasty... I was not shy about cleaning my plate. OH, and our server was gorgeous. Eye candy always helps! ;)
