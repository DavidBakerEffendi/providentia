I love this place! It's become my home away from home. I am in Harlem a lot bug usually on 8th ave but I make a special trip to go here to just say hi and grab a bite to eat. Love the soups and I can't wait to see what the spring and summer holds for this hidden Harlem gem. Say hello to Donna the owner. She's the best!
