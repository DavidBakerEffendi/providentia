Food is great - especially the chicken and waffles. Most waiters are nice, but when getting the mimosa they're not too quick to refill as it's all you can drink. You need to keep asking, which is annoying. One time we went I brought 2 friends to try the chicken and waffles and that's the day the sausage sauce was done and it was not late in the day. Was disappointing as that was the reason we came. Also what annoyed me was that when we walked in and asked if we can be seated by the window the waitress said that those seats are reserved for a larger party and we were seated in a different spot. Then another couple walked in and got seated at one of the tables by the window. Felt pretty insulted as I watched this go down.
