Went there for dinner on a Friday night. We were seated right away but then forgotten by our waitress. The hostess came over to our table after at a minimum of ten minutes and asked if we had been helped yet.  After our response (no) the waitress made her way over to take our drink order.  The manager followed up with an apology that we had to wait.  We ordered the Risotto Potsticks (not so great) and the Nachos as appetizers. If you like melted Velveeta cheese then order the Nachos because that's what you get! The main meal was just so-so.  Friday night is Prime Rib night and I love Prime Rib so I ordered it.  I figured if it was a twice a week special then it must be halfway decent.  Not so.  I ate some but took the rest home.  My two dogs loved it.  The grilled veggies were pretty good.  And then...when it came time to pay the waitress assumed she was getting a $90 tip!  She walked off with the cash and one credit card and put the entire bill on the credit card.  Not a good experience at all. Good luck Red Stone Tavern.
