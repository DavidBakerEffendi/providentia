You know what, I recently revisted this place and remembered how much I like the dark dive-barish feel of this NY Burger institution, one of the only locales in the city where you can order McSorley's light and dark ale (not that I like either too much).  I also appreciate the fact that you get an excellent burger served on a paper plate for a quite affordable price.   One problem is that the fries taste like they've been crisped in a substance that's 97% cooking oil, 3% gasoline.  They had a serious aftertaste, in my opinion.   Also, it absolutely sucks if you go there on a day with a ridiculous line.  It takes all the fun out of it and causes you to resent Corner Bistro.  It is fabulous when you're just strolling past, hungrily looking for a place to munch, and you peek in and notice empty space in front of the bar and realize you can waltz right in and sit at a table without the obnoxious tourist masses cramping your style.  It's also a succulent late night option since it's open til... 2 or 3? Now I forget... but it's pretty late.
