Back for round two at Osteria, and it was just as wonderful as my first experience! An absolute treat. We started with the Parma pizza (again) - arugula, prosciutto, and fresh shaved Parmesan drizzled in olive oil. So darn good, and the prosciutto really made it spectacular being so fresh! For dinner I had the polenta gnocchini with mushrooms and Parmesan as well, so good and a very unique take on gnocchi! A little softer than traditional gnocchi, and definitely the polenta taste, it was so good. Once again their wine (and champagne - special occasion!) list was out of this world and they are so happy to accommodate you and allow you to taste a wine if you are unsure. I had the boudino for dessert which was really special and I absolutely loved it, it was just the perfect little size for a sweet treat to complete another glorious meal. Who wants to take me back next time? So many more things I want to try!
