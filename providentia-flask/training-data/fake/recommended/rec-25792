You know when you think of NY's best restaurants you think of flashy lights, beautiful people, and sexy dishes made by a celebrity chef in a restaurant with a breath-taking view of Manhattan?  Well this place is the opposite of that.  This restaurant is like the girl that doesn't know she is smoking hot. This small, hole in the wall, mom & pop restaurant sits on an ugly street in China town.  When you walk in the front door, you hope you are in the wrong place.  People have crammed into the 10 tables and a tiny Chinese woman runs around taking orders. Once your food arrives however, you instantly love the cook like she is the Chinese grandmother you never had.  Steamy noodle dishes, sloppy and drippy down your chin, plump dumplings packed tight with flavor - food and beer for two for $25.  This is my favorite hidden New York gem.
