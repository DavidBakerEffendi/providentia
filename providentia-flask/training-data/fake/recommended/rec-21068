it's really hard to find good sushi in the Allwood area of Clifton. It's either crappy sushi done by people that don't know what they are doing or done by Koreans/Chinese that are pretending to be Japanese. Which could pass for sushi for people that live around here. This is the real deal. They are Japanese. They plate very well and the food is fresh, cool and tastes great. It's a bit of a small place and they are gaining popularity because of their 50% off sushi menu and it's good sushi, so it can get crowded on a weekend. I wish they would change the cups that they put hot tea into because it needs a handle so I don't burn my hand. This is probably the best you can get around here. You have to go to Manhattan for the best of the best sushi. Clifton doesn't cut it for me. This place is better than Osaka sushi which is run by koreans that make kimbap more than sushi and better than Aki Sushi which looks nice, but served me warm sushi with old hard rice AKA crap. I eat here whenever I am in the mood for a sushi dinner and I can't get to the city.
