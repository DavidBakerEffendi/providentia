Well...the establishment should have a sign out that says " Non-Serbians need not come in"... The service staff was annoyed and not so interested in our modest table of 4...The water glasses were left us begging for water...The food was very problematic; completely raw Pork Chop and ice cold stuffed peppers sitting in a bowl of runoff from overheating. Â But, those at other tables speaking the language were fawned over like family...It is beyond me that this place is well Yelp rated and Zagat rated too.
