I have to say that other than one other place, this is one of my favorite places to eat brunch.  Located down a smaller street, they have a nice set up.  Small, but it works toward the appeal.  Fresh Orange juice is on point, and the French toast is really good here with mixed berries.  My friend got the banana split, and he made that disappear really fast.  The service is great too.  Perfect for a nice Saturday or Sunday morning.  Make sure that when you go, your whole party is there. They will not seat you otherwise.  But the hostess Jennifer is really patient.  Only reason 4 stars is because its a fairly long wait, but it is worth it.
