I really liked Terroir. Great wine selection -- and their list makes for fun reading. They had offered a Bobal by the glass --  Bodegas y Viñedos Ponce "La Casilla" Manchuela...and a lot of other wines that impressed, not for the name or stature, but you could tell it was a carefully crafted list by people that knew their wine and loved it as well. Pours were also generous Staff was also very knowledgeable as well as attentive and friendly. I also liked the atmosphere -- it was a very nice space with great wine and food, but it was in no way pretentious. Food was excellent as well. The meatball sandwich was delicious as were the beet and gorgonzola risotto balls.... Great experience. Will return.
