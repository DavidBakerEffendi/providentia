I met a client in Hartford and we decided on lunch at Bear's BBQ. I drove around the block looking for parking and finally decided to park on the street. The fancy new parking meters are a pain to use -- avoid them if possible! But enough on parking... on to the food! When we walked in, the wonderful aroma of smoked meats got our attention right away. I ordered the brisket without sauce (hard core) and my lunch partner ordered burnt ends.Both were excellent! Â I thought burnt ends would be crispy burned ends (I've eaten in dives before!). We shared lunches and the burnt ends were delicious. Tender, moist, and probably will be my menu item of choice next time. My brisket was also tasty. Very tender and obviously slowly cooked in a smoker to get that flavor that made me glad I ordered it without the sauce. The staff was excellent and one overheard me grumbling that the parking meters required me to go back to my car to write down my license number. The staff person asked why I didn't park in the garage and get a validated ticket. Doh, nothing I had seen indicated that to be an option. Make that less of a secret and this foodie haven becomes a five star bonanza.
