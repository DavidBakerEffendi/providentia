We've been looking forward to dining here since this restaurant got "best burger in state NY" rating on some website.  We had a reservation, so we were seated quickly and no problems. Problems appeared when our waiter Christopher who looked exactly like George Zimmer from Men's Warehouse approached us to take our order. My husband asked for a glass of Cabernet to start, we orders a salad and speciafically asked for two burgers  - their signature Black Burger ($26) and Minneta Burger ($19) just so we can try both and compare. Our salads arrived promptly, wine never showed up. After we finished our salads it took 45 min for our burgers to come. Considering that almost everyone in the restaurant ordered these burgers, I still don't understand what took so long. A couple seated about 20 min after us finished their meal before we got out main course. I was loosing my patience when our burgers arrived looking suspiciously similar. We decided that the difference was the meat quality so we spend 10 min comparing these burgers side to side to learn later that he just decided to order us same dishes  - so they were two Black Label Burgers. I felt like an idiot. When we pointed it out to Christopher he just shrugged it off without an apology. So technically he screwed up our order twice  - no wine and wrong burger. No apology. We paid the bill and left disappointed -  a combo of long unjustified wait (they werent that busy btw) and screwed up orders.  It's a shame because burger was rather good. This guy is just an ignorant ass. My husband still left him a tip even though I asked not to.
