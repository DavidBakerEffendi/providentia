completely overpriced.  interestingly-assembled foods, but that's about it.  3 tiny un-authentic pork buns for $15 that you could buy from a dimsum place for $3?  microwaved wontons from the frozen section of a chinese grocery store for $12?  food that requires hardly any cooking, just a little assembly (see the kitchen)?  no thank you.  overall, it was a very expensive and sometimes uncomfortable experience.  not good for dates, large groups of people, people who enjoy being full, and people who appreciate quality food.  i am very surprised by all the rave reviews!
