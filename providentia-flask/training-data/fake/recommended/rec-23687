I have been going to Sahara Grill for the past 4 years and have enjoyed each experience.  The food is consistently good, although I have to admit that I get one of the kabob platters (usually the lamb) every time.  I keep saying that I'm going to branch out and try some of the other items, but when I get there, I just crave the lamb kabobs too much! The atmosphere is casual, but I've never had problems having a conversation in there.  I love little byobs, but they tend to be kind of loud for me sometimes.  Maybe it's the acoustics, but I've never had that problem at Sahara. The service is terrific.  The wait staff, while being small, is incredibly efficient.  There is a guy who I think is either the owner or manager who helps when things get busy.  If Sahara isn't a family business, it sure runs like one; everybody seems to just help out where they are needed. It seems to me that business for them has gotten better and better over the past few years.  I hope that's true!  They certainly deserve it.
