New ground up building remarkable mood lighting, very chic relaxing decor & comfortable furnishings surrounded in creative architecture to create Hartford's best upscale lounge space. Service is still spotty at times however they will work this out and provide over-the-top service here in the near future. Each service mis-step was corrected by management in a swift manner with first class flair. Tuna tacos are truly amazing some of the best ever. Â I ordered the filet, which was tender, tasty & well seasoned with fresh crisp steamed veggies. Restrooms were clean and neat. Pricing was above average. Bar scene is quite lively as the evening progresses. Bar seating is plentiful with flatscreen televisions
