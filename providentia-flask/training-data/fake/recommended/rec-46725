Went there for the first time as I had purchased a coupon through Living Social. What a pleasant surprise. Food was delicious!  The service was very good, attentive and the place was pretty crowded for a Thursday night. Tried an appetizer - Lobster-avocado quesadilla, salad - ENSALADA DE REMOLACHA, entree -Grilled Skirt Steak and Black Paella and dessert - Tres Leches.  Everything was really tasty. Will def return to try other dishes and the great drink menu.
