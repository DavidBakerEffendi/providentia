Love this place for so many different occasions.  The first time I visited, a group of friends and I sat for dinner.  The service was great, including recommendations for items to share.  And the drinks were creative, delicious and well liquored.  Prices are similar to other mid-town village restaurants so this was not a surprise.  The occasion was as cheerful as the colored tile in the decor! My most recent visit involved only a friend and me.  So we opted for a seat at the bar.  The three friendly bartender(ess)s rotated their attentions to us so we were served quickly.  I tried a blueberry caipirinha (sans simple sugar) which is now my favorite drink.   I have long been a cachaca fan, but the combo with muddled blueberries...spectacular.  If that wasn't the best, the guacamole with pistachios and goat cheese just made me the happiest gal in the world.  The flavor combos here are wonderful and I always find a new treat to add to my favorites list.
