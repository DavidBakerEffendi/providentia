Cheryl's is our go to spot for neighborhood brunches --- it can get busy so be prepared to wait a bit but the food is FANTASTIC, especially the french toast. And its very reasonable because brunch includes tea or coffee and a mimosa or bloody mary with the meal. Cheryl is warm and hospitable to everyone that comes through her doors and its got that good cozy bustling neighborhood vibe. Also portions are a good size, not skimpy like with some uber fancy brunch places. We have also eaten here for dinner and the food is consistently tasty. There don't tend to be lines for dinner, and I would definitely recommend doing both meals there.
