You can eat Fresh GLUTEN FREE Breakfast and lunch dishes. I had my first GF Grilled cheese with Bacon sandwich for Lunch then went back the next morning for a 3 piece French Toast Breakfast made from fresh GF brown rice, tapioca and corn grains. Actually tasted fresh, light and fluffy with a very easy crispness. I took my time eating to enjoy the fresh flavors of each dish. The staff and owner are friendly and enjoy what they are doing. Tastes great and you will smile here. Jim from Dallas, Texas
