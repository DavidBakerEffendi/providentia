The place is amazing. There is a reason why the place is always busy. Clearly one of the best values in NYC you get so much more than you pay for in the typical city establishment. While the mixed drinks will shock the tourist at $12, the bottles of wine are all $25 and you will never need the reserve list to find an amazing vino. My all time favorite is the stuffed peppers but many get the pasta special - 3 types that chance daily and are all you can eat. Enjoy!
