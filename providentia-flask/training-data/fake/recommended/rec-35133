Went here this morning with a friend. I liked the casual vibe because we wanted to eat and talk. So, for us the service wasn't too slow. The staff was very friendly and seemed to take pride in the place, which is a plus. Â  The food was good - attractive, home made style. I appreciated the juicy, turkey sausage and griddle cakes with yogurt and bananas. My scrambled eggs had a little cheese in them which I didn't expect but really enjoyed. My companion also enjoyed her griddle cakes and turkey bacon. Ohh, also liked the touch of warm milk to go with my coffee. All in all, we had a relaxing, delicious afternoon. I recommend it and hope to go there again.
