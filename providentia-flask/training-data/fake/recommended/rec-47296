Simply stated this place is way over rated. The experience from the minute we walked up was a negative one driven by the obnoxious host who ended up waiting by our table pressuring us to leave so he could sit two friends who were only there to have a drink, not dinner. Â Keep in mind we were only there :40 min at that point. My cod was over cooked and only luke warm by the time it hit my table. At least our server and the bartender were very nice, but for the wait and attitude you may potentially have to deal with my advice is to keep walking.
