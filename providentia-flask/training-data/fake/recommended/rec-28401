I thought the sandwiches were quite excellent. Lots of selections, and at very good prices. The atmosphere inside is quaint, cafeish, but not in a bad way. There's also a lot of delicious looking cupcakey things in the case inside. I didn't have any, but how could they be bad? I had to take some stars away because the service was fairly poor. They forgot to bring one of our Crostinis and the sandwiches came out in staggered waves. but I enjoyed my sandwich enough that I would definitely go back again. Â and just hope the service is a bit better.
