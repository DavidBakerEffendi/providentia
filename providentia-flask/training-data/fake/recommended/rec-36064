I have been here a ton of times and almost every time I leave with a belly full of sushi! The first time I came I had the vegetable terayaki. It was only $7 and it was delicious! It also came with a salad that has a carrot dressing and even came with a cup of miso soup. Not a bad deal at all. But then I got the 2 roll sushi special!! I was hooked! I love sushi and it's only $8.75. And the sushi came with the salad and soup top. I love getting the spicy shrimp and crab roll and the salmon roll. Â Last time I threw them a curve ball and got two rolls of salmon with avocado! I was one happy camper! And then the other week, my co worker and I got the bento box for $9.50! I couldn't believe my eyes! Shumai, spring roll, salad, house noodles and then you had options for the last portion of teriyaki, california roll, sashimi, sushi roll or tempura. I went for the salmon/avocado roll. I was stuffed like a Thanksgiving turkey. I even had to leave some noodles. Sad! I think next time I will go for the sashimi. So good.
