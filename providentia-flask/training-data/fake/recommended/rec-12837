Momofuku ssam didn't quite live up to my expectations on my trip up to New York. While this is the more casual of David Chang's restaurants, nothing seemed to blow me away like I expected, though we only got to try 2 dishes. The much praised pork buns were fall apart tender, but lacked flavor. The fried duck dumplings were good overall with the snap peas and nuoc mam giving it a pleasant freshness, but it didn't need the dipping sauce in my opinion. Overall, I did enjoy the food, and I'd be excited to go back and try Mr. Chang's multitude of other restaurants.
