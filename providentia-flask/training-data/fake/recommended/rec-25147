I moved from San Diego to New York, and this is precisely what a taqueria should be; hole-in-the-wall not expensive and amazing! I'm not a huge pork person but I had a taste of the al pastor and carnitas and wow so good. The chicken is juicy and delicious. The nachos are fantastic and could feed a family of four. This is probably the best tacos your going to get in the city and what ever you get load it up. The guac and sour cream make the taco.
