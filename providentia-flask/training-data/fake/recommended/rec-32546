As a longtime patron of Chipotle it was hard to set aside bias when I first tried Dos Toros Taqueria, but I was really impressed. I had the Pollo Asado (grilled chicken) bowl and what struck me was how fresh and flavorful the food was for the price ($8.50). I would definitely go here if I'm looking for a quick bite to eat.
