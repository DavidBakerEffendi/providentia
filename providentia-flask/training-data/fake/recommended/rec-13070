I've traveled approximately 2800 miles just to try a bowl of Ippudo ramen - and it was the best ramen I ever had, period. Sure, there are other ramen stores in Southern California that have just as good of broth, noodle texture, and chashu pork, BUT I couldn't find a store that has the best of everything (broth, noodle, and chashu pork) in one bowl. Until I came here. There was a longgggg waiting line, but luckily one of our friend waited in line before the store even opened (the store opened at 5 PM). As opposed to the Totto Ramen (another popular ramen place in NYC), Ippudo has a much larger dining space and classier dining environment. We actually had to wait for a bit for our food, but it was worth the wait. Hirata Buns Pork ($9) - I can eat one of these buns for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Buns were soft and pork belly were seared perfectly. Â  Akamaru Modern ($15) with Niku ($3), Nitamago (seasoned salt boiled egg, $2), Bakudan (spicy paste, $2), and Kakuni (braised pork belly, $4) toppings - Basically it's tonkotsu (pork) broth with "Umami Dama" miso paste, chashu pork, cabbage, sesame kikurage mushrooms, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil. Perfect broth, perfect chashu pork, and above average noodle. Broth was very flavorful and it has a great aftertaste. Chashu pork was amazing - meaty part was flavorful and fatty part just melted in my mouth. Although I personally preferred thicker noodle, the texture of noodle was still great. I got a ramen-orgasm from eating here - the ramen was simply too good. A must come place for ramen-lovers.
