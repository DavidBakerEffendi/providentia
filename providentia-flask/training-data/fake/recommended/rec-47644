Great place to go for a casual dinner.  Burgers and Beer is what keeps me going back again and again.  The beer selection is amazing and changes every time I go.  I recommend the lamb burger and upgrade to the truffle fries, you will not be disappointed.  Service has been great every time I have been there.
