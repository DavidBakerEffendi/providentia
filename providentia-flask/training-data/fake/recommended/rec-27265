We were quite lucky as they dont take reservations for parties of 7or less, we got a table within 5 minutes and the couple right behind us got a waiting time of :45 minutes, and this was relatively early @7:30pm on a friday evening. Â I had a winter meal on a super hot summer day and still enjoyed it but the Habanero Grapefruit Margarita was the highlight of my meal. Not for the faint at heart. My hubby had the fish tacos and probably expected the fish to be breaded and fried but they were lightly grilled and healthier. They were delish too. We did not try dessert since we made a beeline to Big Gay Ice Cream afterwards. The place is definitely loud. Great for a first date so there are no awkward silences.
