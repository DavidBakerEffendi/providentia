THIS PLACE IS RIDICULOUS. YOU SHOULD SUE. You can get better chicaron at Manila Oriental or Pacific Super. What is there to "halo" in the Halo-Halo? ..its basically milk & ice! Also, the waiters/waitresses don't have any knowledge as to what filipino food really is. At lastly, the plates look like it's from chinatown which doesn't make the food any more appealing.
