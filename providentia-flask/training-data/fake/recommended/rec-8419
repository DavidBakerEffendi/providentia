Peaches Hot House is the smaller version of Peaches, but I went to this location first. The wait on the weekends for brunch is about 30-45 mins because the space is small and they have maybe 2 waiters at most. The food is pretty good, especially the granola crusted french toast - that's what I always order, with a side of fries. The drinks are strong and they usually have specials, so plan ahead and have a good meal.
