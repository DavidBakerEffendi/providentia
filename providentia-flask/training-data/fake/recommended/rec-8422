Unbelievable London quality Indian, Eureka!! I live in Manhattan, have eaten at all the places on 6th street, 58th street, plus the other high end places like Tamarind. Nothing compares to Gandhi. Incredibly fresh ingredients, subtle flavors, perfect execution and attention to detail. Well worth the trip to Brooklyn. I begged them to open another location in Manhattan, to show the rest how it's done properly.
