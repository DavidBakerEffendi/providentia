This place is awesome. I give it five stars because it exceeded my expectations all-around, in terms of decor, quality of food, service and price. A lot of people, myself included, don't mind going to run-down spots to eat good food (read: Punjabi Diner on 21st Street), but this place is NOT one of those. Every detail in the place has been thought out, from the tiles to the metal plate on which food is served-yet they still managed to convey a comfy feel. I should also mention that a black board lists the farms from where the meat comes. In an age where people are quick to label stuff "organic" without even knowing what the word means, it was nice to see that a restaurant owner cares about accountability. I was fortunate enough to be accompanied by my boyfriend and his daughter, which allowed me to taste not only my 50/50 sandwich, but my boyfriend's burger (although I forget the name) and his daughter's turkey burger. My sandwich was simple and delicious. The meat was so tasty, it didn't need anything else but the bun. My boyfriend's burger was some kind of meat that has bacon pieces buried inside and it was equally delicious. Finally, his daughter's turkey burger was out-of-this-world. I generally try to eat healthy and often opt for turkey meat rather than beef but am sometimes disappointed to be served dry turkey meat. This burger was anything but-it was juicy and tasty. All in all, this food rocks and although you may not be eating the healthiest food in the world, you certainly feel like it since it's fresh and simple. Lastly, I just want to mention the service. Everyone at Butcher Bar was super-friendly and also conveyed their excitement at being a part of this place. I love people who are passionate about good food and these people clearly are. I'm also not a fan of the overbearing waitress, but this place didn't have that-just staff that wanted to see that we were satisfied-and that we were!
