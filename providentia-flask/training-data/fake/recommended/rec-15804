I've been here a couple of times at least. I love this little hipster place. Their sandwiches are actually pretty good and they have a neat wine selection. Today we went there at 4 and ordered a glass of wine each (its weekend and wine is allowed at 4pm :)) The waitress told us that it is officially happy hour and the bottle of wines are half priced (glass of Malbec wine $9, bottle of Malbec $36 regular, half price $18) and since it was my friend's birthday, she did not tax us on the bottle. That was really nice of her to let us know and we had 3 glasses each instead of a glass for the same price.Just for that, I'll give them 5 stars!
