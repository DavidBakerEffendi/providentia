Warning: Serious Frites fan Having been to Belgium, I can CONFIDENTLY say that these fries are not "authentic Belgian fries" as they are too overcooked, too thick and too dark to be so!!!! Belgian fries have a light yellow colour and are the regular French-fry size or even smaller. The only thing 'Belgian' about them is that they come with the original frites sauce (the mayo), and they're wrapped in a paper cone, as they are served in Belgium. With that said, the "pomme frites" still taste pretty good and the amount of sauce you get is great. The portions of the frites in general were large-- the regular size was more than sufficient for one person. The line up was pretty long, and it was hot in there. We decided to eat them inside, which was probably a bad idea because I smelled like frites for rest of the night. The tables even have little holes where you can put your frites. Smart. Note: no bathroom. Great customer service though, the "pomme chef" was HARD at work.
