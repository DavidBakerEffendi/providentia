I had a lot of hope after having the salad with delicious fresh mozzarella and balsamic grilled Portobello and the cheese ravioli, which were absolutely perfect in a mushroom sauce like I've never had before.  That's unfortunately where my good experience with their food ended.  I was preparing myself for over-indulging in Brazilian rodizio, but what I was given was disappointing to say the least.   This is an Italian restaurant that should stick to Italian food.  The meat given for the "Brazilian" rodizio was overly salty and offered to my party under names like "American steak"...?...but I came for the Brazilian food.  In addition, many options were wrapped in poorly cooked bacon, it was all just bad and confusing. The waiter, however, was very sweet and tried very hard to make us happy, and I do hope we were nice enough to him as I tried not to take my dislike for the meal out on him. Long story over...would go back for the ravioli but NEVER AGAIN FOR THE "RODIZIO"
