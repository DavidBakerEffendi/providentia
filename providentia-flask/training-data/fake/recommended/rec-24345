Recommends: Sandwiches! Ordered: Sliced Granny Smith Apple with Turkey, Brie & Raspberry Mustard Sandwhich, Egg Sandwich with Cheese on a Croissant, Latte, Sweet Potato Fries Spent: $9.75 for the Sliced Granny Smith Apple with Turkey, Brie & Raspberry Mustard Sandwich; $7.95 for the Egg Sandwhich with Cheese on a Croissant, $3.50 for Sweet Potato Fries This was one of the places that has redeemed itself after many years. I've been to the Grey Dog in Union Square a number of times and was unimpressed both times. Personally thought it was overpriced for whatever health friendly meal I ended up purchasing. However, after graduating and succumbing myself to the reality of New York City brunch prices, I was extremely satisfied after my recent less-than-$15 brunch at the new Chelsea location. More spacious, though equally low-lighted, than it's sister, this Grey dog has an efficient method of moving the long line (yes, we should not be surprised by now) through, served, and leaving happy. Also a shoutout to their diverse, well packed menu, with interesting items in great typography. One of the best things I appreciate is the portion size. The sandwich could barely fit in my mouth due to the generosity of cheese, apple, and turkey. I got lucky with my ordering this time too. It was so ginormous that my show of eating it attracted some nice man to politely ask me what I was consuming so ravenously. The sweet potato fries, though good (come on who doesn't like fried stuff!), didn't stray too far from the typical. But all in all, a delicious bang for the buck! Well deserved Grey Dog!
