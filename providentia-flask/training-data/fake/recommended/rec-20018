The food here was EXCELLENT. It is unfortunate that my niece and I sat at the bar because the barmaid was very unfriendly and seemed disgusted the whole time. We tipped her only 15% because she gave us such poor service and had almost a hostile-like attitude. I will go back to buttermilk but will wait for a table rather than sit at the bar.
