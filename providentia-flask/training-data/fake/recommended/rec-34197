Stumbled upon this nice little French style brunch place right when the NYC marathon was going on. Just thought the food here was ok, nothing that special. I had the Eggs Benedict w/ ham, which I got b/c everyone else said their Eggs benedict was amazing. I thought it was just standard, they weren't particular generous with portions either. I would probably go with their more French-style brunch offerings if I had to make the choice again.
