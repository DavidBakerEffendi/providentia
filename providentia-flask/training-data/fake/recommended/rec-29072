My guess is that Fogo de Chau translates to Meat Lover's Haven. Seriously. You don't have to waste energy to get up, raise a hand or move a dish.  Beautifully seasoned and cooked meat is delivered to your table just as you like them and are placed onto your plate.  You just tell the men in the funny pants the level of moo-ness... I mean... rareness you want, and they'll oblige you with a smile.  All the red meat is moan-inducing.  (My favorite was the bacon wrapped filet mignon... sans bacon.)  The lamb chops were very tasty.  I wasn't impressed with the chicken or the pork.  And I hated the sausage.  Don't waste precious stomach real estate with these.  The salad bar was laden with high quality foodage.  And the sides brought to your table are worthy of the silver plates upon with they're served.  The cheese-bread biscuits are dream inducing. The gauchos (men in funny pants) know their meats/cuts and are very fast.  The waitstaff is very attentitive, friendly and helpful.  They noticed if my glasses needed refilling or if I needed a fresh plate before I realized it! If I start writing about how much I love the decor, your eyes will start to glaze over and you may never make it to this fine charcuterie.  Just go and see it for yourself.  Notice the beautiful woodwork as you pace yourself through a glorious meat-fest!
