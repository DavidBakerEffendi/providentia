Tldr: place didn't live up to its expectations. DONT GET THE PUMPKIN PANCAKES NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY. And wait for 3+ is NEVER 20 min. Don't let them fool you. It's about an hour wait. Found on yelp that this was a great brunch place so decided to give it a go. Called before hand to ask if they took down names (not reservations) and was rudely shut down then hung up on. What. when we got there we were told the wait would be "20 minutes" but waited almost an hour. The lady at the front kept telling people times that I believed were far from accurate. The food- Seemed like everyone was raving about the pumpkin pancakes... So I ordered them. And they were a complete fail. I think mine were actually not cooked all the way through.. And the cinnamon yogurt on top was a little sour for my taste. Home made pancakes taste better than their pancakes The other dish we ordered was one of the brunch items-salmon with hollandaise and eggs and potatoes. This was actually pretty tasty and the potatoes were amazing! The best part of the meal! I also ordered the chai latte which was decent and my mom seemed to like their cappuccino. But really, stay away from the pancakes. It's not worth your money. You're better off paying a couple more bucks for something else. All in all, sad about this place. Still in search for a good NYC brunch place. But I will give it 3 stars for its portions. Makes me sad when I order a dish and it's for ants. This place had great portions :)
