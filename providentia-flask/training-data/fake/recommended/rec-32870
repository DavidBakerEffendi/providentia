This is a small yet intimate restaurant with professional, but not pretentious, service. We had five different appetizers and entrees and each was amazing. The calamari is fresh with a light crispy crust. Polenta fries are light and crispy with a creamy sauce. The ravioli with lamb was amazing as well as he mezzaluna with beet and mascarpone. I will return very soon. This is a great find and I don't have to go into the city.
