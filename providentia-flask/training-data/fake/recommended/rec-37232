After a long crazy day, my traveling companions and I decided to forgo going out to dinner and order Chinese in.  We found Golden Empress was nearby and delivered.  They were fabulous!  Placed the order over the phone and within about 30 minutes we had an abundance of food delivered to our hotel!   They have a great vegetarian menu!  We ordered four different vegetarian entrees and were impressed with each.  The hot and sour soup was pretty good too.  I can't even remember what everyone ordered but I can say that we had way more food than we needed and it was all pretty delicious and inexpensive.  I wish we had a place like this in Newburyport!! Now, I must go sleep off this Chinese food coma... P.S. Unlike other yelpers who have visited Golden Empress before us, we did not get the overload of fortune cookies and I was sad.   P.P.S. One guy in our party was irritated that they did not send chop sticks with the plastic utensils.  Bah!  So we only give them four stars.  A little harsh?
