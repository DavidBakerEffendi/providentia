So I really couldn't stop making my Top Chef references here. I had the jacket on like Tommy C with the open collar on the shirt, from asking if the dish was tops...I'm completely lame. However the food was definitely the opposite of lame. First off I am not an adventure-thrill-seeking food type, frankly, you can read my other reviews and see where I stand in the land of bland. But from my lady's point of view, it was amazing. She thought it was very carefully put together and everything flowed like Padma's hair. Sorry, had to do it. Bravo, Harold! (Last one, I'm done)
