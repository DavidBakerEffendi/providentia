Incredible panini's. This place is worth dropping into whenever you are in Astoria. The line was surprisingly short on a Sunday for brunch. It's definitely one of those hip areas where all the foodies are hanging out before the rest of the world figures it out. We sat down relatively quickly (20 min) and ordered two panini's and a soup. It was definitely delicious and a heart attack on a plate! It was worth the extra set (or two) of squats if you ask me. Next time, i would probably share ONE panini with my girl friend and a appetizer.
