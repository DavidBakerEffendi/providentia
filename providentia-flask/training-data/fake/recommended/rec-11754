I loved the whole decor of the place! But I was very disappointed with the food. I had high hopes for this restaurant and really wanted to like it. But I couldn't stop thinking to myself, why are they using ginormous plates if the serving sizes are not even that large? The table is small enough as it is, why make it into a battle with the plates? I ordered the Spicy Basil Noodles with beef. The flavor was pretty good, but since the plate was so large, the food got cold quickly.
