In my opinion this restaurant is VILE. Would NEVER go back here!! We ordered the tuna tartare and it was the worst one I've ever had. When I tried to send it back the manager refused ( he was also extremely rude) and said if they took everything back people complained about they would make no money.I would spare yourself from this place.
