Delicious pasta and one of the best pasta meals I've ever had outside of Italy!  Nothing is overly saucy and you feel like you're in Italy with an all-Italian menu (with translations on the back of the menu).  This is not a place to go to for spaghetti and meatballs, but where to go if you want real Italian food.  The ciabatta bread that comes before the meal had the right balance of salt and rosemary with a yummy olive oil.  The staff was friendly, attentive, and wanted to provide as much information as they could about the restaurant and menu items!
