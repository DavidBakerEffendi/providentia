Finally stopped in here Saturday afternoon after walking by for months (years??) Husband and I decided to stop in for a drink and a snack after running errands. We sat at the bar and were perfectly timed for happy hour (you know a place is good when they do Saturday happy hour!) I was swayed from my initial choice of wine to try the Greek margarita, because why not, and while tasty it was a bit fruity for me so I switched to the wine on tap for the second drink. The bartender Kevin was really great and nice about letting us taste beers before committing and also made some good suggestions. They had a very good tap selection in general, and half price during happy hour. There was a party going on upstairs with loud music (mentioned in some of the other reviews) but we didn't mind. I liked the music and it felt festive. Food options were limited for vegans, but we got two dips and later ended up getting a yummy salad as well. Since we were looking to snack and drink rather than a full dinner it was perfect. We stayed much longer than we planned and will definitely be back!
