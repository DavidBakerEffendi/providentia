Gypsy bar almost made it, then the bartender left. Sabor was a victim of circumstance, or maybe just strange vibes given off by the staff, or just marginal fare.. The place before Sabor was the type of spot that you forget the name of.... Adelina's seems to be poised to be the next local JUMP OFF for coffee drinkers in the coffee & wifi less doldrums between Troost and Grumpy. save for local rogue wifi favorties such as Smolak, domek, SUNBEAM SPA (the covert rub and tug), and the always elusive yet thought provoking "Other Network" Â  I know they are gonna make a good truffled egg and most likely cater to the bruschetta enthusiasts of the block BUT they boast a pizza on the menu--- and remember what Biggie said Ya got da truffled egg game TITE ok DATS RIGHT But if u got Espresso AND da pizza GAME Ill take her there ALL NITE (its the seemingly simple pizza that will aid to the rise or downfall of a coffee shop)
