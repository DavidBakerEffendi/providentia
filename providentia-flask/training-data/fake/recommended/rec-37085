Happy hr rocks...so much so, that I decided to have my b'day party here in March. Wait staff, bartneders, DJ are all cool as hell. Drinks are not too strong & not to weak, right in the middle. Decent finger food, Love the ginger wings. DJ is dope! Love the R&B/Hip Hop mix. One floor, spacious bar, dark, yet cool. I've only been on Friday & Saturday's so I don't know how it is during the week but I'm sure any night, you'd have a good time. Can't wait to go back.
