Really tasty caribbean food. I've had curry chicken, jerk chicken, brown stew chicken, and curry goat. All have been really delicious. Â The sides are also excellent, rice w peas, cabbage, and plantains. Munchie's is definitely one of the top quality restaurants in South Orange. Inside, it's nice, clean, and warm. Definitely a place you can sit down and eat in. The owners and staff are friendly. And the portions are solid. Highly recommended!
