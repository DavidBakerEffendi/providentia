I have been coming here pretty regularly for the last 2 years.. even though the food is not amazing or by any means "authentically thai," it is always a safe bet for dinner when I don't feel like straying from the neighborhood. There is one thing on the menu, however, that I always order: the vegetarian green dumplings. These are not authentically thai either, you won't find any peanuts or sticky glutinous wrapper that typically define thai dumplings. These are little pouches of deliciousness made up of spinach, mushrooms and mixed veggies swimming in a sweet and savory black bean sauce. For some reason the combination of the semi-chewy wrapper and the sauce always hits the spot for me. The filling can sometimes come off a little mushy, but covered by that damn black bean sauce it is somehow strangely satisfying.. The decor is gaudy and the selection of waitresses is very amusing to say the less. But hey, I can't help but love this place for what it is... and what it isn't.
