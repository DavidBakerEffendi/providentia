Fun atmosphere, great food presentation, but ultimately the food itself is average. The prices are quite reasonable for regular pad thai, curry, etc dishes. A chicken pad thai is $8.90. It's ordering off the "fancy" specials side of the menu that lands you into pricier territory, and I'm not sure it's worth the extra $6 to be honest. I thought the Room Service pad thai tasted the same as regular pad thai, just made with seafood instead of your regular chicken/pork/beef, and colored red with an egg on top. The mixed drinks were delicious, but heavily watered down (where's the booze?). My boyfriend's panang curry was delicious! But it was more curry than meat or veggies. Couldn't figure out where all the ingredients were! I'd come back again for the really fun atmosphere, but I wouldn't call this a special Thai place by any means.
