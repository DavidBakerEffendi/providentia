I haven't been to Philly in a decade, and I'm staying in University City. I am extremely jetlagged so I picked whatever place to get a steak that was close. Abner's is definitely a divey joint, kind of dirty inside. The guys working the counter were nice, though, and cooked me and my buddy up some steaks right away. Meat was really fresh, as were the rolls. They melted the cheese well, although I'll be honest, there wasn't nearly enough cheese. Other than that, though, this place was a quality choice, especially given that I refused to take a cab ride at the time.
