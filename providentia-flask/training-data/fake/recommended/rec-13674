Someone once told me that Americans can't do bistros worth a damn. To the lot of you I say, nuts to that. Market Table might not be a bistro in the French tradition but it's a homey, unpretentious restaurant that serves nearly flawless traditional comfort food in a casual setting that belies the care put into each dish. I could eat here seven days a week and nine ways to Sunday. The roasted beets with goat cheese fritters? Refreshing like that first shower after waking up facedown on your living room floor with your shoes still on and a tequila mariachi band playing last night's song in your jackhammered skull. Trust me, I would know. The grilled yellowfin tuna is on-cray-ah-bull, as you bistro elitists would say. And the pan crisped chicken? Let's be honest, chicken sucks. And yet this was the bomb. You're taking sucky food and making it into bombs over Baghdad while throwing some bok choy into the remix like you knew a discerning Chinese palate was gonna be in the house. I'm sold like a blue light special on Valtrex when Paris Hilton is in town. I kinda went on a rant about how great the food was but the service won't be outshined. They are really on point here, to the point where I made a note of how outstanding the staff were. Very helpful and attentive without being intrusive. The fact that the atmosphere (stadium size glass windows letting much of the street light in) created just the right balance of rustic escape and urban charm should also be mentioned. Like Puff would say if he was a restaurant critic, it's all about the ambiance baby.
