from the live music to the fun waiters, cuba is a great place to have an entertaining dinner.  throw in some pretty good food and you are in for a treat. we had a really fun time and enjoyed the ambiance.  our waiter always had a smile on his face and was always around to help us out w/ anything.  there were a few misses w/ the food but we were overall happy with cuba. i started with the soft shell crab with the tropical fruit salad and she had the ensalada de cuba w/out avocados.  i really enjoyed my salad as the crab was cooked very nicely and went well with the salad.  she liked her salad as well. for our main course, i had the rack of lamb w/ corn, asparagus and potatoes.  she had the pollo guajira which was stuffed chicken w/ plantains and cheese, zucchini, and rice and beans.  she was a bit underwhelmed by this especially when she saw the same dish be brought out for the table next to us.  oh well. for dessert, i got the natilla which a creme brulee and she got the bombon cubano which was a molten chocolate cake.  we actually sent the cake back as it didn't have a molten center.  they quickly switched which made us question if it was store bought or not. i'd recommend coming here and would go back.
