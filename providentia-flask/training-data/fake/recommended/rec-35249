This was our late night stop for food after a full night of drinking. Took the cabs here and basically picked up food and went back to our hotel. Pic: yelp.com/biz_photos/53rdâ€¦ We ordered the mixed plate. The meat was tasty, but kind of bland. The rice was good as was the bread. What really made the plate was the beyond spicy sauce. This added the punch that was sorely missing from the plate. I didn't use any of the yogurt sauce, but the salad was pretty refreshing in the mix. Overall, it was pretty good meal after drinking, but I don't think it hit my hunger spot though. The line was really long and it was probably too long for what this is. I didn't quite see the 5 stars that everyone was giving. There was nothing that really stood out about the food, but it is good... just not great. I'm sure the fact that we were eating after drinking helped a lot though I don't know if I'd go here randomly during the day. Regardless, this is definitely worth a try just based on their popularity. So, 3.5 stars... rounded up to 4 because math says so.
