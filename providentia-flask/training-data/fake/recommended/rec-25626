Love these guys- the pizza is top-notch but don't be afraid to try their other offerings. Last time I was there I tried the oxtail ragu -off the chain. It can be pricey, but it's no more than you'd expect to pay at a mediocre restaurant in Manhattan. Bonus: If the line's too long you can always hang out at the bar in the back. They set up an awesome heated lodge for the winter.
