As someone who has dined at Osteria, Amis and Vetri, I am extremely underwhelmed with Pizzeria Vetri. I think the easiest way to explain the experience is by sharing with you my meal for two: One 12" Crudo Pizza (not great) - $18.00 One Caesar Salad (terrible) - $10.00 One Rotolo (decent) - $3.50 3 glasses of (average) wine - $25.50 After tax and tip = $71.52 I don't know if my stomach is upset from the Â  horrendous Caesar Salad or the size of this check! Take my advice and walk 4 blocks to Pete's Famous Pizza and order a large $12 pie and a couple of craft brews from their cooler. Trust me that it will be a better meal than this and it will cost you $50 less!
