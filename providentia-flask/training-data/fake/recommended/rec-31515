I want to start off by saying I love, love Italian food!  Soooo, after reading all of the wonderful reviews everyone wrote I couldn't wait till my reservation time was near!  I starved myself all day expecting to really eat everything I possibly could, def not the case!!!! I ordered my favorite dish of lobster ravioli, what a disappointment!  The caprese salad I ordered was average at best!  I had to ask in the middle of my meal if they even offered anything other then water to drink.  I was then given a can of soda at my table.  From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out it was 35 minutes!!!!  We were rushed and completely unsatisfied!   Upon leaving the restaurant my guest and I came to the conclusion we would have had a better meal and service had we gone to the Olive Garden!  Now that's BAD!!!!!!!! So, If you want to be rushed, have little selection on the less then impressive menu and eat average food this is your place!   Wouldn't ever waste my time again.
