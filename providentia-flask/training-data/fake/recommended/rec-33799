Went here for New Year's brunch and I'm so glades we decided to give it a try. The food was really good and speaking as a "drinkie" as well as, a foodie the non-alcoholic drinks on the menu were really good as well. The beau and I ordered the chicken fried steak with eggs, ricotta sage pancakes with apricot sausage and the crumpets with bacon marmalade and just kind of shared everything, and everything was absolutely delicious. My plate, both out plates actually were completely clean, lol. The portion sizes are just right too, not too much and not bird portions, they were just enough. To drink I had a pomegranate Rickey and the fizz from the soda, coupled with the cute little glass it was served made me feel like I was drinking a Bellini, I really liked it. The place is really "comfy co", my little abbreviation for comfy cozy. The service is impeccable, they were very attentive and I didn't realize it until after we left and I read a review on The Patch, that the woman who greeted and seated us was one if the owners which is really nice to see. The secret weapon if this place was the music. I guess because it will soon be a full bar, they have a whole built in bookshelf topped with a turntable and the guy that was emceeing New Year's Day hit all the right tunes for a great brunch meal with a laid back vibe.
