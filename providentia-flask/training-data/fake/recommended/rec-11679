I went here last night for my birthday and the service and the food was all amazing. The 4 of us were very pleased with everything they did for us. We tried almost all the dinner menu and we loved it all, the desserts are so delicious I just want to come back for more. The ceviche, the pasta, the radishes, the greens, the oysters, the fish and all it totally deserves 5 stars. Thank you Chef Bryan for the amazing food and thank you to all the crew. Only thing I regret is not leaving more tip :( I'm sorry. Please forgive us, we will be back and will tip you better!
