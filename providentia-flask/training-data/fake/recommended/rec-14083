Yuca bar is a brunch must. I always bring out-of-town visitors here and am happy to say that I've made them believers. In fact, several people request it when they visit again. I always promote the huevos rancheros with a fierceness, but the menu offers no disappointments that I've seen/heard thus far. Not only is the food a treat,  but the coffee (bottomless), brunch cocktail, and fresh squeezed OJ $14 prix fixe situation makes their brunch situation a stellar deal. I went for dinner and drinks for the first time this weekend and true to form, I left Yuca Bar glowing. The sangria probably had something to do with that, but I was equally as satisfied with dinner as I have been with brunch.  Since it was a beautiful spring night, it was pretty crowded and a bit loud, but there was no wait and the noise didn't interfere with conversing. Service was a little rushed given the crowd, but we didn't ever feel ignored or rushed to leave right away. Bottom line: I adore this place. Great for brunch, and as I've recently discovered, great for tapas and drinks too.
