My companion and I have been Garces fans since our conversion at Amada.  Tinto, Distrito, Chifa...all above-average.  So, our expectations were high.  But we were truly surprised at the level of disappointment with our meal at JG Domestic. On the positive side, service was typical Garces: expert, friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.  The space is clean and warmly lit, despite its oft-maligned "beneath-an-escalator" location.    Plating is attractive.  The table bread was an encouraging start.  But things went downhill from there. Avoid: any dish featuring morels.  Ours were sandy.  Too gritty to eat.  (Not washing food properly is a crime at any pricepoint.) We ordered the lobster cappuccino after its recent NY Times' mention.  It was good, but nothing spectacular.  The rest of our dishes - potato cassoulet, a duck entree, baby artichokes, the above-mentioned morel mushrooms and a raw tuna special - were *decidedly* underseasoned.  Some we didn't even bother to finish. We split the beignets for dessert, not wanting to risk any more disappointment.  They were...hot.  That is all I can say in their favor.   Bottom line: Skip JG Domestic and go to one of his other restaurants if you are craving a Garces fix...preferably Amada.
