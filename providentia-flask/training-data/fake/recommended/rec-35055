I have been going to Top's dinner for over ten years. As a true hardcore diner gal Top's has gotten better with age. After the renovation a few years back, management changed the menu to a "higher end" diner *(if there is such a concept). The portions are gigantic. You can split a meal and both parties will have a good sized portions to munch on. The staff is always accomandating and very friendly. My guilty pleasure is the Â Neapolitan poundcake. It is two buttery slices of poundcake, with a huge scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, strawberry slices and rasberry sauce. A rare treat but a wonderful one indeed. FYI. If you plan to walk in there at 3am on a weekend prepare to wait a bit, it's crowded all the club folks who need a good meal to combat tomorrow's hangover :)
