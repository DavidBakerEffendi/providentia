Five stars because surly mother, picky sister and I left here very pleased (and full) a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately, in recent times, BK's culinary scene has gotten almost TOO popular. That night, we went to Buttermilk (2 hour wait!), Blue Ribbon (PACKED), and having gone to Good Fork and having their Steak & Eggs, we called and the person on the other line was very cordial, saying we might have to wait 15 mins. We got there, and table was ready. Perfect. Thank you car. Love my animal proteins, but tempura hen of woods mushrooms risotto was fantastic - savory and perfect for winter. I'm not sure if there's anything more satisfying than good tempura batter. Picky sister (gnocchi) and Surly mother (forgot what she had - selective hearing - but clearly enjoyed) were happy. There's no pretense to this place, food/service was excellent, well-priced wine list. Dessert is tough to compare with some behemoths around the borough (doughnuts at Buttermilk, crisp/tart at Adderley) but solid nonetheless (we had the flan. I've had the key lime pie before, which is good). When it's wintery mixing outside and its cold and dark and you're hungry, it's nice to walk into somewhere warm and cozy like someone's inviting you to their home, with great food to match. And if my mother's happy, then that at least gives me 30 mins. of solitude on the drive home :-).
