Small, Salty and Oil-laden portions.  This alleges to be a Mediterranean Cuisine in the Spanish tradition.  Rather than the predominant flavors being high grade olive oil and garlic, it's salt and a vegetable oil blend that is certain to make your small portion only a "quick rental".  Sit near the bathroom.  The seafood stew was a ladle of salty, oily broth, devoid of rice or anything to balance the overwhelming salt.  The first time I visited, I did enjoy the paella rice, except for the overcooked seafood that tasted like bait.  The service was very pleasant however the management seemed used to frequent complaints and followed me out seeking feedback.
