Frankford Hall has got atmosphere. The best kind of atmosphere, with lots of outdoor seating, twinkly lights, beer pong and table games, and fire pits to get snuggly with your lova' - it's an oasis in the city. The beer selection is out of this world. The s'mores are banging. The food...meh. I might be a German food snob - so all I can say I wasn't blown away. But the potato salad is good, and the mustard is spicy. Why aren't there more beirgardens in Philadelphia?
