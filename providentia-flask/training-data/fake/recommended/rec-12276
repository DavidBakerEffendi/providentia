Many ramen places fail because they can't get the broth right. The good ones have that bold and rich flavor without the fatty, oily feel to it. This place, thankfully, knows what theyre doing. I got the Karaka-men, the spicy one. This is so good, but being a L.A. native, I remain faithful to the establishment that first opened my eyes to ramen, Orochon. And compartively, Ippudo is just not on par with the west coast establishment. With that said, I still recommend this place to any ramen lover. I got taco Wasabi and edamame as well. I'm very particular about my taco wasabi's being perfectly fresh with that kick to the nose. It does just that and I enjoyed it very much. For dessert, I got the crepe cake. This was good but I kept thinking that it would be better if the crepe was filled with custard instead of the whipped cream. How much dreamier it must be... haha. Nonetheless, everything that I have tried did not fail and it is a must try! Good and friendly staff as well.
