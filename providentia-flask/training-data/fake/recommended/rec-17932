i was really excited to come here and the food didn't disappoint me as it's an interesting food destination. They do nose to tail pork dishes, which includes an entire pig's head. The first time we visited, I tried pig head salad, pig tails, and the pork terrine. Everything was very delicious. They have a great beer selection and our service was pretty good. The space itself is really cool and eclectic. The second time we went however, we got there late, approx 1215/1230 am. there were other people at the bar and as we understood they stop serving food at 1. The bartender didn't approach us and then we he did, he seemed terribly bothered by our presence as he handed us menus and then walked away. We could see into the kitchen that they were starting to clean and the bartender never really came back to us and the later it got the less we wanted to order any food. So, we just left. I understand that it was getting late and approaching the kitchen's close...but we just wanted a couple things and there was time and on top of it the bar closed at 2, but this man was annoyed with us being there at all, so we didn't even stick around for a beer. That left a bad taste in my mouth. I should have quit while I was ahead after the first visit.
