Al's is the best place I have ever been to, and I've traveled the world.  It has an incredible atmosphere that is conducive to families and college students alike.  I grew up in Vermont, and went to school in DC, Paris, and Oxford... and I bring all my friends who visit me to this local gem!! Absolutely amazing hot dogs, great fries, good cremies, and the service is one of a kind!  I'm 22 now, and I'll never stop coming to this place!
