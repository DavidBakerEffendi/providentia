Brunch on Saturday: seated right away for 2 Eggs Benedict w/ home fries - very delicious! just wish there were more home fries! Lemon Ricotta pancakes - also very good - the BF liked it coffee - great! free refills = great! the place is really loud, the staff are friendly, it feels like a hipster cafeteria haha prices are also decent. Â the area it's in was a little sketch - we walked about .5 miles to it from the Loews hotel and quickly realized the change in the neighborhood, but whatevs the food was good
