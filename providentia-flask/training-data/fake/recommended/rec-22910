Pellet rinks was good not great. I had the Rigatoni and Vodka sauce and the rest had various chicken dishes. The apps and bread were no great deal either. It is a tourist stop and we expected the food to be ok. I think more people were trying to use the bathroom than eat there when we were there. Tiny bathrooms by the way. Pretty expensive too excluding the beverage charges. I have eaten and made better.
