Farm to table organic fare.  If you love dogs you will love the ambiance and decor. Had brunch . Menu I'm told changes daily. Limited menu but very good choices.  Has a small Bar, outdoor  seating and pleasant fun atmosphere. Nice are to walk around after eating stroll.  Prices were reasonable for the city . Would love to go again .
