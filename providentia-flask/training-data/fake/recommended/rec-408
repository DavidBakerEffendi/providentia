Only "bad" thing I can say is they Â need to tell customers that their chicken wings are SPICY (unless they did and I missed it...). Spicy delicious sweat-while-you-eat wings that is. If you're the type that can't handle pepper, don't eat the wings. Other than that, their brisket and grilled ratatouille (I was trying to trick my body it was eating healthy) were great. Beer selection also good but a little pricey for $7/plastic cup.
