Love this spot. Great staff -- get to know 'em! -- and great selection of beverages and food. Get the Omega salad! Sometimes the soups are questionable, but the staff is always very honest about what they think is good and fresh that day. The place is relaxed and you can camp out on your computer for a while (though I try to order something every 45 minutes or so, so as not to tie up a seat). I love the decor -- big fireplace, funky colorful chandelier, big wood tables. The back room is private enough that you can have lunch meetings, too. Some may find it a bit odd that New Moon is closed on Saturdays, but I believe it's to honor the Sabbath. Otherwise, the hours are great! Just make sure you get there before 11am so some of the samples are left... :)
