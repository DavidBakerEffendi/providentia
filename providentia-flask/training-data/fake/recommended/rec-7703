This is like walking into an authentic elegant café in downtown Vienna - with the dark wooden panels on the walls, thick curtains and drapes, velvet sofas, coffee being served with water glasses on silver trays, dressed up waiters, and last but not least a fabulous assortment of delicate cakes that make you drewl and want to have it all... Quite classy! We had to wait in line for almost an hour to get in to the street level café but it was definitely worth it. So happy we decided to skip the café at nearby Metropolitan Museum of Art and chose this instead.
