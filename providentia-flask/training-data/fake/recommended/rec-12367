oh my gosh the food being delicious was not even the best part of my experience... incredibly attentive staff, well-traveled, easy to chat with, super knowledgable, fun and approachable... they have a real passion for food and ingredients... i swear to you this food was cooked with love and i ate that stuff right up and went back for dessert!!! :D
