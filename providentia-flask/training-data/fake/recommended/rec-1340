I actually want to give it 3.5 stars!  I went for dinner a couple of weeks ago.  Decorated nicely, relaxing atmosphere, and he staff were super friendly and attentive. My meal was just okay, though.  I had the seafood tofu hot pot.  It wasn't bland, but that was because I asked for level 2 spiciness. Not sure if I could have handled more than that. My friend ordered the sweet & sour chicken... It was nothing special. Marginally better than the dish from a corner take-out restaurant. You get large portions though, definitely enough for leftovers which makes the prices reasonable!
