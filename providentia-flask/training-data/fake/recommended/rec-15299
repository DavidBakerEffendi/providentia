I tried the cheesesteak here and it was very good although not the best I've ever had. I loved the fries with Old Bay seasoning and the gravy fries. Portions are very big and the service was good. The place is kind of dark and not very inviting but it does have a lot of character and is conveniently located in the historic district. Prices were reasonable and the whole family loved it
