Can I move in here? I was DYING to get to Garces Trading Company for months.  We went a few Tuesdays ago, after a particularly trying day at work.  Garces was the remedy.   Excellent service, warm and comfortable atmosphere and delicious food.  It's that simple.  We bought a bottle of Malbec at the wine store and enjoyed it with our cheese and charcuterie plate (we chose the chef's selection; two words: garlic caramel), potted duck,  pappradelle with lamb ragu and chorizo clam pizza.  Finished the early evening with a s'more. Jose Garces is an evil genius. Cannot wait to get back to GTC!
