Mmmmm Mmmmmm Mmmmmm!!! Get an absolutely delicious bowl of hand made noodles for under $7.  This tiny shop servers up asian comfort food at its best.  If you order the hand drawn noodles you can watch the guy in the kitchen yank and twirl that dough until the hair fine noodles are dropped into your soup.  An art form in itself.  Skip that value meal and try this place for lunch or dinner. Le Bec Fin is a 5 star restaurant and so is Nanzhou.  How, you may ask, is the epitomy of classic french food served by a team of staff beckoning to your every whim in a beautiful silk parlor the same as a cheap hole in the wall with neon in the windows and where you'll probably have to sit with some strangers because they have no room?  Because they both are exactly what they're supposed to be at their best.  Nanzhou is quick, cheap, bare bones, and delicious.  In and out in 15 minutes and completely satisfied.  What more could you ask for??
