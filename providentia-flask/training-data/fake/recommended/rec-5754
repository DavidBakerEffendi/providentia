Got the tasting menu, and every dish was excellent.  The chicken was a standout, it was perfectly cooked and the peaches on the side added to the flavor.  I also had the portobello and arugula appetizer, the seafood pasta, and the gelatto.  My wife and I brought a bottle pinot noir from the Williamette Valley with us, as Mercato is a BYO. The price of the tasting menu is phenomenal, when you consider that it actually isn't a real tasting menu.  What I got was a full size portion for each course (and there were four courses).  That is actually my only gripe.  I am used to each course in a tasting menu being pared down in size.  I just wish I knew going into the meal how much food I was going to get.  But  I won't ding Mercato in stars for this.  The staff will gladly wrap up any leftovers.       Bottom line, Mercato should be on everyone's dining list for Philly.
