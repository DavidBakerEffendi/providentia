The eggs benedict is the best I've had anywhere because the hollandaise sauce is consistently outstanding and they actually know how to poach an egg.  Home fries are perfectly crispy and well-seasoned.  Caution - wait can be really long if you arrive after 10am on the weekends, and service can be slow.  Food more than makes up for both of these issues.
