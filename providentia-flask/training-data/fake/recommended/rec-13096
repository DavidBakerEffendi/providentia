After wanting to check this place out for a couple weeks, my friends and I came across some awesome Google offers (one voucher gets you an entree, stack of pancakes, and a drink) and made our way over one Friday night. O..M..G. I'd eat here every night if my waistline wouldn't stage a coup d'etat. Since we were a group of four, we decided to order a bunch of different dishes and go in family style. Go in we did. It got to the point where common decency was abandoned and we started eating with our hands. It's really that good. Everything from the apple cider to the biscuits to the chicken and waffles to the pancakes (we tried plain and banana) to the shrimp and grits were absolutely delicious. We left stuffed, content, and ready to curl up in bed with smiles on our faces. Net net, someone is back in that kitchen cooking with nothing less than love, and I will definitely be back. p.s. The waiters were friendly and offered up suggestions, which are always appreciated :)
