One of those places where you can lose yourself in a perfect Sunday reverie all the while enjoying an incredibly local and seasonal menu. Do try: The mushroom omelette: the marinated paper-thin slices of mushrooms on top of the omelette pair Â incredibly well with the savory cheese and potato filling. They also have Colombe coffee...nuff' said Tip: If you like spice as them to make the Bloody Mary extra spicy..the result was fantastic. Also, if you're coming by car/cab/etc you can actually turn into 29th street (it looks like it's one way but it's actually a two way drive-in)
