Definitely not worth all that trouble. I really don't understand all the fuss. We had a 10pm reservation for 3. I called to make it four, but they said they couldn't accommodate, which is cool, I get it ... until I walk in and there are 3 empty tables and space at our table to add a chair. Really, really lame if you ask me -- but you didn't, so I am telling you. The food was serviceable, but not anything to write home about. We had the short-rib sashimi, which was a great piece of meat, nicely marbled. The sashimi assortment with tuna and toro, good fish but not any better than any good sushi restaurant. Â The uni croquette was probably the highlight of the evening. The uni and fried croquette just complement each other in so many ways. The oysters, which were fresh and lovely. The salmon roe and uni with rice, which was fine. My sister thought the rice was not sticky enough. The foie gras soba, which was the second highlight of the night. The flavors just work so well together. The fried potatoes, which were just fried potatoes. Finally, the branzini, our last plate, which tasted perfectly fine and smelled divine. However, it is a huge plate, and we were already full. But we did order the green tea panna cotta, a great palate cleanser. Overall, the food was okay--not wow, very unfortunate. Service points: - They are really slow with drinks, but I guess if they have to chisel that lovely piece of ice, I forgive. - My sister asked for a new pair of chopsticks after dropping hers and it never comes. Whatever, my sister is easy going. - Here is the kicker: the check comes and the total is all wrong, $425 total for three people who ordered 4 drinks? How did $188 worth of food turn into $323? Any good waiter would have known that the amount looked unreasonable on it's face. He fixed it, and we went on our way ... ... to never come back again.
