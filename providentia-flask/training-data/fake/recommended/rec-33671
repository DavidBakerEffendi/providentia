My husband and I had a lovely meal here. We made a reservation only an hour before coming and did not have to wait at all for our table even though they seemed quite busy. The food is rich, creative and our waitress was adorable and professional. Its a bit on the expensive side, but fine for an occasional splurge because the food is amazing. We were left feeling it was worth it for such a pleasant evening.
