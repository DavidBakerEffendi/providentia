We went here last night to try the restaurant week menu.  The restaurant itself is very comfortable with plush cushions - after dinner we were ready to take a nap right there. As far as service is concerned our server was very attentive and knowledgable.  For our appetizers we got the chicken livers, moussaka, chankleesh, and steak tartar.  All four were great - the pomegranate molasses on the chicken livers gave it a nice tart seasoning.  Per our servers recommendation we ate the chankleesh with the steak tartar and the flavors mixed well together. For our entrees we went for the diver scallops and lamb shank over dirty rice. The lamb was so tender that you didn't even need to cut the meat.  The scallops were seared perfectly, although I'm not sure how I felt about the spring pea purée below it. For dessert we got the cheesecake and the Knafe Bil Jibneh.  I immediately fell in love with the Knafe.  The flaky cheesy tart mixed with the orange blossom and rose water syrup was great.  It's an amazing blend of sweet and savory. I would come back here for this alone. Overall this was a great experience. I will definitely be coming back here again.
