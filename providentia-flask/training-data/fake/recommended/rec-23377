I have been going to Tequila's for years. It is hands down the best Mexican in the city!!! I have never had a bad meal...ever.  The wait staff is friendly, same w/ the bartenders. The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful inside. The margarita's are superb.  The tortilla soup is out of this world. It has come to a point where I can't try other mexican restaurants in Philly, if it ain't broke, why fix it.
