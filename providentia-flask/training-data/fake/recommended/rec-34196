Came here after work on a Wednesday night and had a great meal! You almost walk right past Kilo and its unassuming exterior, but once you're inside it's a very cozy atmosphere. My friend and I started with a bottle of wine and 4 small plates to share. The operative word here is "small" - if you have an appetite, you will definitely need to make a few different selections! Our server was VERY helpful and gave us great wine/food pairing recommendations! The Kale salad was tasty - a little too much garlic for me (and I LOVE garlic!). Would not recommend that for anyone having a romantic evening! We ordered the scallop special, too. Scallops were seared perfectly and pretty tasty. The mushroom tacos and cheese plate were probably our favorite plates - did not expect to like the mushroom tacos as much as we did! Spicy and delish! As other reviewers have said, the prices do add up pretty quickly and you'll probably spend more than your average wine & tapas bar. However, we really enjoyed our bottle of wine and food, so I would for sure try Kilo again!
