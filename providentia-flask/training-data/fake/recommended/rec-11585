Chill coffee shop setting with some pretty damn good food, i always get the Baja fish tacos. Happy hour prices starting at 4 and a great place to meet for a date or a group of friends. You place your order at the counter, leave your name and they bring the food to your table. Don't forget to grab your own utensils. Really nice staff.
