I love that they give you foccacia bread instead of regular Italian bread at the table.  It comes with olive oil with fresh garlic to dip it in.  Lunchtime is usually the best time to visit and the waiters are polite and attentive.  Their tomato sauce is really tasty.  I recommend their chicken with asparagus.
