Glad we stumbled on this place. Pleasantly surprised with the quality and quantity of the food.  We started with empanadas which are made fresh each day.  Comes with a tasty sauce on the side for dipping.  We had to try the Cuban Sandwiches.  Very authentic made on fresh bead and pressed real flat like it's supposed to be.  We also had a taste of the Piccadillo which we plan to order next time.  The Piccadillo is also authentically prepared using olives, peppers, and Cuban spices. The owner is very nice and told us a bit about his business.  He has been open a little under two years.  We plan to return for dinner soon.
