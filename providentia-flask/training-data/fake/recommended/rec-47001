Absolutely love to go with a bottle of white (Byob) and get the grilled octopus, every time! The mussels saut√© is amazing! The shrimp scampi is out of this world! The pita bread and olive oil are great! Sharing a whole fish with your date is fun as well, I like to get it deboned ! A must go for seafood and Greek food lovers!
