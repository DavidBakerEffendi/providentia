Ishkabibbles is ok. It was not all that great to me. It's wasn't horrible but I have had better. I don't even eat cheesesteaks a lot, hardly ever, but I have had better when I do eat them. I also think my expectations were to high. A coworker told me to try them the next time I was in Philly bc they are good so I did, and I must say I was a little disappointed. He and someone else I know raved about their fries and to me they were just *meh* OK. Nothing special. My fianc√© and I both got regular cheesesteaks and shared the fries. I also tried the Gremlin drink (grape juice and lemonade mixed) and I must say that wasn't bad. It was different but pretty good, and I normally don't like anything grape flavor (most grape flavors taste like dimetapp) . Overall I would suggest trying a different cheesesteak place. I honestly felt like I wasted calories on this cheesesteak bc I was expecting and wanting it to be amazing and it was just ok. Waste of time and a cheesesteak meal.
