Vrry friendly place and food is good. Not amazing, but tasty. Sangria made with champagne is very nice option for soething different. Excelleny bread with olive oil. Best dish we had was chorizio wrapped in a thin potatoe wrap. All in all a fine place to go. Â comfortable. But not the finest tapas in theworld either. Extra credit for great welcoming service.
