I've spent a majority of my life in the South and the Midwest, specifically near Memphis and Kansas City, both of which are famed for BBQ. My love for a great BBQ brisket sandwich is pretty intense. Ruthie's hits the spot when it comes to BBQ found in North Jersey! I've had some not so great experiences with other, local BBQ joints. Ruthie's is a sweet, saucy BBQ comparable to anything I'd find back down south!
