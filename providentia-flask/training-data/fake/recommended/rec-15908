My review would have been 4 or 5 stars, but the host was incredibly disorganized and rude last night. Two friends and I went to Chavela's for dinner last night, and we were told by the host that the wait would only be a few minutes. After about 30 minutes, we were called in and seated at cramped end table in between the kitchen door and the bar. My friend could hardly sit in her seat because the table was so close to the wall. We asked to be moved to the table next to us, which was empty, and we were told that another group was coming soon for that table. We had waited longer, which was infuriating. We were finally moved, and the waitress was very nice, the food was great, but the host was horrible at his job.
