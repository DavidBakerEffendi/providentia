Having moved to Los Angeles two years ago, I really miss the Tavern on Jane and would gladly pay a year's salary to have the place airlifted -- wholesale -- to Venice. A perfect local redoubt for a casual meal after work or a late night drink after dining elsewhere, the Tavern on Jane is dark, warm, friendly, and relaxed.  I used to come here to celebrate the end of a long week with my girlfriend, to commiserate a softball loss while still in uniform, or to shoot the breeze with some hungry friends who happened to be in the neighborhood. Food-wise, it's hard to go wrong with anything on the menu.   Unfortunately, I have yet to find Tavern on Jane's equivalent in L.A.  Anyone with direct working knowledge of this problem?  I'd be thrilled to hear from you...
