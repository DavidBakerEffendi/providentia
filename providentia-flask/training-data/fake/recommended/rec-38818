My friends and I stopped here as we had always passed it and the menu seemed fun and different. I ordered the fried chicken and kimchi half sandwich, my friend ordered the roast beef sandwich and my other friend the beer battered fish sandwich. We were not disappointed, everything was super flavorful and fresh! As soon as we were done chowing down we were already talking about the next time we would come back! Highly recommend!
