The first time I ate a crepe here was end of last semester, my last day of finals. SHAME ! I have been missing out on this all of Spring? A lonely Summer followed. I have been here 3 times ever since Fall semester started. So far I've had the Meat Lovers: full off different kinds of meat, including gyro meat. Not going to lie, the mass amount of feta in the middle was a bit overwhelming, I could do without it. Veggie: Recently turned Pescatarian, I went for this, and still was pleasantly surprised with the huge flavor. Did not miss the meat at all. Right after I ordered it, I realized they have a seafood crepe. Seafood: Assuming it would come with shrimps, I was a bit taken aback when I saw the mock lobster. Well who knew mock lobster could ever taste good, but it does in a crepe! I usually would throw up if i ate mock lobster, but this crepe absolutely tasted like seafood. And then I noticed they have tuna crepe? Looks like I can't efficiently scan the whole menu without missing something. Tuna: So I returned today to get the Tuna crepe. It was tuna salad [not sure why I was picturing slices of peppercorn crusted seared rare sushi grade tuna in my head]. It was pretty badass. The sauce was ranch? Not sure, might not be, whatever it was, totally worked. Also folks, I scanned the menu properly this time, din't miss anything! The consistency of the crepe itself is amazing, not to thin, not too thick or chewy, just enough to hold the goodies that are inside. Â The people working at the truck are pretty chill and flexible, I've tweaked my orders many times [i'm an indecisive soul] and they were absolutely cool about it. I always contemplate trying new food trucks, but not sure where I would find anything savory for $5 and $1 drink. Yeh, no joke, this is the best bang for your buck, both taste and portion-wise. Also I love watching these guys make the crepes.
