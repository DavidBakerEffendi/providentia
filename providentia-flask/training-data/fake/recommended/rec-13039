Long over due review. Every time I come to New York I visit this cart. Since my first visit they have expanded to 3 carts. This past 5 day visit we came to the Halal cart 3 separate times. Twice after the giants game and once after a night of drunken stupor. Not once have the chicken and rice let me down. So So So yums... Hot and steamy on a cold night this really hits the spot. We got lucky and didn't have to wait in the infamous long lines but at peak after clubbing and drinking hours be warned. Â  Don't forget the white and super crazy hot sauce!
