after reading the reviews this place seemed promising... I will admit that the pad Thai was very good! Everything else I ordered though was not seasoned well at all. I ordered the Â som tom( green papaya salad). There were too many burned peanuts on the top that overpowered the dish. Also the flavor sauce was not unlike any green papaya salad I've had before... which was not a good thing. very salty. I also ordered tom yum soup. It had these weird cloudy bits in it. it was not like traditional tom yum soup. I couldn't taste the lemon grass or galangal. tasted more like a sweet tomato pepper soup. Not awful but just not what i look for in Thai food. Won't be coming here again.
