Came here with my family to celebrate my birthday and boy was I happy that we did! I have to admit that this was our second choice for a restaurant. Our first choice had a one hour and 45 minute wait. Sunday night at 6:30... really?? Oh well. So the five of us walk into Miriam's and no wait for a table. Yeah! Pleasant and happy servers greet us with smiles. Even the bartender nodded. We got a great both in the back corner and loved the adorable ambiance throughout! We were all totally happy with what we ordered. I loved my pear salad! It was large enough for two to share. I don't agree with some of the other reviews that said the food was tasteless. I ordered the four small plates for $12 and felt as though each one was perfect and complimented each other with just the right spices and flavors. Overall, I was thrilled! I was a great dining experience and I will definitely be coming back!!
