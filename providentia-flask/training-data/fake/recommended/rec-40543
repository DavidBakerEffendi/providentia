Had a great brunch experience at Jones today! Our waitress Callie was amazing! She greeted us with a smile, had excellent recommendation including Bloody Mary mix-ins and entree selections and kept us updated on the progress of our food. She even "heard the blender going" and new my milkshake would be ready momentarily! A trip to Jones is not complete without monkey bread; my milkshake perfectly crafted and entrees were delicious. I recommend the make your own Bloody Mary's, chicken and waffles and huevos rancheros. The decor is fabulously 70s and welcoming! Definitely coming back!
