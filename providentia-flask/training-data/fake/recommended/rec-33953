I stumbled in here on Friday evening and it just happened to be Restaurant Week: my lucky day. The food was excellent, and there is a wonderful selection for Restaurant Week. They allow you to choose two appetizers from a list of about 14 and there about 8 choices for the main course. The best thing I tasted was this pancake like bread that was wrapped around veal bacon. Things that good shouldn't be allowed to exist. Essentially, it was like a super high-end McGriddle, but much tastier, which is saying something. The hummus was very good, and I am generally not a fan of hummus. The only hummus I have actually liked, I had during a trip to the Middle East. The ambiance is fine, a little dark for dinner though. I definitely suggest trying this place.
