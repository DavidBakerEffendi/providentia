Good food that offers flexibility on the menu. Although they come in small portion it's not good for peeps who wanna pig out since its kinda pricey, taste of food is mediocre but if you wanna guzzle or booze up, welcome! Staff are good and courteous. If you wanna experience the real taste of Filipino dishes this is not the place. It's Pinoy dishes made fancy...
