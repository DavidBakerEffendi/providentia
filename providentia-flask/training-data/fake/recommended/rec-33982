Pretentious a-holes. The epitome of everything wrong w gentrification. Being a native Brooklyn-nite, yes we still exist, I've known bk at its best. But since the hipster invasion, it appears that ppl and new businesses think they've made it better all the while capitalizing off of everything that makes bk great (diversity in food, ppl, culture) This place is no exception. Kiddos for blasting hip hop, so unique for the neighborhood. And the use of Biggie's phrase and the last business' awning is genious. Boycott if u have a soul or social conscious. It's new york, good food comes a dime a dozen w/o the ignorance. No shame in their game - blatant appropriation of everything Brooklyn.
