I'll start by saying that this is NOT a German beer hall (and it's not trying to be). Everyone seems to assume places with communal seating and beer are automatically German/Austrian beer halls. The name Dirck the Norseman comes from the first settler of Greenpoint (who happened to be Dutch). It's an homage to the neighborhood, not specifically the cuisine or beer. That being said, Dirck the Norseman has a lot to offer in a beautiful space. Chris Prout, the head brewer, is constantly brewing in the back and turning out a great diverse range of beers for all to enjoy. In addition to the beers made on premise, Dirck also sells several German and Belgian beers imported by Raven Import Co. There is also a FULL bar with every variety of liquor/wine you could want (not sure why others have said it's not a full bar). The food, which is prepared by the same people who own Peter's Since 1969 on Bedford Ave, includes several classics such as sausage and pig knuckle in addition to several other delicious menu items. Because the restaurant is a separate operation the food must be ordered at the counter and is then delivered to your table (not a big deal). Aside from the great beer and food, the atmosphere is really a selling point to this place. The three large glass "garage" doors making up the front of the establishment provide an amazing view of the city and East River - it's a great place to knock back a beer and watch the sunset. All-in-all I think Dirck the Norseman is an amazing new addition to the neighborhood and will continue to serve up some of the finest brews made in NYC.
