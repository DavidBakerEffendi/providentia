i had to be talked into going here. i'm not that adventurous of an eater to begin with and i often ignorantly assume vegan cuisine is bland, boring or slightly 'off' versions of traditionally non-vegan dishes. I've been proven wrong before but my visit to bunna has officially exiled that idea from my head for eternity! we shared the feast for two. i'd never even seen Ethiopian food before but thankfully my boyfriend warned me ("they're going to put different color blobs on a spongey bread plate, you can eat the whole thing"). the first thing i took into my sponge-bread utensil (injera) was the kedija selada. i coughed, teared up and had to take a moment to even process what happened in my mouth. it sounds like an exaggeration but i've literally never had such a huge amount of flavor in such a tiny amount of food in my life. it was a mix of very spicy and savory, slightly vinegary. i deemed it my favorite. most of the others were just as shockingly flavorful and delicious. there were 2 or 3 of the samples that were a bit more mild, which I appreciated when i needed a break from the stronger flavors of the other samples. the only sample I didn't like was keysir selata which isn't bunna's fault- I just hate beets. the feast is the perfect dish here, i don't know if I'd want an entire dish of any of the 9 selections because they're all so strong and because i couldn't choose one if i tried. if you take someone new to Ethiopian cuisine, the feast is perfect because they're bound to LOVE at least a few of the options. the restaurant is very casual and the service was just fine. to me, my visit was way more than just a meal, it was a learning experience and light culture immersion. so cool. can't wait to come back here and share this place with friends.
