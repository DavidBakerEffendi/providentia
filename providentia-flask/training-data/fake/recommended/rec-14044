This place never fails me for dinner or brunch. Most definitely the best paninis in the area. The bread is so crusty and delicious...two words I would not normally pair together. The trio fish cakes that they sometimes have on special are the best dish I've had there, but the grilled donuts are a close second. The only downside about this place is that the bottles of water are never cold. They are almost warmer than room temp.
