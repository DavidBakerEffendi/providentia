Oh my lord, is this place amazing! I typically don't eat a lot of Indian food as most places in the city are okay with a few outstanding exceptions like Devi. But this place....well, I just found a new favorite lunch spot! You can beat the prices; $5-6 for one roll and a discounted price for 2. I had the chicken tikka roll and it was out of this world!!! I'm definitely coming back for more!
