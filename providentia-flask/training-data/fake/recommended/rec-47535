This a cozy place on the lower east side that houses some of the tastiest treats in NYC. Highlights? The pretzels and the fried chicken are outstanding. Good beer selection (drafts and bottles) and a wide array of whiskeys. All the food was spot-on in terms of flavor and presentation. It is worth a trip from the boroughs or the 'burbs to try The Redhead.
