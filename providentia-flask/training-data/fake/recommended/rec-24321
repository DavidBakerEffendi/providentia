Absolute waste of time. Poorly managed.  Was doing our normal bounce around & eat apps at restaurants we haven't been to in a while & stepped in for a drink at midnight.  .  We wanted to sit in one of the 6 vacant hi-top booths in the bar area.  The young hostess told us it was only available if we had dinner only.  Im sorry, but dinner at midnight!!!?  GFY. Between 2 Our tab would have been 6-7 drinks, 3 apps & prob a dessert.  In lieu of seating us, she tells me i need to order two burgers or i couldn't be seated.  Ehhhh?? Absolute Stupid on the rocks.  So instead of adding $150 to their ring & a $30 tip for the server, we threw up deuces & will never go back. Resurrection Ale House came threw like they alway do.  Don't waste your time here. So many better run spots who are willing to accommodate folks willing to part with their coin.
