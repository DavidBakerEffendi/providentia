Oh wow, another five-star review, how terribly original. Sorry.  Actually, sorry that I'm not sorry.  This review isn't gunning for original or insightful or poetic or any other literature 101 concepts.  This is about how good Il Bambino is when it comes to what matters: putting food on a plate, enticing you to put said food in your mouth, and the subsequent yummy sounds you make as you eat the aforementioned food. I've been there twice in the past three days, including the days immediately proceeding and following Thanksgiving, a day notorious for food and such.  Thanksgiving Eve was a dinner trip with my fiancee: baby string beans, fingerling potato salad, artichoke panini, roast mushroom panini.  To say the food was good is to say that a lake is damp. My taste buds were in full-on humbuggery mode throughout Thanksgiving, since it wasn't food from Il Bambino--so we went back for brunch on Friday morning (and really, any place that offers a Friday brunch is obviously the best ever).  If you've never had a breakfast-y panini, you are basically a caveperson, but a fairly uncultured one at that.  You know the kind, they have a favorite rock, but it's the same old rock everybody has, and never really tries other types of rock for whatever silly reasons. I love my fiancee, but I would leave her for the peanut butter hot chocolate.  There.  I said it. Eat at Il Bambino or go fall off a cliff.  Those are your options.
