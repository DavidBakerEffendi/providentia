I waited in a line here for about 45 minutes.  Everyone said it's worth the wait.  They were right... it's definitely the type of pizza you'll only have here.  Very thin, lots of cheese... it tasted great.   But if you are like me-- and enjoy crispy crust-- so crispy you can hold it up by the larger end and it sits straight horizontal- then go elsewhere up the block on Henry.
