This is one of my go-to restaurants in tribeca. The sushi is good and high quality, but very pricey (I suggest Takahachi around the corner if you just want sushi). The ramen here is a very solid, tastes great and is moderately priced. However, I suggest ordering a plethora of their small plates and share them around (you'll get a great variety and most certainly taste something you weren't expecting to love). Definitely a nice atmosphere inside, would be good for a date. They also have some pretty good happy hour specials (for food and drinks), additionally on mondays their house ramen is $10.
