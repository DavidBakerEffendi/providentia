I love this plc!  The food is amazing anf thr prices are fabulous!  The portions are big I alwys have left overs... the seating is bumper to bumper but its overall a vreat plc.  Byob there Sangrias are delicious bring a bottle of wine fo pour in. Appetizers are indxpensive and just the right size for one person.  If you dont wanna deal with noise or crowd go earlier in the day.  I see ppl bring kids here but I dont recommend it the space is too tight.
