How have I not reviewed Corner Bistro?! I go regularly with friends and am never disappointed. My love for the McSorleys dark ale and their fries is well known among my social circle, and we always somehow end up there on quiet weekday nights to have drinks and a good time. I love places that lack pretense and everything from the old school jukebox to the old school bartender, Tom (whom I love, get him to tell you about himself he's absolutely fascinating!) makes this place one of my top favourites in the village. I can't personally account for the burger myself, but everyone I go with always sings it's praises. And at about $8 with all the fixins, it's impossible to go wrong. It's cash only and there's almost always a wait for tables, but $3 beers make time fly.
