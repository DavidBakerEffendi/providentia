After reading all the positive reviews, I was really excited to try this place.  Having lived in Midtown West area for the past 7 years, I would always trek down to Astor Place (Yakitori Taisho) when I needed a yakitori fix.  So when I read about this place, I was really excited because it was so close. We ended up there on Friday night, around 10pm.  Was told the wait was an hour.  We put our name on the list and wandered off.  We weren't seated till maybe 1 hour 15 mins.   We ordered several of the daily specials (kobe beef skewer, sweet potato tempura), skewers (pork, chicken meatball), this sashimi dish and stir fried udon.   What a disappointment - especially on a hungry stomach!  The food was mediocre at best.  Certainly not worth the wait (or the hype).  We noticed the majority of people inside were early 20s.... If you want yakitori, DO NOT go here.  The skewers at Yakitori Taisho are infinitely better.  Other dishes, all mediocre, No WOW factor.   This place may have been featured on a show, but it is seriously over-hyped and you can get much better food downtown.   On positive note, service was good and overall atmosphere was lively, even close to midnight.  And though food was mediocre, it still beats some of the crap in Times Square...so if it was really late at night and we just needed a place for a late night snack and some sake, I would recommend this place.   If you have more time, make a trip downtown.
