I've been there a shamefully high number of times over the years and I am pleasantly surprised that the quality of the food has remained impeccably high. Ever the minimalist, I keep it ultra simple and get a plain "old fashioned" and it is DIVINE. The crust is chewy and flavorful (a little yeasty in a good way), sauce (made of San Marzano tomatoes if memory serves me correctly) is savory yet a little sweet and cheese is the perfect, mild accompaniment to the perfect slice of pizza. Just like my nonexistent Nonna would make ;-)
