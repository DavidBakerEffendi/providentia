Be careful coming here during lunch time, the parking lot fills very very fast during 12pm-1pm. But whenever we are able to find parking, it is always so worth it! Been coming here for awhile now and still love their food EVERY SINGLE TIME. I love their pork or vegetable gyoza soup, spicy ramen, and their specialty rolls.. All so good! I know how quality sushi should taste, and this is definitely a top pick for me.
