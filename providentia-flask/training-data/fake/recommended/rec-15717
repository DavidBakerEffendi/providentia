OMG this was my first time at Public and it wont be my last. A friend and I went here for Sunday brunch, the place was pretty packed but we had a reservation so we didn't wait.  We each chose the brunch special which includes an alcoholic drink and coffee.  The food came out fast and we did enjoy our dishes.  Food was good and we had a great time!
