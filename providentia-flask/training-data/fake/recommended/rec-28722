I'm not one to throw away food, especially if it costs as much as it did at this place, and so I found myself SUFFERING through my baked chicken. How did they manage to bake a chicken that was as dry and tasteless as tissue paper? I went to public school in New York, and the trash those lunchladies pushed was gourmet compared to this. They serve better food in the Army; fact. I was absolutely floored by the prices they decided were acceptable for their food, which can only be described as bland and flavorless. HALF a chicken cost $9. Want a drink? $9.50 for a bottle of juice. Want a yummy healthy shake? $9. The prices reflect their pretentiousness, as the place is covered in self-promoting slogans and patrons equally as pretentious. And the environment... it's supposed to be a modern atmosphere? They have widescreen TVs that are constantly ON displaying a static non-changing menu (real earth-friendly) and mirrors everywhere so you can watch yourself eat. Lovely. Made me feel like I was eating in a bathroom. This place falls flat on its face with its promise to provide fresh, delicious, organic food. I was sorely disappointed by my visit, and was very unhappy paying so much for food that was so overhyped. Want delicious cruelty-free, organic, gluten-free, vegan Â food? Go to the Whole Foods at Union Square. Yeah, you read right. Go eat at a supermarket; I promise it'll be better. Not to put down Whole Foods. I love that place. Hu Kitchen is a dump.
