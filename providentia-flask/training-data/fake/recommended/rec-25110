The beer selection here is great! The wait staff can always make a great recommendation and I really appreciate the moderately priced sampler you can it if you're like me and can never make a decision! That's where the positive review ends. While the beer is great, the food is not. Every time I have gone my food has been consistently bland and/or sometimes even cold. Call me silly, but shouldn't cheese on cheese fries be melty instead of solid when it arrives? I try to avoid VPB but it seems like one of those place where we always go to grab a quick meal. For the sake of transparency, I do not eat beef or pork- my friends that do insist that their options that include beef and/or pork are wonderful (they go for the gravy fries) and so I'm sure they would have a much different perception of this restaurant. However, in terms of providing an inclusive menu, I don't think it's okay to really focus on half of the menu and shirk on the other.
