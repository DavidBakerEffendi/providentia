Again, now I've been here once and don't need to waste my time on future Philly culinary adventures. The meat and onions and whiz are better than the place across the street, but still not impressive. And at $9 a pop, so not worth it. Â The cheesesteak really should have more cheese, and better bread, then maybe I might a return trip, but I'm done for now.
