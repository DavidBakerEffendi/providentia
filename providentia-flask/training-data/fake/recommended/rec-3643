Very good burgers. Not everyone working here was friendly but our server was. Decent prices for huge cheese and bacon burgers served with lettuce pickles and onions that you will taste for days. Good prices on beer but we ordered wine and had sticker shock for not asking how much in advance ($9/glass). The place itself is the quid-essential old time Village pub...I loved it!
