I wish I could give this place 0 stars. One of the most appalling dining experiences of my life. Workers aren't friendly but that is to be expected with places like this. Food is just OK which is also to be expected. But the owner decorates the joint with racist and far right wing propaganda. NOT WHAT I WANT TO SEE WHEN IM WITH FAMILY TRYING TO ENJOY A MEAL. He is entitled to his opinions, but he should keep those racist stickers and signs out of my face when I am giving him MY business. Absolutely abysmal. Never again.
