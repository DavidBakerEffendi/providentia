Food was pretty good. We got potato & leek soup, grilled octopus, sheep's milk dumplings, and scallop risotto. The thing lacking about this place is ambience and service. It was casual but the seat we sat which was in the back of the restaurant was too noisy. We left immediately after finishing our food becuase we didn't want to stay any longer. Overall, since the food is pretty good we will try to come back when it's not so busy
