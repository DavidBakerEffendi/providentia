The wait on the weekends are terrible, but if you are craving the Glory Cakes with fruit - you wait!  Try the turkey sausage, it's a patty and is pretty amazing.  If you're nice and polite to the waitstaff, they're nice to you - easy enough people.   If you'd like to experience MG without the horror of a wait, check it out for lunch on a weekday afternoon.  I think that's when it's at its best.
