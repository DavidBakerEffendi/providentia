The food and service were excellent and for a reasonable price. I was seated on the second floor in an enclosed balcony. Seating was a little tight but I enjoyed the view. The complimentary bread, dip, and olives were very good. The wine menu features a large $25 bottle list if you feel like trying something new and not risking a big investment. I had the all you can eat past which includes a caesar salad or antipasto. I had the antipasto which featured a large variety of vegetables including spaghetti squash. The house also gave us a small plate of fried fish and chilled octopus salad that makes me hungry recalling it. The octopus was the best I've ever had, perfectly cooked. The pasta selections included homemade mushroom truffle ravioli, homemade farfalle in tomatoe sauce, and linguini in clam sauce. Each was great and the wait stuff continually brought out hot pans of more pasta until you're completely stuffed.
