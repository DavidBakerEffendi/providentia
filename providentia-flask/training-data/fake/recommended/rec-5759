OK, another 5-star review from me but what can I do? I have been at this place twice - first time in the evening, for a cup of coffee and a cake. They put us in a small backyard (patio) behind the main dining hall. The atmosphere was such that I felt like I was in Italy! Pictures of Italian landscapes painted on the walls, dark night, warm air... The dessert was an ordinary one (Tiramisu, I think), and cafe latte was truly delicious. Next time we came for dinner and that's when we got to try the food of this place. I think we had specials - Calamari (a huge one!) for appetizer, and then seafood pasta (don't remember the exact name) and Gnocchi Roberto. Everything was so delicious! Calamari simply melted in my mouth (it was stuffed with something really good but don't ask me what - ingredients is not my specialty) and the two pastas were very-well cooked, with the taste of Italy in all its splendor. One small touch that made the evening even brighter: we came without wine, and the manager kindly produced a bottle of wine and poured us two glasses (on the house). Capitalism-shmapitalism... When you really care about your clients - that's what you do. A very, very pleasant experience. Couldn't find any faults (although I tried hard):)
