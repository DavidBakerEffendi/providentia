The ambiance was great, the food was tasty, and the service was excellent.  We tried the fried goat cheese on toast, patatas braves, albondigas, gambas al ajillo, sliced steak, and chorizo wrapped witth potato.  All of our choices were delicious.  We ended the meal with the coconut flan. We went on a Thursday evening and enjoyed a flamenco show while we ate with great music.  It reminded me of being in Spain. Our server, Unua, was so accommodating and friendly.   We will definitely be back!
