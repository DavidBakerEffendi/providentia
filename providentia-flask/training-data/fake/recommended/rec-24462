I really love this place. It's a great Thursday night spot and one of my neighborhood favorites. The sliders, charcuterie, wine selection, atmosphere, and service are what stand out for me. I've never had to wait for a table or spot to sit even when I roll up with 4-5 people. Great nights have ended and started here.
