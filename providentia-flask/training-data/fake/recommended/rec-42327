It's a great place to go in the neighborhood but everything was pretty average (food, atmosphere). Didn't think the Korean fusion part was executed very well. The kimchi rice I had was pretty disastrous. The kimchi had not pickled yet and all I could taste was the red pepper paste and limp raw cabbage - not a great combo. The dumplings were good but rather forgettable. I really wanted to love this place, but the food fell short of expectations for sure.
