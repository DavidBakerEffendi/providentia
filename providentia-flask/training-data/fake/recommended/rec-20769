It's cute, clean, comfortable with nice decor, and it wasn't bad so i gave it a 2.  However, you're not missing anything. Save your hard earned $ and pass on this joint and try another soba/ramen eatery.  Their soup base was just okay.  It reminds me of some instant noodle soup flavoring packets that comes in the bag (which isn't bad).  We had the boiled pork appetizer and that's exactly what it tasted like...BOILED PORK!  Besides it being well arranged on the plate topped with scallions, it lacked flavor and about 5 more hours of slow braising.  Definitely pass on the boiled pork app!  On to the soba.  I had the chicken and chicken meatball soba (Kashiwa Soba I believe).  You ONLY GET ONE chicken meatball in your bowl.  The diced chicken tasted like it was diced and just boiled in your soup.  Once again, the chicken lacked flavor.  The soba was cooked to perfection.  We also had the pork with chicken meatball soba.  Needless to say, its the same.  They also charge for hot tea!  Most Japanese eateries don't charge for hot green tea with your meal.   For 2 sobas and 1 app, the bill came out to $40 (includes tip and tax).  If you're in the neighborhood and in the mood for some hot noodles.  I say take a hike.  A 3.5 block hike to be exact, to Big Wing Wong.  Spend $15 for 2 bowls of hot noodle(rice noodle, egg, noodle, and etc) with your favorite protein of bbq pork (my fav!), roasted duck, chicken, ship/pork wontons, and etc.   Hope this helps!
