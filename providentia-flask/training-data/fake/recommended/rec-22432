I was there with my wife and my kids. We had great pasta for the kids, and 2 "not bad" testy chicken burgers for me and for my wife. My wife asked the waitress clearly that she don't want pork in her burger, and after we got the food we found that they add pork in it. We ask them nicely if they can remove it, and they did, but without an apology! I worked in many places, I believe mistakes are part of human nature, but the thing I found it non-professional in this place was making an error and not apologizing.
