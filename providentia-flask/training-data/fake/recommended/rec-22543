I love Brooklyn Proper, and is the kind of place that's been missing from PPW. Charmingly decorated and pleasantly and knowledgeably staffed, my husband and I had one of the best dining experiences we've had in a long while when we stopped in on Sunday night. Our server, who turned out to be the owner, happily recommended wine that would pair well with our food and the correct number of plates (there's been a few reviews complaining about size/price, which I don't understand). Be prepared to order 6 or 7 plates as a couple - the point is to enjoy many things We shared the cucumber gazpacho, the little gem salad with watermelon radish, the roasted cauliflower, the sweet potato wedges, the duck three ways, and the beef Carpaccio. Everything was fresh, seasonal, healthful and flavorful. My favorites were probably the cucumber gazpacho and the duck three ways -- I think I moaned in pleasure more than once. For dessert, we shared fresh apricot, peaches, and blueberries with cr√®me fraiche, and Ginger was so kind as to mix us up several vermouth cocktails that would pair well with dessert and serve as fine after dinner drinks (we wound up having three apiece, we were enjoying ourselves so much). Items came out one at a time so you were able to savor flavors and nuances - we were never rushed. This place is small and has a beer and liquor license, and what Brooklyn Proper manages to do within these constraints is incredible - for example, I've never liked vermouth, nor realized much could be done with it besides splash it in your martini, and thankfully 'Proper' taught me the error of my ways. If you're looking for fresh, healthful, and inventive food - the way food should be -- this place is for you. Can't wait until they open for brunch, and look forward to enjoying many more meals here. Welcome to the neighborhood, Brooklyn Proper!
