Definitely above average, and although I can't say for sure maybe one of the best in town, but I was unpleasantly disappointed with my meal, whig included the much loved dan dan noodles. Points for byob status, chill waitstaff, huge tables in the basement, and a surly Mr. Han who will visit your table. Â I'm a bit spoiled after living next to a Grand Sichuan up north, so I may be back to amend this review as my search continues.
