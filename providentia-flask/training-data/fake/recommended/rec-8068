Let me start by saying that I had high expectations for this dinner.  After hearing so much buzz about Fitler Dining Room, I couldn't wait to try it out.  Perhaps my expectations were too high . . . Service was lacking.  I feel like I spent a good amount of time looking for a server.  Meal was sloooooww (nearly 2.5 hours and we didn't even get dessert).  Some of the food was quite good.  Most of it was mediocre at best.  Between my husband and I, we tried all four of the vegetable dishes.  Three of them were quite good.  One of them (the salad with bleu cheese dressing) was not.  I would have sent it back if I I weren't so hungry because we were already over an hour and a half into the meal when the third course arrived.  The entrees (duck and the sundried tomato and olive angilotti) were both pretty blah.  Considering the pricepoint (even setting aside the high expectations), I expect way more.  With so many better restaurants in the city, I wouldn't bother with Fitler Dining Room.
