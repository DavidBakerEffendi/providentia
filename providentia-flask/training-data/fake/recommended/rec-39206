My crepe obsession started here and everywhere I go, am always saying it's just not as great as my crepe truck at Temple U. Even though I graduated back in 2005, I still find myself driving quite a distance just to get the crepes. The crepe is thin yet thick enough where you can walk and eat at the same time. No utensils needed. Crispy yet chewy. You can get your crepe with basically whatever your heart desires. I have always gotten the Nutella strawberry but my friend ordered the peanut butter banana cup one today and omg... Amazing!!! Â And you just can't beat the price. $4-$6 between crepes and crepe and drink combo. Most places charge you almost double and it's just not as filling as The Creperie at Temple. I also got the very veggie crepe filled with tons of delicious veggies and a feta sauce. Again, everything is made fresh so customize as you like. They have every sauce and topping you can think of. Lunch time gets pretty crazy here so definitely call them to put your order in ahead of time.
