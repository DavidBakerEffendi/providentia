Great choice when you're not sure whether to eat dinner or just unsure of what you want to eat for dinner.  Either way, you're going to grab a ton of these delicious little morsels and not give a second thought cause at $1.50 ~ $2 per they're so damn cheap!  So gorge my dear friends!   Except for the turkey one.  That was pretty meh.  But definitely try the Nutella one! (and the Broccoli Cheddar one, if that's you're thing) But Remember: no credit cards so be sure to have cash
