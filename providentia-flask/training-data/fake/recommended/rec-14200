After hearing about the Bo Ssam (GIANT pork butt that feeds six and comes with a dozen oysters, korean rice, bib lettuce and all sorts of saucy kimchi-related goodies), I knew that there was nothing else I wanted to eat more during my stay in NY. The Bo Ssam costs $200, and it claims to feed six, but really, it feeds more like 8 or 9.  It was a gigantic hunk of porky heaven--miso glazed sweetness that fell off the bone.  Some parts of it were a little too fatty, some parts were a bit too crusty and dry, but that's just due to the random nature of pig meat composition, and really couldn't be helped. We also had the squid salad, which was OK, and the asparagus, which was also pretty good. In the end, our bill for a party of 7 came out to be something like $350 (fifty bucks a piece), including tip, and we were stuffed to the gills. I say it's worth the effort to call in and order the darn thing in advance.
