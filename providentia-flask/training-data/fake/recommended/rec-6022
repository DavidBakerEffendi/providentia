We loved this little spot right across from the TriBeCa Grand.  We enjoyed a glass of Barbara and some free slices of pizza that they put out for everyone at the bar.  The pizza was INCREDIBLE and I am a native New Yorker so that is saying something. Everyone there was really cool as well, two girls chatting away in Russian helped us and were totally on top of it. We'll be back for sure!
