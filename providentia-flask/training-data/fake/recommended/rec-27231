yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. i'm so glad i finally decided to try this place for brunch. we sidled up to the bar and made friends (i hope?) with scotty, who is a superb bartender. we let him take the wheel and he came up with some creative and tasty inventions. he's also just an all-around fun guy to chat up - a trait that's often lacking in the stuffier cocktail bar setting. i would recommend / reorder all of the things we had: waffle fries, pulled pork biscuits and gravy and brussels sprouts salad.
