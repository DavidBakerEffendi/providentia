If I was able to give 4.5 stars I would! This place is great. The structure in which this resturaunt sits is a genuine piece of history. The dining room makes you feel like you are home and there is a gorgeous sprawling fireplace that gives it that "country" charm. I have not had the opportunity to experience the outdoor area but will be back for sure to enjoy a nice spring evening! We were celebrating a family member's birthday and it was a very enjoyable meal! The waitress was fantastic, a real veteran in my eyes! Her reccomendations were spot on, especially the coconut cake! OMG the coconut cake, there are no words to even begin to desribe how AMAZING it is. I am truly not a dessert person and have high standards when it comes to them, but this was literally the best cake I've ever eaten in my life. Even my father (who is a baker/chef) agreed! And he is not easy to please! The appetizers were okay. We has the crab stack and shrimp cocktail. The shrimp was not my choice but I'm not sure you can realy be wowed by a shrimp cocktail lol. The crab stack sounded a lot better than it tasted. While the ingredients were fresh and you could undoubtedly taste the crab just felt like something was missing. Everyone at our table had a different type of steak. We had; 8 oz filet mignon topped with bleu cheese crumbles and a Port wine reduction sauce, filet mignon medallions with a mushroom wine sauce and grilled shrimp, steak frittes, and an 8 oz filet in a bourbon cream sauce with garlic mashed. All of the steaks were cooked PERFECTLY and exactly to our specifications. I personally had the steak frittes. I was in a blue cheese mood and I can tell you that they use excellent quality bluecheese. It was creamy and absolutely delicious!!! I sampled the sauces of everyone else I was dining with and the bourbon cream sauce will knock your socks off! I will be back for sure, and have requested the coconut cake for my next birthday!
