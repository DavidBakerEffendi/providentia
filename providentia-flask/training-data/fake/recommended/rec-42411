I had the Eggs Heritage, which was eggs benedict, but you know, named after the restaurant. It was very good. Admirable hollandaise. I tasted bits off the plates of those around me - delicious tender pancakes that did not at all resemble sponge. Blueberry muffins that took to butter very well. Decent capuccino, hot chocolate out of a machine, but it wasn't bad. Excellent cinnamon-y french toast. Our party of twenty landed on the one cook and one clerk one Sunday morning, and they did an admirable job taking care of us. They have a wide selection of house made bakery goods, salads and grilled and cold deli sandwiches. You order at the counter, they bring to the table, you bus your own table at the end. A great comfort for the weary, damp camper. I'll be back.
