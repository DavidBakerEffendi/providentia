I didn't realize how romantic this restaurant was.. if only I knew I was getting One if by Land (at least that's the way it was in the red room), I prob would've preferred to take a sig other.  Oh yeah, that's right.. I don't have one.  Rub it in, David. In any case, the food was so amazing and the dining room so pretty, I tried to hold my lady friend's hand by the end of the two-hour meal but she slapped it away.  Guess food isn't the greatest aphrodisiac for everyone.
