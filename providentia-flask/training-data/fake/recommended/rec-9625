Really great food. I had the pad kee-mao (spicy basil noodles), which is usually my staple at any Thai restaurant. This was definitely the best pad kee-mao I've had EVER, which is quite impressive. The noodles actually had spice, and as you were eating, you could taste all the different components of the dish that were put into it. I also tried the corn spring rolls and the curry puffs. The spring rolls were good, but they didn't taste any different from a normal spring roll. I felt like I was eating corn, but the taste was no different. The curry puff was really good and had a nice curry taste. The fried outside part was a little mushy and not as crispy as I would have liked, though. The reason this place gets 4/5 (because with the food, I'd have said 5), is because they canceled my friend's reservation, so we ended up having to wait. Also, it's REALLY loud in there and very dark, which personally I'm not a fan of. I'm definitely planning on being a regular for take-out, though!
