FIVE FIVE FIVE! One of the best meals I have had in NYC! I came in on a Friday night and had to wait for about 30 minutes which was pretty reasonable. To start we ordered the pulled pork buns which were great. They meat was extremely succulent and the buns were steamed to perfection. For our entrees we ordered the rib chop and the rice cakes with spicy pork sausage. The spicy pork sausage was delicious and was the perfect level of heat. My favorite dish was definitely the rib. It was prepared with lettuce, sunchokes and a cauliflower purée. The meat was cooked on the rare side which was perfect when dipped in the purée. The sunchokes and the lettuce added a refreshing element to the meal, which helped clean the palate in between each bite. I strongly recommend!
