El Vez is a place to be seen, but not heard.   Having walked past the restaurant several time, the colorful interior seemed fun and the booths along the window appeared whimsical.  We tried to get in on a Thursday night and we were told it would be a 45 minute wait.   We decided to try again on a Monday evening.  We were seated right away, in the mostly full dining room. The first thing I noticed was the noise level was quite high.  A combination of the "alternative" music with the chatter of the fellow dinners made it nearly impossible to hear what my dining partner was saying, let alone our server who was trying to tell us the specials.   I ordered the Pollo Annatto, it came on a sweet poblano with Chile Relleno on the side.  Both were quite good, very flavorful, without being too spicy.   My dining partner ordered the Calabaza Soup, which when it came out we were a little underwhelmed by the large, nearly empty bowl, with a few small quesadillas and pepitas.  The server then took what appeared to be a tea kettle and poured the tomato creme over the contents in the large bowl.  My friend found the soup to be quite filling, a good match for the Chicken Tacos that he ordered, which arrived as three smallish tacos.  The soup was a good complement to the tacos, and the two of these together were about the same price as my entree and filled him up.   The evening would have been better had it been easier to talk to one another, not a bad meal, but not a great social experience.
