We made a reservation (and noted our party contained a child) as soon as we could to take my parents and well behaved toddler to an early dinner. A few hours before we were supposed to have dinner, after our reservation has been confirmed, we got a call that they could not accommodate a toddler. Not great for our family friendly neighborhood. We ended up enjoying an amazing meal at Tinto!
