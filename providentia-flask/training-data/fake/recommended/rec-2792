I recently dined here and quite frankly, was not impressed. I made a reservation a week in advance for a party of 12. We showed up right on time, and were told "sorry, we dont have room for your party...we filled the dining room with the over-flow from happy hour" (extremly dissapointing). Our group spent the next hour at the bar (since we were unsuccessful in securing reservations anywhere else in the vacinity). We were finally seated and and still had to wait another half hour before the waiter would take our food order... not even allowing us to put in a few appetizers right when we sat down, so he could take the whole order at once. We were starving at this point. The food was good for the most part. I had the spicy BBQ duck flat bread and the buffalo wings, and both were enjoyable. A friend had the roastd beet and arugula salad, which was brought out Â un-dressed....(which was probably better off because the passion fruit vin. tasted like Kool Aid) and the shortrib flat bread, that was dry and flavorless. Other than that, everyone seemed to enjoy what they ordered ranging from duck fries, to mussels Aventinus, to the turkey club. Overall, expierence could have been better with a little effort from management. Dissapointing.
