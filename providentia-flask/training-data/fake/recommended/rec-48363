Stick with the Sicilian squares and you will not be disappointed.  They are the best I've had anywhere.  The regular pizza is very good, but not nearly as good as the squares.  One of the best pieces of pre-gentrification Brooklyn you can find.  Any old-timer from the area will surely know about it, and many drive from NJ and Staten Island just to go here.
