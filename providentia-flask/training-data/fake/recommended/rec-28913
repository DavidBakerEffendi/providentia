I actually enjoyed this place a lot. Their chocolate martini is FABULOUS, as are the desserts and hot chocolate. However, it is outrageously and laughably overpriced. I was floored at the prices and could not believe how expensive the menu items were, considering most of it is burgers and sandwiches and pasta and salads. The chocolate martini alone is $13. My friend and I got the mac and cheese (me) and the risotto (her), which cost $15 and $20, respectively. They were good, but nothing special whatsoever and absolutely not worth those prices. The mac & cheese is something I could have made at home for free or got in my local diner for a third of the price. In addition, all the tables in the place seemed really rickety; our drinks kept spilling whenever the table wobbled. Despite all that, I really loved the place and the desserts. I'd give it five stars if the prices made more sense. I definitely won't be going back there any time soon. It's just TOO damn expensive.
