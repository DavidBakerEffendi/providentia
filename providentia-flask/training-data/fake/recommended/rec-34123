I am in love with this place.  It was the very first restaurant in New Haven I ever went to, and I remain a fan to this day.  I'm a sucker for their coconut curry noodle soup, and their bubble teas are delicious!  Keep in mind, this is not 5-star dining.  It's very divey, and the prices reflect that.  But for $5-$7, you can get a HUGE bowl of noodles the size of your face.  It's a win-win.
