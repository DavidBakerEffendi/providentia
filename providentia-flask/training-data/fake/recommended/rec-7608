Two stars. Two miserable and measly stars. That's all I give this place, based on a brunch experience. Perhaps if the expectations were lower, definitely if the prices were not so exorbitant, I would think better of Dover, but that's not the case. This place had so much hype, you really expect a lot, but the best thing is the decor. The coffee is pretty good too as are the drinks. Â  But the food is just the same old same old and there isn't much selection. I can see what they are trying to do with this concept of very simple food that goes well together and contains high quality ingredients that are local and in season but the execution is so off. You're charging customers pretty steep prices and you're billing yourself as the next big thing all over eater and paid yelp reviews (so obvious) but it's just meh it's just aight. Plus the service is of that sort of snobby Brooklyn variety that you can only get away with if you've earned it. But you haven't, Dover. Plus my stomach felt a bit off. Make better, more interesting food or charge less. For just allright food I think I'll go to one of the many other amazing places here.
