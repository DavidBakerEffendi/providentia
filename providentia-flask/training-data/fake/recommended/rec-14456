Their grade was pending from the Health Dept but it wasn't scary-dirty inside at all. I know you can judge a book by its cover - front area can't be judged by what's in back but hey I came for the food! We ordered the dry hand pulled noodles with beef brisket and I'd definitely order it again. The beef was tender, moist, and full of flavor. The noodles were perfectly cooked and so tasty I could hardly stop eating them. The portion was huge, in my opinion, and only $6.25.
