Love, love, LOVE Moon Dog Cafe! We've been here many times for coffee or lunch and never leave disappointed. Lots of local, organic, vegetarian options. I haven't had anything on the menu that I don't like, though the portobello sandwich is a favorite of mine (and my husband's!). They also make their own hummus, which is fresh and delicious. All of their baked goods are heavenly....and hard to resist from their glass case display. The vibe of the restaurant is artsy and eclectic -- lots of local fares for sale (crafts, clothing, food, etc), and they feature various artists in the gallery in back. Yes, the vibe is a little hippy, but honestly this is everything you could hope to find in a small Vermont cafe.
