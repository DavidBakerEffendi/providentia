Really good and interesting food.  I'm not sure that I loved the ambiance, but I thought that some of the dishes were very tasty.  My favorite thing we ate all evening (and I know this sounds boring, but it was delicious) waas the Lebanese Thyme Salad.  It was really simple but it just blew my mind.  I also liked the Arnebeet Mekle (cauliflower - although I wish they had cut the cauliflower into slightly smaller pieces because some of the florets were dinosaur-sized), the duck kebab (we really wanted the duck shawarma but they were out so we got the kebab instead) and the mekanek (a very cinnamon-y lamb sausage).  The duck kebab was a hair away from being too sweet, but it worked.  The dessert we ordered was a little bizarre (little pistachio cookies with a licorice flavored marshmallow dip) and the octopus dish was just ok. So it wasn't my favorite meal, and I would give it 3.5 stars except that Yelp won't let me.  It was interesting enough that I rounded up to 4, rather than down to 3.  I'm not sure if I will be back, but I am glad that I went.
