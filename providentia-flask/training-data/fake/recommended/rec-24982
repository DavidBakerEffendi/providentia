My wife and I absolutely love the Bayou. It is very rare to find a manhattan quality restaurant in Staten Island, they're aren't many but this place is one of them. It is a place that serves a modern twist on Cajun food, the atmosphere makes you really feel like your in New Orleans. I recommend making a reservation because the downside of this place is it's size, very limited seating. I also suggest you try going for Sunday brunch, the menu and price are excellent.
