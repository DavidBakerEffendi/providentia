We went there on Friday night, and waited for 15mins to get the seat. Everything looked fine til the food came. All the food we ordered were disappointed. We had tge shrimp dumpling, takayori, beef tongue. Those were either too salty or stuffed with whole bunch of starch inside. Japanese cuisine was never supposed to be like that. I am way too disappointed
