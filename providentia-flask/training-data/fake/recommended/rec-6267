Kefi - Down to what their known for - or should be known for. The selection of their spreads - on the appetizer menu. The taste is indisputable. It was the best spread of baba ganoush, tatizki, and roasted red pepper dip I've ever eaten. The grilled octopus is also tasty. Everyone gets their panties in a bunch about the sheep milk dumplings w/ chorizo. It's that good! Think about it... it's sheeps milk! In it's own right sheep milk/cheese is not flavorful... if anything it's fair to argue it's mundane. If you don't know that you haven't eaten it before. The branzino is good but not great. This place is definitely worth it if you haven't been - but there are a select few places that deserve four and five star hype but sorry this joint simply is not one of them.
