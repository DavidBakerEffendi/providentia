Can the service be as bad a they say?  Yes.  They had their act together about 10 years ago when they had a dedicated waitress..but she's been gone a long time.  Have we waited 20 mins for drinks?  Yes?  Have we waited an hour for food?  Yes.  Is the quality worth it?  It was.  But as with other things in ths economy,portions got smaller and service slower.  We were long timers and frequent customers but it just was declining...and no longer merits our business or money.  Too bad.
