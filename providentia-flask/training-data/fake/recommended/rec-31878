I've been sampling various Bahn Mi around the city, Nicky's, Hanco, Saigon sandwiches, and Zon. I had high hopes for Xe May, but it was by far the worst so far. Had the Super Cub. Dry, over-toasted bread bread, dry, thin shredded carrots, a tiny piece of cucumber. No daikon, no herbs. Â On the positive side, the meats had some flavor, which kept them from a one star rating.
