The only reason im not giving this place FIVE STARS is simply because there are other places that can offer a similiar experience at a lower price point. The fact that my dish was slightly overseasoned also contributes to my rating. However we chose JL because we didn't want to wait for the 45 minute line at cafteria. The food? Simply amazing. The skate wing was perfectly cooked and the serving size was great. Buttery melt in your mouth tenderness with a touch of creamy citrusy sauce...absolutely divine. The service? Excellent, the place is small and the one waitress was fast, extremely polite, and above all had actually tasted the dishes I asked her to reccomend. The Verdict? This place is superb, slight expensive but well worth the experience...even better if they laid off the salt just a tad. However at about the same price point I was much more satisfied with JL than would have been with cafeteria. Excellent!
