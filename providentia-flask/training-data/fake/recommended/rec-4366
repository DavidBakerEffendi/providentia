Let's start off with he positive. The fries are really good. The hot dog itself is decent. Â However, the bread is blah and they screwed up 2 of the 4 hotdogs we ordered. I ordered a brat and they gave me a hot dog with mustard and sauerkraut. The other one was completely wrong. It was smothered with cole slaw and some weird sauce. I did not care for that one at all. Don't think it is worth giving it another shot.
