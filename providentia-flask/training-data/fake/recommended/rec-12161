Waaaaay too salty.   As another commenator noted, the atmosphere was nice and the service above average.  Certain dishes, however, were extremely salty (as in, no one in the kitchen was monitoring any of the sauces or dressings).  We started with the argula salad (nothing special and the simple vinegrette dressing was over-salted) and the potato crochetta (good).  We split two pastas (the fuselli and the gramigna).  Portions were on the smaller side, although we were warned by our waiter about that.  Both pasta dishes were way oversalted, which was disappointing.  The pork belly was excellent, as was the napolean.  Overall, we left feeling underwhelmed given the large bill and 3 out of 5 dishes other than dessert were seasoned so poorly.
