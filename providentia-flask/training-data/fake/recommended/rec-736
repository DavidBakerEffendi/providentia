The food was decent. My waffle fries were amazing. I ordered the jersey burger (turkey burger w/no taylor ham) and it was ok. Not too bad. But my main issue was the service. The service was AWFUL from beginning to end. I made reservations because my family and i wanted to go there (for the first time) to celebrate a special occasion. The waitress sat us at a tight corner 4 top right by the condiment station where the servers also put in orders. That was a no no...so we moved our seats to a bigger dining room. Our server was not friendly or knowledgable of the menu at all. she talked over us as we asked questions while making our order. she didnt bring ketchup and assumed we knew the different bbq sauces she just sat on the table and walked away. she didnt refill our sodas untii it was time to ask for the check. she was rude and unattentive. everything in me wanted to complain to the manager but my mom convinced me to just let it go for the moment. so i did. but i have to share this review because ppl need to know how awful the service is at this place. i'd consider going back but no time soon. probably not at all. i hope management sees this post. YOUR SERVERS SUCK!!!
