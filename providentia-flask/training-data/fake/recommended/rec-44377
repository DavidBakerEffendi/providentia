We came here in high hopes of a sublime Bloody experience, and left unsatisfied! The options for a Bloody Mary were creative and great in theory... But seriously lacked in execution.  So bad I couldn't even finish mine, as it left this awful taste in my mouth.   The food albeit hot, was greasy and a mess.  Our server was friendly, but lacked attention to detail, which included our water glasses that ran empty for over 15 minutes.  I asked for extra napkins to help with my messy burger and I'm still waiting for them.  It was busy, but we look forward to exploring Burlington's alternative brunch spots next visit.  Chalk it up to a bad day, but we won't be back.
