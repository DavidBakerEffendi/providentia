I'm surprised at all the rave reviews. We went to the waterbury one, and I was definitely not impressed. The atmosphere was good. Service was great too. Our waiter was attentive. The food on the other side was not that great at all. Most vegetable were deep fried, tasty but very oily. The heavy sauce covered any natural flavor the food has. You wouldn't be able to tell how fresh the food is given the way they are cooked. Small portions were expected. Charging for starter bread was a surprise. Overall, the food was not that good, and over-priced even by new york city standards.
