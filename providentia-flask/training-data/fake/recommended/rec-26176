thoroughly researched and read every comment on Yelp before going to this hole on Nassau St. I'm used to Subway sandwiches, so the price here as many pointed out is a bit steep, but their stuff is quite good. Â I'll have to go back there and try a few other stuff before coming to a conclusion, but so far I'm impressed.
