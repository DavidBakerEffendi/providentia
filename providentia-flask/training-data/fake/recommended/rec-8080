This review is only for their bubble tea. One day this weekend, I was sad that T-Bowl had closed (T-Bowl had some average bubble tea but some above average tapioca before they closed down probably cuz their rice bowls were wayy too expensive)  and a friend told me that Koreana served bubble tea in addition to their usual korean fast-ish-food.  Well, after attempting to get a lychee milk tea, I was told that lychee and milk "Just doesn't taste right".... oh really now? I always get lychee milk teas at other bubble tea places and they are fantastic.  Anyway, I settled on a $3.25 small "milk tea" original bubble tea, and after waiting 5 minutes for it, I took one sip and threw the entire thing out in the nearest garbage can.  Bubble tea SUCKS!!!  Don't even waste your time or money on the bubble tea here. The tapioca isn't great, but it's the taste of the heavy powder/or/something/metallic in the "tea" slash gross powdery sugar water that just didn't sit right with me. BLEUUUGHGHH!!
