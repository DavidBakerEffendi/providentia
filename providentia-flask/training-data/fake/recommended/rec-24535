Excellent, thoughtful dishes that are unique enough to make you remember the meal, and tasty enough to make you want to devour them. Very good service, classy and hip atmosphere. The sea bass dish and the vegetarian paella were both fantastic. The artichoke tapas was tasty but a bit too greasy for my liking. Reasonably priced for the quality of the food
