Horrible experience. Friends come over on Friday night 9/19/14 and decide they are hungry. Knowing bareburger is new in the area I take this as a perfect opportunity to try it. I walk in at 10:40pm and no host at the stand. He is wiping tables and says to me "sorry sir, but takeout only now." I was okay with that. I was going to make a six person order and take it back to my apt.... Only, when I get to the counter, 3 people leaning behind the counter look at me confused. When I say I'd like to make a takeout order, the guy says the kitchen is closed. I look at my watch and at the three booths that still have people eating.... And back at him. He musters out a "sorry." I then turned to leave and when I got half way to the door he said "sir, would you like to take a menu so that you can see what we have and come back later?" Really dude? No! What I'd like is to order actual food for the 5 hungry people at my apt from the restaurant I specifically came to try at 10:40 on a weekend night in center city. Â  I'd like to comment on the food, but I wasn't able to try it. Then I was met with bad customer service on top of it. Needless to say I won't be coming back to try the food. I took myself and my money out of the front door of bareburger and went to one of the many other places on walnut that weren't seemingly perturbed to see a customer walk into their establishment. Bad business guys...just bad business.
