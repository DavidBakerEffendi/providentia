Came here for a group dinner- they were very accommodating and made the night a pleasure! Pita and eggplant dip was on the table as soon as we sat down. The scallop appetizer special was delicious, must have been the butter sauce, but was a bit overpriced at 18$ compared to the rest of the items on the menu. The seafood couscous was delicious- plenty of fish and calamari, large prawns and fresh tomatoes in large Israeli couscous. Great atmosphere- bustling but not too loud on a Friday. Staff super attentive- reasonably priced bottles of house wine make this a good choice for a group dinner.
