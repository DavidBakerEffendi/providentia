Off the wall good!!! First off, the place was PACKED! great sign considering there is another seafood restaurant across the street which was pretty empty.  Full plate of olive oil soaked warm toasty bread accompanied with a full bowl of lemon wedges.  Ordered the calamari appetizer and crab stuffed filet.  The calamari was delicious and such a huge portion that I could barely eat the entree.  The filet was delicious, what i could eat of it, and the lemon potato side soooo YUMMY! will definitely go back to try the other dishes!!!
