Watching the whole season of Treme in a two week span gave me a serious hankering for some cajun/creole food.   We split the etouffee of the day (shrimp and crawfish) and a po boy.  At the server's suggestion, we got oyster & shrimp, which was a good call on her part. The etouffe was great.  The po boy was pretty good, could have used more remoulade and pickles.  The po boy's at 10th St Pourhouse were better (at least as I remember them; haven't had one there since I moved out of the neighborhood). Our server gave us a sample of the bread pudding, which was just enough to top off a great meal.  $20 (not including tip) for the two entrees and 2 sodas.  Awesome. PS.  Made me miss that New Orleans restaurant that used to be in the space Tequila's currently occupies -- anyone remember it from a million years ago?  They used to let people throw beads up into the tree in front... I can't remember the name of it.  If you know, pls message me, it's driving me nuts.
