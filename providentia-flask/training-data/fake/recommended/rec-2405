This is one of my favorite all-around places because it meets all (?) of my requirements: * Great bands * Great food * Great beers * Nice staff (except that one girl who wouldn't let us go backstage even though we were clearly WITH THE BAND) * Light up tables * Outdoor seating * Multiple floors * Tiny balcony * Never-fail parking spot on Girard * Dry ice smell. Haven't decided if this is good or bad but it is omnipresent.
