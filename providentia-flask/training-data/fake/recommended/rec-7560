I found this place absolutely charming.  Despite the small interior, it feels very airy and sunny, cheerful and quaint, adorned with pictures and knickknacks, staffed by friendly and very French servers.  I feel like all it needs is a waterfront view, a whiff of the sea, and a light patina of sand scraping underfoot. I had the socca as an appetizer -- finger-lickin', finger-singing chickpea pancakes -- and am currently so enamored with the simplicity and deliciousness of the dish that I need to locate some chickpea flour posthaste so I can recreate this myself.  Based on the other reviews here, I opted for La Bergere crepe, which was incredible.  Savory/sweet goat cheese... figs... delicious.  The accompanying salad was quite fresh, too, with a light basalmic vinagrette.  The olive oil they use is quite fragrant.  I wish I had the stomach space to enjoy dessert, but left feeling very satisfied, my mood much lighter than my wallet. I was a little wary about coming here by myself, especially at a fairly popular time (Saturday brunch), but I was treated kindly and respectfully all the same, and was able to leisurely enjoy my meal without being rushed out of the door to make way for more customers.  I felt this was in keeping with the French spirit, of which this restaurant possesses in spades.
