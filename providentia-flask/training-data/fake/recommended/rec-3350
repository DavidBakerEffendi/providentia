Visiting from south Florida I must say they have the best pollo a la brasa I've tried in the states. The flavor profile it's as close to the Pollo a la brasa in Peru that you're going to get. For this reason alone you should come and get your pollo on. The reason for the 3 stars is the rest of the food. Even though its good it still lacks some of the distinct flavor Peruvian food is know for. We ordered the Jalea familiar which was huge and can feed up to four ppl as your main dish. We were given a mountain of perfectly fried to golden perfection fish, mussels, calamari, and shrimp. On top of your seafood mountain you'll find an onion and tomato mixture which goes perfect with all that fried goodness.I personally would have like this to be seasoned a little more and to be served with lime wedges. We also ordered anticuchos which were served with potato and Peruvian corn. This is were the let down happened. Anticuchos are supposed to be extremely packed with flavor and what we got lacked that quality. They needed to either marinate them longer or vamp up the marinade they use. What seemed to be popular and very inexpensive at only $7.99 was their daily special. You got a huge bowl of chicken soup, the entree for the day was tallarin con pollo, and a salad. 90% of the restaurant ordered this and the portions were big. I would definitely keep coming back for their amazing pollo a la brasa. Also their cash only and no atm in plaza.
