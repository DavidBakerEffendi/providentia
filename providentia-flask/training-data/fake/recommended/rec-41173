This is truly a neighborhood gem which makes you covet the folks who live right down the street. If that's you, one can put their name in (for what always seems like an hour wait) and head home to relax before receiving the call that your table is ready. With the popularity of ramen spreading across the city it might seem overwhelming to choose the right place to indulge. Well if your headed to Chuko it won't disappoint. EVERYTHING is delicious. Here's my regular order: Kale Salad- you won't be bored with this version. The sweet and salty dressing combined with golden raisins and bits of tempura fried kale scattered amongst the fresh stuff is simply divine! Fried chicken wings- I always get a side of house made garlic hot sauce to pour over top. The only problem is that you don't get very many wings for the price. Veggie or miso ramen ADD pork (of course) and a side of kimchi to mix into the broth. Amazing. Good enough to eat in the middle of the summer! Other standouts are: the brussel sprouts and the pork buns (although these are not quite as good as Ippudos... I must be honest) The only reason Chuko loses a star is because of the small portion of chicken wings and the cash only policy. I find cash only places annoying! If you are gonna spend more that $20 at a place I think they should take cards, but that certainly won't stop me from going back! I just spent some time in the birthplace of Ramen- Sapporo Japan , and Chuko certainly holds it's own! The Japanese believe that eating hot soup in the summer cools you down. Try it tonight!
