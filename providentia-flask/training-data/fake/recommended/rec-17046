Overall, Cuban Pete's is an overrated restaurant. If you want to have quality Cuban food, I suggest that you find another restaurant in Union City or Paterson. The food at this restaurant was nothing spectacular, and the price to portion ratio is not justified. I had the Pollo Cubano which was suppose to be boneless according to the menu. The chicken was too dry for my taste and half of the plate was plantain. Least to mention, I was given the cheap parts of the chicken, leg and thigh. The restaurant has to lower to their prices or increase their portion size in order for me to find the value of going to Cuban Pete's. On a positive note, the wait service was good. Although the food took a while to be served, the waiter was very nice in attending to our needs. Also, the ambiance of the restaurant is quite unique in which you feel like you are transported to Havana. I believe that Cuban Pete's builds a lot of hype from the fact that they are located in a trendy neighborhood of Montclair. My recommendation for people thinking about going to Cuban Pete's is that it is a nice place to have a good experience with your food. However, do not come in with high expectations with the food itself!
