I've been to Bufad for take out more than once, but today was the first time I sat down for lunch. I had their lunch special: $7 for two slices of Roman-style pizza and a small bean salad with meat and cheese. I had one slice of amatriciana and potato, which was especially delightful because I wouldn't have expected potatoes on pizza. I also ordered vanilla gelato. It was just what I was looking for. My server was really friendly and attentive. I work in the neighborhood and Bufad made my lunch break all the more special. A sparkling water, two slices of premium pizza, one small salad, and one dessert later, I'm only out 14 dollars. Great place. I'll be back again!
