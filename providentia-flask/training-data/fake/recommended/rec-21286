Maialino 2 Lexington Avenue New York, NY 10010-5405 (212) 777-2410 Subway: 23 St maialinonyc.com ************************************** Overall Impression: Located just south of the Gramercy Park, Maialino is a Roman-style trattoria, a warm and comfortable place for any of it's guests - whether they wear a t-shirt or an impeccable suit. The restaurant is extremely well run and managed, as one might expect from any of the establishments owned by Danny Meyer. Maialino particularly excels at pastas, although the Primi and the wine program are remarkable in their own right. Maialino desserts can use some improvement, but other than that this restaurant is absolutely worth a visit, and for more than one reason.
