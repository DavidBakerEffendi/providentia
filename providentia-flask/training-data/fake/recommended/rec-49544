I've been wanting to try this restaurant for a while so it was fate that I was interning at a nearby hospital. Nurnberger Bierhaus was surprisingly busy every day I went and the service is top notch. The lunch menu is very affordable and the portions are big. I tried two different schnitzels. One was the jagerschnitzel and the other started with a "w" but I don't remember the name. Both of them ($9 each) were served with a large house salad and a side of homefries that were to die for. My coworker tried their pastrami sandwich which was served with fries that were always perfectly cooked and seasoned. Honestly I'd go back just for their potato side dishes! Too bad I only went during my lunch hours so I can't say much about their beer. Next time I'll go on a day off and grab a few beers with my delicious German food. Note: Maybe it's unusual for two small petite Asian women to dine in a German restaurant but the two times we went we got curious looks. It didn't deter me from going back though.
