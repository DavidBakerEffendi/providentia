Praise the Lord and pass the hot sauce! :) In an effort to get to know the neighborhood, I stopped by Peaches HotHouse on a cold and windy night. The place was tiny, and that's the reason I didn't give it 5 stars bc I'm tall and my bf is big too and we felt a little squished. However, the food was great, and my drink was stiff. Perfect. I love my spice, so I ordered the fried chicken "extra hot." Our server informed me that 'extra hot' is really hot and most people don't order it. I chickened out and changed my order to 'regular hot.' My bf felt he was a big man and ordered his chicken 'extra hot.' Â My chicken was perfectly juicy, spicy and crispy. How did they accomplish this?! I got the kale as my side and it was like kale braised in hot sauce. Awesome! My nose was running slightly (but in a good way). The cornbread that came alongside was pretty good but nothing to write home about. The service wasn't anything great, but it was friendly, and the place was surprisingly crowded for a weeknight. I guess Bed Stuy is hot! Great little neighborhood spot. Will definitely return. P.S. bf almost had to leave work the next day as a result of the x-tra hot chicken. haha..glad I passed it up. :)
