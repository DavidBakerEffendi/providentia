Got the poutine and almond crusted chicken tenders. Food was decent enough (VERY good honey mustard). Â Robot that served our food could use an upgrade. His emotion chip seemed to be malfunctioning. Would recommend programming him with higher level vocabulary. Only words he knew were "yea" and "mhm".
