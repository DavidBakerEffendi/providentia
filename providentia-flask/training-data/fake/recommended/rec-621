There are a ton of Thai places in Hell's Kitchen, but this place really does stand out. First and foremost, the decor and chic ambiance at this restaurant far surpasses any of the rest of the Thai places in the area, with prices comparable to many of the cheaper restaurants designed for take-out. Main dishes run anywhere from $8.50-20, and cocktails range from around $10-13. The Portions are huge, and served incredibly fast. Even better, it's actually GOOD Thai food! I was impressed with Room Service, mainly because of how well they treated our group of 15. I had made reservations a few hours in advance, and they set up a major portion of the back of the restaurant for us. The man I spoke to on the phone informed me that with a reservation greater than 10, they required a $20 minimum per person, requiring that we all order a bit more than just a meal. Okay, there was a worry that there would be some light eaters, but we went ahead with it anyway. When we arrived, the wait staff was friendly and attentive, and gladly helped us out when we had a few more friends arrive late. Most of us stuffed our faces, and there wasn't a face in the group that was unsatisfied with their meals! I think it's fair to say that their food was relatively well done with large portions, and their menu had plenty of options. I'm a big fan of their Tamarind Sauce with the Veggie Duck. With a group of 17, with drinks, meals, and some shared appetizers and desserts, we walked out with a bill of $25 a person- tax and tip included! Great place for a group- reasonably priced, cool vibe, great food, and great service. Thanks, Room Service!
