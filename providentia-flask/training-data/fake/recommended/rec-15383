I went to Uva on a dinner date based off of reading reviews on Yelp, and was really pleasantly surprised. The ambiance was excellent- we sat in the enclosed garden in the back, the service was good and the food was excellent. We shared some delicious bruschetta with ricotta and honey, and I had the gnocchi with ricotta for my main. All in all it was a very pleasant, intimate experience and very good for a date!
