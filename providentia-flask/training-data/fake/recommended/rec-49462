Going to keep this review short and sweet. Went here on a short trip to NYC. As a vegetarian, mostly vegan, always excited to check out veggie restaurants in the big city. I have a special fondness for american veggie sushi, as I lived in Japan for three years, as a vegetarian... and while delicious, I eventually got tired of my only options being: tamago, kanpyo, avocado, umeboshi, and cucumber. So is this traditional Japanese sushi? Clearly not. In Japan, you don't really see these crazy rolls with a million ingredients. They are pretty straight forward with it over there. Is Beyond Sushi trying to be a Japanese sushi joint? Clearly not. The food we had here was awesome, and quickly served. Guys behind the counter friendly. Hubbie said miso soup was amazing. Love all of the rolls. So much easier than making your own! We will definitely be coming here again on our next trip to New York.
