Love places that I could never find without a native, in this case, thanks to my cousin. This was Corner Bistro. It's an old bar/pub on the corner of course and you wait in line, passing by a stinky bathroom and getting pushed around as the wait staff maneuvers around you to get to the bar, kitchen and tables. There are a few more tables in the back, and you just patiently stand in line until it's your turn. They have the Bistro Burger, $7.50, which is their signature burger with bacon cooked to crispy perfection sitting right on top. I just ate up all the bacon first. Oops. Fries are simple. Menu only has that, hamburger, cheeseburger and grilled cheese cheese. Not much, but that's what makes it cool. They have a ton of beers, but all this lightweight got was a water. The wait staff are guys who don't waste time being nice, but get the job done and quickly. My kind of attitude. I'd rather you just be hard at work, than slacking off and wasting time and letting my food get cold. The burger is delicious, just the right size and not too pricey. Would rather wait here for a burger than in that ridiculous line for Shake Shack.
