Just ate here with friends and we all agree, this place is delicious and inviting. First of all, they make their own corn tortillas. That alone is my heart song! The guacamole is really good- lots of like and good seasoning. I split the fish and the pollo enchilado and both were really good. I'd definitely get the fish again! So tasty and lots of olives, lemon, and seasoning. I'll be back very soon for sure!
