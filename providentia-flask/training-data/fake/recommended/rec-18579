Must preface this with the fact that I did not in the end even get to eat here - Just wanted to send a message - When you walk in, there is no clear access to tables, or employees - there is no take out menu to be seen, and standing in the lobby for 5 minutes with a confused look on my face  (twice within the space of one hour no less) does not produce any help from the employees (are there any?) I think front of the house stuff like this is essential for any new business - I really wanted to eat there today - I live a block away - But it was essentially impossible , and it wasn't even crowded in there.  here's hoping that they figure this stuff out...
