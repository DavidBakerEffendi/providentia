I am forever a Pat's fan. I love everything about this sandwich, the bread, the meat, and the wiz. Every time I am in Philly, I stop over for a cheesesteak. There's not much to say about it. There is usually a line, which will give you time to formulate your order because you better have it figured out by the time you make it to the window. If it's cold out, bring your gloves because there is no indoor seating. Still worth it if you are in town!
