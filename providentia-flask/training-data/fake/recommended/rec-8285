I had dinner with my family at Marietta this past Saturday. It was a last minute second choice since the first restaurant we planned on going to was unable to accommodate our group of 8. Â This was the happiest I've ever been after a rejection. The food was amazing, the salmon dish was one of the best I've had. I sampled some of my nephew's fried chicken which was crispy and delicious. Everyone enjoyed their dish from the steak to the mussels. The atmosphere was great. The old school reggae playing in the background was a nice touch along with the candlelit tables. Makes you feel like you're in a different place and not this quiet unassuming block in Brooklyn.
