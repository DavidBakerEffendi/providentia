I'm from NJ so I've had my fair share of AMAZING pizza from the best and I'd have to say this hits home. This is the only place I get pizza from. I think their best pizza is their chicken finger pie with ranch sauce on top (you will not regret ordering this). Make sure to ask for it to be hot, only complaint I can say I have when I take out. GO!
