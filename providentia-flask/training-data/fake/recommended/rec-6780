As previous reviewers have said, amazing! Found parking down the street and walked in. As previously stated, total dive bar -which is awesome because I was there for the food! We sat down and ordered: roast beef combo for me, roast pork combo for my friend, gravy fries to share, and drinks. Fries came first and we dove in. Oh my goodness. Heaven on a plate. Worth every calorie! Then the sandwiches came (as big as the plates they come on!) which we topped with the horseradish and banana peppers on the table. If I thought the fries were delicious, the sandwich was better!!! Perfect. And it was not expensive at all! I will definitely be back!
