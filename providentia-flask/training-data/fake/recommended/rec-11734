My friend and I had possibly the rudest encounter with a staff member of any restaurant I've ever been to in NYC (and I've lived here 20 yrs). A simple request to switch tables within 5 minutes of sitting down (to the table literally next to us) was met with an 'well i'm not sure, this table is reserved, i don't think so but maybe--but I'll see what I can do but it might not work'. After consulting her iPad she says 'well I had to switch everything around--you see we have a 'system' and its not that easy but you can sit there but you'll have to be done at 8:30'. I have never ever in all my years been told that I will have to be done at a certain time (so basically 'get out') and her manner was so incredibly rude that I was frankly shocked. After that encounter we stayed in our original seats. The meal itself was great and the other staff were profession and nice. Too bad one rude redhead ruined the entire experience. The irony? The party that got seated at that table were only eating their main courses at 8:30 when we where leaving--and we didn't see them getting kicked out. Switching from a deuce to a deuce right next to us shouldn't be that complicated and it was actually quite infuriating to be spoken to in such a condescending passive aggressive manner. I will not be back. First time and last time. There are too many wonderful restaurants in NYC for this kind of attitude.
