Wholesome Greatness Locavore was the 2007 Word of the Year for the Oxford American Dictionary. Four years later, we're still singing the same grass-fed and trap-caught tune. And virtue is still delicious. Cookshop in Chelsea was where I dined last night and on this farm, we started with a round at the bar. The Cucumber-Jalapeno Margarita seemed like a safe enough bet, though we sent it back as it was overpoweringly spicy. The second attempt wasn't spicy enough, my suggestion would be to rethink the measures. My cocktail was the Cherry Orchard - a crisp summer cocktail with muddled black cherries and prosecco. I wished it were a bit more tart and tangy, but these palate preludes were ample lubrication for what came next. We began with the radishes and butter - crispy, bitter and delightful. Then the Montauk-caught squid with creme fraiche-orange vinaigrette, fennel, Cayuga Mills pinto beans and arugula - delicate and exquisite. The marinated beets, on a bed of field greens and goat milk feta were flavorful and the whole sea bass took the cake - literally, we were too full for dessert. E-I-E-I-Ommmm.
