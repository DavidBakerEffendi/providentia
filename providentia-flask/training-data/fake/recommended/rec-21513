What a sandwich!  My brother ordered from here while I meandered aimlessly around Reading Terminal Market, totally unable to make a decision.  I saw his sandwich and it looked so darn good...so I finally decided to go for it here.  My sandwich artist (that may be a faux pas here, sorry) was very cool and we had a nice chat while she put together my masterpiece. She let me try the house dressing first on a sample of bread.  I went for turkey with the works: house dressing, provolone, thinly sliced onion, roasted red peppers, hot Italian peppers, ARTICHOKES, romano and oregano.  Holy moly mo!  This was such a tasty experience, every bite full of many flavors, and very fresh.  The bread was excellent too.  Cannot go wrong here!
