I'd been waiting for months to finally go to Johnny Brenda's and I got a chance on Friday, thanks to the serendipitous union of Day 1 of Philly Beer Week and a band that I'd ACTUALLY HEARD OF on stage. I would probably go just about anywhere to see Gil Mantera's Party Dream, but the experience was definitely heightened by a concert space that reminded me of the spot where we'd go to see shows in college, with a good handful of my college friends in tow. I have to admit that I neglected to try any of the food, and didn't see anyone in the place noshing when I was there between eleven and two. That said, I will say the downstairs dining area was pleasantly clean, the waitstaff fairly attentive, and the menu boards were legible. It was Victory night, so I went for the summer ale. Good choice. Minus a few points just because this isn't exactly my favorite area of the city, but at least parking wasn't too difficult. Also, a word to the wise: Friday night is put out your trash night in this neighborhood.
