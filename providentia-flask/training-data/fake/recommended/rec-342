4.5/5 stars for me here. On a weekend morning, my girl and I found ourselves in Tompkins Square Park, as we usually do. We elected to walk south and east, a route we don't usually take. As we turned for home, we noticed this place. We took a look at the menu and we stepped in. The place is very inviting and has great curb appeal. Huge open windows and doors. Interior and exterior wooden tables in a bit of a rustic yet neat set up. We beat the brunch crowd, so we were shown a table right away without a reservation. We ordered some drinks and water for the table. The food on the surrounding tables looked super, which is always exciting! ​We started with the B4 Brunch Basket with Schmears, which I saw on just about every table and understand why. An incredible spread of buns and biscuits with a number of jams and schmears. I was torn between the Salmon Cake Eggs Benedict w/Baby Greens  and the Lemon Ricotta Pancake w/ Mixed Berries. I ended up going with the Salmon Cakes and I should have had the pancakes. Not to say the salmon was bad, because it was not at all, it was actually delicious, I was just not in the mood. My date had the Greek Omelette Feta & Spinach w/Baby Greens & Olives, which was awesome! I had more than one bite...more than two also.. We were in and out pretty quickly, not because we were rushed. I could have stayed all day with my wine and great food. I will be back for sure and recommend you to as well! Until next time..
