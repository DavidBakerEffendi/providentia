Kinda crazy that Bagel Stop doesn't have any reviews.   Anyways, I'm gonna make ordering easy on you: TEC + SPK I honestly* don't even know if there's anything else on the menu besides Taylor Ham**, egg, and cheese.  Add in some salt, pepper, and ketchup and you're golden.  I know you're gonna say, "Ketchup? For real?"  Trust me, I don't mess around with breakfast sandwiches.   Peter D. said to me one time that he's really glad he's not from NJ; I know, crazy, right? The thing is, Pete's probably never had Taylor Ham.  He's always "bacon this, bacon that", but John Taylor*** is rolling in his grave that such a pork connoisseur as Pete does not know about his gift to the world, Taylor Ham. Next time you guys find yourself in the wonderful place known as New Jersey, get yourself a Jersey Breakfast, you'll be glad you did. *: I'm lying. But the rest of the menu doesn't matter. **: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta… ***: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo…
