I visited here for brunch on a Sunday around 2pm with a friend. It was pretty crowded, so it took us around 20 minutes for us to get a table. It's a really inviting and clean place, and servers are good. We ordered mushroom benedicts, which were really delicious! I also saw the table next to us get the brussel sprout plate which looked amazing as well. I would definitely come back again to try some of their other dishes!
