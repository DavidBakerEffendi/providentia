Nothing about this place is good to me. Bottled salad dressing and jarred sauce would have been better! 1. The salad that came with dinner, they only offered garden salads and were unwilling to substitute a side ceasar salad so I just had the ceasar dressing on the wilted garden salad. The dressing was absolutely horrible. 2. Artichokes Francais were way too buttery. I never understood why you would place something fried(crispy) into liquid but I was dying for artichokes! 3. Eggplant Parmigiana was cut a bit thick, came out cold and was served skin on. Its not a good look. Peel it. But the nail in Brazi's coffin was the shitty service. SLOW as hell, failed to notice the piss warm beer they handed me... I don't see how people like this place at all.
