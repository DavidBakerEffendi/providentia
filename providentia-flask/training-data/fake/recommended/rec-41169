My wife and I were, for a long while, big fans of this place. But this time felt like so much laurel-resting... The menu's become smaller, and the dishes this time were more 'meh' than 'more!'. We did accept an early seating as apparently that was the only possible time for 3 of us... Yet the restaurant remained half empty for the 2 hours we were there. Service was dispassionate, the bill high. Sad to say that, with so many other options available in Manhattan, this may have been our last visit. It was fun here while it lasted.
