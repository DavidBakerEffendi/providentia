I had never had good tonkatsu outside of Japan--until I found this place. Don't get me wrong, this place isn't perfect. It's dingy, dusty, sticky, and the service by their South Asian waiters isn't good by any means.  Also, the food they serve isn't that great, either--for example, the meat can be chewy and cardboard-like at times, and the rice isn't that good at all. Still, this place serves the BEST TONKATSU in NYC. Period. I've tried tonkatsu at four-star Japanese restaurants, but none comes close.  Tonkatsu is hard to prepare, apparently because the oil temperature has to be super duper high--which most U.S. kitchens apparently cannot accomplish. So, if you want good tonkatsu, you must give this place a try.
