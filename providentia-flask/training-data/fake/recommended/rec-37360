Excellent food, great atmosphere, genuine people with great hospitality. Prices are wonderful and very* reasonable. A very relaxing place with free Wi-fi and a small outdoor patio for eating while relaxing and catching up on the latest happenings.I ordered breakfast. They even substituted egg whites for "no extra charge" like alot of places will. Â Give it a try. They even have free delivery. I also had a yummy iced mocha from here...very delish!* I love this place and will definitely return to sit out on the patio to relax while surfing on my tablet... :-)
