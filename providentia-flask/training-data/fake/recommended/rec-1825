Like some of the other reviewers stated there is no sign out front. This place has been here for many years and seems to be going strong.  Nicole b.'s review was dead-on. I pretty much felt the same way about this place. As I glanced over the menu, I thought the price of the combo plates were a bit high. The combo I had consisted of a taco, enchilada and tostada and cost $15.  It would have been nice if they threw a scoop of rice or some salad with the entree. The food was good. The chicken in the enchilada was tasty as was the enchilada sauce, I was just expecting something more for that price. The service wasn't that great. It looked like there was just one waiter working. Our pitcher of soda didn't come until after the entrees came out. It was hard to get the waiter because he was going back and forth to the kitchen. Also took a while to get the check. So the food was good, but a bit pricey and no side dish came with it and the service was off. I guess I was expecting more from Fiesta Hut.
