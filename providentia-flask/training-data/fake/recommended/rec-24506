If you are not afraid of spending couple of extra $, Salinas is a great restaurant to go to. Charming, intimate and warm place with abundance of flowers and candles. We had a Birthday party and as party was larger than six people had to order from the special menu. Manager was extremely accommodating to all my menu changes requests and daily change in number of the guests. We are not an easy to please crowed but owner did everything to accommodate our last minutes requests upon arrival. Stuff is knowledgeable, and friendly. Menu looked delicious on the paper and was even better on the table: branzino, aged ribaye steak,Pa Amb Oli,Patatas Bravas and everything else was of superb quality and taste. We are definitely coming back for more !
