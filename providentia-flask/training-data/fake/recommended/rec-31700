Probably the most overrated place I have ever been. First of all, it's a diner, so I'm not really sure why there was so much hype in the first place but after I saw it on Diner's, Drive In's, and Dives, I thought, "OK, I'll try it." The food was mediocre, at best, and the service was slow and forgetable. There are plenty of other diners that are better than this one that are closer to where I live. Definitely won't be making the trip back.
