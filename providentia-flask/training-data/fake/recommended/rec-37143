Order the 2007 'George' Pinot noir. So good. :) If you like chi-chi then this is a good spot.  We went here for dinner with friends. We had a lovely time. The meal was decent.  But the wine we had that night was divine.  So good that, it overshadowed the meal itself.  So while I left tipsy and happy, the food was as expected just not truly memorable for me.
