3.5 stars.   Good and fairly priced food is overshadowed by lazy service and long waits. Arrived at 6:30pm on a Friday in April 2008 and we had to wait approx 1.5 hours. Wow! You put your name and # on a list and they'll call you. But I suggest that you hang around the area b/c we got a seat early due to a party that was ahead of us not calling back immediately. Food was good except for the acclaimed grilled yellowtail collar. We found it bland. Wasabi shumai will clear your sinuses very quickly and painfully (the trick is to not breath through your nose when eating). Yakitoris are good and are about $1.50 to $2.50 each. The service is a bit lazy; they are slow and inefficient but friendly. There are about five flat screen TVs scattered around so you won't miss the latest yankees game. I'm a mets fan but I think most japanese are yankee fans.   I don't think I'll go back due to the long wait times which is not a fault of the restaurant.  I'm sure Anthony Bourdain didn't have to wait when he taped a show in this restaurant last year.  I'll make sure walk in with him the next time he's in town.
