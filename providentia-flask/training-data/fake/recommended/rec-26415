Brought visiting parents here. Cozy ambiance. Service was efficient, if completely invisible (were there specials? I have no idea.) Â The selection of spreads was a good starter for 4 to share. Crispy Cod with garlic potatoes and grilled tomato - awesome. Sheep's milk dumplings -- a nice dish. Parents got the pork tenderloin and tubular pasta - verdict was that it was okay, nothing special. Overall good experience. Would go back.
