Entering my third year of living in the land of "grinders" (a.k.a. subs, a.k.a. hoagies) A panino is one of the many things that I crave when make my way back to NY. Il Bambino did not disappoint in the slightest. I ordered the Porchetta, which was totally on the money. It was a nice mix between the Italian tradition, and modern ingredients, the spicy pickle slaw being one of the best parts of the sandwich. The aioli was also good, but I feel like there was a little Â too much of it. The offerings of beer and wine were also phenomenal. Will most definitely be coming back to try the crostini and the brunch.
