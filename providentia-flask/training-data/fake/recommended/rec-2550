Thanks for serving a great portion of heart attack on a plate!  Sandwich is greasy and yucky. I would give it negative stars for the inappropriate signage (this is America, please order in English).  Well Joe or Geno or whatever this clown's name is, I guess his ancestors knew English when they jumped over to Ellis Island from Italy! Go ahead and turn down business from minorities.  I don't know what business template he's operating on (bossy instructions on the website notwithstanding) but profit is a profit.  If you turn down all those people w/ "accents" or limited English, that's gotta hurt the bottom line. Eh whatever, this bilingual gal is taking her money somewhere else!
