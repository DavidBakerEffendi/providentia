Love the way the food is presented and the loud ambience. The food was good and excellent to try if you're new to Peruvian food, but I've had the same quality Peruvian food at a mom n pop restaurant in Los Angeles. A lot cheaper too. We were here for a friends birthday and we had a blast. We moved to the bar for drinks and they did not disappoint. Their signature drinks are worth a try.
