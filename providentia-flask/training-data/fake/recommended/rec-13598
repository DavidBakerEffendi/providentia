I always crave Joe's Shanghai when I'm in NY.  I've been here about 3 times already and I will continue to come back every time I'm in New York.  We don't have juicy pork dumplings as good as Joe's in California.  The first time I went to Joe's there was a wait.  The second time I went I ordered them to go and ate the outside the restaurant because I didn't want to wait for a table.   The third time NO WAIT at all!! 3rd time's a CHARM!! These dumplings are so big, plump, and juicy! I've had the pork dumplings and the crab and pork dumplings, but I prefer the pork ones better.  Eight pieces for $5, so worth the wait!!! Be prepared to eat with strangers!
