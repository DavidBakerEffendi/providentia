I'll be as honest as any comment here with no malice involve. The place seems to have plenty of business b/c wait times were an hour. The decor is very dated, needs a refresher like 10 years ago. The bathroom was absolutely hideous & offensive especially considering the menu is a bit pricey. While i love the crab corn chowder i doubt I would come again. I find it hard to support a business that doesnt take pride in it's look. Which means really I dont care about you the customer who helps keep this thing running & profitable. I personally want to know my dollar is going into a better food, visit & salary for workers not your damn yacht or Porsche only. I give it 2 stars for the chowder alone but its worthy of 4 alone. However the bathroom & decor takes so much from the experience. Decided to order crab cakes. EXCELLENT! fresh tasting, handmade not frozen bag stuff. Its ashame the food was so good in a drabby place like this.
