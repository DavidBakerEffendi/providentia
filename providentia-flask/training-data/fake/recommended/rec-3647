First of all, this is a mexican RESTAURANT, not just a taco place. That means the tacos AND everything else is really good, so don't just order your standard tacos, burrito, flautas, etc. Be adventurous and you won't be disappointed! On the brunch menu: My vegetarian Â friend ordered the 'eggless plato don'. As a meat-eater, even I was jealous of her impressively large selection of yummy toppings! I ordered the bistec, medium well done, with a sunny side egg on top. My meat was *perfect* and tender... incredible. It also came on top of delicious potato hash and a delicious salsa verde. My other friend ordered a torta, which I took a bite out of. The bread was so fresh that I'm convinced it must've been baked in house. All brunch items were $11.50, plus juice/tea/coffee and we received two plates of complimentary pastries - a buttery croissant and a sweet bun, wrapped in sugared flakey pastry. A small price to pay for a delicious meal, great setting, and service. We left very happy campers. Come early at 10:50am or so on a weekend and you'll have no line, no wait for your food, and an altogether fabulous experience. Otherwise, I can imagine the wait being annoying when you're hungry.
