I don't really understand the hype.  Maybe it's just because the neighborhood craves any kind of charm and this place offers a glimpse?  The food is fairly good.  The service was adequate.  But there wasn't anything memorable about it other than the fact that my friend walked over from her apt an hour before we met to put her name on the list for brunch.
