I LOVE THE HALAL GUYS. I got a combo, chicken and beef. Drenched that entire plate with WHITE SAUCE. OMG IT WAS ALL SO AMAZING. Beware of the red sauce! Spicy as shit! I only poured a little bit on my plate thinking it was equivalent to Taco Bell Fire Sauce but it burned so much. I would use extra caution! IT'S STRONG!
