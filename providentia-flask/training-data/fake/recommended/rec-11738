I loved my meal at Northern Spy. It was an absolutely highlight of my visit to NYC. Fresh, exquisite and thoughtful meals. Beautiful entree of beets with a hidden sorbet (divine) followed by a roast chicken and fried gnocchi main (I usually detest fried gnocchi but this was better than wonderful.) The food was colourful and delicious. A must try! And must go to again!
