The margherita with anchovies was arguably perfect in my book. The clam pie got a little dry and could have used a little more olive oil because the lemon didn't fully rehydrate it. I really liked it and would get it again, but it wasn't perfect like the margherita. So yeah, outstanding pizza here! Also, very cool bartender. I should go here more often.
