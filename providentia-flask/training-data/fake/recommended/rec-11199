I love this place. As a northern liberties resident you are surrounded by places to eat and fabulous brunch. This has become my friends go to location. Its delicious! Breakfast burrito & biscuit and gravy are easily the favorites among my friends, although I never heard anyone complain about anything they've gotten there. The atmosphere is very different from what you would expect at a typical bar, but I like it. They don't really have TVs to watch any games on, which is a shame cause they have great wings, but its really not that type of bar. The service there has always been great and the waitresses and bartenders actually act like people instead of just someone who comes and takes your order and leaves. Definitely a great place!
