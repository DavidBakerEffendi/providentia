I stopped by this place on Wednesday night with a friend after it was recommended by a coworker.  The food was good and the atmosphere was nice and relaxed.  There is nice picnic table seating outdoors but it was a little breezy that night so we opted for a booth inside.  I tried the wings and my friend had one of their cheese steak sandwiches.  My only complaint is with the waiter.  He took our orders and wasn't seen again until my drink sat empty for almost an hour and I was ready to go.  A little attention would have been nice....
