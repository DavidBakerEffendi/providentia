I happened to go to Eulogy just a few days after I returned from Belgium, where I visited a few similar places.  Eulogy has a very good selection of beer - lots of abbey ales that get almost no attention outside of Belgium but are very popular there.  They also have a wide selection of American beers (think Rogue, Stone, Anchor, and similar breweries).  The food is Belgian enough - twice fried fritjes, mussels, burgers, etc.  And it won't kill your wallet, either - not cheap, but you can get a pretty good beer for under $6, which is more than you can say for most bars in the US.  But take advantage of that fact, and don't order any of the cheap, watery domestic beers that they grudgingly serve - it'll cost you about $5, and the bartender is likely to growl a little when he brings it to you.
