The most amazing drinks...margaritas really. The tamarindo was my all time favorite and we had a lot of drinks that night.  If I had to choose the last drink I could consume before I died it would be Barrio Chino's tamarindo margarita!! Get ready for the spice!!! The food was decent.  Totally worth the wait and tight space.  Beautiful experience.
