I love this place and come here all the time, (cheap, very tasty, veggie items marked with green sticker, fast service) but today, i got a little container of spinach that tastes really gross!! it is kind of rancid, i don't know if it was left refrigerated overnight or what. but i tried to eat it and it made me gag. perhaps the bet bet is to stick to the fresh buffet food!
