If you like Greek food this is the place to go. The tables are a bit cramped together and there can be a wait on weekends but the food is first rate. We have been here on a number of occasions and it has never failed to satisfy. The chicken and lamb dishes are very good as are the Greek specialties such as spanakopita, grape leaves, Greek fries (cut like potato chips & topped with oregano & parmigan cheese). The salads and desserts are also first rate. Â The restaurant is also BYOB which is a plus.
