I've been wanting to try the food here for ages, so when I saw the truck parked on 38th & Broadway this morning, I was set to buy lunch from here. I finally went to the truck at 12.30, starving, and there was already a small line. They took my order quick and I got it within less than 15 minutes. I ordered the Merguez Couscous w/ Mint Ice Tea.. The couscous was A-MAZING!!!! It was fluffy and slightly more creamier than what I'm used to having. Piled on top with the spicy merguez & yummy vegg (squash, carrots, zucchini) it was perfection. The sauces are great, definitely go a bit heavy on it. If you don't like spicy, make sure to not get the spicy sauce because IT'S HOT! The mint tea was good, I liked the fact that they actually brew the tea with mint leaves. It's such a breath of fresh air to have Moroccan food in midtown, especially when you start getting bored with the food available around here. Next week I'm going to try their burger (which has been a great hit according to some of my coworkers) Now I am going to proceed to hide under my desk for a quick nap
