Every time I walk by Gueros there is a line out the door. Granted, the place isn't that big, but when I see a line like that, I think, "the food must be amazing." I finally decided to brave the line and ordered a quesadilla with steak. The tortilla was hard and so was the steak. I was less than impressed. I never went back in again for over a year. That changed one night after having drinks in the neighborhood, my friend decided we should have some tacos to soak up the alcohol. I suggested Chavela's but she had Gueros for their fried avocado and jalapeno taco on her mind so that's where we went. This time, I had the blackened catfish, fried chicken and fried shrimp tacos and became a Guero's addict. I didn't love the shrimp but the catfish and fried chicken were both good. Since then, I've tried the grilled chicken, brisket, grilled hangar steak, picadillo and el pastor.The catfish, fried chicken and brisket are my go-to order though I switch out the brisket for the picadillo if I'm in the mood for some crunch. The chips and guac are good size for sharing too. My one complaint is the salsa. There is no consistency. Sometimes it's just a tad spicy other times it's over the top, I can feel the burn in my ear canal spicy (that really happened. I had my head tilted sideways to eat my taco and a all of a sudden the side of my throat and ear canal felt like they were on fire. have never experienced something like that in my life!.) I guess sometimes decide to leave the jalapeno seeds in and sometimes they take them out. The trick to skipping the long line is to order over the phone and get there in 10 minutes or less so your tacos don't sit and get soggy. Guero's has gone from a place I continuously walked by to my go-to takeout spot.
