So I went left NYC with some friends around 5-6 pm got to Philly by 8 pm. This is all in consideration that I had class the next morning. Cheese steak experience was worth when you consider that there are two cheese steak joints adjacent to each other. HOWEVER, Pat's failed to melt its cheese. What is the point of quick service when the food is not completely cooked to its full potential. It was a disappointment. By this factor, Geno's is better. Sorry to dock Pat's but they failed on a key factor. I am hoping that what happened to my group was a rare occasion.
