One of the oldest bars in New York (est. 1817), the Ear Inn is a nice place to get a beer, a table and some friends together and enjoy the evening.  I was there on a Friday night.  The service is really good, for one thing.  After ordering at the bar, we had a waitress coming by every five minutes making sure we were ok.  There's a standard selection of good beers on tap (Stella & Brooklyn Lager are the only two I can remember off hand).  Flat screen TV for Yankee games.  At some point well past midnight, it got really crowded and noisy, but in the Eleven o'clock hour it was moderately full.   For a (very) old school New York experience, visit the Ear Inn.
