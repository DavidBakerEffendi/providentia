My girlfriend and I had a good time here and we shared a few decent appetizers...They had an ok prossecco. Overall the atmosphere was really nice, decadent meets romantic, definitely a place I would return or take a girl for a date...If I weren't a girl already. So take your woman to a cute, fun place or take me!! ( insert winking emoticon here)..:)
