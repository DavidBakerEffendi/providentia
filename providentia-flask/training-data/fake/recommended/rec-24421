We have visited the pleasant Chelsea spot several times, but due to traveling had not been for over a year. All I can say is they must be under new ownership, we were eagerly looking forward to their suckling pig, preceded by various appetizers, but arrived to find a completely different menu. No suckling pig, except in the form of appetizer mini sandwiches, and the whole menu is now a limited selection of tapas along with a few rice plates. The tapas we ordered were mediocre at best, but I was especially annoyed by a paella type vegetarian rice dish, which described succulent vegetables and arrived with some limp piecs of brocoli and canned straw mushrooms. The food was pretty bad, but what is worse is that no restaurant employee, from bus boy to waiter on up, appeared to be the slightest bit interested in hearing about our disappointment. This one's a no return for us.
