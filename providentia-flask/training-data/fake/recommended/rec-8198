I've been going here for years, and keep coming back again and again.  I highly recommend sticking with a full tasting of the appetizers.  They're always the best selections on the menu, and perfect to share with a few friends or a date. Go during the warmer months, when all the windows are open.  It's the perfect atmosphere. I always thought that the menu needed more frequent revisions, but all-in-all it's good.
