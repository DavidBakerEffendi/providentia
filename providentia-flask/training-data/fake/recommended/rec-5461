Cute little spot around the corner on South street. The staff is nice but not attentive or quick with their service. The food is good though. Fluffy pancakes. Fresh fruit smoothies. Good coffee. You cant go wrong with any of those choices. I so see this as a spot i will frequent on-the- go but no more dining in for me here because service is "eh"
