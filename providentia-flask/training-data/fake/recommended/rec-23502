Yes! This is a wonderful Mexican restaurant. I always forget the name of this place and so I call it the colorful Mexican place, because they are colorful on the inside and out! My husband and I live not even a mile away from El Bandido's, so we have eaten here several times. We've always been pleased withe food, service and atmosphere. My favorite item on the menu is the Enchiladas Mole Poblano. Before bringing the meal, the staff always brings chips and salsa (I wouldn't mind if the salsa was hotter) as well as a small cheese quesadilla. After the meal, they finish it off with a yummy banana chimichanga. It's not the cheapest Mexican restaurant, but I think the prices are very reasonable, especially considering how well they take care of you.
