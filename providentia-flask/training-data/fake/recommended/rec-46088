Are there previously 4 times and all was ok. The chicken Parm was saturated with too much cheese, not a sign of quality. Today had their sausage pizza. It was flat bread with a terrible sauce, if one would call it that serve cold.  The other party had pasta and meatballs. Meatballs were good but had too much gristle and the spaghetti looked day old. Lastly, the waitress as typical in these places worked hard at up charging, which was fine, but when she suggested freshly made cookies and we received stale cookies that was the final sign something has changed in this establishment. The quality and authentic Italian flavors do not exist here any longer. When I mentioned to the waitress the cookies were stale she mumbled something and ran away, then this bouncer type mgr came to our table stating no ever complained about the cookies or pizza in the past. At that point I realized I was wasting my time trying to help them by letting them know the problems that occurred. Lastly, that same mgr saw us struggle to get out of the restaurant with one door locked while I was pushing a wheelchair out,. No class and no quality. I should mention I know good Italian  cooking, as I'm Italian.
