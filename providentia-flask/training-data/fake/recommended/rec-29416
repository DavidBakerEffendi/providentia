The perfect place for a family meal following my nephew's birthday party.   Wish I had followed the previous Yelp reviewers' advice and gotten the breakfast burger.  Instead I opted for the Greek salad.  Nothing wrong with it but nothing special either.  Parents both ordered burgers and pronounced them excellent.  My dad is a burger fiend and both parents are obnoxiously fussy about their medium rares, so to actually get positive praise is huge. Personally I preferred the regular fries to the sweet potato ones.  Of course I ordered the sweet potato ones so I had to spend the meal sneaking regular fries off other peoples' plates!
