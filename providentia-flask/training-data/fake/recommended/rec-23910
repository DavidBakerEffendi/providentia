At this restaurant was first time that I tried goat. Maybe it was the delicious passionfruit margarita that made me do it, but I was pleasantly surprised. It reminded me of lamb, with a touch of gamey flavor, but it was tender like barbacoa.  The chips and duo of salsas are also great. The service was attentive with a touch of sass.  The waitress was a hipster who didn't eat meat and wasn't very helpful with meal suggestions because of that fact. The place was packed with a mix of young professionals and hipsters looking for a cheap meal and drinks.  Coming from DC, $5 for a margarita is a steal, especially with the variety of unique flavors available  I'll definitely be back!
