Excellent food w/ great New Orleans cuisine options such as Po Boy sandwiches w/ nice size shrimp lightly breaded, so you can see you're getting a FULL size shrimp & the flavor is amazingly tasty!! Also, the French bread for the Po Boy was very authentic since I am a native from New Orleans, I can tell for sure! Beignets were on point too! The rest of the food my family had from the half chicken, hamburger, sweet potatoe fries, baked beans, greens, banana foster pancakes..etc were ALL extremely flavorable & delicious!! Give this place a try..you will NOT regret it!! PS. I forgot to mention they have a very nice selection of VEGAN FOOD options & they taste soo GOOD! Someone in my party had the nachos w/ the vegan pulled pork option, I was blown away since the taste was soo yummy!!
