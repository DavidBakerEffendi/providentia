This is a tiny spot so be prepared to wait and sit very close with someone else like you're in the same party close. If you're sitting in one of the small tables be prepared to get up if someone needs to leave as well. It's also very noisy so you have to talk loud or be very close to someone to hear. Â  But the wait staff is friendly and service is very quick. Of course after reading the reviews I had to try the corn which was sweet, nicely roasted and had the perfect saltiness from the cheese. Because so many people order the corn it's prepared ahead of time and comes out almost instantly. The fish tacos were fresh and tasty. Cuban sandwich was flavorful with the right amount of meat and crunchy on the outside. I enjoy the food but I would not go on a hot summer day or during peak hours.
