While visiting Philly, I found Rybread via Yelp. Rybread is a great little sandwich shop in a narrow space along Fairmont Avenue between 23rd and 24th streets in the Art/Museum district.  It's right down the road from the Eastern State Penitentiary, a former American prison. There are a couple tables on the left hand side when you walk in and a HUGE blackboard menu behind them.  You take one step up and place your order.  There are additional tables in the front of the store, as well as seating in an outdoor patio out back. While I understand the architectures of Philly row houses -- everything feels tight,cramped, no place to stand -- people don't know if you are waiting or trying to place an order.  The overall seating capacity is pretty small, and so you might be "popping a squat" on the curb if you intend on eating there. The sandwiches are generally good to great.  There's some variability in the quantity/quality of what you get when you order, so your mileage may vary here. A breakfast sandwich, sausage, egg, cheese on Everything bagel was very good. The Rybread, the signature crabcake and chipotle mayo sandwich, was very good. The "San Antonio", the roast beef and cheddar, was good but boring. Some were better than others, and because of the drastic number of items on the menu, there's just no consistency of the quality. They should review all menu items, eliminate the ones that look like they could have been made at home.  Rybread needs more custom dressings, special breads, and don't be afraid to put some meat on the sandwiches. I would still recommend Rybread, but don't be too surprised if you end up with a "regular" deli sandwich for $8-$9.
