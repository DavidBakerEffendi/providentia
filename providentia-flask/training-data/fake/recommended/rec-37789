Stumbled into here on a sunny weekend morning after playing a round of Yelp roulette with the "near you" feature. What a great find! The food here was hearty, delicious and fresh. I had the sausage and egg brioche - two delicious slabs of hot buttered brioche toast, stacked with sriracha turkey sausage, blue cheese, fried eggs and arugula. It was perfect. This may be an odd comment, but it's a shame this place doesn't have a catchier name. It's a bit off the beaten path as it is, and the name is so generic that it doesn't really stick in your head. I kept trying to remember "that place from the other weekend" when talking about it recently.
