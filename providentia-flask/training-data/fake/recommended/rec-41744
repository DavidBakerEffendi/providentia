My boyfriend and I often go to gueros and have a great experience with great food, tonight was nothing like that. Three girls were at the register taking orders, handing out orders, ect... We waited on a short line, ordered our food and grabbed a table. After a long wait and one wrong order brought to our table, my boyfriend got his three tacos, I was told mine would be right out. He started eating, not wanting them to get cold, and I patiently waited on mine while keeping an eye on the waitresses. They looked extremely frazzled the entire time, no one had a clue what was going on and one stood around not doing a thing. My boyfriend finished his tacos and mine were nowhere in sight and no one came to apologize. I approached the girls and said I wanted my money back, they didn't even know what I was waiting on. I got my money refunded, got no apology, and nothing to compensate. It was 8:20 when we ordered our food and sat down, at 9:00 my boyfriend finished his food. I'm extremely upset by the service, THE PLACE WASNT EVEN BUSY. We've been in this place when it's packed, not a seat around, and have gotten our food much quicker and had much better service. Not planning to visit gueros again anytime soon. And to top it all off a roach was on the seat of the table next to us who had equally as bad an experience.
