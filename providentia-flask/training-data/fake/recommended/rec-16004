Last evening we returned for our 3rd visit to Trading Post. This time with my daughter and future son in law who are moving here from Florida. This place is consistently outstanding!! We chose to be seated in the rear area of the 1st floor bar in a cozy, private booth for 4. As I mentioned previously, I LOVE  the decor of the entire restaurant! We enjoyed 2 of their specialty cocktails, a bottle of wine and a craft draft beer (they have an impressive list of draft beers!!) The autumn kale salad was divine, perfectly dressed, with generous portions of Gorgonzola, nuts and dried cranberries. Additionally we couldn't pass up having the four cheese flatbread again. For main courses we ordered  the filet, short ribs and the steak and shrimp special, ALL PERFECTLY prepared!! Equally as important, the staff treated us like royalty!! As we were leaving we noticed the cleverest dining nook tucked at the end of the bar with not only a dining area for 2, but 2 bar stools (an amazing place for a special occasion! Sam, the owner, (was dining adjacent to this area) introduced himself and clued us in to the pocket doors you can utilize in this area for a special private moment!! He was extremely warm and friendly, and extremely grateful to hear how we adore his new venture!! Can't wait to return!!!!
