Ugh it's true, you will wait and wait for a while but as my friends rolled off their red eye flights and we walked down here from my other friend's place on St. Mark's and A, it was well worth the wait. Morning cocktails in hand, the worst part of Clinton St. was really choosing what we'd all order to make sure we would all get the chance to steal off other plates and try more things. With over 800 reviews I'm not going to tell you anything groundbreaking here but the service was friendly, the food was delicious, the location is cute and homey and I will certainly be back again!
