Been coming to this place for years, overall all the food and drinks are pretty good. But with the lack of consistency in staff with poor customer service I feel myself really not eating here as much as I used to which was 2-3 times a week. I rather drink at the bar and eat somewhere I feel my money is being appreciated all around. Hire better waitresses/hostesses/and that lady manager has a pissy attitude. Bar tenders are usually cool!
