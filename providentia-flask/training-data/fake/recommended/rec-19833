Well, what can I tell you?  If you are looking for a bad customer service, that's the place to go.  We are regulars to Park Slope brunch places and recently discovered Juventino.   We came there once and everything was fine.  We came again with a group of friends and due to the wait were told to wait outside since we were "in the way" (and it was not said in a nice way basically making us feel like we are there to beg for food).   This time to avoid the wait we made reservations for 7 people and were told on the phone that "you only have 5 minutes, if you are late, your table will be given away".  So, ok (eventhough in NY you can never be on time due to trafic and stuff.  Later that day we wanted to add 1 more friend and made the change over the phone.  So our reservation was for 11:30, 5 of us got there at 11:27 and told the owner our remaining 3 people are running 5-10 minutes late but if needed, we can order for them.  He was not happy (the table was already set for us) and started to lecture us on how first we called and had to change the number of people (like, dude, more business for you, don't you think) and then how people first make reservations and then some people cancel and we were told and did not follow the rules, we all felt like we were not in a restaurant where we PAY our money to get service but in college being lectured by a professor.  Guess what?  We said that was the worst customer service we have had in a long time and we would take our money elsewhere (and him loosing $300-400 on our order).  O well, his loss, Stone Park Cafe gain, we came and with no reservation and their Sunday busy schedule we were nicely told that no problems, if you can wait 5-10 minutes we will sit you.  So take your money where you are treated with respect.  I bet this place will not live long with such treatment.
