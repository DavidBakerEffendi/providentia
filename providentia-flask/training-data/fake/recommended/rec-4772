Bill's is amazing! My coworkers and I go for breakfast often! We all normally get the omelette's which come with toast and home fires or grits. The pricing is fantastic and the customer service is above average. I would definitely recommend to everyone!! Oh, and call ahead to place your order to avoid a long wait. UPDATE: I had to come back and change my rating to 3 stars... I think Bill's has nice staff and they're affordable... just not too healthy and the consistency was off. It's hit or miss with this place..
