Seriously the best ramen I've ever had. ever. EVER. I'm glad it has remained under the radar for so long because it is Pro-Heights' best kept secret. This is my go-to spot to bring out of town visitors, and they friggin love it. And that actually makes me seem cooler for knowing about this fine place. So i'm a hip Brooklynite now, and that's great! Thanks Chuko! FOOD: The kale salad is excellent, I order it every single time. My girl and I chopstick-sword-fight over the deep fried pieces. The buns are warm and delightful. move over baohaus. The miso ramen is next level good. The last few spoonfuls of broth taste like candy. My favorite dish is the Mazemen. It's brothless noodles, and tastes out of this world. It's only around during the hotter months which is upsetting, but I'll live. Damn it's good.
