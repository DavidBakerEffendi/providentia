I have traveled the world and dined at the top restaurants in the country (Per Se, Landmarc, Le Bernadin, Alex, Bouchon...just to name a few) and I would put the restaurant in the same category. The food combinations were unique and beyond delicious, and the garden was one of the most romantic places I have ever dined.  The wait staff was knowledgeable and made the experience very pleasant.   I can't believe that this amazing place is just down the street, I cannot wait to head back and try even more on the menu! MUST HAVES crab cakes were one for the books, life altering ... do not miss out! Hazelnut Latte - I do not drink coffee but wanted to try something different... i am now having dreams about this deliciousness.
