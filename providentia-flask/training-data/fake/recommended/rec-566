Alta has a great tapas menu, you pretty much can't go wrong with your order. I had tried a few of their cocktails and thought the Spanish Manhattan was great. This place has a great deal if you go with a few friends, for $480 you can order the entire menu and try a little bit of everything. With their wine, beer, cocktail selection, and Sangrias, this place is sure to be a good time.
