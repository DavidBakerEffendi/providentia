Had to log in and write a review after reading some of the bad reviews of Chuko, the new little Ramen celebrity in Prospect Heights. Waitstaff was attentive, and knowledgeable about every item. When a brand new restaurant tells you they've "run out of food" or are "filled to capacity," and you don't know what that means, you've never worked in the service industry. True pork bone ramen takes at least 3-5 hours to make, even in a pressure cooker. Running out of soup is not unheard of even at established popular Ramen restaurants. Chuko gets their Tonkotsu ramen spot on. If your pork bone ramen is not rich, creamy, and milky, walk out. When you order a pork bone ramen and complain that the consistency is thick or milky, you don't know what you're talking about. Go back to the ramen places that cater to non-cooks and white-people food. This ramen broth is called Tonkotsu, and is literally the first thing you should look for at a Ramen place. An egg in your ramen should never be ANYTHING but poached or soft boiled. A hard boiled egg in ramen is a travesty and Chuko get's it right. $12 is not an overprice bowl here. The quality is evident in every single ingredient. This is not a ramen factory that can give you a $9 bowl the size of your entire expanded stomach. My complaints: $7 for a single pork bun. It was good, but there should honestly be 2 in a serving. If you come in and order drinks, it will be an expensive tab. Expect this. Or walk in, get a bowl, and walk out having spent $15 for real quality food. It's best to come when it's really busy, so the chefs are feeling the rush and getting their groove on. I came one day when they just opened their doors, and my ramen was warm but not hot. With that said, during the rush you may wait a little longer than you'd expect for your ramen to come out of the kitchen. Hence the 4 not 5 star review.
