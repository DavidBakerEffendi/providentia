Pleasant, interesting place.  Great Lebanese wine list (yep, you heard me, Lebanese wine).  The servers were very helpful and friendly and greatly assisted us in navigating the menu. The meat dishes were just acceptable, not bad, not good, just acceptable.  The smaller tapas type dishes were standouts. I'll probably be back, and go with no skewer plate, and I am sure I'll be happier.
