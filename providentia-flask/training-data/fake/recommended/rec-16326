Really good noodles if you are into spicy foods, or if you are not, and prefer vegetarian, try the vegetables noodles. The Chinese buns, tea eggs and scallion pancakes are good, too. Sometimes, I would order sweet potato congee, just because I prefer plain simple foods to spicy and flavorful dishes.
