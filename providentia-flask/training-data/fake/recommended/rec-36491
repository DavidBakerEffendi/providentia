3.5 stars -- the food was GREAT (thus, rounding up!), but the service... not so much. My friend and I arrived on Saturday morning a little after 10. I knew this meant a long wait, but we did it anyway. There is a prix-fixe is $14.50 and each entree comes with coffee/tea and juice OR the apple cider mimosa. I should have tried the mimosa... The wait was about 45 minutes, which was not too bad. Unfortunately, there is not much around Penelope to see or do. My friend and I walked around a bit and just came back and waited in the small "lobby" area. Bonus points to Penelope for free coffee while waiting, though! The FOOD was great. I had a hard time making a decision between the Nutella French Toast and the Punkin' Waffles, and made the difficult choice to go with the Nutella French Toast which came with a side of fresh fruit (strawberries, blueberries, and melon). The french toast was actual french bread. Parts of it were a little hard to chew, but overall it was yum. My friend ordered the Salmon Wrapped Poached Eggs which was served with a salad. The salad dressing was delicious - very light but just the right amount of flavor. I tried a bite of her eggs and salmon, which were very good as well. The smoked salmon was not too salty (as it can be sometimes) and the eggs were perfectly poached. My only quibble was the server. She was stonefaced and when I asked for coffee/tea halfway through our meal she told me that I had not asked for it when I ordered. But yes, I could still have some. Then, I asked what kind of tea she had and she asked what I wanted because they had many choices. My friend wanted some fruit tea, but alas -- none. We both went with green tea.
