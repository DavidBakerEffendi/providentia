Lovely patio with great service. We took our six-month-old puppy for a 5 mile walk and wanted to grab a bite to eat as we approached the Chelsea Piers area. Surprisingly, Cookshop popped up on Yelp as a potentially dog-friendly spot. I called and they indeed said dogs are welcome on the patio. Hooray! Being a Hundred Acres fan, I was happy to try Cookshop. We waited about an hour at 11:30 on a holiday weekend which wasn't terrible. They kept updating us and even brought out a fancy dog biscuit from their pastry chef to keep our pup happy. We sat down and they brought us the Jalapeno Cheese Cornbread & Honey Bun gratis for our wait. Wow, thanks! Both were great - not too heavy for breakfast breads. I ordered the Carolina White Shrimp (fennel, grapefruit, yum) the hubs ordered the Cascun Farms Chicken Breast Salad, which was great. We lean paleo for most of the time and these are both solid options for those avoiding carbs. (Ha - please disregard our demolishing of free breakfast breads. Oops.) What caught me by surprise was a fun menu of 'mocktails' which I happily ordered as we had a big walk to continue. I had the Grilled Grapefruit Faux-ito which was super fresh tasting and not too sweet. Husband got a ginger beer. All in all a great experience!
