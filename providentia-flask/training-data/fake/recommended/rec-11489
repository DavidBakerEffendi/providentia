Food was excellent and the staff was very nice. I don't understand the bad reviews here at all... most are related to service which seemed fine to us. Aside from that the pizza is just as good if not better than La Piazza in Allentown or The Vault in Bordentown. We ordered three brick oven pies and an amazing stromboli.
