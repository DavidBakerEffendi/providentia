I've ate a lot of Chicken and Waffles throughout my life. Sweet Chick is at the topof my favorite places to go for CnW. A lot of restaurants that serve CnW are usually never balanced. It's hard to find a place that knows how to cook both the chicken and the waffles good. Sweet Chick was able to find that perfect balance. The waffles are beautifully tasty. The chicken is moist and crunchy. Whether you get the waffles in original, rose-marry mushroom, cheddar-bacon, or anything else; You will always be satisfied. The service is amazing, the environment is beautiful, and the food is out of this world. Definitely recommend Sweet Chick. P.S Not just the Chicken and Waffles are good. Practically everything else on the menu is good.
