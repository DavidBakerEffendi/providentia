I've worked at Brooklyn Botanic Garden for long enough that I was BORED with lunch options, especially of the vegetarian persuasion. But after finally sticking my head into Natural Blend a few weeks ago, that changed, for serious. The food is yummy and there are enough specials to keep it interesting. The baked goods RULE, by and large, though I'd skip the sweet potato pudding and head straight for the Vegan Gingerbread. And-- as others have said-- for an I'm-starving-but-have-no-time moment, go for the patties; I love jerk tofu the best!
