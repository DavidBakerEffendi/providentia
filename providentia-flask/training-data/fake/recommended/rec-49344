Clean quick and noodly Noodles & Company started in Denver in 1995 by a fellow that decided the world needed more noodly things.  Quick, cheap, noodly things. Apparently a lot of other people agreed because the idea took off and now there are over 300 of these noodly places around the country. The seem to be spreading fast and the very first one in CT in appeared in West Hartford a short time ago. It is fast food, make no mistake about that and don't expect a fine Asian or Italian restaurant.  You order at the counter from the huge menu and then find a table to sit at. They will bring your food when it is ready. Lots of American, Italian and traditional Asian things on the menu as well as some unexpected stuff.  The food is all well prepared and tasty but again, this is fast food and not a gourmet restaurant. The prices for the most part are dirt cheap and most of the meals are well under ten bucks.  However the portions were on the small side. Noodles & Company is a great alternative to the traditional fast foods joints.  Quick, clean and cheap, it's a pleasant and different place to visit for anyone in a nooldy mood.
