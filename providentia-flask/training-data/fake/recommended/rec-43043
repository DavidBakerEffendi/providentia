It's a tiny little bar on the far west side in Chelsea and probably the best bar dining and one of the best traditional tapas experiences in New York. The menu is moderately priced, but, as with all tapas experiences, all those dishes you order do add up and a night at the bar can end up being a tad on the expensive side. But, don't get me wrong, it's worth every penny.   The restaurant is very small and can be easy to miss. The facade is just a red frame with big red framed glass doors. The only sign of "Tia Pol" is on the doors' glass and since the door is usually swung wide open, you probably won't notice it. The line out the door and people crowded around the bar inside will probably tip you off, though. The sangria is sweet and fruity but retains a pretty good red wine character and was really delicious.  If you're looking for a cheaper night, the trio of dips is quite tasty and they give you more than enough so just keep asking for bread. Other must haves on the menu include the lamb skewers, squid ink rice, and the deviled eggs which are liberally seasoned with smoky paprika. Oh, and I know every place that wants to call itself a tapas bar has it, but the spanish tortilla here is actually worth getting.
