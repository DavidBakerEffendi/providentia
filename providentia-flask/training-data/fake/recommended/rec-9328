The only down side of this place is they dont do take out or delivery. I've only been to a few ramen houses but this is the best thus far. We had the pork buns minus the mayo and it was tender and flavorful. I ordered the Akamaru Modern and picked takana (pickled mustard greens) and shigureni (pulled charsu). So delicious. Noodles were fresh and not overcooked. The broth w/ a pork base and a tsp of their spicy pepper paste...flavor w/ a kick. I ended up leaving my bowl empty. Actually, all four of us did. If you are into Ramen, you should really check this place out.
