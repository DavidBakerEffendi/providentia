I've eaten or gotten take out from taqueria about 20 times.  The food is always good, especially for the price point and is a great place to grab a quick bite if you live in the LES.  I rated it a three because the service is always poor and I generally find the staff rude.  It seems they are more concerned with turning over tables rather than satisfying the customer.  But whatever, the food is tasty enough to put up with the service...hopefully management will do something about it in the future...
