I'm a big fan of Dinics!   Everybody has their own go to roast pork joint in Philly, and this one is mine.  I always go for the roast pork with provolone and rabe.  The pork is always moist well seasoned while the juices run into the roll and make it juicy (not soggy) and delicious. The contrast of the shrap prov with the bitterness of the rabe can't be beat.  The only thing you gotta beat is the long lunch line- so go at an off-peak dining hour.
