Perfect Thai a good fusion of spices and dish size, service is excellent and taste is exceptional. We tried all entrees in one go as a main to sample the whole range and was impressed, best way to try a place rather than traditional entree mains and dessert. I tried the cooked chilli and am only just cooling down.
