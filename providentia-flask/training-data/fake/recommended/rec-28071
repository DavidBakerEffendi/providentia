One of my favorite places in my hood! The fried pickles and mac and cheese are to die for! Great cocktails, lots of different beers to choose from. Nice ambience! Super packed especially on the weekends. I would give 5 stars but they won't let you order take out! All I wanted was my fried pickles to go :( lol
