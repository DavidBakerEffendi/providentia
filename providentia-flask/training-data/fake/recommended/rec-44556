I didn't fly all the way to NYC from San Diego to eat Filipino food. Really. But I have to say, this is one of the best. I thank YELP for directing me to this place - oh, and I thank my iphone too. I was just curious to see if there was any Filipino restaurants in the city and stumbled across Grill 21 with awesome reviews. (YELP, I trust in you) We got there when it just opened and no customers yet. I peeked at the back towards the kitchen and saw "manong" (respectful connotation for older Filipino men) and said "Kamusta po!" (Hi, how are you?) He smiled and responded back nicely. YES! it's *Filipinos* cooking real Filipino food in NYC, just sayin'. I ordered the longsilog (sweet pork sausage with egg and garlic rice) and my boyfriend got the tocilog ( sweet pork). The longanisa and tocino is as good as it gets, old school Filipino style- no fusions or fancies. Their garlic fried rice was excellent!! Cooked to perfection, not over/under cooked, and topped with crunchy bits of garlic on top. I seriously was debating to start a conversation with "manong" and ask him how he makes his garlic fried rice. Maybe the next time I'm in town. Served along with that was eggs (anyway you like it) and "sukang put" (vinegar with herbs) to dip your meat in. Small place. Outdoor seating. Friendly staff and service. Reasonably priced for NYC. GREAT Filipino breakfast. Maraming Salamat Po! :)
