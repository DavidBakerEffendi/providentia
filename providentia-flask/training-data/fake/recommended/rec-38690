I love macarons so I decided to stop here on a Saturday stroll for a little treat. So disappointing. When i entered the restaurant, there was an overwhelming stench of burned bread. Service was ok, could use a little training on customer service (like smiling!). The macarons were a bit stale and cold. Probably won't be back. Such a shame since it is walking distance from my apartment!
