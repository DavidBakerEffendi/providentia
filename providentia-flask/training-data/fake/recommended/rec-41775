We have been looking for a place in Brooklyn for solid, non-fancy, Mexican food. Tacos El Bronco was just what we had been looking for. The horchata was lovely, the salsa decent (could have been hotter), the refried beans were refried (although they had a slightly odd sweetness... cinnamon?). Â We are still on the hunt for a place with homemade tortillas, but will probably return here until then.
