I'm not much on breakfast or brunch but i came here for brunch anyway.  Cant go wrong with food and friends.  Definitely good eatin' here when you check out the menu.  There isn't anything I couldn't eat besides Eggs Benedict.  No, I don't touch that stuff... but definitely would get the blueberry waffles again like I did this time around. "Best brunch"?  I dont know, but I like fixed price, and a few choices and I love me some brunch cocktails.. mimosas and bellinis?  Yes please!  Who doesnt?  Oh yes, be punctual!  Dont be "that person"!  :)
