I came here with my boyfriend and one of his best friends for dinner tonight. all I have to say the food is banging. and by banging I mean it was delicious. we all got something different and tried everything. highly recommend the empanadas and the yellow rice pork 2 different ways and the beans were superb. at the end of the day highly recommend this fine dining establishment
