Overall we enjoyed our experience. The food and atmosphere were great and we had a nice time. However, our waitress, Marci, was incredibly rude and unhelpful. Simple questions went unanswered, and asking for a suggestion seemed to thoroughly inconvenience her. Isn't that why she's there? We all were very taken aback by her attitude. It was easily the most unpleasant experience I've had with a staff member at any restaurant in NYC thus far. Had it not been for the great food, she would have ruined our experience.
