On a day trip to NYC, I was given a crash course on the pizza war.  I was told this is the real Grimaldis, which sold its name to the now Grimaldis (literally next door down, which got more touristy and less in quality supposedly) and couldn't use the name anymore. So he named it Juliana's after grandma and uses the original oven. Can't attest to the accuracy of the info however. We walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and got there for lunch on a Saturday. The space is tiny, so there was a wait (outside by the curb) yet it wasn't bad at all.  The hostess kept us informed on the progress of the wait, which seemed to impress our local friends. The service overall was efficient, nothing too special but seems to be above average for the city per our friends.  The ambiance was a nice down home feel without being dumpy. It looked so nice that I at first questioned the food quality (since I thought REAL pizza joints would look more like holes in the wall) Here comes the food.  Menu selection wasn't huge and everyone seems to stick with the basic, the margherita.  For good reason, because it was indeed fabulous. The freshness of the tomato sauce and cheese is apparent.  The dough was yummy, not too doughy, but not as thin crust as I thought either. We had a 2nd smaller one (16in instead of 18in, not much size difference in my opinion, still pretty big and plenty for 2-3 ppl) with anchovies and sausage. The sausage was made with fennel, and has a very prominent taste because of it, beware.  Anchovies added saltiness (& fishiness), thus making this a very powerful combo. I liked it but not sure if it's for everyone. I saw the calamari being passed nearby, which I thought looked rather delicious and plentiful for $8. The plain pie was $19 for large, $16 for smaller one.  The 2 extra toppings were $5. I have no idea how much a pie is normally in NYC, it's a little pricey for pizza I thought, but this is definitely not just another pizza place so it's worth the splurge.
