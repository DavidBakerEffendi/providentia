I called in an order to be picked up.  Went there, waited like 15 minutes and the order was finally ready.  It was really busy and chaotic in there so I waited outside in the doorway.  The waitress came and handed me my food and I left.  I got home and I realized that I may have forgotten to pay (I didn't remember if I did or not).   I called the restaurant and asked to check if I had paid, and they asked around and came to the realization that I hadn't paid.  I apologized and said that I'd come in the next day (they said fine, rudely).  They then proceeded to call me back and insist that I go back and pay now.  They've since called me four more times to yell at me and demand that I immediately go back and pay (I've started screening their calls). Food is actually good.  I've come here like once or twice a month over the past decade.  They lost a customer over the $10.50 that they couldn't wait until the next day to collect.
