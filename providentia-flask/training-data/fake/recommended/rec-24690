I dont think i can give this place more then 2 stars, if you are looking to have a good italian food, fuggerabouit. im tell you why. 1. all the antipasti we orderd were tasteless, Â specially the calamari i thought i was eating plastic. 2. pizza ? nyc is famous to have one of the best pizza in the U.S deffently is not here, we all had burned pizza and personally i found the Dow really heavy after half pizza you already feel full. service was okay. for sure im not coming back.
