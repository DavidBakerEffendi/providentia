Went on a Saturday night place was busy (always busy), but the staff keeps this place running smoothly. We got a couple glasses of Malbec, Burrata & Prosciutto to start, then Braised Short-Rib & Rigantoni w/Duck Ragu (one of the specials) entrees. Everything was really good. My VERY picky friend is not so picky after her visit to Uva.
