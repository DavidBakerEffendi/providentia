Went for dinner on a Sunday night and had to wait about 30 minutes to get a table for two. We each had the special (pork bone ramen) and a steamed pork bun. The pork bun was delicious -- really rich pork and a great spicy aioli pairing. It was a little pricey for an appetizer that can't be shared, though. The ramen was rich and really well balanced with egg, seaweed, scallions, and greens. I would recommend getting the roasted pork with it and adding some hot sauce.
