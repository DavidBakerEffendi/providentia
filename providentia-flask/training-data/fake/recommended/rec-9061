My date and I sat at the bar and shared an order of the sliders and the pulled pork sliders.  Each order comes with 2 sliders.  Surprisingly, I liked the regular sliders better but both were just awesome.  It's BYO, which we didn't have, but was a great fuel station before a show at the Music Hall of Williamsburg.  We'd definitely come back here if in the area.  Cash only, so come prepared.
