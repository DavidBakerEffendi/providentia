Sunday brunch may not have been the best time to sample this place.  I had been looking forward to a more Latin American menu and found only a few items of interest  The room was very noisy, even before the crowds came.  Our appetizers arrived after the main dishes, and only when the waiter was reminded they'd been ordered.  The brunch foods were fine, but the overall experience was not.  We're in the Theater District/Hell's Kitchen often, but won't bother checking in on La Pulperia a second time.
