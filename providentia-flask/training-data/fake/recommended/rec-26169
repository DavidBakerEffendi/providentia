I went to this place last night to have LA galbi and their spicy chicken. The galbi was so tasty, juicy and tender. The spicy chicken was a little too spicy even for my asian taste but I would still recommend it. What highlighted our stay at bcd was our server, Joe. He was just so polite and attentive and he also speaks good english which is always a plus for me. Over all I have nothing but good things to say about this place. Definitely a place to visit if you want a nice korean meal
