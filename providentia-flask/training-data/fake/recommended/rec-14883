HOLY CRAP. My second time here, I had a roast pork sandwich with broccoli rabe....... everyone should try this at least once in their life. Meat was tender, flavorful, juicy.... i could go on. The broccoli rabe added a little bitter flavor ,so if that not your thing, go with spinach. Next time I'm going to try the peppers.
