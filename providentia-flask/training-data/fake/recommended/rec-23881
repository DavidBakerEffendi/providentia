I am a huge fan of sushi.  However, we all know that in any city, good fresh sushi can be hard to come by... Izumi definitely surpassed my expectations.  Its located on a cute triangle intersection on Passyunk Ave.  When I walked up and saw the open air concept and outdoor seating I was excited to be able to enjoy the young hip neighborhood in addition to the restaurant.  The ROCK SHRIMP is amazing... along with the gyoza! I don't get into experimenting too much with much but I have had the rolls and a few other appetizers... all which have been great.  The waiter was intelligent and knew all the specials by memory and was attentive and even brought a few ice buckets for our numerous bottles of wine.  Great atmosphere, pleasant staff, easy to make a reservation, and a BYOB.  Definitely recommend trying it out...
