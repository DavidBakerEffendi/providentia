Couldn't decide between 1 and 2 stars.  Somehow we ended up at this place looking for a good Cuban sandwich.  Reviewers raved about it.  Not sure if they were reviewing the wrong restaurant.  You can't even call what this place makes a Cuban.  It was basically a ham and cheese sandwich (not even Swiss).  Yes it's ridiculously cheap at $2 or whatever, but I'd gladly pay $10 for a good Cuban sandwich.  Avoid this place unless you are just looking for the cheapest food you can find.
