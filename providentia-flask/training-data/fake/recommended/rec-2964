Very nice set up.  Booths in back, tables in front.   Efficient servers, good bartenders...GREAT MARGARITAS. I really hate to say anymore, because this place is around the corner from my house, and I don't want anyone to know how great it is. I was hoping to keep it a secret, but as you can see by everyone's review, they hit it out of the park with this one.
