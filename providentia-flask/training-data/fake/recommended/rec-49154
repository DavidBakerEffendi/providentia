Only really giving this place 3 stars because the atmosphere is great and so is the wine list. None of the entrees looked appetizing so we stuck to a few small plates. We ordered the octopus, beef carpaccio, sweet bread croquettes, and cauliflower. Carpaccio was average, I liked the addition of the french fries but other than that it wasn't very impressive. Octopus was cooked well but didn't have much flavor. You couldn't even taste the sweet breads in the croquettes. Service however was great!
