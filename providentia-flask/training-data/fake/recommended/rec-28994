after living in philly for over a month - i FINALLY found myself at reading terminal market.  how i LOVED the ambiance!  though touristy - it was buzzing with excitement about delicious food!   despite being tempted by many vendors, i tried my best to keep my focus:  roast pork with provolone and broccoli - bc that's what all the reviews are raving about. $8 + $1.25 for 2 toppings = $9.25 i waited for approx 30 minutes while other friends gathered food from other vendors for our family style feast.  finally - i ordered and got my sandwich.  delicious!  i love the bitterness of the broccoli rabe w/ the sharp provolone. i will come back on a weekday when there are less tourists!
