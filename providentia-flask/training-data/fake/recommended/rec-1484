Inspired to try this place thanks to Food Network, I'm kind of glad that I stopped in. The cheese steak sandwich was pretty delicious, fries (order at next counter) was nothing really too spectacular but wayyyyyyy better than their rival restaurant across the street. If you're a local, you already know it's great. If you're in the area it's a MUST TRY.
