On a recent trip to VT I had to return to Red Onion for a sandwich before leaving (literally it was my last stop before getting to the highway). I have not been back in a few years and still found my favorite on the menu (red onion spinach melt). I was a bit disappointed to see the prices had risen two sandwiches and a drink totalled 19 and change. I agree with some of the other posts the atmosphere is a bit lacking and the bathroom is midly frightening when coming out as there is only a small gap between the bathroom door and the steep stairway to the cellar. (Not ideal for special needs or small children). Overall I recommend the place just for the food!
