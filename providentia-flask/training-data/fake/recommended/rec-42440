I tried Eat a Pita the day after Christmas and it was wonderful!  I had the turkey special penni and it was soo good.  It has turkey, swiss cheese, thousand island and this pickled cabbage that i can't stop thinking about!  My lunch partners had pitas and raved about them!  The folks behind the counter were very nice and friendly!  You should check this place out you won't be sorry!
