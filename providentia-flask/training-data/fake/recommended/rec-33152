I live in Midtown, which means that I have to deal with really crappy overpriced food most of the time.  So maybe I'm reacting a little bit disproportionately here, but I thought that Joya was one of the best cheap Asian places I've found in NYC.   My Brooklyn friend (yes, I'm jealous of your neighborhood--wanna trade?) told me that Joya was cheap and good, so I was expecting a grungy little place.  Surprisingly, Joya is a relatively classy restaurant with an open kitchen, a full, bar, and lots of natural light.  But the food is still dirt-cheap, with most of the noodle dishes coming in at around $7.  Can't beat that. I'm hopelessly hooked on the spicy noodles... perfectly charred flavor, if a little bit greasy.  We also chowed through chicken-avocado summer rolls, which were phenomenal, if of dubious authenticity.   And even the bathrooms were kind of charming.  Who knew that you could get a little bit of class with your $6.95 spicy Thai noodles?
