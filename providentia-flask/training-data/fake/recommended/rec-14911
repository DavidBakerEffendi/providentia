Ah, le cuisine chez Bibou.  Tres jolie!  Best food in Philly.  Pierre is the utterly talented man behind the stove, Charlotte is the lovely soul in the dining room making you feel like her house guest.  La cuisine francaise is alive and well in Philadelphia.  I ate here some time ago but remember it like yesterday.  That lemon verbena, so subtle with the crab, was delicate and aromatic.  The pate, rustic and simple.  A skate wing, puckering my mouth with watermelon and a kick of chorizo.  A braised beef cheek on petits pois a la francaise, true to the classic.  Pierre even makes the bread in his tiny kitchen.  Ahh, bliss.  Now I have to go kill somebody on the reservation list so I can steal their table!
