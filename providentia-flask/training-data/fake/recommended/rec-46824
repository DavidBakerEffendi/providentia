Total disappointment...having heard great things about the restaurant we had high hopes.  Once seated, we waited 15 minutes and no one even came to the table with water. We asked the waitress for water and a drink menu...to which she responded "oh you want drinks?" In the end, 5 tables came in after us and were eating their dessert before we had our salads. There were apologies from the waitress that the kitchen was really busy.  She then told us we were being given a round of drinks...that were wrong...i,e. asked for Reisling and got Pinot.  Once food came, it was cold.  We were then rushed and when we wanted coffee it was pushed on us and cleared just as quickly.  Very disappointing...will not go back.
