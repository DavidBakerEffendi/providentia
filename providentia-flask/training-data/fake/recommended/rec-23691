The best risotto I have ever tasted. I went on a night when seafood risotto was a special and man did I get lucky. The outdoor seating was very nice, but the inside seemed great too. The overall atmosphere was very impressive, perfect for dates or nights out. Â Our waiter was actually Italian, which was a nice change. The others in my party ordered a seafood medley dish over noodles and the lobster ravioli. I sampled the ravioli, and I instantly knew what I was getting next time. Good drink selection, more variety than the usual Italian place, and pretty good location. I will be returning next time I'm in Philly. This place set the bar for Italian restaurants for me, and few places have come close to comparing.
