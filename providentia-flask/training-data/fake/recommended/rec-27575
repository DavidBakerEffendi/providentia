I am in love with Michael Psilakis. The combination of having a bald head and being a Greek chef demi-god has certainly sealed the deal for me. The proverbial icing on top came when I frequented Kefi last night for a satisfying and rustic Greek dinner. The ambiance is nothing to write home about but the quality of the cuisine makes up for the unimpressive decor. There is something very comforting about Kefi - the throngs of happy diners, waiters in t-shirts, and the plates upon places of delicious and classic Greek dishes. I visited Greece several years ago and the cheery atmosphere reminded me of knocking back shots of ouzo in central Athens. We started off with the mussels and the sheep's milk dumplings and spicy sausage. The mussels were wonderful - steamed and dunked in some yummy savory broth, loaded with scallions, garlic, tomatoes, and herbs. My favorite dish however, was the dumplings. The perfect combination of savory and spicy, packed with flavor, and ultimately satisfying. The dumplings were akin to pillows stuffed with sheep's milk cheese, topped with crumbled feta and sundried tomatoes. Lovely. I had the braised lamb shank with orzo and my dining companion opted for the grilled branzino. The branzino had just the right amount of citrus and was perfectly charred and well seasoned. My lamb shank literally fell off the bone like a good braise should. The orzo was creamy and was the perfect pair to the delicate and tender protein. Dessert was a warm walnut cake accompanied by walnut ice cream, complete with bits of nuts. I usually choose something chocolate-y for dessert but I much preferred my selection. A perfect ending to this meal. My only question is why were all the Asians in the restaurant seated downstairs? I swear, my section of the dining floor was like a snapshot of Chinatown on dimsum Sundays.
