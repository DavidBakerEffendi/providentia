I love Johnny Brenda's and I will tell you why. 1. The food is always yummy.  They change the menu, but they always have a nice mix of culinary delights in the form of entrees, sandwiches, appetizers, oysters, salads, etc.  I would describe the food as good and whole, ripe for the chomps of any self-proclaimed foodie. 2. There is plenty of room.  The booths come in all sizes, so it is a great place for big groups and small, too. 3.  Prices are right.  You can totally stay on budget at JB's. 4.  Saturday and Sunday brunch.  I am hesitant to write this because as soon as the news is out, this will no longer be the case, but JB's has a delicious brunch on the weekends and you don't have to wait for a table.  My brother had this shrimp and grits concoction that was to die for.  I ordered a veggie scramble (not a tofu scram, though I am sure there are vegan options).  It was yumtastic.  We also shared a whisky donut for the table.  Goddamn.  So good.  Even my 3 and 5 year old nephews had a good time. 5.  My dog Zissou loves it there.  In the warmer months we sit outside and he is totally welcome.  Way better than being left at home, right Zissou?  (woof.)
