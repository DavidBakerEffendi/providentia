ZOMG.. I LOVE YOU and I will learn how to make you one of these days! get a rice plate.. combo or gyro or chicken or whatever. if you're lucky like me you'll miss the horrendous line. add at least 2 layers of that white sauce... drool.. I wonder if it's mayo based. and the hot sauce is really HOT. a lil goes too far so keep that in mind. I've seen heat lovers cry because they did not heed the warning to all that the HOT sauce here is HOOOOT! I'm drooling writing this review! ;D
