I got my food to go and it was prepared very quickly - although that may have been because I ordered around 9:30 and it probably wasn't as busy as normal. I got the Hatch burger - it had great flavor and the beef was very tasty. Although I was satisfied with my order I do think this place is very overhyped. Also the burgers are on the pricey side - my burger was around $10 but some are around $14. The fries are good - thin and crispy - kind of taste like McDonald's fries...
