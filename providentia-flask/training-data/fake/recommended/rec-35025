The corner eatery is clean, quick and the food tastes very fresh. Great to get out of the cold for a few minutes, and grab a snack/lunch. We ordered a few things.  They had a special falafel which was really nice, and their Hummus with the fresh pita bread was excellent.  Add some feta to the hummus for that little bit of a kick. i could eat this every day... still need to try so much of their menu... including the greek salad (which looked great).
