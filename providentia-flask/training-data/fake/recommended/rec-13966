Place was awesome!! Five stars baby! Your food is bomb your staff smoked a fatty and are down to earth nice people. I'm not gonna sit here and babble about what I ate and why it was so good but it was. If you think something sounds good on the menu it will be. Unless you want a bucket of salt on your tongue do not order the lamb tongue appetizer. Otherwise enjoy:)
