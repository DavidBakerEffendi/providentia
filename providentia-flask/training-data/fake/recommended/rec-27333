When a friend of the other gender invited me to "Room Service," my first reaction was not thinking about a restaurant. =0   The ambience of this restaurant is nice and the interior decor is remarkable.  The food was good with generous size portions.   I plan to take all my out-of-town friends that like Thai food to "Room Service" and to see their facial expression and reaction when I first mention the name...lol  One aspect that should be known is that they will only seat you after your whole party arrives.
