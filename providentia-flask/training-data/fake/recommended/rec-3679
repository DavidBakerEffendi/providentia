Fried geeen tomatoes, swag sampler for two bbq ribs and the bbq wings are my go to items here.  These items are cooked perfectly every add single time without fail.  The mac n cheese, baked beans, link sausage and half bbq chicken and coleslaw are also good as well.  At the take out counter you can also purchase those wonderful spice blends and sauces.  Happy they are un Brooklyn don't have to trek to Harlem for some good barbeque.
