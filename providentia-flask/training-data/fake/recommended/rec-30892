Stopped in this morning for a scone and an iced coffee. The scone was delicious, but was a tad burnt on the bottom and a little drier than I'm used to. Still, it tasted good and hit the spot. Being a fan of Stumptown coffee, I can only say the iced coffee was just okay. I probably won't get it again. They have a nice array of various baked goods and soups on display. I wish I would have tried the brunch special (a jalapeno muffin, w/ egg, kale, and "stinky" cheese). It sounded great, but I played it safe and got what I came for. Will be back to give it a try.
