We went to Rats on saturday night. It was our 40th wedding anniversary and we were given a gift certificate. We started with appetizers. I had the pei mussels. She had the lobster crepe. We enjoyed both We had cocktails. I was very disappointed in the sangria....not very fruity...mainly wine. If i wanted wine, i would have ordered wine The first bread they brought out was hard and burnt. On returning it, the second was good. But we never should have gotten the first. She had the filet mignon. I had the sirloin. The meat was good. Â But, the vegetables were from barely warmed to cold.... The server was outstanding. She went out of her way to make our visit enjoyable. Overall. Fine....but the mistakes spoiled some of the night.
