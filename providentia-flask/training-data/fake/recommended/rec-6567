Random Saturday night and hadn't planned out what we wanted to do for dinner so I wandered up Hudson and remembered how great my brunch was here. We were basically immediately seated at a communal table. Nice people next to us so it didn't bother me. We shared a mozzarella & tomato salad, gnocchi, hummus and tabouli. YUM. Yum to all. Everything was delicious and it was the perfect amount of food for two people had overeaten that day. The gnocchi was incredible fluffy compared to so many places that make it so dense. Servers were extremely nice and helpful. They actually read our minds when we needed things - always love that. My only complaint is that the table we were sitting at was the closest to the door so the second people walked in and were waiting to be seated or find out how long the wait was, we were dealing with the draft coming in. Not sure what could be done with that but it was freezing.
