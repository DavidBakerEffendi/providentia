I've been here twice now. The first time was lovely.  It's great that they have outdoor seating and we can bring the pooch.   Both times the pita was soft and delicious.  Both times we ordered the Karisik Meze (the large cold appetizer combo) and it was fabulous.  I definitely recommend it, especially if going with 3 or 4 people. I ordered the Sebze Sote - Vegetarian Saute the first time and wasn't too crazy about it but since it had been months since my first visit I accidentally ordered it again.  At least I'm consistent.  I really need to remember to try one of the other dishes next time. The table ordered a variety of lamb, fish, and salad dishes.  All seemed very happy with their meals. I'm docking 2 stars because of our service last night.  Our waitress was frazzled which was fine for a while.  We had to remind her to bring menus, our chilled wine, an extra knife...   She said she had had a rough week.  She was great on refilling our water, brought a bowl of water out for the dog, and was generally friendly.  The thing that was not at all okay was the check.  She had accidentally added another entree.  When my friend went in to have it removed he encountered the manager first.  She came up and he asked her about it.  She said that her finger accidentally added it, she tried to remove it but couldn't figure it out.   So she brought our check anyway, knowing that there was an extra entree on there.  Not okay at all. We'll be back but we'll definitely keep an eye on the check.
