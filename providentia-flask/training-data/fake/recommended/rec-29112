Great date night spot very cozy, but if you have a group it's a bit tight. The wait staff are very knowledgeable about whiskey selections. The food is a bit overboard, the fries with pulled pork and cheese, a few bites is all I could manage before I felt my pores fill with oil. The pulled Sammy seems to have a very soggy texture and not enough crunch.
