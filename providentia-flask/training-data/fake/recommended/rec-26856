This is my favorite restaurant in all of NY. I've eaten at many great restaurants in the city since moving here, but I love everything about this place. The ambiance, the staff and the food, oh my god the food. I haven't had anything I didn't love. Strip steak! fish tacos! ceviche! Guacamole! Corn! All amazing and not over priced. Great place to bring a date or just sit at the bar alone and devour a steak. Who cares. So good.
