This place is definitely a dive. Reminded me of Red Lobster in the 80's. The food was good. I ate baked scallop scampi. The scallops were tender and sweet. Salad and bread before the meal was tasty. I sat and ate at the bar. There was a decent selection of beers and various liqueurs. The bartenders were semi-friendly. I would have given it a higher rating but the place was really outdated. It didn't really look all that clean. The bartenders kept throwing dishes in a bus pan that was on the floor. It made a very loud crashing sound. It became increasingly irritating. It made me not want to stay for a second beer.
