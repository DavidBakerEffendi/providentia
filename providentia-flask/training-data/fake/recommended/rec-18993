I came here first on Thursday night, and it was great. I got tartine, with butter and bonne maman jam, and some nice crispy chardonnay. I came back today, and I was very disappointed. First of all, the service was terrible. We waited 10 minutes for someone to take our order, and then when they finally did, the orange juice I ordered never came, and the espresso came maybe 20 minutes later. Also, the tartine I got again wasn't great (they charge you 25 cents for extra butter btw) and I wasn't even asked about the kind of bread I wanted. Anyways, still a cute cozy place, even though the service wasn't good today.
