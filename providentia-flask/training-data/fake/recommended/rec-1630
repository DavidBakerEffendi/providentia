Lots of Hype for the "Best Sandwich in 'Merica" mmm...was not that impressed. Yes the line circles around, surprisingly it quickly moves along. My co-worker ordered the mouthwatering Sandwich, it was good but we think you can find one as good or better at another spot within the terminal. So eh, it was good but not America's Best.
