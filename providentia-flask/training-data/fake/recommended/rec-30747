The food was excellent.  If you're looking for something a little different and extremely delicious,  this is the place to go.  The best dishes were the lamb ribs, lamb neck, and poutine.  I also tried the schnitzel,  rabbit, carrots, and peas.   They were all great.  One tip: if you want the pig's head, order it as soon as you get there.  It takes an hour to cook, so I didn't have a chance to try it.  Next time!
