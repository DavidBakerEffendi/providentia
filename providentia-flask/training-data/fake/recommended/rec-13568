My favorite brunch place, and yeah I go to quite a few brunch places. Need to get here early. The salmon, with potato pancake, and other fun stuff is my go to meal, it leaves me so SATISFIED AFTER BRUNCH! The right amount of saltiness, sweetness, greasiness, without being too overbearing of any of those things. If you get here before 10 you shouldn't have a problem with getting in. Service is top notch, everyone there seems to be working hard and is friendly. Oh and the pumpkin pancakes are awesome, but I'd recommend having 3 or 2 people to split them in addition to your meal, lol i eat a lot and like variety!
