When this place first opened my wife and I wanted it to succeed. The food was good and the ice cream...well go there and get the Cookie Monster and you'll see why we keep going back. When we first went when they opened they were still feeling their way around. Service was pretty bad, you'd wait a long time. However, since they opened the service has really stepped it up and we no longer sit twiddling our thumbs wondering if our waitress forgot about us. If you had a bad experience a year ago I'd definitely recommend you going back. I haven't eaten a bad thing there yet and I don't anticipate I will any time soon.
