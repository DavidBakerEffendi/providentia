My roommate and I love sketch burgers. We live nearby and think they're great. However, we will never eat there again. The waitress is so horribly obnoxious and has been every time we come (which is usually Sunday nights) She's loud, abrasive, and has that horribly fake server voice which I can't stand. She also doesn't do the menu any justice. Everytime I order a turkey burger or a veggie burger (or anything that doesn't contain red meat) she makes a snarky comment like what I ordered wasn't a good choice. She did the same thing to my roommate when he tried to order a vegan milkshake, saying (and I quote) that he "shouldn't even bother. Get a real man's milkshake." I couldn't believe it. I do love the burgers and I'm sure I'll be tempted to order from there again but only for takeout. I won't risk having to be served by that obnoxious loud woman ever again.
