I like this place - possibly a little overpriced..but still very nice. I ordered the pita and hummus which came with creamy hummus and perfectly warm grilled pita. My friend and I also shared a plate of shoestring fries, which were drizzled in a chinese hot mustard. Not a combo I would ever think of - but seriously, amazing.
