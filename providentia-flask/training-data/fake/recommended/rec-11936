I've been to the original back when it opened and sampled the cream-drenched artichoke which tasted like a mouthful of alfredo sauce. I guess that's an okay experience, but it's not what I want on a pizza.  I couldn't bring myself to order it again years later, so it must have been somewhat negative.  Our follow-up at the Chelsea location was for the meatball.  The meatball was fine as was the sauce, but the dough was flavorless, carboard-like.  Some may not care as they chew through one of their gooeir offerings that overwhelms the crust taste, but in my opinion, the crust is crucial to the experience.  Unfortunately, I'd have to call this place the most over-rated overhyped pizza in the city. Maybe those who love Chicago deep dish would appreciate.
