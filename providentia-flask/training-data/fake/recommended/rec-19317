The drinks are good but the food... Phenomenal! We sat at bar with bartender Desiree. Awesome bartender, kept us there enjoying ourselves. The chicken cheesesteak is delicious!!!!!!! The fries are to die for! We also shared the lobster roll and being from Maine, I was skeptical but when Desiree mentioned the owners visit Maine frequently I figured we should give it a shot - it was awesome!
