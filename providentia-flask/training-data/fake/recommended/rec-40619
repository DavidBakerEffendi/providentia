I unfortunately had a not-so-good experience at Devil's Alley. I went here twice to eat to give it the benefit of the doubt, but after 2 consecutive let downs, I think I'm officially writing them off my list. On my first trip, myself and a small group of friends went there for a late dinner before we hit the town for some drinks. The hostess and waiter were very rude and inattentive to our table the entire time, our drinks (which were only sodas and waters at this point) we all screwed up. The lighting was also extremely low- to the point we had to use our cell phones to read the menu. We were also seated in the back by the register and kitchen which allowed us to hear all the servers complaining about being there. As if this wasn't bad enough, when our food finally came out the sides that everyone ordered were either on the wrong plate or completely missing from the table. I have never seen such a lack of organization from a restaurant before! On my second shot, my boyfriend and I went for brunch one Saturday. The lighting was obviously better since we had some sunlight shining through as well as the lights indoors. The server once again screwed up my SODA order and my boyfriend's side dish. The food was also less than appealing. I ordered eggs that were very undercooked and runny. My boyfriend also wasn't thrilled with his meal. Overall, I think this place looks cool from the outside with the red lights, and we did go there for their Halloween party where they had great drink specials and neat atmosphere. But as far as this place goes as a restaurant as opposed to a bar, I would suggest you stay far far away. The service is atrocious and the food was not much better!
