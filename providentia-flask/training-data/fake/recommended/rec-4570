Great food with great prices!  I found this restaurant using yelp.  I was there during lunch hour which got busy quickly.  I think it could seat a little over 10 people.  Waitress was friendly.  Food was very delicious!  I had the curry noodle soup with tofu and chicken. Also had a ginger tea which was also good. It seems that the deliver and you can order online.    Definitely plan on coming back.
