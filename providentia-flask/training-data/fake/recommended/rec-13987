15 bucks for a chunky lobster anything is a good deal. For a lobster roll, this was definitely great. I came here the other day after attending a Southern cocktail reception just down the street. After a couple mint juleps and hibiscus coolers, all of my words started transforming into "lobster roll" in anticipation. And yes, said lobster rolls were delicious, from the buttered, crunchy bun to the thick and hearty helpings of lobster. My only other point of reference would be the lobster rolls from Pearl's oyster bar; those seemed to have a thicker slathering of mayo-y goodness and were served at room temperature. The ones at Lobster Pound were served colder with a much thinner dressing. I guess when choosing between the two, it would definitely come down to preference and price. Cape cod kettle chips and natural sodas from sarsaparilla to blueberry round out the menu. The one major caveat would be the location. This place is really. Out. Of. The. Way. But if you can deal with the distance, the lobster is well worth the visit.
