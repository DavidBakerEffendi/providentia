Delicious food and very reasonable prices.  I do miss the cute little space on Classon, but the new restaurant is much bigger and nicer.  Lots of options on the menu, and everything I have had is super tasty.  I really like the shrimp in garlic/tomato sauce.  The flautas are really delicious too!  I will definitely be coming back!
