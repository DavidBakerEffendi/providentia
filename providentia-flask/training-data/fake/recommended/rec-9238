Not a huge fan of pig feet, but felt courageous since my friend has been trying to take me to Hakata Ton Ton for awhile now. This is definitely one of those "hole in the wall" type of restaurants that you could easily walk past and not pay much attention. Upon entering the first thing I noticed was how really small the restaurant was, really was cozy to say the least. Had to do some yelp research and for the most part everything the reviewers suggested was very good. Started with the tofu with avocado and mixed seaweed salad, both great. The tebasaki chicken wings were also a bit different, but tasty nonetheless. Everyone seems to rave about the garlic fried rice and I'd have to agree... I'd go back just to get that dish for sure. We also ordered the soup dish for two that comes loaded with veggies, tofu, chicken, pork and other lovely things, we shared for 4 and it was more than enough. Sort of reminded me of a form of Korean soup called dwenjjang jiggae, but more salty. As far as the pig feet, went with the popular choice with the salt and soy I believe. Again not too fond of pig feet, the texture of the cartilage is always an overpowering component... but hell when in Rome... I'd also like to mention that service was amazing, our particular waitress definitely knew what she was doing and how to guide new patrons of this gem of a restaurant, which has won over a new fan.
