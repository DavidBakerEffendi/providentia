Freakin' yum! Some friends and I (New York State of Mind meetup.com/new-york-statâ€¦ group -- check us, we're AWESOME!) decided we were hungry after seeing Airplane! at Bryant Park. I'd been down 39th before, and walked right on by several times. STUPID! I ordered the Unda Roll (scrambled egg, sauteed onion and DELICIOUS spices) and the Tikka Chicken Roll (chunks of grilled chicken in a spicy cilantro sauce) both rolled in Indian flatbread. Cheap, delicious, spicy, and the posters on the wall are a HOOT! While it's just off the Times Square tourist playpen, late night wasn't a problem. We were there at about 11 pm on a Monday night and had the place almost to ourselves. There were others there, though, so they knew it was open at this time. EAT HERE!
