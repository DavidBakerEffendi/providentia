My favorite place in the whole entire world. The crispy chicken sandwich is to die for. But before you have that, you must have the wings. Then finish with the bread pudding. This is my favorite meal and the only place to get it. Such a hipster vibe. Such cool decor. Servers are casual. Never fails to fill my tummy! Love it.
