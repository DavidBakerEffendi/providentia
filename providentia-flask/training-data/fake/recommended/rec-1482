I was in Philly over the weekend for the NCAA tournament. Let me start by saying that Philadelphia is a beautiful city with so much to see, and do, and eat! However, I DO NOT understand why anyone in their right mind would send me to Pat's or Geno's to pay for a 9 dollar nasty, low quality, meat and cheese wiz sandwich. YUCK! The workers were pretty rude for a thursday night at 11pm with absolutely no one else around. Maybe they just have a sort of 'soup nazi' thing going on that ironically draws people in. Either way, it would work better if their sandwiches weren't dry with fat-tastic meat. I couldn't tell you which place was worse. Geno's was lit up like a neon cracked out Christmas tree that was obviously a gimmick to lure people in like moths to a flame. However, I should have looked at it more along the lines of deadly dart frogs whose bright colors mean, "Beware, I'm poisonous". I'm not a snooty foodie type of person, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that if you receive your food wrapped up and ready to go WHILE you're still paying for it, than it's most likely going to be disgusting and painful the next day. This same post is on both Pat's and Geno's Yelp pages since they both are equally gross. I lost my faith in the so-called famous "Philly Cheesesteak" until we decided to try Jim's on South Street for our last night in town. I actually opted out and got a slice of pizza instead since my experience with cheesesteaks was so horrible. However, my friend from Reading, PA INSISTED that I take half of her sandwich, and I was really glad I did. Turns out there is such thing as a decent Philly Cheesesteak in the City of Brotherly Love. Thanks Jim's! Next time i'll steer clear of the tourist traps, and open my own trap at your restaurant instead.
