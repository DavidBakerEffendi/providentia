This is another one of those places I've been meaning to review for years but just haven't. At any rate, Silk City is hardly a diner in traditional terms. To the contrary, they have a full bar, pretty great gourmet food, and a dance club attached to the old-school-looking diner part. The prices are excellent, the atmosphere is funky and hip but not too hip for its own good, and while the service can be a little rushed during busy times, it's never rude or unhelpful. I'd go back here in a second. It's definitely a must-visit if you're in Philadelphia.
