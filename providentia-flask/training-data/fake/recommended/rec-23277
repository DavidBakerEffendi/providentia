i love alla spina! great spot for casual dinner and drinks their bruch is amazing as well, one of the best in the city for sure i have not had a bad dish here its vetri qualitiy food but with a casual style still they dont just do typical bar food, the really put some extra thought into it and take it to the next level. Â  service is great every time and the atmosphere is urban and industrial
