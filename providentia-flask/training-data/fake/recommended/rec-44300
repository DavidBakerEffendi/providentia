The food is great! Nice selection of hot sauces & BBQ sauces. The portions are just so small, I can't justify going there as much as I'd like. $12 for a brisket sandwich that has just 3 slices of meat. You can check out my picture for proof. $9 for small salad and I bet there's barely 3 ounces of meat. I get that it costs a pile of $$$ to start up, but this isn't a sprint. Treat us right & we'll keep you going. Step it up guys.
