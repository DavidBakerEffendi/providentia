I am not even going to bother reviewing the food.  Let me just say that there is a mastery here where every ingredient seem to be treated with equal care and their final result shows the genius of a perfectly executed meal. I have been visiting this very elegant restaurant for a couple of years now, have done lunch, dinners, and a lovely and memorable champagne infused brunch.  Every time the staff is very attentive, and helpful.  Their wine selection is spectacular, and as expected so are their prices. If you come here in jeans, you will not feel welcomed.  This is not a place to come and be seen, nor it is a place for someone with limits in their credit card.  They are not snobs, but are the class of old world restaurant that have high standards for food and service.  Be forewarned, if you are not accustomed to spend a few hundred dollars per person for lunch, then you may feel intimidated by this place. Try their tasting menu, and ask their sommelier to do a pairing.  Fabulous! Someday, I dream of sitting at the chef's table.
