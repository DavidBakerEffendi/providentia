I arrived at the downtown hotel early and was hungry for a nice breakfast.  Yelp, guided me to a.kitchen and I couldn't have been happier with what I was about to experience. As it was just little 'ol me, I was asked by the hostess if I wanted to sit up at the chef's table, a counter-style area facing the open kitchen.  Seemed like a good suggestion to me! The server, Lee, was there promptly with water and asked if I wanted coffee.  Yes, please - this came quickly and was very good, as were the frequent refill offers. I looked at the menu while watching one of the chef's at work in the kitchen.  My pick for breakfast?  Eggs Benedict - a classic and since they said they make their hollandaise sauce fresh, I had to try it.  As a side note, their muffins are freshly made in-house too, and they are fantastic. By the time my eggs arrived, another chef was in the kitchen and since they weren't too busy, both were very responsive to my few questions and requests (another small tub of hollandaise sauce, please!?).  It was a Saturday morning around 11am and I was, by this time, the only one at the counter-seating, so I thought questions were ok....... The Benedict was superb, the muffin perfect and the ham very well cooked.  The hollandaise was outstanding atop the perfectly poached eggs. Love the decor of the place, the chef's table/counter seating, the menu and the service.  These things, as well as being a short walk from our downtown hotel, will be bringing me back - probably soon and maybe for dinner too, this time!
