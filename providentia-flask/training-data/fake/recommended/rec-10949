I've become very picky with my street meat as more halal trucks have opened up in the city but this is THE halal spot as everyone claims.  I went last night for the first time ever and to our luck, the line was short and the wait was less than 5 minutes.  I noticed it was $6 and while it's cheap, I initially thought it was a bit overpriced for halal.  My usual go to is Rafiqi's and their chicken over rice is $5.25.  But little did I know that these guys on 53rd hook you up in portions.  As soon as I ordered, the food was in my hands.  According to my friend, his theory why this place is so good is because you're normally drunk and two, they have so many customers that their meats are always fresh and juicy.  I think he may be onto something.  The sauces here are all self serve.  Make sure to get a good amount of white sauce but don't oversauce.  And beware of the hot sauce.  Yes, they provide a warning and of course you think you can handle hot but their sauce is EXTREMELY hot.
