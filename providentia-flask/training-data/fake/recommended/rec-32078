I went to this place for a dinner birthday party.  It's tapas Asian cuisine and was just mediocre to me.  I don't feel that they put much of a creative twist to the plates.  They take the really popular Asian dishes and "try" to make it their own.  However, the dishes came out just average.  The price tag, on the other hand, is not.  Maybe it made me feel that way because of the quality of these dishes (which I can get much better for much cheaper).  But if you want a fancy cool place to dress up and hang out, this is not a bad spot.  Also, it seems that it's much better for HH?
