This place rocks. The live music is outstanding--excellent talent. The crowd is fun and friendly, the atmosphere cozy if not comfortable. Andrew is a fantastic tender--indeed, all of the staff get to know their clientele, and the place lives up to its name: Trenton Social. The food is good for a bar, but the prices, already a bit high, were recently raised. There are a few minor issues though. Â $6 drinks are served in a small glass and, to be honest, mostly mix. Notice few of the regulars order mixed drinks for that very reason. The draughts are a bit tepid, but if you ask for a chilled glass they will happily provide. That said, Trenton Social is like an oasis in the urban desert that is south Trenton. With good (but pricy) food, excellent music, and outstanding service, this is the place to be any night of the week. Great job, guys. We are very lucky to have you here.
