It was meant to be. :) I thought the highlight of my night was momofuku and their KILLER steamed pork buns.  After dinner, wandered down the street and stumbled across Swift. Did I mention it was Tuesday at 10:25pm?  Why is that important you ask?  They have live music or as the Irish say "a Session" every Tuesday from 10:30 - 12:30...I think :) Killer place.  Great beer....music was soooo great, good service, etc.  I cannot wait for next Tuesday!! Slainte!
