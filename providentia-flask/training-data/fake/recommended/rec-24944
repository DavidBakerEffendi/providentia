Nice place in a still developing casual yet high end food district. Love the fact that we didn't have to get super dressed up, yet still enjoyed food that was very creative and delicious. Deep fried pork balls and cheese curds are great. I had the wild boar sausage which I had NO intention of trying when I first looked at the menu but decided to go out there a little bit and wasn't disappointed. My girlfriend had the steak with char 4 sauce...which I obvious stole...and that was solid as well. All in all, good place in a neighborhood worthy of a nice walk after a meal. Will DEFINITELY be returning for brunch.
