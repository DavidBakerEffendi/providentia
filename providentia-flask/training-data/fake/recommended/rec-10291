Traveling through the area and needing a place with a gluten-free menu...Yelp to the rescue!  We found Sorella's easily and were greeted by a friendly hostess.  All the staff were super-friendly and helpful. Food was delicious!  We had baby artichokes and a gluten-free pizza with prosciutto, pesto and mozzarella, with some broccoli rabe on the side. All was yummy, delivered with a smile.  Our server checked in frequently to see how we were doing, and the hostess even popped over to see how we were enjoying our dinner. They also have gluten-free pasta available. My only complaint, and it almost feels silly to mention....it was very loud.  Music was loud, and the acoustics were such that the few people in the bar who were laughing and talking sounded really amplified. But overall, it was a nice dinner and I would love to visit again if we pass through this way.
