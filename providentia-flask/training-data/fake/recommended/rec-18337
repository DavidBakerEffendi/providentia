Came with my sister for brunch on Saturday morning. Okay, the place was full and busy but it didn't look understaffed, but my sister and I stood at the entrance looking lost for a while until someone decided to come up to us and find a table. From there, service was pretty awful, which is unfortunate because the french toast selections were great. I picked one of their brunch special french toasts and after what felt like a 20 min wait, a plate of the wrong french toast was delivered to me (which I didn't realize until a server came and took the plate away and said it was the wrong one). After that, it took another 10-15 min wait to have our table cleared and once the check was dropped, our server was practically missing and we sat around for another 20 mins until they came back to pick it up. I'd definitely give the place another try just for their french toast.
