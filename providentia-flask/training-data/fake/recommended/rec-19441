Needed a new Sunday brunch location, so decided to give this place a try. Atmosphere is nice, friendly, low-key. When we arrived at 12:30, only a few tables were free but by the time we left at 3 it was pretty much packed - so come early to avoid crowds. Most people seemed to be indulging in the $25 unlimited mimosa/bloody mary special which kept the waitress very busy. We opted for coffee, which was decent (brought to table in individual french presses) but not bottomless like the mimosas! If you are in a rush, this is not the place for you. We waited quite awhile to order, and then quite a while for food and eventually got our check, about 15 minutes after asking for it. It's much better than being rushed out of a place, but the service was too short-staffed to check in on us or make sure we were finished. Food was decent, nothing overly amazing or inventive, just good, quality, american-style food. As my friend says, we'll go again, just not anytime too soon.
