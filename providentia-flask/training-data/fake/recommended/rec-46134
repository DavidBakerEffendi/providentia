The Mill of the River is a little tucked away off the road and has a beautiful setting. I think it looks like a great place to have a wedding/celebration. We went here for our anniversary and the expereince was wonderfull. Our waitress was very prompt and friendly. We both got wine that went great with our meals! For starters we got mussels in a cream sauce which had a perfect mix of flavor. Then they brought around fresh baked rolls! (SO GOOD) and we had left over sauce to dip. I got the frenched chicken with broccoli rabe which was very good. The chicken was very juicy and not dry at all. My boyfriend got the steak and truffle fries which were great as well! I got tiramisu for dessert and it finished off the meal perfectly. Another great thing about The Mill is the presentation. Everything on the plate was beautiful. Overall a great place to have a special dinner.
