A huge city block sized indoor market place with dozens of vendors.   A must stop while in Philly, but you'll find that you keep coming back, we did. So much to see and several choices for breakfast and lunch.  Opens at 8:00 am with lines forming at the doors and closes at six pm so don't get there too late.  For breakfast we liked the Dutch Eatery, the Creperie,  the Old town coffee and brasserie donuts.    We also liked the honey shop and the olive oil shop.  You can find some great local (not touristy) gift ideas here.  We didn't get to try and fresh baked breads but they looked and smelled fabulous.  If you are lucky to be staying nearby you'll be able to visit frequently.   But Just the sights and smells make it a great stop on your trip to Philly.
