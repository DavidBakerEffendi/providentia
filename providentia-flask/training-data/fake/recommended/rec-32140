I brought two colleagues to the bakery for lunch. Fantastic baguette for my Eiffel sandwich. My colleagues had a salad and a build-up sandwich each. We love our sandwiches. I had bought croissants and desserts before but never stayed to eat there. I'm glad we did. Will come back to try crepe next. Good job and way to go!
