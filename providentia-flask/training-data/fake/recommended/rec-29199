This place was recommended to me by two people, one that resides in the Philadelphia area and the second is a writer for the San Francisco Chronicle. While in the Philadelphia area last week, I finally was able to go to Dalessandro's after last being in Philadelphia in 2010. I took the SEPTA there from Downtown Philadelphia, and finally after a 35 minute bus ride, I got off the bus at the corner of Henry and Walnut Lane and walked a block to Dalessandro's. I was able to sit at the counter, and ordered a steak cheesesteak and a Stella Artois Beer, and what a great price for the combo, as it was just $8.95 for the cheesesteak and the beer. My cheesesteak and beer we're amazing, and I am so looking forward to my next trip to Philadelphia. This place is a must visit if you are in the Philadelphia area. My waitress name was Carol, and she was sweet as can be. There was a five-year old sitting next to me with his father, and she wrote his name on the glass.
