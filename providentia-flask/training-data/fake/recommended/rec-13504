Excellent food with subtle flavors, but don't expect to fill up unless you want to empty your wallet (luckily Otafuku is across the street)! Go with the kamameshi: had crab, mushroom, and salmon at the table and all were amazing (favorite was the salmon!).  Agedashi tofu was also quite tasty.  For food from the grill: avoid the vegetables (fresh pretty flavorless, so not really worth the cost), go for the chicken meatballs, grilled sea urchin, and miso yaki-onigiri. Other perks: beautiful decor, friendly service, able to carry a conversation if you're sitting at the tables in the back. Con: $$$$.
