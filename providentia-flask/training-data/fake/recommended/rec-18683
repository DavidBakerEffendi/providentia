Great selection of craft beers on tap and rotates so we would always be pleasantly surprised. They have a few hard to find offerings of whiskeys, like FEW, 287. The staff is friendly and bartenders know their stuff. Gets tough to get second or third rounds when the place gets packed. Tipping well on the first round helps this process on busy nights. The menu has enough treats so you wont have to wander out when you want a snack or a quick bite. Coffee is awesome and so is their egg sandwich for brunch. If youre lucky, you might even get to meet Brad, one of the owners, knows every beer on tap, friendly and relaxed. JayZ and Beyonce would agree, if they knew him.
