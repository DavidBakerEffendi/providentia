Was walking by and feeling hungry.  I stopped in thinking this was just a burger joint, but found much more.  They have a large and varied menu consisting of tasty low fat items such as flavorful grilled chicken, succulent lemon steak, and a roast garlic hummus; not too overpowering, but just right.  The only thing I can suggest is that they need more vegetables on the menu, a nice chick pea salad perhaps?  Service was excellent, definitely glad I stopped in.
