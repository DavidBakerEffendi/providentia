My wife and I dined at Ocean Prime last night (Restaurant Week). It was a magnificent experience. The restaurant, formerly Roy's was transformed into a sophisticated, classy environment. The service was impeccable...friendly, informative and efficient without being intrusive. We ordered from the Restaurant Week menu and our three course meals were superb! All portions were full sized and very ample. Unlike some retaurants that reduce the size of their entree portions during Restaurant Week. We will definitely return to this restaurant...sooner than later! It was a real treat!
