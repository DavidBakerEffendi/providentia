Maybe it should really be a 2.5. I felt our waitress was a little hostile and short with us. When asked if we could sample a wine before ordering a bottle she looked at us like a table of jackasses and said once they open the bottle it's ours. I still don't know why she bothered to have someone sample the wine at the table before pouring for everyone else... They were sold out of their popular dishes by 9PM. Then they were sold out of the second thing we ordered... I went with a recommendation for the lamb meatballs which I found terribly dry and flavorless. My friend had the swordfish which she was really fishy. She claims swordfish shouldn't be a "fishy" fish. I considered giving it 3 starts, but I have no interest in returning.
