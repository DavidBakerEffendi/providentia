We went here looking to find a new brunch spot and were really happy witith our experience. The decor of the restaurant is a soothing combination of modern NYC combined with California cool. It's nice and spacious and you feel like you have a lot of room to spread out and Â enjoy brunch. The farmer's meat omelette is bursting with flavor and not too heavy. The meats are diced into like size pieces and are cooked separately which ensures that they are the perfect texture. It was so good that I can't remember having as good an omelette anywhere else. I can't wait to go back and try the dinner here. Highly recommended.
