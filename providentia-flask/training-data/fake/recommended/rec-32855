Mixed thoughts - atmosphere nice and Byob is a plus.  Menu sounds great but food not as flavorful as described.  Also felt prices high for the portions.   Crab cake and Tuna appetizers were the standouts.  Sadly, Desserts were bland.   Service was mediocre at best.  While friendly, the waiter seemed to disappear often.  Tables around us were always trying to wave down help as well.   May give it another try but not rushing back.
