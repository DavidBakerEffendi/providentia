1st time here. Went with boyfriend. Heard about the wait. The wait time simultaneously turn us on and off. When we got our estimate wait time---1 hour and 25 mintues---we thought, we must try this place because such a wait time, we thought must mean a very delicious dinner as a reward. It was a dismal rainy, albeit Friday night, afterall---try trying this place on clear and nice day, we could not phantom. Cut to 40 minutes later, boyfriend threatened to leave. I asked him in my most neutral tone, "Really?" He said, "Okay, let's wait a bit" Cut to 1 hr and 30 minutes later, boyfriend started blaming me, "You never told me about this place, now we waited so loooong, they (the hostess and Ippudo staff) might have forgotten about us, and the food might suck afterall" Cut to 10:32 pm, we were in the car, post Ippudo dinner, boyfriend said, "What wait time?" and this is because the dinner consisting of Â 2 Akamaru Modern ramen, Phllycheese steak spring rolls, and Shochu w/ freshly squeezed grapefruit juice (they squeeze it right in front of you), and matcha creme brulee was so good, it made you forget you had the nearly 2 hr wait time. Well, almost. But the wait was worth it. One thing about the ramen---as previous reviewers mention, the soup becomes very salty and too heavy near the end. The first, and for me, midway part of the soup (for others, it gets salty and heavy midway), was incredibly good. The first sip, was so flavorful without any greasiness at all. At $14/bowl, I wanted have every last drop of the soup BUT I think it would've been perfect if I just stopped have the soup mid towards the end. Next time (there will definitely be a next time!), I will do that and it would have been PERFECT. The pork, the egg, the noodles was all so wonderful--how will I have ramen elsewhere ever again??
