Ippudo is awesome.  I went during lunch with some work colleagues and was extremely impressed by the efficiency with which it's run.  It's so busy there yet everything seems to move so quickly and smoothly. That aside, the food is great.  The pork buns are a MUST to start.  Truly delicious.   Not super wallet friendly, but that's just how it is.  Still worth it!
