Love this place! I interned on Wall St around the corner last summer and came here at least once a week. I'm not vegan but love vegan food and fresh juices, and the $5 for $10 Yelp deal was unbeatable. Great sandwiches, juices, smoothies - everything is delicious! The cupcakes are to die for. Very friendly, fast service.
