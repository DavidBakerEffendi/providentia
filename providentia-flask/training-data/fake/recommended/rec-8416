Went there today with a friend after having read all these rave reviews on yelp. I really liked whatever i had. My friend has come okra along with the lentil and carrot and potatoes curry and I had chickpeas and cottage cheese and peas over rice along with the Â carrot and potatoes curry. Both of us killed it. The food was so flavorful and felt like it was home made. The person as said by my fellow yelpers was delightful and struck conversation almost instantly about India. I also like the bread that they serve as it was not the usual whole wheat bread but also had gram flour in it. The chatni that came along was also fresh and similar to the one that I make at home myself. I am definitely going back again with my husband to eat by sitting on the nearby high line.
