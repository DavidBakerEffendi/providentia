A great place to go for a quick (and sort of healthy) meal. The falafel sandwich here (I get the traditional green) is delicious - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and flavorful throughout. They are very generous with their falafel, hummus, and salad servings, so you get your money's worth. I really like their pear, mint, and lime smoothie as well - so refreshing, and a perfect combo with falafel. I typically went to the Highline to get my falafel fix from the Taim food truck before this outlet in Soho opened up. So glad to have Taim in the neighborhood now! Also - another great thing about the Soho location is that it takes credit cards :)
