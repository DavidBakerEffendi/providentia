Sandra's is perfect. Their cajun fried chicken was the best I've ever had - perfectly seasoned, not at all greasy, tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. Of course, the corn bread was, like all of the other reviews say, to die for. Then again, so were all of the other sides we got (cajun rice, mac and cheese, collard greens and fried okra). For dessert, we split sweet potato pie and my favorite, banana pudding. They were both fantastic and clearly made with love. Serving sizes are extremely generous and my friend and I left looking forward to Sandra's leftovers for lunch the next day! As if the food weren't enough, the warmth and hospitality from everyone at Sandra's, including Sandra herself, made the entire experience that much more enjoyable. You absolutely need to go here.
