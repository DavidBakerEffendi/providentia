The Elm Street location will always have a place in my heart, from Parade Day exploits that have expanded with my family, to Dinner with Leo at 500 Blake before a cross-country move.  Walking in on a Sunday night and having to wait for a commercial during the Simpsons to order a drink.  Combine that with all of the inevitable things that I don't remember, and  that, my friends  is what a bar should be.
