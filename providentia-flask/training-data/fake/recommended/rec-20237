My boyfriend and I have been regular patrons of Buttermilk since it opened, however we have been increasingly disenchanted over the past year. There have been two occasions in which we actually had some bad food. One time we had a rancid burger that had to be sent back. Most recently we had oysters, several of which had turned. Â We understand that these things sometimes happen, however if and when they do the management should make sure to comp the patrons who had to deal with the bad experience. After all, the prices are super inflated and one expects a quality experience. What seems to be happening with some frequency in this overrated Carroll Gardens neighborhood is that the service and the food are mediocre at best. Too bad, but unfortunately so true.
