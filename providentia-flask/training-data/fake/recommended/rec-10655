Sazon Latino is a fantastic, family run restaurant that is both eat-in and take out.  Although it is not a "fancy" place , the food was authentic, hot, and delicious. It is served buffet style, so you grab a plate when you walk in and then sit.  My husband and I both had barbecue ribs, chicken, fried pork, rice, beans, plantains, and empanadas for $15.  The owner greeted us warmly, served us himself, and checked on us several times throughout our meal. We truly felt like we were eating at a friend's home. The menu changes everyday and we look forward to going back and trying something new. You won't be disappointed!
