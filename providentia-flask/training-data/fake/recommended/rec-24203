Ignore all the negative reviews you've read about this cafe! I went there this weekend for brunch with my family (17 people total!). We did have a 30min. wait but boy was it worth it! Not only did they accommodate our large party but the service was Â perfect. Meanwhile, we must've ordered more than half the menu. The red velvet pancakes($10) lived up to all the hype! The creme brulee waffles($11) were to die for, the atlantic lox & eggs($12) was like a party in my mouth & the stone grounds grits($5) were THE BEST I've ever tasted! The only thing we all agreed wasn't very good was 'the kitchen sink($10). The biscuits were like bricks, so dry you could choke on them. Lastly, the coffee gave Starbucks a run for their money & the food portions were gargantuan! Not one of us were able to finish all of our food!!
