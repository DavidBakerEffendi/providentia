Was bummed because I was eating here while dieting...but we had a wonderful server named "Cali" who was very accommodating and gave us great options for those of you who can't have all the fried and dyed stuff! I did cheat a little. I had just 1 of their rolls w/ the cinnamon butter and I had to strap my arms to the table not to grab another one. The food was tasty (even w/ the BBQ on the side). And the service of the staff - they are just so sweet and friendly! Definitely, cant wait to get back to CT to go for round two at Texas Roadhouse
