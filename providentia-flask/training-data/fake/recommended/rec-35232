This review is for the lunch box area. I used to buy lunch here often. They had variety of bento-boxes, noodles and rice balls. But they've recently renovated the place, and have no more noodles and curry. All they have now is 4 or 5 types of bento-box. It's kind of disappointing. I have to find anther place for lunch.
