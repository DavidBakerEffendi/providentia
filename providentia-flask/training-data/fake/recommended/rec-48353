We have lived in the North Slope for over 30 years and have settled on Steinhof's as our favorite go-to place when we're tired, hungry, or both. Since it's in the South Slope we must pass a hundred other places on the way without giving them a thought. Portions are big and filling. A typical meal for two is a soup for each of us (chicken consumme or tomato soup with a dollop of sour cream) and a shared wienerschnitzel, washed down with San Giovese wine or Jever Pilsner. Only half as hungry? Cold chicken salad is tangy perfection. Not quite as hungry? Wieneschnitzel sandwich with their mystery dressing will take the edge off. We also love the cod sandwich, brook trout, bread pudding, and vegetable ravioli.
