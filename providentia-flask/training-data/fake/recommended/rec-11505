It's my local go to... The foods incredible and fresh but I've yet to have anything on the menu that has tasted better than the beans that come with the bread... It's not a knock on the food, but it's all about the beans. The octopus was not fresh and sandy. Not the best Italian in the city but the best restaurant in my hood. Seatings competitive
