OMG! My friend has been raving about this place for a hot minute so I was convinced to go and give this wonderful Cafe a try with her and I was not disappointed. First off I love the decor and cleanliness of the establishment. I picked the sausage & Beef Ribs (awesome), from the buffet bar: I got some beans mixed with something with steamed shredded collard greens on top, a finely grounded Yucca crumb like powder with bacon, Fresh steamed okra, some stuffed cod fish with cheese and the total cost of the plate was $10.99. All of the food was fantastic, fresh and offered a unique taste bud experience, (I freaking Love It!). For Desert my friend Frances bought us a gigantic slice of coconut / pineapple cake. Let me tell you, 1st of all I was stuffed as is, but this cake was sliced big enough for two to share, the cake was warm, fresh, lightly sweet, super Â moist, coconut cream topping was so dreamy, creamy and oh so fresh tasting. I was flawed! Absolutely hands downs the best coconut cake I ever tasted people, I swear by it! I went up to the cashier and asked if they make their cake on the premises and they said yes, WHAT!!!!! This establishment is a hit and firing on all cylinders! I will be back with friends and family. I love it!!!! Did I mention price is right! Customer service is tight. See you there....
