I've been going to Sripraphai since 2002 and the food is consistently excellent and prices are extremely reasonable. One piece of advice: when you ask for medium spicy, expect to get sweaty and hot! Â The spicy-ness continuum definitelyt matches authentic Thai standards. Other restaurants just don't compare. I recommend this place to everyone.
