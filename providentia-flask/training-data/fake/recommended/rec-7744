So this place is a pretty generic izakaya restaurant/bar. The service is good, the food is decent, and they make it quickly. The prices are fair and the restaurant has a welcoming feeling to it. This is not grade A Japanese food though. Its not the sort of place you would take a date to impress, but a place to meet friends and chow down. All in all, I am happy I found this place.
