I loved nearly everything I had here. I think the brussel sprouts and fried cheese sticks are must tries. Also, the falafel was delicious and the fried beignet's were delicious! A few complaints include an overly long wait for reservation and the Lamb Shmarma sandwich's meat was not very tender. thetrufflehoney.blogspotâ€¦
