Wow this place was pretty crowded on a Tuesday evening! I had to settle for a bar seating - still, no problem there. Chorizo for appetizer came out in flames. The Chilean sea bass was excellent. More than enough food to be sure! I also had the sparkling Portuguese water drink which I never had before. Not bad, though I still like pelligrino better.
