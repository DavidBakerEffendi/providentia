Terrific service. Pleasant, knowledgeable and quick staff. Reasonably priced food, delicious and filling. Beautiful bay views from 3rd floor. Even bean bag toss games in the back. On street parking, everything u could ask for. Even free shuttle service from the train if you need it. Highly recommend this place!
