Cash only with an ATM on site. I've been here multiple times and usually try something different each visit. I have yet to be let down. The food is incredible and the friendly staff operates with a sense of urgency. I usually finish my plate fast so I can start stealing my wife's food. If I had to choose a favorite I'd probably go with the Shrimp & Grits Benedict.
