This is my new favorite local spot when I'm in the mood for a fancy, herbacious cocktail in lovely surroundings. This is in the same location as the Artful Dodger, and is everything that I wished the Dodger had been and more. One of the best compliments I've heard about SHS is that "it looks as though it's always been there." The period look is understated but consistent throughout. It feels very natural and plays up all the things about the location that makes it relevant to the neighborhood, but doesn't overdo it, like Stephen Starr's Dandelion does. The drinks and food are pricey, but they're good, fresh, unique, well-proportioned, and delicious. I particularly like the chef's modern take on classic American dishes, specific to Philly and early America. As a PA Dutch person, I was particularly impressed with the  amazing Shoe Fly Pie desert, which was made using gorgeous ripe figs and plated beautifully.  Other meals we've had here are thoughtful and delicious. Think Ela in terms of modern twists on Philly classics, however SHS has a bit more of a nod to the historical Philly scene. The prices are a bit prohibitive, cocktails run around $10-$14 a pop. There are more affordable drink alternatives such as Pilsner Urquells to quench your thirst for around $4-$6. However they are special, this is not a place to come get loaded before you traipse down South Street. It's more a place to soak in the scenes of Headhouse Square while sipping on a delicious and precious hand-made cocktail. I only hope they can keep folks coming with the prices the way they are, this is more of a Serpico crowd, so I imagine folks are coming South from Society Hill and North from Queen Village in order to quaff delicious beverages. All in all, one of my favorite new locales in Philly, I love taking friends and clients here. Thanks SHS I hope you stick around for awhile!
