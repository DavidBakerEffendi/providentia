I love that their cocktails are $10 when other bars are creeping up to $15, which is against god. Their cocktails are also fairly hefty. My dry gin martini was very smooth and the Redhead Gibson is a like a friendly punch in the face--it hurts, yeah, but you like it. Food-wise, I wasn't in love with their menu options, which felt a little fancy, a little down-home, and all over the place. The prices were the same way, with their fish dishes going upwards of $24, even though the atmosphere is really casual. If I had to choose, I'd love for this place to be down-home all the way, an expansion of their famous fried chicken and bacon peanut brittle, which I can't get enough of. You're thinking, "yeah, it's like bacon bits or bacon flavored," until you come across a tiny meaty chunk of actual chewy, smoky bacon stuck on a crispy little peanut. Schwang! And although I'd love to see this have a focus on country cooking, the leek and crab soup, which sounds as fancy as it gets, was fantastic.
