perfect lunch spot when you want something light and fresh and pretty.  I had the artichoke chicken salad and it had beans in it the size of my brain.  Have you ever had a mouth full of bean?  It's fantastic!  The bigger then bean, the better.   I'm totally coming here for dinner one night after work for sure.
