I've been twice now & really enjoyed both sandwiches. Hubby is a fan of the buffalo chicken. I've tried the Italian cold cut & the chicken Cuban and been very pleased with both. I could see that this might not be the place if you were short on time and going during breakfast/lunch/dinner rush time. We had nobody in front of us & had to wait about 5 minutes for our sandwiches - not sure how long the 10 people after us had to wait. They've got plenty of items to put on the paninis, both veggie and meat, so I'm confident that the pickiest eater could find something. They also have about 6 soups of the day to choose from. Each time we've been there it's been super clean and the staff has been friendly, and those are big pluses to me. It is pricey for sandwiches, but they are really good and so much better than any other chain sandwich shop. We were a party of 3, each having a Panini, chips & drink and the bill was around $30.
