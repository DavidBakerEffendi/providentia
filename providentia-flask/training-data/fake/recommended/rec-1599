Honestly, who needs to go to New England to experience fresh, amazing lobster when you've got Red Hook Lobster Pound in Brooklyn?!?   Not I.   That first bite of the Maine Style Lobster sandwich, made me feel in my bones, that I was somewhere on the tip of the oceans in Rockland, enjoying the best catch of the day.  Granted these were Maine lobsters, I was still transfixed.   The white bread is slightly toasted with some charring on the outside, but soft like marshmellow when you bite into it.  Along with that soft texture of the bread is the buttery and cool snap of the steamed lobster flesh, tenderly dressed in mayo and other magical seasonings happening in these vats at RHLP.  Paired with a crisp pickle, a bag of cape cod chips and a bottle of lemon lime soda, this was by far the highlight of my Red Hook Food Tour. The CT-style roll is served warm with butter and no mayo.  I tried a bite of it, but quickly realized that a cold lobster sandwich befits my palate a bit more.  Another popular item here is their whoopie pie.  This chocolately-goodness was the main draw for a couple friend of mine who decided to pass on the lobster, but shared (and dominated) a whoopie pie.  I didn't try any as I was way too stuffed (and needed room for the "swingle" experience that was to occur shortly after), but it sure looked pretty (damn) good. The lobster roll will set you back about $18 with the drink, but look at all the money you'd be saving if you nixed that lobster trip to Maine and just stick to good ol' BK.  You'd be having lobster sandwiches all summer long.
