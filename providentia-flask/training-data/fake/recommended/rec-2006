We had a nice meal at the Continental Midtown. The ambiance is certainly...different...in this restaurant, but it makes for a fun evening. We got the udon noodle soup, edamame, chicken lettuce wraps, and pad thai and everything was delicious. The pad thai was a bit too saucy for my taste, but my boyfriend enjoyed it. I would definitely dine there again and would love to try some of the other, more inventive items on the menu.
