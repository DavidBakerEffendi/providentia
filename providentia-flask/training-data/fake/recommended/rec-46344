My husband and I went here yesterday for his birthday and had an awesome time. We ordered a couple of apps and he ordered about 6 different beers. I did not drink any cause I am pregnant, but he said they were amazing. He was very pleased with their beer choices; they had an entire beer menu with a crap load of ones to choose from. Apps....those I did have. The truffle fries were oustanding!!!; as were the fried pickles. We had the wings which were good and the kobe beef sliders which were kind of dry. Summary...I would definitely go back!
