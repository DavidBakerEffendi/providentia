ambiance - simple casual dinner best buger i've had? definitely not. super friendly waitress? check amazing boring salad? no ... not worth it, dressing wasn't good. interesting sauces? yes ... homemade ketchup, diablo sauce, jalapeno ranch, garlic aioli sweet potato fries? hmm, not a fan of sweet potato fries, but it was sprinkled with cinnamon truffle burger? manly burger? they recommend medium rare, and it was ok ice cream sandwich? cool concept, it was snicker doodle cookies with vanilla ice cream and burnt caramel sauce with a bit of sea salt ... definitely not a fan, just ate the ice cream =) overall, glad that the wait wasn't too bad, it was half an hour on a friday night for 2 ppl at 7:30pm fyi.
