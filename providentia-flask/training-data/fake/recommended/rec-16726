Friendly staff, nice salads, sandwiches and specials. A filling lunch for two: Two cured meat baguette sandwiches ($8.95 each), one salad with avocados/oranges/walnuts, and a diet soda -- about $32 (without tip). Plus complementary table bread and bruschetta slice. Can get busy/full during noon hour.
