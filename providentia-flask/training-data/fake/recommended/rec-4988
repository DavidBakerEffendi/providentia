I've spent so many drunken nights craving a taquito from here. When you come in you're greeted by the owner who makes you feel like a guest in his kitchen. The options are beef, chicken, bean, and pork. Everything is top quality --  bell and Evans chicken, Berkshire pork, Grass-fed beef! You could choose 3 or 5 of one of the fillings. I like this because I like to know what I'm eating, you would have no idea which is which if they mixed them. The toppings range from the yummy guac sauce, classic cojita cheese and lettuce. To the chronic!! Which means everything on it and in my opinion is the only way to eat a taquito. Guac sauce, jalapeño relish, lettuce, nacho cheese, and cojita cheese! This place is so delicious! And the tip jars are an east/west side war every night! You could put a dollar in the biggie or tupac jar and represent!
