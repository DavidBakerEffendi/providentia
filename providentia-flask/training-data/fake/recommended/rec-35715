I was in town for a conference and tried Tinto on a recommendation, and literally everything we tried was fabulous! The crab canapes, bomba rice, organic chicken, were my favorites. And the Â artichokes! The sauce was amazing! Service was great and our waiter gave great recommendations. Highly recommend! Apparently Garacas also works with Mercat in Chicago, which I've been wanting to try...can't wait!
