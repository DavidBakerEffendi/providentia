Why does everyone thing this is the best street meat in NYC? The chicken and lamb are both so plain and diced to the point where the meat has no texture. No spices + no onions = no flavor :( It's not bad but don't believe the hype. I've been to at least 6 different halal stands that make more flavorful lamb/chicken and rice. The white sauce seemed pretty standard as any other place. The hot sauce was very good though.
