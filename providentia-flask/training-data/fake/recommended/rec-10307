My rating for Min Ghung would definitely be different if there were an option to provide different star levels for different aspects.   The food gets 5 stars for sure.  Very creative, fresh and excellent!   Then things go downhill... Location - 1 star - It is absolutely impossible to find without a treasure map!!  It is located inside an office building with no signage at all to indicate there is a restaurant.  We only found it because we called and asked them where they were in relation to where our GPS took us.  The explanation was something about the town only allowing them to have 3 signs...so they chose to have three 8 1/2" x 11" pieces of paper taped to the walls inside.  Not their best use of marketing dollars.   Cocktails - 2 stars - they were overly creative on paper and poorly executed.  If I am going to pay $8-$10 for a cocktail, there should be trace amounts of alcohol in them. Service - 2 stars - The staff was not attentive at all and extremely slow.  My date ordered Miso Soup and I ordered seaweed salad.  His soup came immediately, and then he, being polite, waited for them to bring the salad.  It took so long that it was determined they forgot (10 minutes, at least) and then they finally brought it.  They acknowledged that the sushi was taking a long time by saying the "sushi bar was backed up because it was so busy"...there were approximately 6-8 other people in the entire restaurant.  But we got free edamame out of it so it wasn't all bad.   Decor - 3 stars.  It was just a little odd.... the bar had flashing lights like it belonged in a night club...the rest was affected Asian decor...nothing to crazy.  Always a fan of the waving lucky cat though :) I probably will not go back...
