My Princetonian husband has many tales of the Haven from late nights in the E-Quad.  When we were there for Reunions in 2002, the line around the block told the whole story. I've had many a meal from the Haven and have never been disappointed.  Apparently the prices haven't changed since the late '80's.  We stop in every visit we make to town.
