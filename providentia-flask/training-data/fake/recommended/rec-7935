Today I had a terrible craving for barbecue and decided to get a pulled-pork sandwich to go. I'd heard some not-so-encouraging things about this place but thought I'd give it a chance. I lived in Memphis for two years (actually close enough to a large barbecue establishment that my neighborhood was often permeated by the smoke) and there they always put sauce on the sandwich--first the meat, then the sauce, then the coleslaw that has a little mustard in its dressing. So anyway it didn't occur to me that I would get a sandwich with no sauce--not on the side, either. Coleslaw was just ok, the cabbage should have been cut smaller. The meat--well, at least it was pleasantly free from gristle and excessive fat. But the texture was strange, or maybe I should say lack of texture. The flavor was strange too, as if the not-all-that-apparent smoke flavor was not 100% natural. Overall, it seemed like something that had been on a steam table. Having experienced sandwiches made from chopped-while-you-watch meat--this was not that fresh. In all fairness, I did get it at an off time on a weekday in the off season, but still...) The sandwich came with a LOT of fries which were good but a mite overcooked. So, probably won't go back to Baby Blues. Haven't gotten to Phoebe's in a while but I've had much better sandwiches from there. When I was in Memphis I missed hoagies. Here I miss barbecue but then there's porchetta! Monet, you were somehow deprived of the Mid-South's great food!
