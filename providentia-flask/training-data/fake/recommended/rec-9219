There's nothing like a humid summer day and a frozen mojito at Habana Outpost.  Okay, so the mojitos are a little bit on the pricey side for such a casual place but it's cool since there's picnic table-like seating out in the wired fenced in concrete area.   So you go inside, order, pay, get a ticket and then you go pick up your food at the truck outside.  I tend to get a little nervous as sometimes it's so packed, I can't hear the person sitting at the next table, let alone the guy on the truck yelling out your name to get your order.  But it works out.  Usually the porter guys will echo the name through the area to help out.   Surprisingly, the inside is a little "neon-ish."  Doesn't go with the decor of the outside of Habana but oh well.  The bathrooms!  Oh my, try going in the fall when it's chilly out.  You'll realize your bum is cold because there's sorta no roof in both of the stalls.  Go check it out.  I actually kinda like it. Food is good though not outstanding.  I go for the atmosphere - I think they still have movies on Sunday nights?  It's broadcast on an external wall of a building next door.  Oh, and if I remember correctly, there's one beer that's always 2 bucks for a just less than pint. Check it out :)
