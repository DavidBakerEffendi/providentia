I should have know this would have been a bad experience when the male host showed me To my Seat and threw my menus on the table. The coffee tasted like dirty water and that was after we asked for a second pot, b/c the first pot tasted just as bad. So much so that as I write this review my husband is currently in dunkin donuts gettin us coffee. The scrambled eggs and cheese had no taste. The pancakes would have been pretty good if it were not for the fake pancake syrup packets that we were given. The corned beef hash also had no taste and was swimming in grease. (and I am a fine conessieur of hash). Â The waitress was so nasty she made us feel as if we were bothering her; she never came back to check if we needed anything. When I asked for extra napkins she practically threw them on the table. BOTTOM LINE: DO NOT GO HERE!!!
