This place packs a Alphabet City punch.  Loaded with fresh sandwich ingredients and bang-for-your-greenback value, I don't think any sandwich here can disappoint. Okay okay, so I only tried two of their sandwiches. So what? When you enter a place, order a few things, and are supremely satisfied with what you have been given, I think it's ok to follow your emotions and deem a place worthy of four-star praise. My girlfriend and I ordered the roast beef kimchi hero and one of the chicken-based presidential sandwiches.  The latter was great and the former was good but the kimchi tasted a bit overripe.  Typically that kind of kimchi needs to be put in a stew (kimchi jjigae) or fried (kimchi bokum), but definitely not in a sandwich.  It's a good try though.  What can I say, I haven't come across many delicatessens that take a stab at including kimchi into their lineup. I would come again just to try their other sandwiches as everything sounded really intriguing.  The only downside is that they don't take credit.  Even if it's good.
