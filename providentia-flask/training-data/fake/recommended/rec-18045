I am native Philadelphian, lived in many sections of the city and 44 could be a gem, but started to quickly go down hill. My husband and I live walking distance and frequent the shops along 44th street often. I've been to 44 abour 4 times, with varoius groups of friends the food is never consistant, I can't say I've  ever had good dish there. Food is burnt,  tasteless or undercooked.  So dark you can't even see your food and waitresses always seem annoyed.  Really dispointing :(. I hope it changes, would love to support the local businesses.
