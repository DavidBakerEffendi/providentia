I've only eaten here once, but the dish I got was *amazing*! Orichette pasta with kale, black truffle butter sauce, and soybean seasoning on top. Sounded a bit odd, but it was so incredibly delicious. The wine list was quite nice as well. Got a good red at the recommendation of the waiter and it complemented the pasta perfectly. Didn't get a chance to try the mixed drinks, but the menu looked very interesting. Will have to go back and try those next time!
