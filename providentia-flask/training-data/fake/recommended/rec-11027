The best thing I can say about this place is that the pizza comes fast and is edible. Other than that, I think the routine ordering of this stuff for events by my school is contributing to an inevitable early death...or maybe it's my eating it that's doing that. Even the alternative, highly uninspired sandwiches from their competitor caterer are preferable.
