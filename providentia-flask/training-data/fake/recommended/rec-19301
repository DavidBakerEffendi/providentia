Not being a resident of Philly we had never heard of this restaurant. We actually found it while waiting for our reservation at another restaurant across the street. Looking at the menu it just reminded us of Elevation Burger. We ordered single smoke shacks. Loved the spicy taste. Fries were good as well. Staff had great attitude as well. I will definitely come back when next in the area.
