I have been here a few times now for lunch...I work right in the area so it's my go to lunch haunt with reps or clients...and I love it! My favorite thing here has to be the calamari! It's simply amazing...you could make a meal out of their calamari because it's soo delicious! I've also had their steak and the lamb...the lamb was a little gamey for my taste but the steak is a hit each time! Their menu is not as vast as I'd like...I feel like obviously you have talented chefs, why not change it up every now and again? If it wasn't for their lacking menu I'd give this place 4 stars...as of now..3.5 is where I stand :)
