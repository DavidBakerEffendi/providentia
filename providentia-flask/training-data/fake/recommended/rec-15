Interesting new spot still trying to find an identity type of cafe/restaurant/indie music venue/lounge spot. The decor is very chic and modern. The food and desserts look very promising. I had a side dish veggie plate and cheese ravioli which were amazingly tasty. I didn't try the coffee but def will. Great location.
