I had a full satisfied belly and a wonderful evening after leaving this place. Atmosphere: We came early at 6pm when there were plenty of empty tables and got a nice corner in the back patio. By the time we left, every seat was filled and it was a lively, upbeat place. Staff are friendly and attentive and kept my water glass consistently full. Great overall experience :)
