Came here on a Thursday night with a friend. No reservation; it's relatively small and was definitely crowded, but they found a great table for us within a few minutes. They have a happy hour until 7 which is definitely a deal. Everything is $3.50 on a condensed (but still vast) happy hour menu - which includes drinks. The Avocado Salad was light and refreshing, and the Eel Mi Don was flavored very well. I would suggest the Plum wine as this sweet and light wine was perfect for a summer evening. The wait staff was more than doting and accommodating and the decor was low lit and very intimate. All in all, the food wasn't bad, just perhaps lacking in flavor and underwhelming - although it's hard for me to judge entirely as I only ate off the Happy Hour menu. It's worth a try if you're in the neighborhood!
