I'm split on my review of Market Table.  I've been a couple times before and a friend even rented the restaurant out once for a party.  Each visit (including tonight's) was the same.  Everything sounded great on the menu (interesting food, cask conditioned ales) but what came out was just so-so.  They are definitely very busy and none of the staff seemed that excited about serving one more table. The pantry/shopping area is a cute idea, but not that useful if you actually are looking to buy something. For me, it was too busy with just average food to justify the hooplah.
