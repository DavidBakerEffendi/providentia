Great ramen place in the neighborhood. Great black and red decor that makes it intimate. I think it's a great date spot. The ramen is big enough for you to split. When you walk in the staff cheers - so much fun. I'm only marking it down to a 4 star because you can't take home leftovers! Never heard of that! I couldn't eat all of my bowl so definitely will split next time I go.
