What a find!  What started as a food truck on PENNs campus is now a 25 seat restaurant just off South Street.  Never had an arepa before but these amazing little pita pocket type bread slices you can stuff yourself with the most amazingly seasoned meat or veggies.  And the sweet plantains are the perfect balance along with the black beans.  Get the Seafood soup of the day made with shrimp.  It comes in a cast iron bowl with enough for two.  We couldn't believe it was an appetizer.  Thanks to the owner who walked right up to us and explained the menu.  Finally, ask for their fresh squeezed juices of the day.  Amazing experience.
