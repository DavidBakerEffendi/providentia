I was very pleased to find this spot.  We had the $7.95 buffet and it rocked!   The clasics were there - adobo, pancit, lumpia, langanisa, skewers, fried fish, crab, and they even had chocolate meat!  I love chocolate meat!   The variety was really nice quality of the food was quite good, espec ially considering it was an 8 dollar buffet. East West took me back to high school (I was friends with a lot of Filipinos back in the day).  It like going to a filipino teenager's senior year graduation party.  It was hard not to call the nice older lady at the cash register "auntie'.  Next time I'm in Jersey again, I'm coming here!
