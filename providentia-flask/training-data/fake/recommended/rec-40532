Delicious grab and go burritos. Very filling and well seasoned meat selection. Also different sauces that you should request to have blended together. They also have old style Mexico glass coca cola bottles that works perfect for washing down your meal. Be careful when requesting sour cream, he will give you a large scoop unless you ask for a little.
