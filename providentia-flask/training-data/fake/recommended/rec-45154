I loved Halversons Upstreet Cafe! I went there for a late lunch, and I ordered the standard burger with fries. My fries were cooked to perfection and also perfectly salted. I always love a fry that doesn't need ketchup to be good. The burger was one of the best I've ever had, excellently cooked(medium rare) and the buns were perfectly greasy. I had a great meal at Halversons, and you should too!
