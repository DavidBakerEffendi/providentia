My expectations were admittedly high - I wanted some serious Italian cuisine in Philadelphia.  Is that too much to ask?  Here, yes.  It was amateur hour from the very beginning, and I sincerely hope it's because this restaurant just opened or something.  Let's first start with the most obvious - La fourno is incorrect Italian.  It should be Il forno.  And that pretty much sums up the experience at La fourno.  The lighting upstairs is all off - way too bright - and the rest of the atmospherics just seemed a bit thrown together.  I was served a lemon wedge in my gin martini (really?), it had ice cubes in it, they didn't have Hendricks or Tanqueray (only Sapphire), and it tasted all wrong.  I sent it back asking for some vermouth.  The manager asked me a couple of times if try #2 was better, and I guess it was better but still off.  Sure, it's fine.  They struck it from the bill, but c'mon people, gin martinis are not complicated.  Their success with the drink foreshadowed the meal.  I ordered the "star" menu item, a $28 veal parmaggiano that tasted like they dumped a whole jar of Prego and then melted a block of Kraft parmesan on top of it.  The accompanying pasta met similar success, probably store bought.  I should have known better but I ordered an espresso after the meal and it tasted like just really strong bitter coffee with just a hint of crema atop it.  When you shell out $55 for a meal like I did here, I'm sorry Philly, I just expected more.
