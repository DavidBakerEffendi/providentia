Incredible! One of the best brunches in the city. A very French feel, everything on tiny plates and small tables, a little cramped - even for NYC. Plan on a wait, but it is very worth it and if you stick around you may get in sooner. The Belgian waffle sandwich, brunch salad, croquet forester - all delicious!!
