Very nice restaurant with the quintessential Philly byob ambience. My wife and I started off by splitting the ricotta gnocchi in truffle oil. It was the best part of the entire meal. The ricotta gnocchi were light and soft. We had the pan roasted trout and yellow fish tuna entrees. The trout was very good. It was served in a very tasty vinaigrette. However, I didn't care for the yellow fish tuna. It was pretty tasteless.
