The Farmhouse is definitely the best restaurant we have been to in VT. We wanted to go last year when it first opened, but didn't have an opportunity. I think we will be visiting every time we return to VT from now on! The quality of the food was top-notch and the service was friendly and attentive (thank you, Sarah)! Â  We came to the Farmhouse for a celebration dinner with my family- a combined birthday party and graduation party. It's safe to say this was the best meal my husband and I have had in a while. We ordered quite a lot of food, and I tried at least a bite of everything. To start we sampled: the nitty gritty cornbread, the Vermont cheese board, beets, and about 3 orders of the blue cheese garlic toast. The cornbread was gone in an instant. The cheese board was amazing. And the blue cheese garlic toast? The fact that we had 3 orders for 6 of us says it all. I can't say enough about this appetizer, other than that this is a must-try. My husband and I were both hesitant to try it, but he has been asking if I will be able to recreate it since we left the restaurant. On to the entrees: I had the macaroni and cheese with bacon. Yum! Delicious and flavorful, topped with a ton of bread crumbs. My husband had the bacon cheeseburger, which he devoured. I tried a bite of course and it was delicious. The fries were addicting, and we loved how the condiments were served. I also tried the meatloaf, which was tasty. For dessert we all had a few bites of the chocolate cake. It was rich, chocolately, and fudgey, and the perfect way to end a delicious meal. We can't wait for our next trip back.
