Okay, so it was a special and not on the regular menu, but their filet mignon with gorgonzola sauce was THE best filet mignon I've ever had  And I generally don't even like gorgonzola.  On busy nights it can feel a bit on top of your fellow diners, but it isn't often that busy.  Ambiance in the main dining room is fine, but nothing special.  The small bar area is nice, with cloud murals on the walls.
