I think Pizza 46 is one of the better establishments in the area.  I'm here about once a week, most know me by name, and Tom is great!  To be honest, the place doesn't seem to run as well when he isn't handling the counter, but it isn't a deal-killer. Can't speak for much except the pizza and the garlic knots.  Both are good.  The cheese pizza here is excellent and btw, you don't know if a pizza place is good with all those toppings!!!  Get a cheese slice and then you know if the sauce and the crust are cooked to perfection - it's the only way!!! If you are looking for a pizza place to call home, this may be it!
