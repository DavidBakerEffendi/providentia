After a stroll through the west village I found myself craving a burger and went back to my mental list of burger places to try... which is how I wound up at the Corner Bistro. I came in all by my lonesome, sat in the back and waited for a server to come find me. A nice old man came up to my table with his pen and pad ready, and asked what I'd like to eat... in which I asked him if I could have a menu... he smiled, pointed up to the wall where the menu is and said I couldn't go wrong with a bistro burger... so of course I ordered that... a bacon cheeseburger? How could I resist?  And because I needed the whole experience I got a side of fries too. After reading a chapter of my new nook book, my blessed little meal arrived on two small plastic plates.  The burger appears to be small but it's not my friends... it's one of those burgers you need to open wide for (dirty minds exit left) because it's so big.  The burger came with cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and an onion slice.  All the condiments you need are right on the table.  First bite and beyond, the burger was juicy, flavorful and all around yummy. Fries were a bit of a let down but I'll let that slide.  It wasn't the best burger I've ever had but it was pretty damn good for your no frills, low key burger place.  The price isn't bad either... for my bistro burger, fries and a coke - the bill was right around $14 bucks excluding tip. Keep in mind - it's cash only for all my religious swipers out there!
