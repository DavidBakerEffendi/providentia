I really don't like being told that the chef changed how something is made months ago and that I have been eating buttermilk for who knows how long.  That is not cool.  All of the seitan dishes were either removed from the menu or they were changed to include animal junk.  Basically this place has gone from being awesome to just another burrito shop for the vegan community.  Boo!
