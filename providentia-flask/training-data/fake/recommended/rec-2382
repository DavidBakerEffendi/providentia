I was told by many people from Philly to skip the Geno's/Pat's tourist trap but I couldn't help myself.  The cab ride wasn't far and I have seen the plae on the travel channel so many times it had to be a stop on the list.   The line is long but moves pretty quickly. I don't think the service was great...they only half listened to what I said. It looked clean, and the food was good.   The bread was fresh, the steak was quality and what doesn't taste good doused in cheese?   I ultimately decided on Geno's as opposed to Pats  because I wanted chunks of steak- not just shaved steak.
