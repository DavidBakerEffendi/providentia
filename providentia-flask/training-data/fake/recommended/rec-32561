Came here with my boyfriend before seeing a musical. His parents suggested the place for their food and because we were seeing the musical and I'm so glad we picked this place. They were really accommodating and nice - they knew how to work the timing well. I loved my veal parmigiana and my boyfriend's short rib special was also amazing. I had some left over from the huge portion so I got to take it home for later in a cute bag with a logo. Can't wait to go back at some point and try their pastas!
