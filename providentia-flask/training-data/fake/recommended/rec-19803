I give them 4 stars for their awesome food! Had the fried porkchop with waffles and it was amazing! Just what you'd expect to eat in a southern/Midwest diner! Their short rib hash was pretty alright. I wish they had the fried chicken available though! Their buttermilk pancakes were delicious, but definitely had better Bellinis and coffee at other places. Took off one star for the ridiculous one and forty five minutes wait on a Saturday! But mehh, I guess what else can you expect from a New York good brunch spot? Will be back next time but probably on a weekday or slow random weeknight!
