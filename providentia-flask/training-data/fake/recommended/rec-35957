Made a quick two-day trip to New York and this was my favorite meal of the trip! We ate in the restaurant but ordered all pastries for breakfast. Even though we were not ordering a high dollar amount of food, I never felt as though our server was rushing us out of the restaurant. She came back over and over to refill our coffees and waited until we asked for the check to bring it - it was really nice to not feel rushed out of there. The ham & cheese croissant ($11) is heavenly. Absolutely, positively order it! The banana walnut homemade donut ($2) was probably the best donut I've ever had. The cinnamon bun was pretty good, but I think the sticky bun might be a little bit better - but I'd still order both if I got to sample everything. The coffee ($4.50 with unlimited refills) tasted like Intelligentsia but I didn't ask. I'm not a fan of Intelligentsia but the others at my table enjoyed it. I highly recommend this place!
