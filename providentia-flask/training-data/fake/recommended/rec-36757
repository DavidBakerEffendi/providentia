NY = BOMB ASS STREET FOOD! We got there around 12:30 AM (beating the drunk crowd whohoo!) and there was already a long line starting to form down the street.  Given the popularity I was skeptical to see if it was only tourists who went here.  When I saw cab drivers and cops in line waiting for the food it reassured me. It had to be good if locals were willing to wait in line. Although it was a long line it went fairly quickly.  I had the lamb and chicken and couldn't believe for all that food it was only $5.  There was probably enough food for three people to share!  I smothered on the white sauce and inhaled my food.  Damn, it was just as good as everyone raves about.  Chicken was tender and not overly flavored.  It went perfectly with the rice and white sauce.  I wasn't a fan of the texture of the lamb but when mixed with everything else I couldn't really tell the difference. For $5 bucks it was probably one of the best meals I had in NY.  Drunk or sober this street food is DELICIOUS!! Halal cart can you please come over here to San Francisco?
