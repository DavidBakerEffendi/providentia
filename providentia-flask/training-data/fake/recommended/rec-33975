Very cool atmosphere. It's just fun to be in this space, and the waitstaff were friendly and cool. The fois gras donuts were awesomesauce, but my salmon was meh. My parents had better luck with their entrees though. There wasn't enough on the menu to keep me coming back here; it felt like a once and done place to me. But you should go once!
