I will definitely come back to Kim's sushi. I went on a Tuesday evening around 7 and there was no wait. The world cup was on and the staff was still very attentive. Our waters were refilled and the food came out very promptly. I decided to try some of their interesting named rolls like the Dawn Roll (Salmon, Avocado Wrapped w/ Salmon, Avocado, Soybean Paper and Special Spicy Sauce on the Top) and the Spicy Crazy Eel Roll (Cucumber & avocado wrapped w/ baked eel & Kim's sauce). They were both fabulous! My boyfriend ordered the salmon roll, eel roll and tuna roll. He enjoyed his rolls as well. Towards the end of our meal, they gave us a free roll with smoked salmon and some spicy sauce on top. It was pretty good. The meals both came with miso soup and salad. The miso soup was personally too salty for my liking and the salad dressing was a little off. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.
