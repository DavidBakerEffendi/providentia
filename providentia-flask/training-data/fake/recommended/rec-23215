We are experienced diners of Ethiopian restaurants; we've tried them in New York, Baltimore, Chicago, Philly, Houston, and Colorado.  My wife, in particular, loves the cuisine.  This, despite getting an upset stomach nearly every time she eats it.  When we saw the reviews for Almaz on yelp, we decided to go for it. My wife had the shiro; I had a beef dish.  The shiro was good.  Strangely, it arrived with sour cream, which wasn't a great fit; we just ate around it.  The beef was a little flat and not as sizzling-crispy as I would have liked.  The injera was good, maybe a tad dry.  The other side dishes were good.  Overall, the dishes were more low key than in other places that I've tried.  That is, the injera and shiro were not as sour, the bourberrie was not as sharp.  It was not bland, but just tamer than what we're accustomed to.  Overall, we were happy with our meal. The server was very friendly, and she did not charge us for food that we ordered for my 2-yo daughter which was very kind. I found the experience of eating Ethiopian at a western style cafe a little odd.  There is a case of soft drinks, including yoohoo and fanta, and a display of muffins and cookies sitting next to you while you chow down injer and doro wat.  But really, it's nice to have options.  My daughter is very fussy about eating, so it was good that they had bananas for her to eat.
