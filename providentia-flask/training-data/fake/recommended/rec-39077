Authentic, quaint and polite. Kind of small but the French ambiance, friendly staff and especially the delicious, freshly made flambés make it worthwhile. It's easier to get a table if you come in twos or small groups. There are free refills for the coffee and the mimosas are nice and strong. They have Nutella too, for their sweet flambés. There are more than just flambés on the menu for those seeking something else but the signature is obviously the crispy flambés. Would definitely go there again!
