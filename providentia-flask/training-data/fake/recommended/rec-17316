I am a huge fan of Cuban Petes.  There are only two complaints... 1) they don't sell liquor. You can bring your own bottle and they can even mix it for you, but don't think for a second that when you order the mojitos that there is liquor in it.. there ISN'T.  2) it's so popular you will have to wait and it's crowd 8 out of 10. I absolutely love the ambiance and décor of this place. The entrance makes you forget that you're even in Jersey. I've never been to Cuba, but between the décor , the uniforms and the Spanish beats it feels like I'm at least out of country. The food is DELICIOUS! Growing up with Spanish food I'm VERY particular about it, but this food is GOOD. I can't recommend this place enough.
