A solid 3.5 stars. Pretty intense crowd for a Thursday night, so reservations definitely recommended. Wonderful service and a rustic coziness made up for a slightly odd seating arrangement right in front of an open kitchen and next to the entrance. The Squash and Apple salad we started with boded well for the rest of the meal, focusing on the basic ingredients and flavors balanced with a deft hand. A very pedestrian pancetta-wrapped pork followed, which stood out for its incredible tenderness, but somehow failed to "pop" -- the earthiness of the meat and french beans just begged a touch more acidity in the sauce perhaps. A flaw which my companion's veal cutlets remedied more than adequately with the tartness of the artichokes setting off the savory breaded meat beautifully. It was a delicious, relaxed meal which we enjoyed more than the 3-star rating suggests, but one dogged by the constant feeling of expecting more (portions? excitement?) for the money than what we got. Fortunately, good company and moderate expectations made tonight a memorable enough evening.
