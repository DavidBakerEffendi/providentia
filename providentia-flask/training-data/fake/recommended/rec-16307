Checked in because of the Yelp reviews... Had the Polpette starter and the Spinach Raviolli Â main. Simply perfect. This is a restaurant run by a foodie. The menu, the wine list, the service is all about the food. A real gem and a must see for anyone who sees beyond the size of plate as a measure. Food is simply perfect in portion, presentation and palate.
