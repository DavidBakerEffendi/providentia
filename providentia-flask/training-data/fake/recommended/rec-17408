Had high expectations for this place but the food was only okay. Cute decor, service was friendly and accommodating. I ordered: Pork pot pie (too salty.. don't put all the gravy in..), Pretzel appetizer (very good!) and clams (on a bed of salt.. which was not pleasant when you get a mouthful of it)
