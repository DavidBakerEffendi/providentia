Went here for lunch because I was around.. and it was the worst experience I've ever had at a food place. One particular employee that had "helped" me that day was the most rude and careless person I've ever had to deal with..He was so lazy and in such a rush to get me out of there (there was no line whatsoever, I was the only one in the store at the time). While he was in the process of still putting my sandwich together, I had asked him if those were pickles, but he literally ignored me, wrapped up my sandwich as if I was already done, and said "its too late". Oh, and the food? Nothing special. Just huge sandwiches full of random crap. Or maybe I didn't enjoy it as much after having a huge argument with the employee. I have no tolerance for terrible service like that. Never going here again.
