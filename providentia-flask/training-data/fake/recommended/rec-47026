Wow this little BYOB in South Philly could quite possibly have been the best food I've tasted on Philly. The decor isn't fancy, but it still has a cute romantic feeling to it. We were greeted at the door with a warm welcome and escorted right to our table. Somehow the host was our server, food runner, and busser, and just so happened to be the owner. If one person can handle all of these tasks and do it well, then what is everyone else doing in Philadelphia? We chose to do the tasting menu because we simply just couldn't decide. An Amuse Bouche of Smoked Corn Chowder was a tasty way to start. The tasting menu began with a Tuna Crudo with Asian Pear and White Miso which melted in your mouth. Next, was the Venison Pate with Sourdough and Whole grain mustard. Hats off to the Chef for that dish. Then, the Skate Wing, OH the Skate Wing served with corn and a basil aioli, just to die for! Fifth we had the Strip Loin with an Aged Gouda and Sauce Bordelaise. YUM! Last was dessert, which was a duo with Figs and a Pecan Tart and Peanut Brittle with a Chocolate Ganache and Semifreddo. I was really blown away by the service and food and I know I will be back. Something interesting to me was that they have their own pastry chef who bakes all of the fresh rolls, and creates all of the fabulous desserts. One downfall is that they don't take AMEX. Make sure to bring your VISA or MC. So when your on E. Passyunk, be sure to check out Fond! You will be back again and again.
