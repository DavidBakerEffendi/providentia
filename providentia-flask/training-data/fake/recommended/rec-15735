This review is for brunch.  I made reservations and came on a Sunday morning (around 10 am since we knew it'd be less busy since alcohol can't be served until noon).  I got there before my friend, but they wouldn't seat me until the rest of my party had arrived.  I completely understand this policy, especially during busy hours, but I had recently had knee surgery and was on crutches and the place was almost empty, so that was a little frustrating.  I got the eggs benedict with the chicken sausage, which I definitely recommend.  My friend got the potato waffles, which I tried and found a little bland although they were a comfort food if that's what you're looking for.  I would probably go back again if it were convenient, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back given all the brunch places in NYC.
