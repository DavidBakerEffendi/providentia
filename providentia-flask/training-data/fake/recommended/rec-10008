One-stop shop: it's like a buffet, grocery store, cafe, beer store, korean noodle bar all came together and had an orgy! I cannot believe after all the times I've been here...I've not checked-in or wrote a review for them. Food's relatively cheap and good. Typical korean dishes -bulgogi (rather tasteless/bland for me), seafood stew, short ribs, tofu soups are all available hot in the metal cases to the R past the buffet section. The meal set up isn't bad, an entree for $6ish and you get rice and soup by the cashier. Brown rice is 50 cents more. They have Korean sushi too, which is somewhat rare-ish. Always my go-to place when I need a Korean food fix for fast and cheap when I am in K-town. Tip-bits: Please clear your table and trays when you are done. Free h20 water available by the noodle bar counter in Igloo cooler Place is packed in the evening with people coming from work and what nots. So eat and go, eat and go!
