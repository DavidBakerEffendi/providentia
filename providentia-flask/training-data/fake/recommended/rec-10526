I didn't eat here, but sat at the bar drinking beer while my cousins eat. The 1st cousin had the beef stew which he raved about and the other cousin had the special bison/buffalo burger which he didn't like cause he's a dumb-ass & didn't realize that buffalo doesn't taste like beef .... Wowever, the hoegaardens (beer) were very quaff-able the service was decent, the food smelled and looked great and seemed inexpensive for the quality/quanity. I must head back here next time I'm in this part of town to get something to eat.
