The Ssam Bar is a very modern place - ceiling-to-floor wooden décor, often packed and very lively. I've dined here and ordered off their main menu, as well as ordered the famous Bo Ssam. I made a Friday 11pm reservation a month in advance  for a group of 10 for the Bo Ssam. We considered adding one or two more people to our party, but the staff there was pretty strict about reservations and we couldn't exceed the maximum number of people (10) for the Bssam. The slowly cooked pork shoulder was tendor and very flavorful. They provided plenty of items to compliment the meat such as oysters, lettuce, rice, dipping sauces, and kimchi. You can put the pork, rice, oysters, onto the lettuce, and top it off with the various sauces provided to make a sandwich.   The Bo Ssam ended up being $225 for the entire thing, not including tax or tip, and the restaurant allowed us to split the check for multiple credit cards. It was a fun experience to eat in a big group and all 10 of us were completely satisfied and stuffed!
