The pancakes and banana french toast were pretty amazing, really nice and fluffy.  I'm not really a bacon person, but definitely enjoyed theirs.  I think the best part was their maple syprup.  Not sure if it's made inhouse, but it was perfect.. not your typical Aunt Jemima.. It was certainly a solid good meal with no complaints.. However, be prepared for very long wait! Up to 3 hours and don't think they take reservations. They'll text you when your table is ready.
