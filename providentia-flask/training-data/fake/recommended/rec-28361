I adore Il Bambino. It's basically the quintessential neighborhood spot. It's small, but the decor is cute and comfy. Everyone who works there is friendly and sweet. I've tried a bunch of the paninis and have never been disappointed. They're also pretty big and I often take half of it home with me. Lunch tomorrow! And at 8-9$, that's pretty great. I have never had a panini here that wasn't fantastic. I haven't yet tried any of the crostinis because I'm still working my way through the panini menu but they look pretty amazing. Last time I was there I went during the week for lunch and the were pretty quiet. The waiter let me just sit and order my third latte and finish reading my book. Really pleasant way to spend the afternoon. Plus they had great music playing. Can't say enough great things about this place. I can't wait until the garden opens!
