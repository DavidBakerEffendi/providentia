It was Fashion Night Out, and I'd just tottered out of a swirling, drink-fueled crowd at the McQueen store.    I crossed the sidewalk to the warm and loving hum of the Red Hook Lobster Pound's truck .  Butter-toasted rolls, light slaw and generous chunks of freshly-boiled lobster make this sandwich the must-have accessory (and snack) of the season! Tip: You can fit two lobster rolls snugly into a McQueen, studded Britania Clutch! (Mind the Mayo.)
