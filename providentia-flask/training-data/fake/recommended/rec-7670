Ippudo is a standardized, fastfood noodle chain; enough said already about what to expect. Considering the choices for Ramen in New York, Ippudo is nothing too exceptional. If I am craving pork broth soup noodle, I would go somewhere that serves fresh handmade noodles, especially since ippudo requires waiting too.
