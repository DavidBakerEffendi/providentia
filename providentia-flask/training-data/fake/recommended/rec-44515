Most reviews gave this place justice.  The food is incredible.  I brought my mother out on a date and we had one salad, one pasta, one side, two entrees and two desserts - the perfect amount of food for two.  And if you must judge hey, we're filipino. We eat and of course we get two desserts - I dare someone to ask me to share a dessert with him/her.   We shared the garganelli pasta and it gave me a whole new meaning to al dente.  It was impeccably crafted and executed.  The pasta is thick and had a nice bite.  The mushroom ragu was hearty and we mistakenly thought that there must have been meat.. but no, just great quality mushrooms.  My mom's branzino was fresh and light.  The roasted vegetables with my quail were tah die for.  Get the olive oil cake - no regrets. But what made this restaurant truly a top notch/memorable/fantastic experience was how GREAT our waiter was.  I feel so bad I don't remember his name - tall white male (real helpful Amanda).  Ahhh.. My mother talked at length about the food much after our check was paid for with the waiter and he was SO INCREDIBLY PATIENT and kind.  He explained all the dishes thoroughly (again) - up to how the brussels sprouts were deep fried, how the pasta was freshly made, and exactly which mushrooms were in the ragu.  He made a joke on how he "didn't" fill my mom's wine glass enough so he refilled and then explained which grapes were used in the wines we chose.  Great customer service - A+. Maybe I'm just used to fine dining in NY that's cramped and hurried and I got worried that my mom's CA life was a bit too friendly, but no... this restaurant is just perfectly exceptional.
