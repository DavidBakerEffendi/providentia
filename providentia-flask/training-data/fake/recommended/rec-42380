I live in Boulder, CO and I actually look forward to our visits back east to see family, take my kids to Grover Cleveland Park, and to eat an eggplant parm sandwich from P&SB. Overlook the fact that the place hasn't been updated in years, maybe ever? The food rocks. hard. You locals are used to really amazing food, I know, but there is just nothing like the sandwich barn here at the foot of the Rockies. We may have great skiing, but I'd take a slice of their tomato and onion pizza or one of the great cold deli sandwiches over ANYTHING I CAN FIND TO EAT HERE, ON ANY DAY OF THE WEEK!!
