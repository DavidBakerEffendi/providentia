Sukiyaki pork and prime rib were super tasty! It comes with plenty of vegetables and well-cooked sticky rice too. The staff was very helpful and showed us the whole process, and checked in various times to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and doing okay with the cooking at the table. It's a cozy, casual vibe, the kind of place that's perfect for a night with friends. Not to mention, heard of this place through recommendations from various friends.
