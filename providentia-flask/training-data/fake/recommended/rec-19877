the place was great - great service, great wine, great food...except for our entrees. they were SO SALTY...literally tasted like eating a salt lick. my brother and sister had the fried chicken which was perfection except for the amount of salt in the breading. I had the linguine which again was delicious - light and delicate...except for DUMP OF SALT! The cauliflower soup and the coffee pot de creme were both exceptional - even on the 'etheral' level. I have no idea what happened - we came on Monday and got the prix fix (amazing deal) so maybe it was an off night because of that. I will go again - hopefully the salt was a mistake!
