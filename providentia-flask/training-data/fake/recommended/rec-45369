Went here for dinner on a Sunday night and waited 20 minutes for a table. This place has outdoor seating in the rear under a tent. Tables had small votives and was very cute and quaint. They were playing bluegrass and country music, which is a plus in my book. Five stars for ambiance. Food: We ordered carrots as an appetizer and they were pretty plain, no brown sugar or glaze, but were still sweet and delicious. We also had the greens salad and the dressing was great. The salad was pretty plain with no tomatoes, onions, or nuts, but the simplicity was still delish. For an entree I ordered the sweet sausage and red pepper. It was good, but there were no noodles in the dish - only polenta. I would have liked some noodles. Also, I wasn't impressed with the bread and olive oil served at the outset of the meal. Neither were remarkable. I'd go back if a friend insisted on eating here, but I think I'd prefer to try other places before going back.
