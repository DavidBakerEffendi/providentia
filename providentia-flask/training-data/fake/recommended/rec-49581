I absolutely love risotto so I decided that I would order their special meatball that night, pizza ball, with meat sauce over risotto. The meatball was good but the risotto was not cutting it... I'm not the best cook and I can make better risotto. In a sense I shouldn't have expected too much since they are known for their meatballs and not their pasta but still a little effort wouldn't have hurt. Â Over all the meatballs were good and it's probably best to have it as a sandwich or just by itself.
