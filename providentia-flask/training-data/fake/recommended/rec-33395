My dinner at ABC Kitchen on Thursday night was the best meal I can remember!! It was the perfect place for my family -- beautiful design, relaxed but elegant vibe, not too loud, and most importantly, AMAZING food!! Between the four of us, we got the crab toast, salmon tartare, and cauliflower dish to start. The crab toast was RIDICULOUS. I'm still thinking about it. A must-have for sure. Salmon tartare was also amazing. Perfectly grilled sourdough bread as the base for both the tartare and the crab toast. We ordered the cauliflower dish with the egg on the side because I don't eat eggs, even though the waitress cautioned us that it might be a little dry--It was THE MOST DELICIOUS CAULIFLOWER I've ever had in my life!! Even my dad who doesn't love vegetables like I do agreed. Then for our main dishes we had the house made spaghetti with chanterelles, the tomato basil pizza, the burger, and the sunchokes. The spaghetti is now one of my top five favorite pasta dishes (along Scarpetta's spaghetti, and Spago's sweet corn agnolotti), and the sunchokes were an amazing seasonal special. Definitely get them while you can! I did not try the burger but they loved it, and the pizza was solid. I've definitely had better as far as the dough but their tomato sauce is really delicious. The pinot noir and blood orange bellini were also excellent with the meal. And for dessert, I had heard so much about their salted caramel sundae that we had to try it and it definitely lived up to the hype!! We also got the doughnuts that were perfectly light and airy. All in all it was an unforgettable meal. ABC Kitchen is definitely my new favorite restaurant in NYC! SO GOOD!
