Really a 2 star, but 1 star to pull down the average, even if by a tiny bit. As not authentic as it comes. Another case where Yelp is wrong. (cough cough Joe's Shanghai) I got the beef hand pulled noodle soup, which should be the best thing on the menu if you're advertising yourself as a lan zhou noodle restaurant. Tasty? no. The soup had minimal flavor, you could hardly tell it was beef. The beef itself was plentiful, but very bland to almost an unpleasant flavor. Hand pulled? well yes, I saw the guy pull dough but the noodle width were inconsistent, I got thin noodles to udon sized noodles. There was plenty of it though and they are nicely chewy. They did get right the smell of the dish, unfortunately nothing tasted like what it smelled. Seems like most people here don't understand what lan zhou halal beef noodle soup should be. Gather round, let me tell you what it's all about. The broth should be not overly rich, but well spiced and unmistakably beefy. The beef itself should have been stewed in that broth for hours, just as flavorful and tender. The noodle should be consistently sized and chewy. the aroma should be powerful and make your mouth water, and when you dig into that steamy bowl of noodles, your dreams should come true. I will never return to this place. Call me a purist, but a good lan zhou noodle shop Â definitely shouldn't be serving pork.
