Literally the best pizza i have ever had. Sauce on the top is pure brilliance. Any other pizza you eat is dominated by the cheese.....santucci's lets the flavors of their delicious sauce do the talking. After eating santucci's pizza I have not been inclined to eat pizza anywhere else...period. Also, there wings are very very good. I had 6 of their honey chipotle wings delivered and they were fantastic....still nice and crispy. The sauce was good too however don't be fooled by "chipotle" in the title because they were not spicy one bit. There was a nice smokey flavor though. I have made it a point to try some of their other food as well because my guess is that it will be good. The only complaint I can make is the 3 dollar delivery charge.....kinda steep.
