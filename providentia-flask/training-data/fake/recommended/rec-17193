Not to oversell the place, but this is probably the best authentic Haitian food you can find in New Jersey with a fine dining setting. Coming from someone who grew up eating Haitian food regularly, Saveur Creole's dishes are as good as it gets. From the marinade fritters, to the bouillon soup, to the pork griot, everything tastes as amazing as it looks.They pay a lot of attention to presentation. The portion sizes are a little smaller than I would have liked, but the quality makes up for the lack of quantity. It's a pretty small venue, but Â very clean and well maintained. The furniture had a very vintage look, but the place settings felt very upscale. All the staff were well-dressed in all black. My only negative is their bathroom. There's no pleasant way to put it. It's absolutely terrible. Just take my word for it. Don't expect to find any bargains. All the main entrees over $20. It is very high compared to other Haitian restaurants in NY and NJ The staff are friendly. I went on a Weekend day with no reservation. At first, I was told, all the tables were booked for the evening. Keep in mind that I showed up right when they opened. They still managed to find me a table but the overall service took almost 2.5 hours, so don't visit this restaurant if you're on a tight schedule. They refill your water glass regularly. The owner greeted all the patrons on the way out and even shook my hand. The only reason I took one star off the service, was the wait time. They are a pretty busy place. Food: 5/5 Environment: 4/5 Price: 3/5 Service: 4/5 Overall, I would visit this place again, but it would be for a special occasion. It's a little too fancy and expensive for casual dining.
