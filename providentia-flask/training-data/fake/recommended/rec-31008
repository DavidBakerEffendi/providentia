Friends and I have dined here twice--a late lunch during the Manayunk Bike Race and lunch on a Friday. Both times everyone has walked away impressed. Â  Incredibly well done establishment: a casual environment that is attentive to every detail. Pizza is amazing. Bread and spreads are amazing. Drinks are amazing. Service is great!! Looking forward to dinning here on a more regular basis.
