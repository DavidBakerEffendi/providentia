I came here with friends and we were greeted with a wonderful variety of complementary breads.  Service was prompt, and very accommodating to our various requests.  I am vegan and got the Cappellini di Pomodoro, which for $16 was not at all expensive.  I requested various other vegetables be added to my pasta, which they did at no extra charge.  The food was delicious and we were given good portions.  I had dinner just the night before at one of the other restaurants in Little Italy and did not want to come back, but it was totally worth it.  Pellegrino's blew the other place (whose name I don't remember) out of the water.  This will definitely be my go-to if I ever want to take anyone to a good Italian place in NYC.
