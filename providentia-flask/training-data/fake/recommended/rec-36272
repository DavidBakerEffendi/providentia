One of my favorite restaurants in NYC. 5 stars does not do it justice. This place is always amazing. The decor is simple yet elegant, the food is superb and the crowd is always pleasant. I've been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. A reservation is a must for Sunday brunch. It can get crowded and you may have to wait for a table but it's worth it. Balthazar, you never disappoint!
