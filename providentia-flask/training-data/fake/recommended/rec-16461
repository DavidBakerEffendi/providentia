Delish! You get the best of all worlds. What a great idea - rolls, bowls, burgers & buns. Went for dinner and were able to sample a few items on the menu. We had the kobe beef burger - I am not the biggest burger fan but this was heaven, the spicy tuna roll (couldn't' get enough of), the pork bun (yummy) and the soft shell crab bun rocked!!  We also tried the grilled chicken bowl - healthy and nice mix of veggies. A must have - the tempura sweet potato fries - you won't be disappointed. Be sure to sample the sauces(think we tried a wasabi spicy kinda a sauce and the spicy ketchup which if bottled I would have bought to go. Oh and how can I forget the sake to compliment our fine meal.  Prices are reasonable and food is ready timely. Everything was fresh and bursting with flavor.  The place offers a nice relaxing setting décor that of Japan, light music in background, and wooden like booths that have cubbies underneath to place your belongings. Loved, loved, loved it! Have to try the spicy tuna burger next.
