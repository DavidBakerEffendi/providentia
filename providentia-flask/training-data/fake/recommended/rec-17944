Had the Filet Minon on the stone Â ($24.00) and it was amazing! However, the service was a bit slow and not very attentive. For example, I'm assuming the steak on the stone is their "thing" ... Why did it take 30 mins for our steaks to come out? My husband thinks it's because they were heating up the stones; fine, but why not have 10-20 of them heating up at all times? Tip: cook the meat FAST because the stone cools pretty quickly.
