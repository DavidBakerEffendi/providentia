My fiance and I recently spent a week in San Diego, eating a ton of great tacos so we were craving them and decided to go here.  We started with ceviche and then we each got a variety of tacos.  They were all fantastic!  The carnitas (which is actually pork belly) was so good and the special that night was a scallop taco which was fabulous!! They unfortunately don't take reservations for groups under 8 so there can be a long wait, but it's BYOB so bring a bottle of something, open it up and have a drink at the bar!  Fun addition to the neighborhood!
