My first New York Pizza experience so I cannot compare it to the other local pizzerias as I have not tried them yet. I walked up to Grimaldi's from the York St. subway station and, given the previous reviews of the 1 hour wait times, was pleasantly surprised when I walked in the door and was immediately seated... in between two complete strangers. The place was almost packed but I was not about to let that drive me away from a supposedly great pizza. Awkwardness aside, I placed my order and waited patiently (15 minutes)  for my pizza to arrive. Wow! was all I could say when the pie was placed before me. I ordered a small (6 slices) Margherita w/ half pepperoni and it seemed enough to feed maybe even 3 people. The crust was great- thin and crispy on the outside. The mozzarella/basil/sauce combination was awesome and not too many nor too few pepperoni on the pie.  The service was good, the waiters pretty friendly, and my water was refilled without having to ask. My leftovers were even wrapped securely in butcher paper/cardboard. I will be paying Grimaldi's another visit soon!
