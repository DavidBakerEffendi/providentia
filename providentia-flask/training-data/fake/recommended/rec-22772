This is the Chinese version of the soup nazi made iconic by Seinfeld. Fast service, in and out.  Except they'll never say NO DUMPLINGS FOR YOU! Cheap, efficient, and atmospheric with the wafts of fragrant oil all around, you can watch the cook throw dumpings into the giant wok and douse them in grease, which of course makes them super unhealthy and thus super tasty. I've been to some other cheap dumplings place in Chinatown, and unless you're talking about buying frozen dumplings in bulk (which I believe this place sells as well), you really can't beat the value here.  5 dumplings for $1 in this little humble abode of someone's downstairs turned into a hole in the wall, I ate this for several weeks straight while intensely studying for some exams.  Quick, efficient, delicious.   Some might compare this to Prosperity - Prosperity is a much more commercialized place, and their dumplings are cleaner, for sure.  Maybe go there if you prefer bland healthy food (there are healthier foods than dumplings tho...) or are allergic to grease or oil.  Come here if you want the greasy delicious street food to satisfy your cravings.
