Not sure how this place gets such good reviews. I got a sandwich and a bagel. The sandwich was mediocre at best. They didn't offer the full menu on a Sunday either. To top it all off I ordered an everything bagel with cream cheese. She gave me a tiny container of cream cheese with no knife to spread it.
