This is one of my favorite late night snack places after hitting the clubs. I've been here while sober as well. The swings in the front are a lot of fun to sit on as you enjoy your wrap. I tried the following items in order of awesomeness: Wolf Attack- I love crispy tater tots with cheese, jalapenos and meat sauce. Howling- This is one delicious chicken wrap. Though some of my friends mentioned that it was too salty. Blasphemy! Pink Moon- This shrimp wrap is tied with the Howling for my favorite wrap at this place. Once Bitten- As a carnivore, I am amazed at how much I enjoyed this veggie wrap. It has ingredients like goat cheese and beets that I don't usually like. Yet I still like this wrap. If they put chicken into this wrap, this would definitely become my favorite wrap. Â  Carnivore Delight & Underworld wraps- I was very disappointed by these two Angus meatballs wraps. The beef was a bit dry and not flavorful. The Carnivore Delight is marginally better than the Underworld, because it has eggs in it. The wraps were not terrible, but I wouldn't recommend them. Save your calories and money for the items listed above.
