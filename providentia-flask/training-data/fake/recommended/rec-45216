So we wanted to try a new hibatchi place. We started off good, the soup and salad came at the same time which was weird but I didnt really care cuz I dont eat either. It was food time. The food was good but the waitress killed it. We never got the sushi we ordered for appetizer and we were looking all over for out waitress. I was also needing another drink. No waitress. I told the other waitress and she answered "ill call your server". Lets just say she cleaned 3 tables before getting her. we asked where the sushi was she replied " oh sorry they're kinda slow they're training people". What? Really? It took 25 minutes? Well where were you in the meantime when we need you. You need training yourself. Â I gave it 2 because the food was actually good.
