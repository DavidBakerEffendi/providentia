This is one of my new fave restaurants! You know when you enter an authentic restaurant, it's truly authentic if it's filled with the same type of people as the type of restaurant. In this case, it was Japanese.  Service was top notch!  Food, delicious!  Bathrooms were clean & handy (there were tooth picks, mouth wash & maxi pads in there!) I'm still craving the garlic fried rice. I can't wait to go back and get some more.
