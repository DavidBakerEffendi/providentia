This place is absolutely delicious. I always thought it was called cafe antonios, but whatever. I have only ever been here twice, but both times it was so good. I keep telling my boyfriend we should go again and again, but we usually opt for indian fare. The first time i went was for a confirmation dinner and the place was packed with big parties. We got tons of appetizers and the ones that i tried were delicious. I ordered the gnocchi which was so good, that the second time i went back, i had to get it again, instead of trying something different. The service was very friendly and attentive and they sure do a brisk business. I think they also have a little pizza shop attached for take out and quick bites. The wait to get in on the weekend was a pretty long time, but it was worth it. The decor is beautiful and dreamy painted murals of skies and villas. I would totally love to go here all the time. Everyone who i went with or talked to about this place loves it. Why go to some crappy olive garden when you can get a good meal for the same price and not actually have to go to trenton which is becoming overrated and kind of sucky.
