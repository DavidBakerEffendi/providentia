I'm not a breakfast eater. Yea yea I know, it's the most important meal of the day but really, I'd prefer to eat my pancakes for dinner. On my last trip to the big apple, a friend of mine raved about Clinton St. so of course we made a trip out there one morning. The place is small but luckily it was just 2 of us so we got seated at the bar area. The blueberry pancakes is more than enough for 2 people static.px.yelp.com/bphot…. Trick: cut out a circle in the middle and pour the maple syrup into it so that the bottom pancakes get some love too. The omelette was good but nothing special though the fried green tomatoes with the sour cream dipping sauce was tha bomb dot com static.px.yelp.com/bphot… I probably would have given one more star but like I said, I'm not a huge breakfast fan. So yes, this place is A-OK in my book.
