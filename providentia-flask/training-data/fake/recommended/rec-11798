I had high expectations for this place but frankly, the experience fell short.  While the staff was friendly and place had a nice neighborhood vibe, the food was just eh?  I had the seafood stew which really wasn't that hearty... but yes there was half a lobster, a few clams, and some shrimp... the liquid soup was probably only a third of the bowl.   Highlights though were the fried oysters and the dipping sauce (olive oil, garlic, etc) for the bread.  Low point was the non functional toliet.  If you're in the area, check it out yourself.. otherwise, don't let somehow convince you to trek there from outside of Brooklyn.. not worth it.
