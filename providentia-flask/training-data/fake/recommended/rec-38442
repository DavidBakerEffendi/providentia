Sandra catered our son's rehearsal dinner last week.  We were so impressed with the set up, service, attention to detail and wonderful food. 65 people, all with different dietary needs: vegans, vegetarians, gluten free, meat eaters.  All were raving about the food. Being from Nashville,  we wanted to bring a little "taste of the south to the mouth".  We tasted a lot of "southern" food in the New Haven area and none compared to  Sandra's Next Generation.  Hands down, the best around!   Sandra will cook anything that you want her to cook.  She is very flexible.  If you want Italian, Asian, or good old country cooking, she is the one to go to for a special event.  Sandra's wait staff was helpful, attentive, accommodating, and fun.   I guarantee that most people who were from the New Haven area will now be stopping by for a meal at Sandra's.  Next time we are up that way we will definitely have a few meals at Sandra's Next Generation.  Check it out.  You'll be glad you did!
