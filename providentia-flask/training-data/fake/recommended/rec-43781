On a busy Friday night, I accompanied Jen S. to the wonderful hole in Hell's Kitchen called Empanada Mama. Now, I have to admit I did not exactly know what an empanada was -exactly-, which I think is probably the experience of about half the people jumping into this place. Or maybe it's just me being dumb. I had a good time here, and Jen S. did too, but it was just so damn small. And really loud. We were sitting next to two early twenties bitches who had their sunglasses on the whole time even though the sun was no longer out. Also, it's not bright in there. I suspect drug use. Anyway, they wouldn't shut up. And like most people who don't shut up in small restaurants, nothing they were saying was even remotely interesting. So all I wanted to do was kill. The food was good. It has a good reputation, which I think it pretty much well deserved. It's also pretty inexpensive overall, so you totally get your moola's worth. I would go back to this place, but probably with a more substantial group that could overtake a section of the restaurant. I would also like to go at a time that isn't directly post-work, which is probably when they are most crowded and most busy. If you are thinking about going, it's totally worth the trip.
