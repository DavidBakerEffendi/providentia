I cannot praise American Flatbread enough.  Every time we go there we love it.  Every guest we bring raves about the food.  Everything we order has been AMAZING.  My favorite is the salsa pizza (cannot remember the name but black beans and corn with fresh tomatoes...so delicious).  The pizza with the kalamata olives is also a big favorite.  The location is convenient.  They also make beers onsite.  No reservations but we never felt the wait was unbearable and the past few times we didn't wait more than ten minutes.  The wait staff are nice and friendly.  It's also kid-friendly and large group friendly. This place is worth the wait!
