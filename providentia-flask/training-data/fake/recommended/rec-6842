What can you expect when a storefront on an unfashionable block of 4th Ave. turns into a restaurant?  Pure magic.  What do I think about the fact that geese are greatly inconvenienced in order to provide us with fois gras?  I think we need more geese!  And the staff at Olivier really knows what to do with them.
