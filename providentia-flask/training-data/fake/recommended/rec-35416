Hearth is one of the few places where I would recommend to bring a date. Located at the heart of east village, Hearth offers great ambiance and is close enough to the bar scene so you can get your date nice and liquored up after the dinner (provided that you did not already splurge on a bottle of wine). The charm of Hearth is in its extensive wine list. I am by no means a master sommelier, the staff will be more than willing to walk you through their prolific collection and choose the right wine to accompany your taste. Do not be intimidated and do ask questions. When in doubt, ask if you may taste the choices that you've narrowed down. They will happily oblige. As for the menu, I would recommend the scallops for appetizer and the poached chicken for entree. I have not yet tried the tasting menu, but it will be a priority the next time I visit Hearth. Hearth earns 4 stars for its attentive and friendly staff and impressive wine list. So bring a date, bring your friends; heck, bring your mom. Hearth will definitely leave a lasting impression. One last word of caution: Although Hearth opens late, it is usually flowing with traffic. Do make the effort to obtain an reservation. I did run into trouble getting a table a few times during peak hours.
