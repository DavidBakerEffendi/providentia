OHH LOVE THIS PLACE!!! My husband is from Texas, so he has been saturate with lots of Mexican food... and this place is right up there. Great flavor, the chicken is moist, portion sizes are great. There are only like 5 tables, so this is not a good place to take a group, but you can order out!! I will definitely be going back!!
