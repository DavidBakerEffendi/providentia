Good gyros. I preferred the chicken personally. The back of the tongue hot sauce combined with the vinegary based yoghurty white sauce make for an explosively tasty combination when added to the deliciously sizziling mystery meat. Is it lamb and what else ??? What a delectable combination. I visit NY from LA quite often and I love the street carts.If I could I would live on them my entire trip but I need to be kind to my arteries and other organs that would take a beating every time I go (you health people will know what I mean).  Anyway, this cart  is pretty good and is comparable to the one I frequent which is 49th and 6th. A couple of blocks south. They are pretty much the same. However, they are incredulously good compared with anything we have in LA...... I f these guys come to LA they could charge double at any one of the gazillion farmers markets and people would still line up. The price points for these places are fabulicious.
