It is quite exciting to have one of the best, if not the best, falafel joints grace the east side of Downtown Manhattan.  Serious Eats called them the best falafel in NYC, and I would have to agree wholeheartedly.  The falafel is smaller and more expensive than most spots, as the sampler is $4 but only includes 5 or 6 falafel nuggets. Yet what doesn't add up in value, is more than made up for in texture and taste. The Red flavor is fun, and the Harissa (spicy) flavor is great surprise. The Green flavor is hands down addictive as crack. Super crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a great combo of parsley, mint and cilantro makes the Green flavor the top falafel...at least in Manhattan. The sandwiches and platters offer the best value and comprehensive samplings of what is great about Taim. The Sabich platter is my favorite, offering eggplant slices, hard-boiled egg, parsley, with hummus, israeli and moroccan carrot salads, and a side of pita. Order that with a side of falafel might be a bit expensive for a falafel-based meal, but the experience is worth it in so many ways. For those who have tried their smoothies and fries, please let me know how they like it. I have yet to hit that part of the menu yet!
