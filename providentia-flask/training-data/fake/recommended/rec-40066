Come by for an early dinner on a Sunday and get in for the happy hour.  $2 yeungling!  The pizza is YUM.  And you can do half one type, half the other.  The meatballs are also so tasty.  I loved this place.  Worth the trek!  The sauce is so fresh and tomato-ey, with good amounts of garlic, basil, oil flavor going on.   Great pizza place for sure!
