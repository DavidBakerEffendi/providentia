Discovered Black Bamboo a few months ago after reading a write up in the Courant and we now get takeout once or twice a month.... Everything is so fresh and delicious, not your usual Â greasy Chinese take out. Great ingredients, wonderful flavors, healthy vegetarian options. The owner is so friendly, and the prices are great too.
