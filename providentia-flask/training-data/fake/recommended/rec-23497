Wine Down Wednesday!  Nice concept which was enhanced by half-priced wine bottles!  The rioja selections are nice as well.  I have to say that everything we ordered was deeellliiiissssious!  Definitely had two favorites - the spanish cobb salad with deviled eggs were A-MAZING!  I don consider myself a connoisseur of deviled eggs but this has got to be hands down the absolute best deviled egg I've had EVER!  My next fav was the Phyllo wrapped Salmon!  I can't say enough about this sinfully tasteful way to serve salmon with pickled slaw! OMG! I was hesitant initially because of the picked slaw but the flavors melded perfectly inducing an almost orgasmic palate experience!   The ambiance is really nice.  I love the bar & tv screens- definitely tastefully done, nothing like a sports bar feel at all, but I could see myself catching a Giants game on a Sunday afternoon.  I haven't experienced their nite life but am looking forward to dropping in one night. The service was excellent!  Very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu:)
