I'm usually in Morristown but I always crave these subs! The owner made me a panini one time and I literally have dreams about it and my mouth waters and I can't satisfy my craving so I go to Blimpie and cry crocodile tears whilest eating a sandwich that is not the one I really want....which is a Super Hero Sub! I know I was being dramatic....I just really wanted you to feel my pain.
