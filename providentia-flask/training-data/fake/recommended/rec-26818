I try to go at least once a week.  Each time I go I say this "if I ever am going to the electric chair I will order the following as my final meal;  Peking style pork chops, beef with Pan fried noodles, and chicken with Chinese broccoli."  pork chops are like candy!!   i typically order 1 or 2 more different dishes also.   I get as excited as a kid in a candy store when I go here.  I love the place.  ask for the chili oil if you like a little kick.  I don't think I've ever left with a doggy bag cause I eat it all.
