Had a group of 7 people and the service was good. I like the atmosphere of the place - especially the HUGE fireplace at the back of the room. Nice to sit around with a cold beer and good conversation. Discliamer: Food is a subjective thing... like art. What appeals to me may not appeal to you. If something I've written intrigues you, take a shot and give a place the benefit of the doubt. You probably won't be disappointed. The food varied in quality. I started with the French onion soup. Nothing remarkable but good. I could get the same soup in the same bowl at a hundred different restaurants. The big, hearty burger was char grilled (a big plus) and is a generous portion. It was cooked exactly as i requested, was crusty, juicy, meaty Â and well dressed. An 8 on a scale of 10. I asked for grilled onions and should have been more descriptive as I got sauteed/sweated onions. Caramelization on the onions would have provided deeper level of flavor and probably a higher rating. The Nassau (chicken) wings were average - not great but certainly not bad. Wasn't a fan of the dominant Worcestershire flavor in the Buffalo style and the BBQ wings were a little too "gloppy". Portions were generous. The sweet potato fries were good - a little on the thin side - and if a thicker cut had been used, would have made the fluffy inside that much better. Lastly, desert was good. We split the pumpkin bread pudding, cranberry apple crisp and the butterscotch pumpkin shooters. All were very good. I travel to Princeton at least once a year and would go to the YDTR if I craved a burger, a cold beer and a warm fire. So long from Texas.
