Chic location, gorgeous and classy interior, and careful attention to detail. Yes it is a little more expensive, but if you appreciate the finer things in life every once in a while, then this is the place for you. Every dunk of your teeth and taste buds into these delicate macaroons will complete your existence for that moment. The density was so lush and flavors so rich. Â My favorite is the vanilla. If it were up to me, I'd make them a tad less sweet, as the sweetness level of macaroons in general is a bit much for me. These macaroons make the perfect gift for any occasion. Who wouldn't want a box of colorful cute macaroons? I haven't had macaroons in Paris YET but I can imagine Laduree Macaroons to be quite similar since it's straight from France!! It's nice to be able to have access to real French quality macaroons in the USA.
