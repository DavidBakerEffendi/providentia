It was the worst experience I ever had in ANY New York restaurant. McDs have a better service and hostess. We had to wait for 2 and 1/2 hours. It seems that the server's and hostess's friends always had first pick on all the tables. They really gave a new meaning to the name" waiting" for the waiting list. I'll never go back there again.
