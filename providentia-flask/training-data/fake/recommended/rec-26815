I'm sorry- I don't see what people see in this place. Let me start by saying, I eat authentic Greek pretty regularly-I came for lunch- where I was served olives and bread. Unfortunately that was the best part of the meal. I ordered a Greek salad, feta cheese pies, pastichio, a gyro and ktapodi (grilled octopus). The salad was bland, not very fresh and room temperature at best. The feta cheese pies had to have been from the local Costco freezer. Pastichio, dry. Ktapodi, completely inedible. The texture was wrong- the taste was ehhhchhh and the presentation alone was enough to make me sick. Andddd the gyro- can a Greek restaurant with 4 stars really screw this up?!?! Yes!! This place could and did. Once again the lettuce and tomato were not fresh. But the meat even- was flavorless, dry and chewy. You'd think that with such a disappointing Â meal the service would make up for it-it didn't. The food was just thrown at us, one plate on top of the other. Asked for hot sauce with our meal, got it after the 3rd time asking. Waited for the check for a good 15 minutes while we watched our waiter (40 feet from us) chat with his friend.
