Airy and lively restaurant with large portions, delicious food, and reasonable prices. The restaurant is always crowded (there was even a short wait for a table on Monday evening at 9 PM), but is definitely worth the wait. We got 4 market sides - the fried plantains were delicious - sweet and not too oily, the garlic mashed potatoes were okay (a bit bland), the zucchini with cheese was excellent, and the Asian marinated tofu was pretty good but was a bit salty (too much soy sauce). The veggie burger was amazing - probably one of the best I have had in the city - Right mix of vegetables in the pattie and the right amount of flavor Food came quickly and the waitress was great.
