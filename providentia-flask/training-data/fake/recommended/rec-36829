This is an absolute must for you when you stop by NYC.  It's within walking distance from the Soho district - perfect for my friend and I since we came here after a long day of shopping.  Although we did not make reservations when we came, I would definitely make one if you don't want to wait long.  We were lucky in that they were able to seat us right away since we came before the dinner rush...although most the dining room by then was full already.   After we ordered, we munched on the variety of yummy warm bread served with soften butter while waiting for our main entree.  I ordered the Balthazar Bar Steak with pommes frites and béarnaise sauce (but it can be served with maître d' butter instead).  My friend got the Moules FrItes - both dishes very absolutely fabulous!   I'm normally not a big fan of red meat, but the steak was done right here!  The medium-rare meat literally melted in my mouth, it was ridiculously tender and juicy.  Hands down, the best steak I have ever had!  Along with the béarnaise sauce (made with clarified butter & egg yolk flavored with tarragon) goes perfectly with the steak.  Now we can't forget about my friend's dish as well...the mussels were simmered in a seasoned broth & tons of herbs reduced with white wine.  The mussels were super fresh and everything was deliciously flavored.  We actually wanted more bread to soak up the broth... :)  Lastly, the frites - were amazing!!!  Perfectly seasoned & fried just right!  I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to try an authentic French bistro restaurant at a reasonable price.   My only compliant is that seating is tight (so we had difficulty with our numerous shopping bags...)and it's loud so definitely don't expect to have an intimate conversation here.  Otherwise, a MUST go when in the area!  :D  Bon appetite!
