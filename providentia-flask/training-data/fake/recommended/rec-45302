Grimaldi's is purportedly some of the best pizza in the city. And when I first ate here, a few years ago when it was in its original location, you could make an argument for that. To be clear, the actual, real pizzaria owned by the Grimaldi family is Julianna's. It is a few buildings up from Grimaldi's new location, in the location of the old Grimaldi's pizzaria. The only thing that this restaurant called Grimaldi's still has is the name--they weren't even able to take the pizza oven, which, as everyone hopefully knows, is a key player in making a good pie. Don't be that tourist who doesn't know better. Go to Julianna's. It is a shorter wait for a much, much better pie, in the actual historic location. If you time going here right, you won't have to wait on a line. The new Grimaldi's is two stories. The decor is kitchy. It sort of feels like they are trying very, very hard to inject a bit of history into the new location. They had some guy with an accordion singing, which could be nice, but it's not the biggest space and was pretty loud.The staff is touch-and-go. I've had good experiences with them, and I've had bad. I will say that the new restaurant does not feel as cramped as the old one, which is a welcome change. The service was quick, and the pizza we got was...fine. There wasn't anything particularly bad about it, but there wasn't anything particularly good. We'd just come in from Smorgasburg on the waterfront and I had a Pizza Moto pizza right before this (I feel pretty strongly about being able to eat pizza multiple times a day)--the Pizza Moto pie was better. Grimaldi's sauce wasn't incredible. The dough was fine. The ingredients were fresh, but nothing we had was anything special. Bottom line, it's really not worth the wait. If you're visiting NYC, it's definitely not representative of Brooklyn. There are better restaurants in the area. As for those who claim that it is the best pizza in the city, I'd like to direct you to Totonno's.
