I'm not sure how I feel about this place.  I grew up in San Francisco and am well-acquainted with Gordo's, the taqueria on which Dos Toros is modeled (according to the owner).  I appreciate that these guys are trying to bring the San Francisco burrito to New York. Now, call me a snob (go ahead, do it), but these burritos just aren't as good as San Francisco burritos.  Authentic burritos are not made (incredibly slowly) by hipsters.  That said, authentic burritos are also made in much dirtier kitchens with much more questionable ingredients. Overall, I like this place.  It's convenient and tasty; it's just not as good as it's hyped up to be.
