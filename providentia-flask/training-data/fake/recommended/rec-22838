Ordered dumplings, which when named dumplings at 9, you think you might get 9 dumplings, but the 4 i got proved this was not the case. They were well presented but overcooked and just fell apart to the touch. The pad thai was extremely salty and lacked the zing and peanut flavor. The noodles were ok, but when they are soaked in a salty brine that tastes nothing like pad thai, its not much of a redeeming factor. The interior is a little gaudy and over the top for my tastes, but the waiting staff was friendly and attentive. All and all, there are MUCH better options in the city.
