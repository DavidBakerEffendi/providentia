What in the world are you people thinking? 4 1/2 stars on Yelp? really.  This is just another in the long line of over-rated Jersey portugese/spanish restaurants.  Nothing seperated my experience here from any other place in the Ironbound. To begin the place has no ambience at all, but i dont really care about that.  The service was seriously lacking and they actually even incorrectly charged me for two things when i got my bill. Here's the breakdown on what i ate. Bread to start stale and dry could barely tear it apart with my hands.  Complimentary olives were mediocre.  The garlic shrimp were very good and the only reason i gave this place 2 stars.  My grilled porkchops were well seasoned but completly overcooked.  I quickly dumped my lazy cold terrible vegetable medley on a separate plate along with those horrible potato chips that everyone of these places serves you.  Also tasted my friends veal chop and that was close to inedible.  Oh wait the rice was actually quite tasty.  Ordered tres leches cake and they were out but another server was thoughtful enough to give me an order that was for takeout.  Unfortunately it had a strange plastic taste.  The sangria was good too forgot about that but a lunch for 2 for $65 no thankyou.
