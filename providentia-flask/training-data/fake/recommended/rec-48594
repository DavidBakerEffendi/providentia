I would give this place 3and a half stars but alas, if I have to choose between 3 and 4 I'm choosing 3. Good service, stiff drinks, great atmosphere. Every time I stroll into this place I end up running into a friend. The bartenders are nice, the cocktail waitress is a character, I love her demeanor! Fun place. I'm giving it a 3 because hands down, WORST food I've ever had in the entire history of me dining out all across the country. Save yourself the agony of eating here unless you're so hammered that you don't care what you consume. French fries. Just stick with french fries!
