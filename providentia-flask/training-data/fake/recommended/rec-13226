Saw this place on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. I love that man! I couldn't help by make my way over to the EV to try this place. I've heard rave reviews about their fried chicken. Boy was it a great balance of crispy and moist! I recommend the chicken pot pie as well to start! The crust was just devine and the perfect amount to soak up all the juicey insides of the pie. Tip: Get there early, as it gets packed pretty fast. If not you can always grab a drink at the bar. :)
