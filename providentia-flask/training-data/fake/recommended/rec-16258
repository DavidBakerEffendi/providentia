Just came home from MP and what a letdown!!!!! I was very enthusiastic about this place when it opened up last summer...but they are getting all greeky Greek on me. I didn't realize that they were catering only to the Greeks. I thought Astoria was more evolved than that. Look at the people sitting at your bar. Don't get me wrong , I'm Greek, but I don't want to listen to shitty Greek music all night long. Mix it up vreeee!!! And the service has gone straight to hell in a hand basket. Michael Psilakis, take better care of your establishment in Astoria... It should be quite the money maker for you, but when you cater to only one nationality, serve wines that people don't rode and then overcharge, have shitty service and have some young piss ant be your front man, then I guess you will do as well as Mezzo Mezzo. Good luck to you, you will not see me there for a long time. Actually, I will never plan on going to your establishment again, and whoever asks me I will tell them to avoid your place!!!!
