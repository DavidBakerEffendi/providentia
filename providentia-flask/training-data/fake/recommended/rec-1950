Ever had a hostess pick people to sit from the BACK of the line, ignoring the fact that you were obviously there first? Ever had to grab a candle from a nearby table, or wait 20 minutes sans water and only receive some by bothering a water-guy? Ever wait 67 MINUTES for your appetizers? (After getting up TWICE and confronting hostess/waiter, the 2nd time forcing him to re-take order and demanding free dessert?; THEN yelling HEY! What's going on?? As he cavalierly slides by the table again. causing people to take notice?) Ever get appetizers (seafood) that was partially inedible (not completely cooked) then wait 25 MORE with no sign of entrees, while nearby tables fought with waiters who twice brought the wrong appetizers, and the other table eventually gets food--before us)? Ever see 5 or more take out orders become available before your meal? Ever get up and say angrily and Â "We're leaving and NOT paying" and the guy just smiles and says "Thank You" and your friend says 'SCREW YOU!' and you leave? Ever feel like if this were 40 years prior that you and your friend would feel like you were racially discriminated upon?? Never a-fucking-gain.
