My friends and I got to this place pretty close to closing time. We were already pretty drunk-so we obviously needed some food after a fun filled day. Annoyances that may have been more annoying if we weren't already drunk and it wasn't right before closing: they don't take credit cards and they took forever to take our order. BUT... They had outdoor seating, its BYOB and my food was good! Once the waiter finally came, he was really cool. The atmosphere felt like someone's backyard so it felt really comfortable! There isn't a lot of space here so I feel like there may be long waits earlier in the day (but I could be wrong). I got a bacon burger with sweet potato fries-just what my drunk self needed! Yum! Overall it was a good experience!
