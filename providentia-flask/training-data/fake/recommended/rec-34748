I have always been to this place around 2-3 AM after a night of partying.  This has always been a late night stop-over place for me.  If you come here around 2 AM, its packed and always a struggle to find a seat.  In addition, you have to keep hearing for your order number to be called out so you can pick your food from the cashier. My favorite is 'Aaloo Roll' - delicious potatoes mixed with onions, green chillies, wrapped in a roll.  They recently started a 'Chana Roll' which is as good.  I dont eat paneer, but I have heard the 'Paneer' roll is amazing. Even though its not the healthiest food, who thinks about that at 3 AM!!!! I prefer this location to the one in the village.  Try out this place....you wont be disappointed (hopefully)!!!!
