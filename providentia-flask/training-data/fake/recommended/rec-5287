Stopped in after wandering while waiting for my hotel room.  Seated quickly at bar.  Even though they were getting s lunch rush the server was patient and did put push me to order before I was ready.  Turtle soup was flavorful and I also enjoyed the lobster roll.  Not a cheap lunch but hit the spot after a long morning of travel.
