For a Sunday night at 8pm, this place was hopping with no empty tables that we noticed.  We were in NYC from Toronto where we are spoiled with an amazing inventory of restaurants.  Cook Shop did not disappoint these two self-appointed foodies. Cocktails were well made and yummy, Wagyu Beef was perfectly done.. good wine pairing from our delightful and super attentive waitress.  Staff worked together like a well oiled machine with people slipping in and out of our table with food, refilling glasses, clearing plates, etc, allowing our server to focus on just that... serving.  In NYC you can get amazing food everywhere but what truly stands out is a well managed service environment and friendly staff who don't look like they would rather be elsewhere.  Cook Shop succeeds here.
