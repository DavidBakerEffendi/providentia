Not a steak fan but i have to admit, it was pretty darn good.  A lot of tourists are in the area so personally, it's a place i wouldn't visit again. Not because of the tourists, but i just mean that too many people know about it for my liking... long wait, crowded, etc.  good selection of dessert, but wasn't too impressed.  try it if you get a chance, but don't go breaking your neck to go here.
