I lived in Italy for 11 years, and I've eaten pizza in Naples on several occasions. Paulie Gee's combines the best of both worlds. I tasted Italian authenticity, and New York innovation. It was truly excellent. 5 of us split the "In Ricotta Da Vita", "Delboy", "Regina", and "Hellified Porkpie White", and all were equally superb. The only drawback was the wait, which we were told would be 1 hour and 30 minutes, we opted to wait at the little bar area, and we ordered beers and an "appetizer" pizza, and were seated in 40 min. Also, Paulie Gee comes over for a chat, and he seems like a genuine chap, very happy to see people enjoying his food. I'll be coming here often, probably very often.
