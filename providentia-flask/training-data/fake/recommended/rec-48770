My new favorite tapas place! Food was delicious. It's a small restaurant right near High Line. We ordered: -gambas al ajillos (garlic shrimp)-- good -chanquetes en adobo (fish)-- okay -croquetas de jamón (ham croquettes)--very good -piquillos rellenos de pisto (stuffed piquillo peppers)--very good!!! -tortilla española (potato layered omelet)--good Service was great. The lady described the wine menu with her nice accent and told us what country it came from. We ended up ordering coffee instead of drinks, and the coffee was very good. Would definitely go again! Highly recommend! Edit: went there a 2nd time, wasn't as good as the first, but best thing was still the croquetas!
