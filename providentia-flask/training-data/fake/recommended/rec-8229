After a recommendation from a friend I decided to go here and I am quite happy that I did. They have relatively cheap hamburgers that are very good. Also the sandwiches are a bit on the pricy side but are excellent. They also give you a sandwich card so it kind of works out price wise. You get 1 sandwich free after you buy 5. Its also a kind of weird overall store with a liquor store in it which I was not expecting when I walked in. Its convenient if you are trying to get some liquor and sandwiches at the same time. Overall its expensive but the food is quality.
