During a recent trip to Hartford we decided to visit the famous Mozzicato bakery everyone's been raving about.  To our dismay they did not live up to their reputation.  I'm sure this used to be an amazing shop but the service we experienced was appalling.  The food wasn't edible though the cookies were mediocre at best. This bakery relies on their outdated reputation for business.  I didn't drive all the way to Hartford to be treated like a smelly hobo for lack of better terms.  I'd have better food and service at a Stop and Shop bakery counter.  The employees at this shop should all be fired!
