Disappointed. I read 20+ review and tried chicken adobe. It was very salty with no taste. Server was unpleasant. First time trying to leave a comment on Yelp. Dont be fool by the comments in here. Halo special was okay but artificial canned fruits were underneath it. $42 for two ppl lunch wasnt worth it.
