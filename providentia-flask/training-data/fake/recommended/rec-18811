Xiao Long Bao was AMAZING!  Some of the best I've ever had!   Careful or it will explode crazy hot broth in your mouth or your clothes. We also had this garlicky broccoli (also AMAZING), sesame chicken, and fried rice.  I walked out with a garlic pork baby in my tummy, but it didn't bother me one bit. One thing that is sort of a downside, you eat at a table with others...the others at our table were a little "off".  Just a forewarning.
