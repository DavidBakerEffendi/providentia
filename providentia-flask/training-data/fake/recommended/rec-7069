Friend if mine recommended this place for me as I was craving Asian fusion. I popped in and was pretty overwhelmed with the amount of options they had which is always a good thing. I went with the Poh Piah as my appetizer which were flatten spring rolls with a spicy sauce. It was very good, I had followed it up with seafood fried rice. Both dishes I recommend especially if you enjoy seafood. The staff was pretty attentive and friendly. The only major drawback to this spot is that it's cash only, which can be very inconvenient. I recommend checking it out if you're around. Just pull out some cash.
