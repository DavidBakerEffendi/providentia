3.5 stars I couldn't pick a better spot than Eulogy for some good beer.  The selection is absolutely unbelievable, though the draught menu could be more extensive.  The server was also pretty knowledgeable and provided some recommendations and his thought on each one. My complaint is that when we said we were there for beer and might only order an appetizer, we were told that if more people showed up we'd have to leave.  This irritated me quite a bit.  The menu is so minimal, it seems more of a way to feed you while you drink than to really be a showcase.  How can you possibly offer a selection of well over 200 Belgian and craft brews, and then shun people when they don't want anything from the minimal food menu?  I just don't understand the difference between four people spending $20+ each on beers and four people spending $20+ each on food. When we first arrived it wasn't crowded at all (a huge improvement over Monk's) with a great laid back vibe, and we eagerly started scouring the beer list.  As soon as we were "encouraged" to order food, we were turned off for the rest of our time there and felt rushed.  We had about two rounds, and probably would've ordered more if we had felt welcome.
