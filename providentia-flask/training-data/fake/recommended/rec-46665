I was super jazzed to head to Mercato for Restauant Week.  The food looked great and to eat where the Chef won an episode of Chopped on the Food Network is also a good plus. I would love to comment on the food and tell you that it was lovely, but I am still fuming after waiting over an hour to be seated even though our table of 10 had a reservation!  Also, it's not like we had reservations for 6 or 7PM, it was 8:30, which means we weren't seated till 9:30PM and didn't get food until 10PM... this was a Wednesday night! While the hostess was apologetic over the fact that we weren't seated in a timely manner, all of the remaining staff didn't seem to notice nor care that we were standing on their sidewalk waiting and waiting and waiting.  Service is just as important as food in my book, and Mercato FAILED.  I know it's Restaurant Week, but that does not give you the right to treat customers like crap, because guess what?   I then come on Yelp and tell yelpers all how I will NEVER return to Mercato... NEVER.
