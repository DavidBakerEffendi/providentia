I came here last night with my husband. We ordered fish tacos and pork tacos, along with an appetizer and margaritas. The fish tacos were amazing! I recommend that dish to anyone. The appetizer was DELICIOUS as well. It was probably the best dish thing we ordered last night. It was something asparagus topped with an egg on flat bread. Â  If you ask the waiter, she'll tell you. Speaking of the waiter, her name was Sam. She was very nice, but was not at all attentive. She never stopped by to ask how we were doing. I had to flag her down a few times but she still didn't come. I even had to tell another waiter about another order that I wanted, and later on I had to tell the manager that I wanted the check & my food packed to go. It was a busy night, that could've been her excuse, however she was attentive to other tables (who came in after us) That's the only reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars. Anyway, my husband didn't like his pork tacos, and he didn't like his margarita drink, which was something that had death whiskey in it. LOL. I enjoyed my meal. This place was a nice place to hang out with friends. The music could be really loud but once you start drinking, you won't even notice it. The decor is cool also. Anyways I recommend the fish tacos and Feliz margarita and the asparagus appetizer with an egg. Don't get the pork tacos!!
