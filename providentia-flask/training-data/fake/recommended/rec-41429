This restaurant can really get crowded. Try and avoid the tables around the bar and next to the entrance as you will have people hanging behind you as you eat. I have a feeling that this place over books. The food was ok. I had heard praises about the octopus... It was good but not great . The chickpeas below had a little too much lime. The home made sausages were good. The dumplings were great, I wish there was more sausage in it an dome pita to dip in the sauce. Somehow the dish felt a little incomplete. The lamb shank was good too. Had heard so much about this restaurant that was expecting to be wowed which I wasn't .
