I had a wonderful experience here back in October, and I know I'm only just now making the review. I was with a large group, so I was pushed to the back and sat in the way of where the workers came and went. I had the Gustaio, which was messy and delicious. A little ways into it a person, who I believed to be the owner, came in and went to around me. He asked me if there were any tomatoes on my food. I could've sworn it did not include tomatoes on the menu; it was made correctly. I think he was jokingly reprimanding the cook about my lack of tomatoes. Anyway, he comes from the back with a huge jar of sun-dried tomatoes and tongs. He puts them in front of me and says I can help myself. I was stunned and excited! I think he gave me that attention because the rest of my party was deep in conversation, and I was on the outskirts. He also told me that anyone who spoke Armenian (I think; definitely started with an A) got a free sandwich. The sandwich and side of potatoes were already worth it, and then the alleged boss guy just took it further!
