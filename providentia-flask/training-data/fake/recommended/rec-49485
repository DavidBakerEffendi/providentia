Protip: 53rd & 6th is on the Southwest corner after 8 pm (the cart that's there during the day is not the same, though it's pretty good); this is the location with the long line. The cart on the southeast corner is run by the same people and has a much shorter line (often no line). IT'S THE SAME FOOD. Look for the halalguys.com umbrella.
