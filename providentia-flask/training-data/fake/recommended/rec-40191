My favorite bar in Center City is the original Tria Cafe. So I was really excited to try this place. The Beverage choices are great. I didnt try any food but it smelled good the people that had the mussels really liked them. Although my overall experience wasn't great, You should still check this place out. What I liked: The host staff and wondering waiter's were very pleasant and welcoming. The beer list is great. The beer and wine were good. The place is clean and easy to get around. Everything but the bar itself is cool and has a good vibe. The food esp. mussels and flatbread looked good. The Music that was playing was great. What I Dis-liked. The bartenders were very cold. Not approachable and no small talk. They took our order and gave our drink and no other talking was had. They gave us a food menu but never asked if we wanted anything. The bar itself is also cold. It looks cool at first  with a marble back drop but after sitting for awhile you realize it is as cold as the bartenders (On the night we went). The bartenders didn't do anything wrong per say, however.  The iPad beer and wine list is nothing impressive. I learned nothing more from the iPad than I could have if it were written on a regular menu. Its a cool idea but just doesnt get through. And for you Tria regulars  They don't accept the "Tria Card". Overall, I think that this place is good if you are sitting at a table but not at the bar. They have a great idea here they just need to make it seem more welcoming and friendlier and accept the Tria Card. My experience may have been different if we had more engaging barkeeps. However, after talking with staff from Tria they were very apologetic and understanding about my experience and I thank them for reaching out which warranted another star.
