We came here on a Tuesday night around 7pm, the wait was pretty long which I sort of expected since it's still relatively new and popular place. For our party took about 40-45 minutes total wait. So definitely be prepared to wait if you're coming with a bigger party. This is place is still pretty packed after opened for 4-5 months now So being a first timer of course I opted for the Truffle Burger and as well as bunch of appetizers to share. My favorite was definitely the sweet potato fries. They were good but I didn't think much different from other sweet potato fries I've had. The burger however was definitely a very unique taste. I ordered it medium after the waiter described their medium-rare is pretty rare but really I should have gone for medium-rare... My medium was definitely pretty brown inside and out which I think added to the saltiness from the cheese and truffle oil. So, it wasn't a very good burger but I definitely like the taste despite the burger being little bit over cooked. The size was something to be desired more to be honest for the $12 price tag. One plus note is their sauces though. I really liked their spicy dipping sauce that I used it with fries as well as the burger. I see on the pictures here that there's an even spicier version than the Diablo hot sauce, I definitely will want to try that next time. I'll definitely come back once the hype dies down but I think its worth a try just try to avoid the crowd as best as you can otherwise I think longer than 15-30 min wait is bit long for the experience I got.
