The baby back ribs w/ slaw appetizer was filling enough to have as the main meal - the ribs were tender and flavorful. Â The sweet potato and goat cheese croquettes were ok. The squash tart w/ buttermilk ricotta was the perfect blend of flavors and textures. The buttermilk fried chicken (still can't touch my daddy's fried chicken! But good try.) And the finale... The pecan Pie Sundae might kill you #1 because it is DELICIOUS! #2 from heart disease (I'm a nutritionist -- I can't help it) But, it is worth dying for (don't tell my boss I said that).
