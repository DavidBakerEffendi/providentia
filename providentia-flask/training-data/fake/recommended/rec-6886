Unimpressed by the whole experience. Chairs outside aren't that comfortable (the bar digs into your back). The arugula small plate was fine, not exceptional but passable. The spaetzle was fried and so oily as to be gross. The salmon was good but not great as an entree. Least satisfying was the red sangria, which tasted like it was made with low-quality wine. We won't be back
