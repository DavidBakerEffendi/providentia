The only reason I even gave this place one star was because they delivered it within 15 min after ordering. The service was deplorable and turned me off this place from the get go. I had to call four times before someone actually answered back. The other three times the girl on the phone puts me on hold, but I can hear their entire conversations. When she did answer she knew nothing about the ingredients in their products. The food was ehhh alright. Maybe they do breakfast better, but I wont be finding out.
