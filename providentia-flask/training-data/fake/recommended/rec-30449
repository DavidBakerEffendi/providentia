Wonderful intimate ambiance and decor. Melt in your mouth deliciousness. And the avocado ice cream... I dream of the avocado ice cream. I am not giving Market Table 5 stars because during one of my experiences there, one of the waiters served me a ruby port and tried to convince me that it was a tawny. After standing my ground, he finally brought me a different glass of port - the tawny one that I had originally asked for.
