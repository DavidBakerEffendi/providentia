I wanted a yummy pastry and stumbled upon this place on a Sunday walk with my boyfriend. We decided to give it a try. I give the place 3 stars because the flourless chocolate cake was actually tasty. My boyfriend and I shared it. Very rich. Most cakes like this do not have a hard exterior and is just like a rich fudge cake. The outside was a little harder than usual and it crumbled into pieces when u tried to break it so that sucked. I didn't really like how the lady helped us when we walked in so that was a little bit of a turn off. We took the cake to go because we wanted to walk a little more and find a nice quiet place to sit and talk while we ate the cake. We realized when we opened the bag she didn't really give us any fork or spoon or napkins or anything really. How am I suppose to eat this cake? With my hand? I also noticed that all the places near by were packed while this place did not have a soul (usually says something about the place) either way the pastry tasted good. I don't think it was worth it for the price but it's good to try the place before you judge.
