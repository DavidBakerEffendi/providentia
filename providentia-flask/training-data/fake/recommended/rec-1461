A fabulous place. The two worst parts of this place are a) the price and b) I can't pronounce the name.  Think its pronounced (Wa-haca) but not sure... I have been here before us and the worst part frankly is that it is not inexpensive,. However since this is not typical "Mexican" food it's unfair to compare it to other Mexican restaurants.  This is clearly gourmet fare so it's not unfair that they charge more for it. Don't expect to go and eat typical mexican food (burritos, tacos, etc...) this is gourmet, deluxe dining. I took four other businessman here for "New Haven restaurant week" and by far found to be the best value of the four restaurants I tried (and 7 others over other restaurant weeks)... Even the waiter acknowledged that the place was jammed because the prices were inexpensive that week. I had the tamale for an appetizer, I had the skirt steak for the entree, and a flan for dessert; all were amazing. Other entrées were the hominy and pork stew and the chil relleno. However, the outstanding item of the entire meal was the dessert which was the flan. Although I tried not to eat it (on a diet) could not resist ended up completing the whole thing. Don't miss it This was a tremendous success. If you can get it at a discount or deal (like restaurant week) don't pass this by. Even at regular pricing and expense its still worth a visit.
