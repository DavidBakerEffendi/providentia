Wow.  I can't even believe I'm only giving this place 4 stars. We went here for my birthday dinner last night.  Since it's the top rated restaurant in Philly, I guess I had high expectations.  And I just ate at Le Bec Fin a few weeks ago, so I have that fresh in my memory. The space is beautiful - The flower arrangements were to die for.  It is very elegant, even if you still know you're in a hotel restaurant.  Why can't hotel restaurants break free of that?   The service was excellent.  Not once did we want for anything.  We did the 6 course chef's tasting with wine pairing, and the courses were brought out at a good (not rushed) pace, which actually allowed us to finish our wines for each.  (I hate when I do a wine pairing and I have 3 partially drunk glasses of wine in front of me.)  The wines with the pairing were very good - 2 California and 3 French.  The Sommelier was very informative, obviously very excited about the wines, knew it all about the grape, region, etc.  Hubby and I know a fair deal about wine and at first we thought he was talking down to us, but then realized that he was just giving us the whole scoop. The food.  Maybe I'm just too hard to impress.  Or maybe this particular menu wasn't my taste.  But reading the descriptions on the menu, it certainly sounded like it was right up my alley.  Not once when I took a bite was I "OMG this is AMAZING."  That's kind of the reaction I'm looking for at a restaurant of this caliber.  Actually I take that back - once I got that reaction.  But only because the course included a hunk of fois gras, which I ate in one bite and since it was fois gras, was of course amazing.  The food was very good, but in my opinion not the best in Philly by any stretch. Hubby loved it.  But his palate doesn't crave the savory as much as mine.  I have to say, I like Le Bec much better.  There, every course elicited the response I was looking for. So I deducted 1 star because I wasn't wowed.
