loveee mercato! been twice and cant wait to go back. the grilled artichoke and the crab appetizer are excellent apps to start with. the pasta is incredible as is the short rib ragu. 4 stars cause of the space.. it gets REALLY crowded and the waiters move around so fast they were bumping into my chair a bunch! and while i LOVE that the chef and cooks are right in house and its fun to watch.. the heat gets very intense so wear layers! def a top five BYOB for me in philly.. the chef won chopped on food network too!! save room for desert here its worth it.. -jecarosenose
