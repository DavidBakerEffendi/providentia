Left a little earlier from the last Yelp Elite event - great music, but the crowd made getting food a little difficult.  And there was brick oven pizza across the street! I love brick oven pizza! So we stopped by for a slice. Really, 3 pizzas and some garlic knots. And wine, though I didn't have any. And it was all totally acceptable. I dunno. Not too much to rave or complain about. I was super excited about the garlic knots, since a place by my work (Sopranos - check my reviews) makes the most amazing garlic knots in the world. But the ones at Mix were... ok.  Little overcooked. Little under garlicked. My friends apparently don't have the same taste in pizzas, because I couldn't be brought in on the meat-lovers (I don't eat pig, but not for normal reasons) or the veggie (too much with the peppers and onions).  I was game for the margharita, which was decent, but a little light on the mozzarella. Waitress was chill, prices were fine... I dunno. Ok sums this place up for me.  I wouldn't avoid it, but I'm not raving about the newest brick oven pizza place I found.
