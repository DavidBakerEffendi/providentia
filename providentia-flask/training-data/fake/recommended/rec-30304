Oh, Pepe. You elicit such mixed feelings. Really great food. Amazing pasta. Terrific prices. About half the tables are great (the other half are like communal tables). And wildly inconsistent service. I've had great wait staff and prompt service here, and all was well. I've also seen a full dining room with one frazzled person saddled with all of the tables, causing us to wait 45 minutes for entrees that arrived cold. I like the sass (no diet soda, etc) but not when it morphs into incompetence and disrespect. Ultimately, this is a good spot for takeout so you aren't hostage to the uneven dining room service.
