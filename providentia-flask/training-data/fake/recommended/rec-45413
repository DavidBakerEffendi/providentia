Great food, wonderful kind staff.  We were seated next to a fabulous group on women in their early 60s and the staff made them (and us) feel like royalty.  I generally avoid midtown at all costs, but the 25 wine selection (hooray orveito classico), the food and the genuinely friendly atmosphere was worth dealing with tourist central.
