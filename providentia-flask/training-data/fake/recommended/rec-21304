Ahhhhhhh hellz yeah. I hate to jump on the bandwagon here, but this place is so legit.  FYI, it is no longer BYOB, so skip the overpriced Williamsburg wine shops and head directly to Pates et Traditions. 5 stars for the FOOD!  We couldn't get enough of it.  The bleu cheese, bacon, and balsamic salad was spot-on.  So flavorful, so well-executed.  We also ordered the Provencale plate, which is basically an appetizer sampler.  We liked the socca the best from that selection.  The galette we ordered was absolutely perfect.  Quite possibly the best salty crepe I've ever had.  It wasn't just the quality of the ingredients, but the thoughtful way in which it was all put together.  For dessert we had the chocolate coco(nut) crepe.  Again, I can't imagine how they could really improve on what we had... I found it particularly heart-warming that a French family of four came to dine there last night and received such a warm welcome from the restaurant's staff.  I appreciated their implicit approval. The decor is cute and clever.  It reminded me a little of Penelope in Murray Hill. This is definitely a place to which I want to return, perhaps with out-of-towners or European friends who would understand its authenticity. You have to applaud the owner, chef, and staff at Pates et Traditions.  The proof is in the pudding.  Make delicious food and they will come.  I hope this place thrives!
