Cozy place with good food and great service.  Our experience started on a great note, with a warm welcome from the host and a bartender who helped us with some food recommendations.  The place is small, but it didn't feel cramped.  Babaganoush, hummus and baked meatballs were all delicious.   Worth a visit!
