so let's start with this....if you didn't know the halal chicken and rice cart was good, you clearly have never been in the area on any evening or weekend.  the line is sometimes half hour long....even in the winter! now, I used to frequent the cart much more often after barhopping on the weekends.   It hasn't changed a bit over the years.  I always get the lamb and rice, which are seasoned to perfection and flavorful and moist.  Add the white sauce and just a drop of hot sauce, and your mouth will do flips.  it's soooooo good. If you're a healthy eater, as I have become, this is a nice treat once in a while.  however, your stomach might not feel so great the next day. despite that, it's totally worth it. INSIDER'S TIP- the cart guys have become so successful that they have opened an annex diagonally across the street.  It's the same food, same owners, but NO line.  It's funny because people still wait on that humongous line across the street.   A lamb and rice plate will set you back $6.  Enjoy!
