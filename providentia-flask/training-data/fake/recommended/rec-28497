If you get disappointed by the lack of pile high lunch meat and shredded iceberg lettuce then steer clear of Il Bambino!  I came here for lunch the other day and suddenly reminisced of my travels in Europe.  The paninis are made with fresh and crusty bread and the fillings are only thin slices of high quality meats and just the right amount of cheese.  I didn't have to unhinge my jaw to enjoy my sandwich. My boyfriend and I ordered the spicy chicken and the apricot speck to share.  While we both enjoyed the chicken, we wished we would have ventured out and tried some more unique flavor combinations as the apricot speck was absolutely excellent.   Not sure if I would come back for dinner, but it's now definitely number one in my weekend lunch rotation!
