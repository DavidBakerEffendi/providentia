This place is awesome. The pizza is some of the very best in Burlington, hands down. The beer list is fantastic, and the service is super friendly and inviting. Not to mention, there are always rotating specials and it's just a fun place to be. My husband and I just moved up from Boston and frequent often. I would highly recommend this place!
