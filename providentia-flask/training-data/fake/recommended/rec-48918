I made dinner reservations here for me and my boyfriend, hoping to have a memorable night. We both ended up being disappointed. The food was fine. We had the falafel appetizer: three teeny, tiny pieces of falafel on a plate for $10. Overpriced, but tasted good. I got the vegetable napoleon, which was delicious. Their marinara sauce is very good. My boyfriend got the Greek salad, which he liked. It was, however, very small. Now, the reason for the low review is the service. If there were any dinner or drink specials, I had no idea because the waitress never made any effort to talk to us. The falafels came out unusually quickly, but we were hungry, so no reason to complain about that. And then our meals came out after we had barely finished the meager appetizer. I think I've waited longer at IHOP for a short stack. At this point we were starting to feel like we were being rushed. We had no time to sit and enjoy the view or each other's company. My boyfriend finished his salad rather quickly, but I was eating slowly and trying to enjoy the experience of being with him and eating outside on the patio. At one point, the waitress came by and asked if I was done with my meal. I said no, and continued eating. Not even five minutes later, a different employee came by and asked if I was done with my meal. I said not yet, but she misheard me and cleared my plate and the entire table anyway. It was so awkward and so rude at the same time, I was speechless. I don't think I've ever felt so unwelcome and so rushed in a restaurant in my life. Maybe it was because they could tell by the way we were dressed that we're not rich. Maybe it was because we're gay. I don't know what it was, but I didn't feel good eating here and certainly won't be returning.
