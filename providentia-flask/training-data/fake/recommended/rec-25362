Made last minute dinner plans with friends.  Earliest reservation we could get was 8:45pm.  We enjoyed some time at the bar for cocktails and at 8:45 on the dot, our table was ready.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our appetizers, meals and dessert.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  We would definitely go back again.  Nice addition to the Marketfair area.
