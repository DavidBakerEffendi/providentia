I come here if I'm in the area. You don't have to wait for food and it's relatively cheap. Glass noodles are my favorite. I also love the kimchi rice. My only complaint is about seating. You have to keep your eye out for empty ones. If there's no room and the weather is good, I recommend eating in the park by 6th ave. Note: beware of the animals, they are not afraid of you!
