This is the third time I've been there and been able to get the food I desired.  Tonight's excuse was merely that the grill was turned off even though it was 90 minutes before closing.  Based on the lack of service orientation of this crew (they rotate new immigrants through every 6 months it so), avoid this place like the plague.
