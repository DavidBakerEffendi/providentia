I've been here a few times with a meetup group I belong to, and despite the fancy decor and extensive beer and liquor flowing, they could stand to make some improvements. Their staff on the bar upstairs can be quite rude. The individual in question practically shouted his name at me when I asked once, "Wa-keen!!" Their appetizers are overpriced, and when you want a little something, you end up paying New York prices when there's no need. Also, drinking outside is a nightmare. They send their goons outside and tell you not to sit and drink on the wall. Ridiculous.
