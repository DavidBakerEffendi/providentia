This place received a lot of attention with its tragic connection.  When it first opened it was novel with fresh food, unusual  ingredient combination.  But, I have always been disappointed by the meals I've ordered.  The chichen wrap I ordered for lunch was inedible due to over salting.  Another Wrap just fell apart in my hands the dressing was all oil.   Rather than all the impatient counter help, they should hire more qualified kitchen help.
