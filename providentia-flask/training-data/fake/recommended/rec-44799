Our dinner at Little Owl  was incedible!!!  Fabulous food, great service and hospitality.  The co owner/host treated us like we were highly important folks who frequented the restaurant often.  It was our first time.  The pork chop was the best we have ever had.  Lamb raviolis,  halibut, and dessert strudel were equally wonderful.  A neighborhood  place with a homely feel and far from the hustle/bustle of Manhatten.  Our waitress delivered super advice and  superb service!  Can't wait to go back.  Hard to get reserviations but eating early helped.
