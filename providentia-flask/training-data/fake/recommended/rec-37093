I usually don't like to write reviews for places that are over-reviewed as well as places that I go to frequently.  However, this place leaves me no choice. I have been here many times over the years.  The first time I came here, I was amazed at the decor and the atmosphere.  Modern, simple, cool.  Then came the food and that was magnificent.  Sprinkled in was the efficiency and friendliness of the staff.  Last came the bill and the brunch is well worth the price. Years later I keep coming back and I'm happy with every experience.
