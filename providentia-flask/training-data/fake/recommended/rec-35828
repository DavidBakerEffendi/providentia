I've been here a couple of times and have to say that the ambiance in the place is pretty neat. For some reason it reminds me a bit of a night out in LA during Market Week. Not the most over the top or delicious Thai food I've ever tasted, but for a quick, local, informal hang out with girlfriends and a bite on a Mon-Thurs situation this does it. On a random note, they do provide brown rice in your dishes upon request and free of charge ( many places charge for BR some reason). Being that I'm a brown rice girl, that's definitely a nice option to have.
