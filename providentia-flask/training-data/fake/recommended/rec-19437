This place had a great setup for the inside and outside.  I liked that the wall was open so that you could enjoy the nice weather.  It felt like the bars I saw in Asheville, N.C.  Something for hippies.  haha.  Moving on to the food and beer. I enjoyed a raspberry wheat beer from Victory.  And with that I ordered the maple glazed fried chicken.  My friend is the expert on fried chicken and felt that it was not the strongest that he has ever had.  My amateur taste buds enjoyed it.  The fries that came with the meal were fantastic. I felt the service was a little overwhelming though.  They were always quick to clean our table.  I like that when it was not a mess that I created but I'm okay with being in my own filth.  Also, that were always a little to quick with the water.  Again, I like to be waited on but constant interruption of my conversation is a problem.
