Highly recommend the following from the brunch menu: Guacamole, Stuffed Roast Poblano Pepper, Chorizo Eggs Benedict Ate outside on a nice Spring day. The guacamole was fresh and perfectly seasoned (hate unsalted guacamole). I'd do it all over again, outside again because I wasn't digging the atmosphere inside.
