I was visiting over the weekend and stopped in here for dinner after going to the art museum. I really liked the ambiance and the food. My fiance and I sat at the bar- the bartender was very nice (I think his name was James). It got really busy while we were there and he did forget to bring one drink. It was not a big deal to us, but when I asked for the bill, he realized he forgot. He brought us the drink free of charge even though I said it was OK. Onto the food...we loved it! The Fall Leaf Salad and the Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwich really hit the spot.
