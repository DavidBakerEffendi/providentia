I waited so long to write a review for this place.  This is the BESTEST pancake place I have ever been to.   I used to think pancakes were pancakes, but boy am i so wrong.   This place is totally worth waiting for.  It's a tiny little restaurant, but the breakfast stuff is absolutely amazing.   If I'm ever in NY, this spot will definitely be one place I'll be going to.  Also, try their egg benedicts.
