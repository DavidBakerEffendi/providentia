I cannot believe I didn't know about this place sooner. I've lived in the South Street district for three years and only just started eating at Alyan's about six months ago. Don't repeat my mistakes! The staff here is absolutely great. They're always sweet and friendly and the guys whip your food up fast in their little kitchen right alongside the entryway. They're always happy to let me have a seat and wait for my takeout order as long as there is an open spot in the dining area. The hummus, as other reviewers have mentioned, is stellar. Rich and garlicky. I almost always get the lamb shawarma, which is absolutely excellent, as is nearly everything else I've had from Alyan's. The only thing I did not enjoy was their stuffed grape leaves. They didn't seem to have nearly as much flavor as everything else I've had and I haven't chanced ordering them again. Nonetheless, I'm a loyal customer. Alyan's is great Middle Eastern food.
