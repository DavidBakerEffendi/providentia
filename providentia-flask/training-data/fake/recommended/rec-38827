I walked by at Mooks during lunch time yesterday, and I had a creative fried chicken and kimchi burger, and a drink called " let's go green", which were great, the portion of the food was great and the price of the food was very reasonable, also, they were offering chef's special yesterday, however, I didn't try, anyway, I recommended this grand opening restaurant.
