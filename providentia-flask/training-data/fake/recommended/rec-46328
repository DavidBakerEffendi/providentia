I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here.  We wanted to check out the Iron Chef's restaurant on a Sunday evening and were able to get a 6pm reservation. The restaurant has so much ambiance and is pretty romantic considering it is lit by tea lights throughout the restaurant.  It has a rustic feel to it and it is definitely a place you want to go with someone special. The food and service is also impressive.  The amuse bouche was a mini bagel and when you took a bite, the cream cheese melted in your mouth.  It was a nice interpretation.  I had the BBQ oysters which were tasty and we shared the tommy hawk steak which was amazing.  For desert we had the carrot cake which took 10 minutes to cook.  It was spectacular! We will definitely be going back and trying the chicken for 2.
