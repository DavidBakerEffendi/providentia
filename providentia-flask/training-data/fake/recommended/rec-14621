It's done very well but I don't believe it deserves all the hoopla that it's getting. The service is very rushed which cannot be helped given the volume of customers they receive, however they still showed all their customers their appreciation while I was in line by giving us free reusable grocery bags. Pretty nice of them. The place is good, but not worth getting stabbed. If you don't get the reference, do a little bit of digging on the internet.
