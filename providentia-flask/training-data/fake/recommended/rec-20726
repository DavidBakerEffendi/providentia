I have been hearing the hype on this place for a while and finally have the chance to try it! The wait was of course very long. Minimum of 45 minutes to an hour. They send you a text to inform you that your table is ready (pssss: if you ask them after a little wait they might let you in a bit earlier). Our server was very friendly. She explained the special clearly. Our drinks came as soon as we ordered it. We ordered the truffle fries and fried pickle. A roasted garlic aoili, chilly chipotle sauce, and ketchup would accompany the fried pickles. The garlic aoili is the best our of the 3. The truffle fries with truffle cheese were good. They came out like literally 2 minutes after we ordered it. Which was pretty surprising considering it was fairly busy. Which makes me wonder do they cook the orders a la minute or in advance and heat it up... My friends had the truffle burger and I decided to try the special which was a duck burger with caramelized onions. The duck burger was good, but wasn't anything too special. The caramelized onions were a bit too sweet and overpowered the burger itself. The truffle burger was really good though. The umami flavors from truffle cheese just blows up when you bite it. It was delicious. All in all, this was a good meal. It was worth the wait. I would come back!
