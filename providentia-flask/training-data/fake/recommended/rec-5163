2 Morgans went to Morgan's in Brooklyn last night for Texas style BBQ.  We has brisket and you choose fatty or lean...guess which Jr. picked?  I got pulled pork, then we added sides of green bean casserole, mac-n-cheese, coleslaw, jalapeño corn bread with pepper jelly, Frito pie (beef chili, sour cream on Fritos inside the Fritos bag, tequila for me and really perfect hand made sweetened ice tea for Jr....then for round 2 some ribs and then a key lime pie for dessert...voila. We talked to the owner, a young guy from Beaumont Texas with the last name Morgan, and he was pretty happy the place was packed after being open 3 weeks.  I'm super critical so I would give it an 8...could have been a 9 but my pulled pork was too fatty and the portion in the amazing Frito pie (pictured) was a bit light.  They are planning more Louisiana style stuff to like gumbo, crawfish étouffée and brunch soon.  It was marvelous!!!  I'll be back.
