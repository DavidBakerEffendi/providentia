I went to this place because I had a taste for Thai food. I went in, it was completely empty which should have been an indication that the food was horrible. I ordered chicken pad thai thinking that NO ONE can mess up something as simple as pad thai..well, I WAS WRONG!!! The noddles were still white, there was no seasoning on it. It tasted so disgusting.I would have asked for a refund but I had ordered it as take out and didnt want to go all the way back to the restaurant. Also, I asked for the Thai chili sauce, they gave me regular hot sauce out of a bottle. NEVER AGAIN!!! And to top things off, all I bought was chicken pad thai and thai tea, it cost me nearly $20. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!! ITS HORRIBLE!!
