This cart is the epitome of chicken and rice. I order food from a couple of carts here and there, BUT THIS IS THE BEST. - DO NOT OVER DO THE HOT SAUCE. YOU MAY DIE. - This cart lets you put on the sauces yourself. ( I went there at one in the morning, maybe they do it differently in the day) - Expect a line. As I said, I was there at one in the morning, and there was a line (mine you it is December). - The bbq sauce is a tad hot too. - Besides all the warnings above, the food is so good it makes you happy an hour after eating it. I got the combination of chicken and lamb. - Even if theres 20 people ahead of you the wait still wont be very long. I think it was like 7 or 8 dollars. Somewhat pricey for a halal cart BUT IT WAS SO DAMN GOOD IT REALLY DOES NOT MATTER.
