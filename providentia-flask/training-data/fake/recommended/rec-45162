Do not order nachos. They put the salsa on the chips before putting in the broiler. Hmmmm let's see, what does common sense tell you will happen when you put a liquid on top of something crunchy/crispy....yup, as most average IQ individuals would deduce, it makes for a pile of soggy chips, GROSS. PLUS it's literally only salsa, cheese & sour cream, unless you request guacamole and/or a meat. We did order chicken but you don't always get what you ask for. Waitresses solution = remove the cost of the chicken addition from the check. WRONG. She should have removed the cost of the nachos from the check. I also requested some shredded lettuce & onion (you know what usually comes on top of nachos) & I received large chunks of lettuce and a whole slice of onion in rings! WTF. I also had to ask if they even had jalape√±os. Not mentioned anywhere on the menu but by the waitresses response to my question it was like "well duh". Ugh. Totally average, benign menu & establishment. Not worth the calories.
