Steak bacon cheddar meatballs with mushroom gravy over a generous portion of chef's choice of market greens (arugula, broccoli, sauteed spinach, white beans, apples, garlic kale) for $8 - yummilicious. Risotto with prosciutto and chives - savory. Peanut butter cookie chocolate ice cream sandwich $4 - divine. Food was great and a bang for your buck. I know it's called the "meatball" shop, but I was impressed by the fresh local greens. The chicken and beef meatballs are tasty. I liked the spicy pork, but didn't love it. It wasn't as flavorful as the others. Downside is the small space, long waits and voices carry so It can get super loud. In warm weather, you can just get take out and sit in the park.
