Definitely one of my favorite places in NYC. You WILL have a wait, however they will offer to text you and you can take advantage of a walk around the area and The Smith is a good place to grab a drink. There is no alternative to a great bowl of ramen. Once you experience it everything else is sub-par. Must : Pork Buns, Crusted Shrimp(Dinner only), and shishito peppers! I get the Modern Ramen with a poached egg every time. This place delivers some of the best ingredients and consistent service I have ever come across, anywhere!
