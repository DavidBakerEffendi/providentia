Southern comfort food in NYC!!!! I'm a Southerner and think this place is fantastic! As good as you're going to get in this city! I was beyond excited when my boyfriend and I came upon this place soon after it opened! It is now one of my favorite places on the UWS and I have been many times. Must Get: Grits Fried Pickles Biscuits The atmosphere is rustic (like it should be a lumberjack's home) and very inviting as well as the staff. I literally stumbled in one night a bit tipsy wanting...you guessed it comfort food. Jacob himself found a spot for me at the bar and made sure I was taken care of. Love this place and will continue to be back as often as possible!
