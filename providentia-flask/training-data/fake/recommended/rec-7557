AMAZING GYROS - order 1 of those pronto because you won't be disappointed! The couple who own this place are so nice and sweet and look like they just walked off of the movie set of "My Big Fat GREEK Wedding" - LOVE them & this little GEM in my town of Rutherford. The only thing that I would change about their menu is the price of the Falafel Sandwich - because in the city you can get falafel for like $2.50, it's a little over priced I think here, but it IS still very delicious and VERY affordable, regardless!
