I stopped here for lunch while with a few friends for a girls' weekend. I loved the decor and how open and bright the space was. It was very welcoming and striking. The menu choices were also great. Two friends and I got the melted Brie, fig jam, and almond sandwiches; they were incredible. I also had a soy pumpkin latte. That, I will say, wasn't as impressive. The pumpkin flavor was extremely mild and the coffee wasn't quite hot. Most of the people working there were great. I interacted with a total of 6 people and 5 of them were nice and friendly. The one complaint I really have was the girl who brought us our food. She was incredibly rude and had a poor attitude. She didn't know what the sandwiches were that she brought out and it seemed like a bother for her to do her job. Other than that issue, this place was great and I would definitely go back.
