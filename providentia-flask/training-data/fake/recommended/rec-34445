We were pleasantly surprised to enjoy a good meal at Gaetano's after knowing the previous names this place has observed and some of the reputation it has. Not much remodeling from previous iterations but the restaurant was clean and well organized with a musician playing jazz on keyboards. We started with Oysters Rockefeller (wonderfully balanced with the right amount of bacon & spinach) and a thick slab of bacon that was more like a pork belly with nice saltiness, a good amount of fat and and a crunchy rind.  The warm, fresh bread with soft butter was a tasty accompaniment. Wine selections appeared to be adequate - I didn't scan the list but my fiancee' ordered a pinot gris that was fresh and crisp - Santa Margherita perhaps ?  Whatever, it was good. A 12 oz filet (medium) with Bearnaise sauce and a Tuscon steak (bone-in ribeye - medium grilled and egg over-medium on top) followed.  Both steaks were very good and came with a small side of vegetables and a side salad.  We ordered the cream-spinach which was a bit too salty but was not the usual baby-food grind - it was whole leaf.  A little less salt here will fix the issue next time. We skipped desert as the Cappuccino machine was acting up but the desert choices looked good with the usual favorites (cheese cake, creme brulee, etc.).  Overall, a very nice meal. We'll be sure to come back for another dinner soon.
