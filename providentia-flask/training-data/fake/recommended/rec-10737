5 stars for the service and 3 for the food. The most memorable part was the service. Our waiter was attentive without being overbearing and very friendly. My group tried the Moussaka, Scallops and the Combination Platter. There were only 4 scallops on the plate. The funny thing is that the waiter told me that the scallops were REALLY big that night. Sigh. The Moussaka was good but a bit too heavy/creamy. I overheard my waiter telling the table next to me that the Moussaka was the best in NY. Hahaha. The best part was the Combination Platter. It was filling, delicious and flavorful.
