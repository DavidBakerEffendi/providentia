I came here once with two friends, one of them being sober. Ironic to bring her here, but I wanted to include her and she didn't seem to have a problem with it. She specifically asked our server for a virgin drink and received an alcoholic drink. I'm a server we all make mistakes not a big deal, but when I told him while she was in the bathroom he said she didn't say virgin (when she clearly did) and didn't even apologize. Then not only did he charge us for it along with the virgin drink, he up charged because he gave her a frozen drink. Like I said I'm a server and have been in the food service industry for ten years everyone has their off days, but how rude and unapologetic the server was about it led to me tipping below 20 percent for the first time in my life. I took the seven dollars he charged us for the alcoholic frozen margarita out of his tip, which would of been a 30 percent tip if he had at least done a decent job.
