This is going to be one of those "I really wanted to like this place" reviews because......well......I reeeeaaaally wanted to like this place. Anywhere with good beer choices is usually a go for me, but the service is often poor for me. Both times I've gone have been in the late afternoon and I've walked in and it takes forever to be seated. Finally get a seat and then the waiter takes forever to come as well. Food is OK nothing special in my mind. One thing I have to say is that the beer selection is vast and I do love it for that. Otherwise, I don't know if I'll use the 3rd time's the charm trick on this place.
