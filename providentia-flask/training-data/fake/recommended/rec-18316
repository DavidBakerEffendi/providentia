Mercato seemed another of the immensely pretentious gayborhood restaurants like barbuzzo, for instance. Food is clearly overpriced. The veal cutlets that I had weren't particularly good and I ended up spending $30!!! Plus, it's cash only, which I find annoying. Moreover, they charge an extra $5 if you share an entree. They don't realize that a lot of people would just not get the entree and leave as disappointed as I was.
