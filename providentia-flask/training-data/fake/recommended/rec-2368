I went to Pat's a couple times when I was in Philly last week, I also went to Jim's, Tony Luke's, Geno's and also got a cheesesteak from a street vendor and I would have to say that Pat's was my favorite cheesesteak during my vacation in Philly but I've had better cheesesteaks in the bay area surprisingly I came here twice for cheesesteaks while I was visiting the city and I had the mushroom cheesesteak wit whiz and onions the first time and the 2nd time, the same thing but wit white american instead, the cheese whiz is soooo good they use, their meat has a lot of good flavor. I love their cheese fries too and their cherry soda they have is good, it's like a soda version of a cherry slurpee but it's not as sweet as a cherry slurpee. The rolls they use are great too. One thing I didn't like about Pat's is that the workers that helped me had no personality but I like how they are fast at giving you your food. Pat's rocks!!
