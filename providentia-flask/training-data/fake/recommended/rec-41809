Sometimes this place is really good. Great even. And other times it seems like they are just phoning it in from some foggy part of the universe. The food is usually well prepared with good ingredients. It's the front of the house that needs a bit of polish. There is a bizarre food runner (who might be the owner) who just tosses your plates on the table in the most inelegant way. Every time I have been there, he just plonks the plates down like they are blocks of concrete and then spirits away. It's hilarious. Also, table service is spotty. It can range anywhere from great and attentive to blase and downright incompetent. I'd recommend sitting at the bar.
