We had a group of 50 people and we couldn't have been happier with the food or the service. The food was more than we could eat but it was delicious. The service was great - informative (especially the wine and beer pairing recommendations) and friendly. Ben was a great server and helped make the meal memorable. overall, fantastic food and and fantastic atmosphere.
