Good-bye, Robata-ya! You were wonderful once but no more. You raised the decibel level through a renovation which removed panels which could have insulated diners from noise. You decreased the level of flavor from some of the best dishes. What was good: the sake recommendation was excellent. The chawanmushi was sublime as always. The edamame were very good. What was so-so: the eggplant was ok. What was forgettable: the kamameshi with salmon & salmon roe used to be so full of flavor and has now become rice with some salmon & salmon roe. Gone are the flavors. The teriyaki chicken whether breast or thigh were uninteresting and lacked any flavor. The eryngi needed to be on the flame a little longer. The tsukune was overwhelmed by the shiso. The so-called seared beef was raw beef slightly browned at the edges. Very good cut of meat but with no flavor. Our group of 4, all of whom have many years experience in Japan were mightily disappointed. This is an expensive dinner and it was not worth it.
