Is it blasphemy to give Mu ramen 3 stars while everyone else is absolutely raving about this place? To be honest, the ramen didn't wow me in the slightest. Very average, expensive and not worth the hour wait. We ordered the U&I to start which was the uni, ikura and spicy maguro. That was really good, probably the only thing I'd come back for. Mostly because I love uni. The second appetizer we ordered was the foie gras and brioche stuffed wings. Kind of heavy, greasy but nevertheless it was decent. I was most excited when the ramen came. We ordered the heavily raved about spicy miso and the name sake Mu ramen. First off, my spicy miso Â was missing it's corn! I didn't really realize til a little later but didn't say anything because I didn't particularly enjoy the ramen already. The broth was one dimensional and was definitely not that great. I absolutely lovee udon like noodes, but it just didn't work in this. I think I liked the Mu ramen a little more, still not much depth in the broth but it was better in my opinion. The disappointing part was the broth came out lukewarm....not a good sign. Paid around $80 total, left underwhelmed. Maybe I'm missing something here or they had a bad day but the hype isn't real.
