Went there for my birthday last week and it was absolutely amazing! I was sad that even with my reservations there was a wait for outside, so we had to eat inside, but oh well.  Also, I was too full for dessert, so I can't wait to go back just for that!  We picked 3 cheeses which were amazing (the ricotta is heavenly) and then my gf had the duck and I had the calamari and the rabbit appetizers.  The rabbit dish was insanely good.  The pasta was melt in your mouth.  Some of the calamari was overcooked but still delicious.  Some pieces of the duck were rare (not medium like ordered) but minor things.  I also had the strawberry bourbon drink and it was so refreshing.  It's definitely worth the cost and I can't wait for another excuse to go back!!
