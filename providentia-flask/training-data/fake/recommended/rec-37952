A bowl of comfort for under $6!  I'm not usually a big chinese noodle soup fan, but this place is great for fresh noodles and a flavorful beef broth.  Go early or late (for lunch) or expect a big crowd and possibly sharing a table with strangers (which is kinda fun, unless they slurp and splatter all over you).
