Three words comes to mind when you think of Bohemian:Amazing, impressive and secretive. You can only dine here if you know somebody who's been there and bring you with them or you can try e-mail them and if they like you, they'll provide you with necessary info on how to get into their restaurant. I had no connection who's been here before and so I took the harder way and e-mailed them. It came to fruitful when I got a reply. A month before I want to dine, I called in and got the RSVP (Yes!). It was the most rewarding thing ever since I will dine there on a scheduled vacation to NY. I love everything about Bohemian, from the secret entryway( the meat store infront), the intimate relax ambiance and even the bathroom was so cool (ok, I think I am going overboard). There were the four of us (we met up with a friend and his fiancee who lives in NYC) and we opted out on the fix menu and went with a la carte instead. We ordered almost everything from vegetable fondue, uni Croquette, to wagyu steak, foie gras sobam branzino whole fish, beef tartare sashimi, the wagyu beef mini burger.. oh soo good. Especially the uni croquette.. I can eat 5 servings of it for myself. I can't wait to try out the branch in Japan. Holla!
