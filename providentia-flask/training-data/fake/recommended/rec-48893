Octopus pizza: was ok. Pizza didn't really need the octopus. Didn't really add anything. Margarita pizza: not enough cheese for my liking but crust was good. Parma: was excellent Vegetable antipasta special: revolved around beets so have to like beets. It was very good. Service: good. No complaints.
