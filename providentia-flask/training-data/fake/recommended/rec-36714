I'm still dreaming of chicken and rice and lamb swimming in delicious white sauce with a sprinkling of hot sauce.  Over 600 reviews and 4.5 stars?  'Nuff said, this is the epitome of good street food so I won't bother you with the details.   We were starving and while I thought the 15 minute wait would be interminable, I think it enhanced the experience.  Once my friends and I had commandeered our wares, we copped a squat at a nearby bench that unfortunately was surrounded by pigeons (my friend has issues with them).  Those bastard pigeons were eyeing our food ferociously, and for good reason because it was just plain ol delicious.  I can't even go into detail about how and why it was so good.  I got chicken but should have gotten a half and half or gone for the lamb because my friend's lamb and rice was orgasmic!   Good for lunch, great for drunk nights after the club. Quick, efficient service and yea the guy taking my order does get points for handing me my change, looking down my shirt, and saying "Nice, baby."  That's exactly the kind of thing I was waiting for when I went to NYC and he didn't disappoint.
