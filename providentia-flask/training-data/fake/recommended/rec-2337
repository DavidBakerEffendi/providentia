i was treated well right away when the bartender started explaining the different mojitos he served without me asking. each mojito he explained was like he was describing his own kids. had to get one at that point. if the drinks werent enough, the food was even more amazing. had the vaca frita. the meat was extremely tender and left me wanting another plate. overall, the prices might be a little steep because of its hoity-toity ambiance, but well deserved
