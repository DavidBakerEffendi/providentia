Great food and drinks! came here for my best friend's graduation celbration got chicken quessadilla (6 peices came) very tasty! also ordered a mai tai which was just right not too water down or too strong with alcohol. the waiter brought out chips and salsa which was super yummy (or maybe i was starving which is why everything tasted so great haha) Overall great place for mexican food!
