While it is true in this great country that all men are created equal, it is untrue that all men's halal carts are created equal.  I should know for I had one very good halal cart meal from a man down near Chelsea Market, one carrot-filled odd mess of a meal from another man on some random Manhattan street, and several meals from the Thomas Keller of halal carts here at 53rd and 6th.   With yelp reviews approaching almost 3/k for this particular cart there's possibly not a lot more to add but I'll give it a spin.  The lamb and rice plate here is the thing to order.  Topped with white sauce and some saucy red squirts, it's $7 worth of perfection in a foil tin.  Across the street there's some outdoor tables and chairs so you can plop down and fill up or you can try to do as my teenage son did:  simultaneously walk and eat, but it's quite a balancing act not recommended for people over 25.   As a matter of fact, this food probably shouldn't be recommended for anyone over 25.  If you mistakenly decide to order it and walk all the way back to your apartment or hotel before getting down to it you'll quickly find out why.  Even with a quick oven reheat, the whole thing congeals into something about as appalling as a Jack in the Box taco 25 minutes past the time it was handed to you. So, order and eat immediately or don't order at all.  That's the way to do it.  I'm glad this place is all the way across the country; delicious as it is, I'm afraid it's something best consumed on infrequent, special occasions.
