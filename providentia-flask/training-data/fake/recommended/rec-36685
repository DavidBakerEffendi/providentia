Classic french food, everything in there was so french. I would recommend all the seafood and the escargot. The crab and the escargot were amazing. I also order pasta, it was Â a-ok, I should have not order pasta in a french restaurant anyways. I don't recommend going in a large group because as they service in the french style, you have to wait for a long time to have your meal. I would recommend not going to this restaurant with an empty stomach, you would starve to death. And a thing that I don't like would be that because there are so many people in the restaurant, the noise level was very high. So it won't be a quiet dinner.
