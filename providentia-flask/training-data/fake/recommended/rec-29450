YAY: delicious food, free sparking water, cool layout and interior, great to see Fare is part of more development happening in the area BOO: service was much to be desired -- the waitress walk by us numerous times without checking in, forgot to give us bread, forgot we wanted to desert, and we had to go find her for the check because she stopped coming by the table.
