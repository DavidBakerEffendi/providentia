Having known Greg since the opening of VPB as a fellow brewer, I can understand clearly why we have all these negative reviews. The timeline will coincide with his death, no doubt, and probably it's gone consistently downhill from then. Greg was a detail man and never stopped watching over things, except to travel and help others learn the art of brewing. By the way, he's the main person to thank for small breweries in Vermont. He helped write the legislation and push for the laws. My friends and I would stop in all the time for the same lager and the awesome seafood chowder. I've had the same crappy food and service that everyone else has and refuse to go back and waste my money there. There are over 100 better places in town to go to. Sorry, but the place is a has-been. Time to close and let someone else start over fresh. Not sure if you can put a link in here but why not try. This is a blurb about Greg's death and the type of person he was. It's a shame that his dream is dying a slow, ugly death. burlingtonfreepress.com/â€¦
