Absofrikkinlutely delicious.  Spotted Josh Hartnett lounging outside.  Fear not, that in no way influences my first statement. 1.  Food: We ordered the Bronte and the Bondi: good slabs of steak and chicken between two pieces of bread.  Tender meat, and the sweet chili & mayo complement it perfectly.  Happy marriage of sweet and savory, and tender and crunchy.  Salad was great too, with a slightly sweet balsamic vinaigrette.  I wanted to lick my plate clean.  Don't believe I've ever had a better sandwich.   2.  Atmosphere: casual, reclaimed-wood tables and benches kind of a feel 3.  Service: decent.
