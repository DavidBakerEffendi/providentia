Only one another review?  Come on, Trentonians!  This little cafe seems to be a popular enough place during the lunch hour, and it stays open until 7p, which is later than most places in New Jersey's economically depressed state capital.   Thanks to its generous portions served with good spirits, The Hummingbird has become a twice-a-week routine for me.  Sure, the place could use some polish--the dry-erase board menu is often too smudged to read very well, and I wish they didn't keep their bathrooms hidden. But the meals are never bad, and the sides are often fantastic. Their Festival could have been bland, but this doughy confection made a nice accompaniment to the flavorful jerk chicken.  The curry goat could use a bit more intensity in my opinion, but when the meat is this tender I can manage with a problem that is otherwise easy to rectify.  And the Jamaican patties are irresistible.  Be warned: The Hummingbird does tend to run out of its items late in the day, since it's primarily a lunch place (like just about everything in Trenton), but even if you're settling for whatever they have left, your odds of a hit are just too favorable.
