Stopped here for a few Yuenglings after a show at World Cafe Live (see earlier review - I didn't want to give them any more of my money after their stunt at the Gurus show). The place was packed, as it was Game 2 of the playoffs, and the Phillies won. The bartender was getting pounded three deep, and he still managed a "How are ya?" when he took my order. Â Really enjoyed it!
