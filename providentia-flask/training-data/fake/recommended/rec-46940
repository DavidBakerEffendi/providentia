Crepelicious! I've only tried their sweet crepes and it's AWESOME! Their crepes are HUGE and stuffed with heavenly goodness. My favorite is their Nutella Strawberry Banana and it only costs $3.75! BE AWARE as their lines are always packed during the lunch hour. I would suggest ordering over the phone 20 minutes before picking it up.
