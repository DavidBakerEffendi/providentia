This really is a Vermont Bar. The beer? It's only the stuff they make. The food? So-so, it's pub food, greasy and messy, but sometimes you find small treasures on the menu that like little secrets that you discover. The building? Old, leaky, cold/hot, strange smells, never quite right - it has personality unlike half the chain resto's you go to these days. The service? Slow, sometimes rude and inept. You don't go to VPB b/c you want great service, awesome food, sanitized atmosphere, or a Guiness. You don't always want a VPB experience. When you go, you go b/c VPB (and all of the above) is what you want.
