In our final meal for our stay in downtown Brooklyn we went to Joya for lunch. We hadn't tried an Asian restaurant in the area and went with the Yelp recommendations. We got there about noon and we were the first people there. When we walked in, the music was blasting out fairly loud. We had to search for a spot that wasn't that noisy. We had a fairly simple lunch, I had the Pad Thai with Shrimp (a lunch special) and my wife had the Pad See Ew (flat noodles with broccoli and a dark soy-like sauce) with tofu. Service was a bit spotty - there was only one waiter and he kept getting diverted with new customers coming in so we had some delays. It got better later in our meal. My wife really liked the Pad See Ew - she said it was one of the best she's had in a long time. My Pad Thai did not come close to being good. It was overly sweet with a minuscule amount of shrimp. Both lunch meals were large portions. I left over half mine. I did taste my wife's meal and it was much better (and I ended up eating a decent portion of it). On the upside, the lunch cost very little. I was surprised it was a cash only restaurant. I wish they had advertised that in the window. I didn't have that much cash with me so it was good that the meal was cheap.
