This isn't your everyday pizza, this is special pizza like birthday pizza or people in from out of town pizza, because you just can't eat this pizza all the time for $30 a pop and still pay your rent. Limit to special occasions or you'll wind up thinking that you can go around spending that kind of cheddar on mozzarella on a regular Wednesday and the next thing you know it's back to Ohio for you, so just be careful, is all I'm saying... homemade filete de palmi makes for a slippery slope is you're not used to such luxury. It's true what they say, Italians taught the world how to eat...and like all Italians who do it right, it's all about ingredients. They make their own sauce, the mozzarella is the real deal, the basil fresh from the garden, even in winter. And nono Di Fara is still in there making pizzas everyday. Go there. Tomorrow. Even if you have to change your birthday officially to do so!
