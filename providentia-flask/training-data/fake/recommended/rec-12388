Came here with my girls for my 25th birthday. The food was okay. My reservation was 5:45pm since they only had 5:45 or after 9 open. My party came a bit late, they had plenty of seats even by 6:30-7pm. The service was great. They gave each of us a bag of loaf when we were leaving. My friend joked that they knew we wouldn't be full.
