This place opens at 8:00 am. I was there 8:40 morning with my dog to have breakfast.  Since with my dog, I was going to sit outside.  The outside tables were not set up yet.  So I asked if they could set a table but a female worker told me straight out No because the people that set them up were busy. There weren't any customers inside.  She didn't offer an option to wait for the tables to get set up. She just didn't want accommodate me.  Eventhough the food is good, it will be a long very time before I even consider to go again Because of their horrible customer service.
