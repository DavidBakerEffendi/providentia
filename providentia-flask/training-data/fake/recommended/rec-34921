My boyfriend and I used to be regulars at this place. We loved getting the all you can eat sushi for only $21. Our last two experiences where not that great. First of all the service is extremely slow. Second the rolls where hit or miss. Idk if that is because of a different sushi chef or different ingredients. I used to enjoy the spicy tuna and vegetable rolls but the last couple times they where so salty!
