Service 1 Star, Food 4 Stars. The service was so so so so so bad. Everything our server did was rude and condescending, he treated us like trash because we weren't drinking a lot and spending a lot of money. I worked in the restaurant industry for 7 years, and while usually I am very understanding I almost wanted to ask for a different server. My fiance's mother and father split a pizza and he was fighting with them telling them how unacceptable it was to split a pizza. They had to go back-and-forth 3 times with the server, after which he said "There's no yeast in the pizza, you're gonna to leave hungry" then walked away. He then, for the rest of the meal, didn't come back once. He ordered their pizza like an appetizer, to which it came out 10 minutes before our entrees did. So it just sat there and got cold. He never once checked back on us after our food arrived, even though he walked by 5 or 6 times. We ordered dessert, and he dropped off the check with the dessert, as if he was trying to kick us out. I wanted to like Tavola. I live right around the corner, I was hoping to come here often. But this service was so bad that I have no desire to ever return. The food, however, was pretty good. Not amazing or delicious, but clearly it was good authentic Italian food.
