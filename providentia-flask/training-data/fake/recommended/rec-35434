My hubby and I stopped by here for a snack and it was delicious. It is a very small place, with people ordering along the side counter and thorugh the window from outside. It took us about 5 minutes to get our order in, but probably about 15 minutes to actually get all our food. I can't believe how good (and cheap) the food was for the price. We spent approx $3 and got 1 order of pork fried dumplings (5 pieces), 1 small wonton soup, 1 sesame vegetable pancake. The wonton soup had seaweed in it and the soup broth was just right. The dumpling and wonton soup was piping hot but the veggie pancake came to us first and cooled down before we got the rest of our food. The pancake was still good and the veggies inside really taste like the veggies inside a Vietnamese Sandwich. Next time I want to try the sesame pancake with beef and the beef noodle soup. Lots of people ordered their hot and sour soup as well. We read about this place in the Art of Eating, and the author of the article says that he came here one time Â for the sesame pancake with pork and the lady at the counter said "No More." So he asked "No more for the rest of the day or no more right now?" Her response was "No More." So he got another item and by the time he finished eating it, they were making the sesame pork pancake. Since there are so few burners, the pork and pancakes have to take turns on the stove and may temporarily be unavailable. There are a few stools in the back if you want to eat your food there in the cramped quarters. All the food comes in a styrofoam or plastic container (for soups). They have some cold drinks for purchase and you can get frozen dumplings to bring home.
