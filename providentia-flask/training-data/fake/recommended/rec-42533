After hearing lots of great things on this restaurant, I finally got in on a Thursday night. I had the beets appetizer and the duck for my main course. Both were excellent. I loved the beets appetizer in particular, and strongly recommend it. The place is very casual and a bit loud. I was not impressed with the service, not sure if this was a coincidence. However, the food was very good.
