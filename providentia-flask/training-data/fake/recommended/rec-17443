Oh my God the paella.   I enjoyed dinner at Cuban Pete's a few months back while visiting my family in the Northern Jersey area.  Coming from a cuban family, they can be kind of critical of cuban restaurants, so when they recommended a place in Montclair I was a little surprised.   We arrived at 5:30 or so on a Sunday night and the place was jammed.  Our wait was pretty short, maybe 30-45 minutes.  We were seating somewhat awkwardly in the main courtyard.  The service started our pretty rocky in the beginning.  We were 5 seated at a table for 4.  The drinks and order input was sluggish.  One of the people in our party spoke with the manager and everything changed dramatically for the better.  Can't say enough about the food and service.  Stuff happens in life and it's all about how you recover.   I wouldn't hesitate to return.  In fact I can't wait to return for more Paella.
