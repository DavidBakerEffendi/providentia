I keep trying to like this place, but the food is sub-par and the waits are always ridiculous. The queso is the one thing that is made well there, but the chips are always overcooked and too greasy. How hard is it to mess up chips? The fish and shrimp always taste a little old and are a bit rubbery. The pastor has no flavor. On the upside, the people are nice and the margaritas are pretty cheap, but Chavella's is a lot better for food and is less crowded.
