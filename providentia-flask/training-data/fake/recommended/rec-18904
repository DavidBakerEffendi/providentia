This place is fantastic, one of the few places in the Hartford area where you can have Middle Eastern food and unconventional proteins (the lamb and liver are great) without paying for the overpriced fine dining which constitutes most of the Hartford restaurant scene. There is a bit of a language barrier with the night time staff, and orders do get screwed up if you're not careful, but it's reckless and unfair for anyone to be accusing the owners of being dishonest. My friend was mistakenly charged for a Steak & Cheese when he orders a "Slice of cheese", and as we left the owner chased us down and gave him the difference in cash. The story posted below by Kerim A is totally inconsistent with my experience, and I guarantee that the problem would have been resolved if they'd addressed it to the staff instead of passive-aggressively lashing out over the internet.
