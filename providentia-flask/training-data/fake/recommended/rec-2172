I have only heard stories about Pat's from my girlfriend who lived in Philly while going to grad school, so on our visit through Philly, we went.  I was very interested in trying this "hype."  So, we tried the original cheese steak with onions and whiz. As I was in line at Pat's, my girlfriend was in line at Geno's across the street.  We both waited in line and met about the same time.  What I could not believe was that it was hot hot hot out, 95 degrees and sweltering.  For a Sunday at 2:30pm, I could not believe what I was actually waiting in line for, a sandwich. When we both met back up, with both sandwiches, we did a taste test between the two.  I thought Geno's was better, slightly, I could barely tell the difference.  Truthfully, Geno's and Pat's tasted the same to me as an outsider from Denver, CO.  My girlfriend liked Pat's better. Personally, I think the hype is much more popular than the food and everything has just blown up.  I've heard locals tell me that the bar between the two is better than both Pat's OR Geno's. It was a good lunch, but I'm not sure I would ever wait more than five minutes for either again.
