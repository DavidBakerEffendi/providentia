Forno's has been an Ironbound favorite of mine for a while but our last trip there seemed to catch them somewhat on an 'off day". As always, guests are offered prodigious amounts of food even before ordering.  Salads, breads, olives, and olive oil are brought to the table right away.  I had always been a fan of their garlic bread, which wasn't brought right away, much to my chagrin, but they did bring it a while later after I asked for it, and it was every bit as good as I remembered it. One of my all-time culinary loves is the Pulpos a la Feria.  This is a dish of boiled octopus with olive oil, sea salt, and paprika.  We shared that as an appetizer and it still was fabulous.  It is a great dish to eat while one sits at the bar, as well, with a shot or two of "43" to supplement it.  The chorizo appetizer was likewise excellent - a large portion and the chorizo was very flavorful and delicious. Main courses were not as up-to-snuff as I have come to expect.  My daughter's filet mignon was tough and lacked a lot of flavor.  I had the roast suckling pig and it, too, wasn't quite as flavorful as I would have hoped.  Other entrees consumed by our party were well-received, and the experience as a whole really was enjoyable. The service was a bit on the slow side.  They were very busy due to the holiday week and that might have made things a bit challenging.  Not so slow, as to be uncomfortable, but not overly attentive. There are many, many terrific restaurants in the Ironbound - you almost can't go wrong - and Forno's should still be on folks' "short list", especially due to its easy walkability from the Newark train station.  However, I was a bit disappointed in our last outing there  and hope it was a blip, as opposed to a trend.
