In terms of a sports bar, the Waiting Room is the kind I like. Big, open layout, decent selection of beer, good service, pretty good food. I met some friends here to watch a Giants game, and we mostly had the place to ourselves. There was one big screen showing the game we wanted, and the other half-dozen TVs around the room broadcast a selection of sporting events, for your pleasure. The food was average-to-good bar food. The chili and Caesar salad were excellent. The burger left something to be desired, but was cheap enough. Drinks were refilled as often as we wanted them to be refilled. The waiter even came outside to ask our friends if they wanted another round while they were out, smoking. If you want a nice relaxing place to take in an afternoon, and you're in the area, the Waiting Room is a good choice.
