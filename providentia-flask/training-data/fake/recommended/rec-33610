Came here with a few friends and it was all that I hoped for. Â Looking for the best fries and I think I have found them! Truffle sauce was the very best! The Sweet Mango Chutney was a surprise for me......didn't think I would like it but I did! My friends ordered other sauces so we were able to try a variety. Peanut Satay,Mexican Ketchup,War Sauce,Curry Ketchup Especial. Will come back again!
