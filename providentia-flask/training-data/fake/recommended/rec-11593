I'd been looking forward to eating at Palo Santo since falling in love with their barbecue joint down the road, Fort Reno. Palo Santo has a totally different vibe, and was completely amazing. We shared the ceviche, which was a treat and I had the chicken, which was juicy and tasty. Perfect for fantastic meal without too much fuss. Can't wait to go back and try it for brunch sometime! Not to mention the tostadas and other amazing sounding appetizers!
