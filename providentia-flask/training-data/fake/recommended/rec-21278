Better than average Sangria! which is saying a lot since the past few places were below average. Cute restaurant, good food, the food is slightly too salty for me but was still edible. Ham Croquettes were very buttery and creamy loved it. The cheese platter was good but not as good as Casuella. Veal tongue (I did not eat, but K said was very tender and good. Will be back to try the rest of the menu. Prices are very reasonable.
