I love Johnny Brenda's. I love playing shows there, I love watching shows there, I love drinking there, and I love eating there. I wish there was a Johnny Brenda's in South Philly.  The people that work there are awesome. The sound guys are the best sound guys in Philly, and the bartenders are awesome. I am friends with a cook there and she is awesome as well.  Great local beers on tap. The only thing that bothers me is that when a show is really crowded, there are drunk people constantly crashing into me, but that is not JB's problem. Walking from the upstairs bar to try and be in the room where the band plays can also be tricky if it's crowded, especially with all the wasted people spilling beer on you. But if you can catch a band in the balcony area, I highly recommend it. Loves it.
