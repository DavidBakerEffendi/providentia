So many people have written such great reviews about this place that I'm afraid that I don't have much to add. EXCEPT that I recently had such great service from JOSH the waiter that I need to put it on the record. I came here with a date at about 10 in the evening on a weeknight. The hostess sat us in the last available two-top, which was right by the door and in Josh's section. We didn't ask for anything else, but Josh suggested that we might like to move to the large eight-top farther inside the restaurant where it was warmer. After all, the kitchen closed at 11. It wasn't like a large party was going to show up. He was super-friendly all evening and made great suggestions. We didn't order the whitefish guacamole (a special that day), but he brought us some anyway because he wanted us to try it, and because it was the end of the shift and it probably would have been thrown out anyway. And it was great! The food here is always wonderful. I had a green chicken mole, which was another daily special. It might have been to spicy for some people, but I enjoyed it. My dining companion had an assortment of small stuff, including a tamale that I just loved. This was already my favorite neighborhood restaurant. And now Josh has become my favorite neighborhood waiter.
