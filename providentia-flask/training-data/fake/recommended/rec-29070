After seeing Tommy DiNic's being featured on Man vs. Food, my bf and I made it a personal goal to try the famous roast pork sandwich to see if it lived up to all of its hype. And in short, IT DID. Being complete noobs, we made the trek to Reading Terminal and arrived at DiNic's around 5PM thinking that we had enough time to sample the sandwich. DO NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE, the server told us that the sandwich usually gets sold out by 4PM since they only make enough for a day's worth. We made this same mistake a few weeks later and were not as fortunate. But I guess the food Gods were looking out for us that day because we got the very LAST sandwich, which we split between the two of us (it's pretty substantially sized). As soon as we sat down to enjoy the delicious concoction, a steady stream of people approached the register and were quickly turned away., giving us death glares and knowing full well that we took the last sandwich of the day. The melted provolone combined with the tender, juicy pork simply dissolves away in your mouth. The bread isn't too thick and crunchy (like in cheese steak sandwiches); and the broccoli rabe provides just enough crunch that ties the complete meal together. For someone who does not enjoy cheese steak sandwiches, I thought DiNic's roast pork was a great alternative. Beware of the lunch and dinner rush, try to come earlier to ensure that you don't leave empty-handed! This is definitely high up there on my list of Â Philly favorites.
