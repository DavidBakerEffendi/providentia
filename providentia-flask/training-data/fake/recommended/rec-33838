FOOD The food here was DE.LI.CIOUS! Between the two of us, we tried the mussels, oysters, lamb, and ribs. ALL come highly recommended. The mussels were very interesting. They're actually served cold and brined in a jar, which I wasn't expecting, but it was a great sweet n salty combo. The ribs fell right of the bone and had a delicious sweet and tangy sauce. The lamb was perfectly seasoned and cooked. DEFINITELY try it! Overall, 5 stars for the food! SERVICE Service was impeccable, yet warm. The waiters/ waitresses were very attentive and carefully explained the menu. My water glass never went empty, and my waitress checked in on me regularly throughout the meal. 5 stars! AMBIANCE Ambiance was a mixed bag. The decor is very homey and even a tad romantic. There were fresh roses and a candlelight on each table and the tables and chairs looked like they were out of the 50s. Felt like I was eating in a warm kitchen. The setup, however, was pretty awkward. Tables were WAY too close together (as in 2" between tables), and I was able to hear the conversation of a lady 2 tables down! In addition, because the tables were so close together, you couldn't walk around your table, so if you needed to step to the bathroom, you had to ask your neighbor to slide out of the bench. AWKWARD. 3 stars, and thats only because of the decor. OVERALL Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience. I'll return because the food was really well done, but I do wish they'd rethink their setup. I wouldn't feel comfortable inviting anyone I wanted to have serious or intimate conversation with.
