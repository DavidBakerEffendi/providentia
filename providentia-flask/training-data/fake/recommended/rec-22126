Went to The Saint Austere for my birthday last night, which was perfectly cozy and not too noisy.  Made a hassle-free reservation for 8 at 8:30pm a couple days in advance and the table was ready for the few of us that got there a little early. I recommend the polenta, pork belly croquetas, liver, and broccoli rabe, especially for their price. Other plates that were yummy are the skirt steak, risotto, and octopus (so tender!), but are a little pricey in relation to how much I enjoyed them. Next time, I'd pass on the squid calamari which was a little too salty for me, bone marrow, the fried artichokes, and the duck confit which just didn't measure up to everything else. The service was great.  Friendly and attentive. Quick to replace my empty beer glass. Would definitely go again and recommend to others.
