Basically whenever I venture down to Chinatown, I spend $20 and walk out with enough food for 5 dinners.  Best dumplings ever.  I seriously fantasize about their dumplings whenever I smell Chinese food and make a point to get them almost every weekend.   Only negative thing I have to say is that there is very minimal seating (4 bar stools) so you have to take your food to go.  But the food is so cheap and delicious, they're getting 5 stars anyways.
