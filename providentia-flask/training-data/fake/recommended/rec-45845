We have been there twice, once for breakfast when we were new to Vermont and once more recently for a mid morning snack.  Both times we had a great time.  It's a bakery/cafe, so expecting restaurant service isn't realistic.  We ordered sandwiches, which were good, and the coffee was great.  It was easy to find a table, and there is a changing table in the bathroom and plenty of highchairs- always a plus.  It wasn't too loud, but did feel spacious with the high ceilings.
