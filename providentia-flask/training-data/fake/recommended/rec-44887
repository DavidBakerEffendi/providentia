I've been to this place for several times. Every time I ordered different plates and the food quality has been stably good every time. The miso black cod is a must! The place is a little crowded sometimes, but it's nice when it opened its window and nice people watching there! This is not a fancy resto like other jap places. Neither an average fake jap eatery either! It's more like a neighborhood gem~
