Voted in Time Out New York as one of the best new burgers in NYC, the Cluny Burger offers an 8oz Creekstone All-Natural Ground Sirloin with American Cheese and Bacon with a side of fries ($20.00). The visual presentation of the burger is great. You are offered three cheeses, I stuck with American. They forgot my bacon...ugh. It came out as a side after I brought it to their attention but it killed me to stare and wait those five minutes. I cannot fairly judge this burger for the simple reason that it was completely over cooked. I asked for medium and it came out well done. Burger was dry and lacked the juicy flavor one desires when eating a burger. Sides/bacon/cheese were all fresh and good. Fries were awesome and ambiance is that of a quaint French bistro. Service was decent. Location is great.
