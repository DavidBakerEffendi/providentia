I just found out about this place not too long ago, wish I wouldve known about it when it opened.The salmon is absolutely delicious. It's served with yellow rice plus you pick 2 other sides along with it. The sauce thats used on it is soo tasty. I also tried the fried shrimp once, it was delicious too. It's not the cheap tasting breaded type of fried shrimp, its lightly fried. Both are worth trying at least once! They also have their own homeade beverages & the strawberry cake I had for dessert was good. I love their food, I go there at least once a week.
