El Fuego is the burrito destination for me. I'm a huge fan of the big burrito fast food style and I've eaten at just about all of them across the Eastern US. El Fuego does a great job of keeping it simple. They do your basic burrito, quesadilla, taco, or burrito bowl. The quality is great, they are fast, and if you are high-tech like me, you will appreciate that they accept Level Up as a payment type. Minus one star for being slightly on the pricy side for a burrito place. Also, the past time I visited my burrito was slightly on the cool side. That's once out of about ten visits. Give 'em a shot!
