Yum! Sat at the bar with a friend on Thursday night. We had sangria for happy hour which was delicious and only $5 a glass until 7. The bacon flight and tater tots were yummy and a delicious start. My Cobb salad wasn't anything special. I should've tried some of the other things that looked good. I would definitely go back to try a sandwhich.
