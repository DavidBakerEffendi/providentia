Nice place. Come here often to get the vegetarian platter meal thing, which is perfect! Soup or stew is perfect! Sandviches are good as well. Come here alone or with friends and talk to Tai he's very nice. it is not overstuffed with furniture its just a small quintessentially East Village type a place. P.S. Tai the proprietor reminds me slightly of Red from that seventies show.
