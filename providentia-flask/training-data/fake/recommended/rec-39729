I've eaten at Yuca Bar three previous times for Sunday brunch, and have always been thrilled with the food. Wonderful brunch specials, great prices and excellent drinks. I went back this morning, and had a very unpleasant experience. The coffee was lukewarm, and the eggs were the same. Just before leaving, I saw a mouse walk across the top of the banquette that my wife was sitting on. Love the food and the prices, but we won't be back.
