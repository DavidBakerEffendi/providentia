2+ hour wait for mediocre meatballs with just ok sauce, and bad service? I think not! Bf had the beef balls over pasta with marinara sauce, the meat balls were good, the sauce was just ok. I had the special with mushroom sauce. The mushroom sauce was super salty, I tasted a little bit of it and had to chase it with a huge chunk of bread. Then I made the mistake by trying the special meat balls, which were even saltier than the salty mushroom sauce. I finished my bread AND root beer float to wash all the salt off of my tongue. That was not pleasant at all, esp after a 2+ hour wait. Never again! Stupid salty balls.
