I would give this restaurant 6 stars if I could.  Where do I start? #1 - Portions were HUGE.  Amazing for the Price. #2 - The QUALITY of the food was incredible.  The Burnt Ends, Brisket, Pulled Pork, and Smoked Turkey were some of the BEST I've ever had.  My friends also had the ribs which they LOVED.  There was nothing bad about it - it was one of the best bbq experiences I've ever had EVER! #3 The staff were incredibly Nice.  I noticed them being nice to each other too, which is really great to see.  They were closing and we ran in there not realizing that they were closing up shop.  But they were immensely accommodating, served us right away, and chatted with us while we were there.  Very helpful and overly kind and friendly. Cannot possibly ask for more from a BBQ restaurant than this.
