First time at this restaurant, boyfriends dinner celebration- just us two. Unfortunately were placed in corner 2 seat table. Our waiter and staff were very attentive to our needs throughout the evening. Enough time given between courses. I got the scallop entr√©e very flavorful although a bit on the rare side for me. Boyfriend enjoyed filet mignon very much. We ordered blueberry bread pudding very delicious. We are planning on going again to order homemade pasta and to try another dessert. Also BYOB
