While a blizzard hits brooklyn, I think everyone agrees it feels good to stay in warm and cozy and have someone else cook for you :-). I decided to order in sushi at a reasonable price. This was the quickest delivery service I've had in Brooklyn thus far. My sushi was here within 20-25 mins DURING the blizzard. They have a good variety of reasonably priced platters and sushi is pretty good. In $22, I had miso soup, beef broccoli appetizer, 20 sushi rolls, delivered fresh/quick to my door again DURING the blizzard!!!! This place is pretty cool. Try it.
