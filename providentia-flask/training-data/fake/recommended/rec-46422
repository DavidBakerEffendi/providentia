Had a birthday dinner here. The chili lobster is by far the best item on the menu. Other items not as great ( seabass, cavatelli). Cavatelli was too salty ( and I can tolerate a lot of salt)! Really good service and delicious amuses brought to the table to start. Desserts are better than the entrees. Loved the blondie with marshmallow ice cream! Would come back for dessert but mot for dinner.
