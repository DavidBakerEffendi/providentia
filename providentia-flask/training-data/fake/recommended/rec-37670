I've eaten here several times for dinner with my parents, work dinners and dates! Always good service, always great food. I have NEVER been disappointed here. I've even been given free dessert on a few occasions because the servers are just so friendly (especially with my parents asking a million questions when they visit :)) Good prices I think as well. You could get a couple of appetizers and a Classic/Big Zi and split with a partner and be set. Even quite full. Well worth it because the food is supreme. It's a lovely little place in the summer for sitting outside, even when the evenings are a bit cool. I've had almost everything on the menu. The Crazy Baba is a classic but the Tershi is to die for. The cigars are fine as are the shishitos but nothing to write home about. The Shook salad is a bit boring but a good medium sized salad. I've had two of the seasonal salads and they have always been good but a bit small. Definitely need an appetizer to accompany. Of the classic Zi's - the Shakshuka is AMAZING. I loved poached eggs so I'm an easy sell but this is a great dish. The Zizi hummus is nothing special and I've yet to try the lamb kebabs, but hear they are great. The big Zis - GO FOR THE STUFFED ROOT VEGGIES. So wonderful. Even if you don't "love" lamb, it's a great choice. Not overwhelming. The baklava is...wonderful. It's not my grandmother's but it's definitely better than what you can buy in any bakery in Brooklyn.
