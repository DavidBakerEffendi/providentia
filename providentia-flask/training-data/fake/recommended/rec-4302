This used to be one of my favorite (top 3) Philadelphia restaurants, easily surpassing El Vez as the best guacamole (and that's saying a lot).  It is also my sister's favorite restaurant when she visits me so we were excited to find they have a dedicated gluten free menu for her new dietary needs.  We went as a group because we were all craving guacamole. Have always loved the made to order guacamole because I am allergic to red onions and dislike the taste of regular onions. The waitress informed us they were too busy to make guacamole without onions (which is odd since we only waited 5 minutes for a table) to which we replied, we'll wait- but were told that was not an option. Since they use regular onions we were debating whether it was worth ordering and we all heard the waitress say, do you want the guacamole- of course it will be free (which if you can't make it how we want when you've been able to for many other visits would be appropriate). Even those of us who like onion found the guacamole to be too oniony and did not eat it.  After leaving a basically untouched bowl of guacamole we were pretty shocked to then see it on our bill (we realized she must have said gluten free not free and in the loud restaurant we misheard).  In addition, both my sister and I ordered our favorite dishes and didn't find them to be all that taste-y anymore.  (My sister said her dish was short a sauce it had had last time, which could have been because of her new gluten free needs, but mine just wasn't as yummy.)  Needless to say, both my sister & I have crossed El Rey off our favorite list & will not be back despite the gluten free friendly atmosphere which is too bad since I live around the corner.
