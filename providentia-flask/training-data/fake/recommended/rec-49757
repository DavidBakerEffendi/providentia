I use to order here all the time because they were quick and pretty tasty. One day, I decided to order a more expensive dish and lo and behold no rice. There wasn't any warning that the dish wouldn't come with rice which meant I had to re-order or go out and pick up some extra rice. Either way, inconvenient and frustrating. It's a small thing that makes a big impact on me.And considering I'm a regular customer I considered it pretty disrespectful all around. Little things make a big difference.
