On a scale of 1 to 10, the decor was an 11 on the chez factor, you'll understand once you walk in and bump into the glass enclosed chandelier.   The food was quite tasty and reasonably priced, which is the important part.  Some items, such as the fried spring rolls were disappointing, but the Thai Basil Noodle dish was well prepared.  In an area that has an over concentration of Thai restaurants, the decor at Room Service is definitely the 'sch-tick that draws them in.
