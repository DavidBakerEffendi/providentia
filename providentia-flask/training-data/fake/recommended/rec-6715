The food was pretty good, but it was overpriced and the service sucked - they were slow and inattentive. It took forever to get our appetizer (summer roll); it came out at the same time as my entree. Â My friend's entree came out about 10 mins later. Not only are prices high, but they border on ridiculous. My friend asked for extra egg in her pad see ew as she always does at thai places, and they said it'd cost her an extra $2! She could pretty much buy a carton of eggs for that price. Finally, they close at 9:30 and sat people up until about 9:20. At 9:40,they started slamming chairs up onto tables and shutting the place down -- as people are still eating dinner! So rude. Wouldnt go back here.
