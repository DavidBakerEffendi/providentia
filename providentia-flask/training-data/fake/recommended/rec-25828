With so many amazing places to dine in the city, this is not my first pick. To be clear - I know this is an institution, but there has always been something off with some part of the meal. I would not choose to eat here unless someone insisted. On the flip side, the staff is knowledgeable and the ambiance is warm and inviting. I would say to definitely try it, even if just to say you've been, and hopefully you will have better luck than my inconsistent experiences.
