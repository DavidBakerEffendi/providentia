Good price, great food and the guys at the counter are actually really nice. We hit this up for a late 'dinner' after we missed our reservation and just needed something to get us fed and in the mood to booze. For the rest of the weekend, I have had falafel withdrawal. The only knock is that it can get so crowded and uncomfortable in there, and there is nowhere to sit or hang out. Still, this place is worth a check-in.
