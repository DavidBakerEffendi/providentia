Came here because it was in my hotel.  I have such mixed feelings about this place.  When I eat somewhere, it's pretty simple...I like a good atmosphere and great food.  Juni has one out of two of these.  The food is absolutely magnificent, well seasoned and well prepared on every front.  They provide little unexpected treats the entire meal: amazing olive bread, some interesting and tasty palette preparations, and even some dessert samplings.  The langoustines were fantastic and light, and the striper bass I had for dinner along with the carrot puree were delicious and perfectly crafted and cooked.  Only complaint from the meal was the poorly crafted lavender-something rye cocktail I had...easy enough to avoid. On the other hand, this restaurant could not be more pretentious and stuffy.  And this, of course, leads to a similar (read: douchey) clientele.  I mean, it was right out of a movie, like the dinner scene in Trading Places.  Every dish I ordered was read back to me as it was served...uh thanks I read the effing menu, I know what's in it.  My waitress looked like Lauryn Hill yet somehow sounds like Buffy Kensington III...very confusing.  I had a flatware change with each course, unnecessary.  And don't get me started on a obnoxious table of douches next to me.  The chef even came out and visited with a few tables, and all of them were fawning and making nonsensical (and often totally wrong) comments about the food.  The chef just had to sit there and agree with these simpering idiots.  I can't stress enough how this atmosphere and the presentation of my meal dampened the delight of the great food. Five stars for the food, one star for the pretense and open invitation to rich douchebags.  We meet in the middle and you get a three, Juni.
