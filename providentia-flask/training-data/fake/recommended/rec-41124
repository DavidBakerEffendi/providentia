This place has the slowest service in the world. My group of 5 came at 2pm on a saturday and there was a table for 6 that was sitting empty and took them 15 minutes to prepare. It took another 10 minutes for them to take our orders (although we were ready as soon as we sat down). And it was past 2:45 when our food finally arrived. I haven't written a yelp review for a while, but i had so much time to put this together, waiting for the food. Eggs were not cooked properly and mine were overseasoned. To their credit, the waitstaff was nice and our server did apologize for the wait. But im not returning here...
