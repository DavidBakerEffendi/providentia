Went with a huge group - 14. Short wait for table with reservations. Very busy, noisy and happy place. The waiters were working hard and just keeping up. Lots of red wine and beers with a nice steak and fries. Everybody was happy and having fun. I split the bill with my brother and it wasn't painful. I even passed a few bills to the waiter and busboy for trying hard. If there were any celebrities there, they didn't stop by the table and ask for my autograph.
