This place is a MUST try. We were in Philly from NYC this past weekend and stopped in for brunch on Saturday when we got into town. We called ahead and they took our names, so by the time we got there we had less than a 5 minute wait. The décor is cute, the place is clean and the music is dope! Lots of 90s R&B with some hip-hop mixed in. Our waitress was amazing and super sweet. This place had a GREAT vibe from beginning to end. One might think with the place being so great, the food was eh. NO WAY. I got the Bananarama something, Mexican food type plate and OMG it was all delicious. The eggs mixed in with cheese, mushrooms, sausage, green onion, some AMAZING verde sauce...and then the tortillas chips underneath. And with potatoes! I couldn't get enough. The portion was huge and thank goodness, because this was delicious. I don't have one complaint about this place. We tried Lift Café the next day, which got good reviews on Yelp, and the service, vibe and food weren't nearly as good. TRY THIS PLACE!
