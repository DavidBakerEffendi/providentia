Disappointing.  Fun, interesting food with potential strong upside.  But our dishes were mediocre to bad, except fine simple dessert, and we generally had poor service.  They were fairly gracious about our long wait at a table for a friend who had to rush home.  But the constant push to pour your beer or order another drink *really* gets old after the fourth time in fifteen minutes.  The ceviche was crazy salty -- the chips with sliced Peruvian frankfurters, a little gross.  The beer selections outside of a decent Peruvian brew were real weak.  Lots of food, a thumbs up there.  Only accepts AmEx, very noisy, a thumbs down.  Non-stop interruptions from waiters and especially bus-boys to clear plates, put new paper on the table, pour water -- these really spoiled the mood of the evening and made the place somewhere that I would not go back to.  And even though the chicken looked real good, not wanting to return has to take down an otherwise three-star restaurant.
