I adore this tiny nook of a mexican restaurant! good food and great drinks. try the grapefruit habenero margarita! i had the sopa azteca on a chilly, rainy evening and it definitely warmed me up. we tried the churros too. you can't go wrong with cinnamon-sugar crusted fried dough and warm chocolate dipping sauce!
