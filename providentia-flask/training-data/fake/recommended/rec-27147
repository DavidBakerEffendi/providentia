Note to the owners!!  The salad (few pieces of tasteless lettuce) is a bad substitution for your mixed vegetables that come with the chicken naban. I am a devoted customer who loves your chicken naban with fluffy, light as air white rice.  Please bring back the mixed vegetables....the salad does not cut it!
