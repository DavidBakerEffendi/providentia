I had been wanting to come here for a show for a couple of months and finally had the opportunity a couple of days ago. It was great! This is my favorite small venue I have been in Philadelphia thus far, the sound was good, the layout was awesome, you can get inches from the band, people were polite, bathrooms were clean...and the best part...YOU CAN BRING YOUR BEER WHEREVER YOU WANT! No "if you're drinking you must stay within this area like cattle" rules apply here, run free with your draft of choice. I want to come back and try the food as another reason why Johnny Brenda's gets my 5 stars, the whole place smells like smoked meat...which I think is a good thing.
