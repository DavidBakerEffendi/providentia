Banana Leaf is my Philadelphia "go to". It's Malaysian which is an intersection of Thai, Indian and Chinese cuisines. The service is always friendly and quick. The food is always delicious and the prices are reasonable. It's a great place for a diverse group. Where else can you get feed a vegetarian with an indian food craving and someone looking for a a chinese style goat curry?
