I don't think I've said, 'omg this is ridiculously good' so many times in a row in my entire life. Started with a cheese platter that was paired ever so perfectly - the buffalo paired with graham cracker was the most delicious sweet concoction ever. Â The entrees were amazing especially the squash ravioli- I love winter squash and this was perfect. But I need to take quite a few lines to go on and on about dessert. This was were my head exploded from pure joy. The hazelnut torta was ... divine. The chocolate, the salt, hazelnut layers were just incredible - I pretty much did not want to eat again just not to lose the taste. We also ordered the pumpkin triamisu- perfectly layered in a tumbler with just the right amount of nutmeg and not too heavy- it's the prefect winter treat. Overall, really lovely place- wait staff was great and I can't wait to go back.
