Such a Long wait! Its ridiculous esp. when it is so cold outside people still wait for it!! It is pretty yummy for something you get out of a cart and since there is such a high turn over rate with the meat on the grill, it looks and taste like it's pretty safe! The one thing that puzzles me the most is the white sauce, I am not really sure what it is but it is Awesome! It does not taste like a yogurt base maybe it is Ranch? but who knows. I don't suggest eating too much of these plates because its pretty greasy. It is so greasy that it actually taste fine the next day and the day after coming out from the fridge and reheated from the microwave. The oil acts like some sort of preservatives, crazy stuff! Great for college students and drunk people coming out of Parties! My Pick: -The Combo with Pita Bread (Chicken and Lamb) **Beware: the hot sauces is REALLY HOT!!**
