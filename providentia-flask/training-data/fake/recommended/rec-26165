I ventured to their brick and mortar based on their reputation as one of the best food trucks in the city (and didn't want to venture midtown). Their place is relatively low key, and a frequent late night destination after the bars. The food is pretty inexpensive and I would say the quality is similar to your high end food truck but obviously fresher. The food portions are also great. I usually get the combo platter and have yet to be disappointed. Great for anyone in a pinch and I would return.
