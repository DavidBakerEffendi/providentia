Restaurants seem to come and go in this neighborhood, so it's great to see a place get it right on the first try.   Like another reviewer, I was put off by the "bite" arrangement of the menu, but the food is so satisfying that I got over that after a couple of said bites.    I'm also always wary of "small plates" because I envision a $12 slice of waxy cheese and the inevitable ripped-off feeling that follows.     The polenta here is not to be missed.  So creamy and spicy and dee-lish.   The grilled sandwiches are some of the best I've had and the grilled octopus salad really subtle & flavorful.   Nice selection of beers and a really wonderful and genuinely friendly, "neighborhoody" staff make this a home run.  There's also little-to-no hipster douchebaggery (I really don't mind hipsters.  God bless them.  I just hate the sometimes silly hipster "I'm so over it" attitude of so many new places).  For once, the crowd seems really diverse age-wise. We'll definitely be back (and back and back and back).
