I ended up going to this place by accident as a friend of mine from NY, who lives very close by, dragged me to go eat dinner there (besides the fact that I was not that hungry!). We were seated outside in the super pleasant & cozy garden. I was really contemplating what to get and the waiter suggested the (light) off the oven fresh lasagna. Mama mia,  it was delicious & I ate it all of it. Our other friend was teasing me saying "You said you weren't hungry :-)" my reply: "True, but one always finds place for a delicious lasagna." The wine was cool too. Overall, a really nice and pretty quiet place with an excellent service & lovely ambiance, in a very cute part of  bohemian Williamsburg, Brooklyn. I would def. go back again!
