The food is pretty nice but hardly anything you can't find elsewhere (including in my own kitchen), especially if you prefer savory to sweet brunch dishes. The service we had last week however was among the worst I've had, even for NYC standards. We went there pretty early (needed to be out at 8am anyway and this was the main reason we headed to Penelope's), so the woman who had our table didn't even have the usual excuse of too many customers. I don't even care for my waiters to be bubbly and warm, but she was downright rude and with the attitude of someone who should not be handing out towels in a restroom, let alone serving food. With the huge variety of places in NYC, a restaurant can't survive on the strength of its menu alone.
