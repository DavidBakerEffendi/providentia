since I just finished bemoaning the downhill slide of another Thai place, I feel it's only fair to give Erawan the credit it deserves. To me, this is the best Thai food in Center City and I've made a point to sample all six or seven options. the lunch special is beautifully presented, filling, a great value and best of all, it's really tasty. it can get a little crowded during the lunch rush some days - I've found Fridays are a little lighter or just going closer to 1 p.m.
