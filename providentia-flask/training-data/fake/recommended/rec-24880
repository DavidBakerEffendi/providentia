I bought a Groupon to Mediterranea that made this a good deal. We are fans of Greek, Turkish, and Mediterranean food and with all the options in that space in the Montclair area, we figured that Mediterranea would be pretty good. The 3 star average on Yelp! was a red flag and it's one I should have seen coming. Mediterranea is nowhere near the quality of Stamna on Broad Street in Bloomfield and falls short of the Four Seasons Kebab House in Upper Montclair. I don't like giving lukewarm reviews, but when there are better options, it's a shame to encourage people to go to places that are sub par. First the service. Believe everything you hear. While the servers were all very nice and there seemed to be plenty of them, it  took a long time to get our food. Was it coincidence that we received our appetizers only after asked a server to check on our appetizers? Either way, it took over a half hour, which seemed like a long time given that Baba Ghanouj can easily be pre-made. We had fish and lamb kebabs. These were fine although I can't say they were huge portions. Normally I am fine with this as I don't like to overeat, but given that the entrees were quite expensive for what they were--$20 each plus or minus a few dollars--I was surprised. The quality was fine, but not great. I asked my wife what she thought and she suggested that she didn't expect we'd ever come back. I don't get it. Restaurant space in Montclair is expensive. Why blow it? There is a Yelp! sticker in the window, so the management should be aware that their reviews are not so hot. But poor service, food that's just ok (nothing inspired us...heck, my meal at Falafel Hut was better the other day), ambiance that reminds us of days gone by--and not in a good way. I'm not sure what to say. Whatever the problem is, Mediterranea just can't get it together.     Three stars is a generous rating.
