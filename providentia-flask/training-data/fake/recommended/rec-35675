Last week we enjoyed a wonderful dinner at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and helpful with the menu. The bartender really gave terrific service. My boyfriend and I shared three appetizers and a pasta (chicken liver rigatoni). Everything, especially the pasta was delicious. We were having a fantastic time, but left with a very sour taste in our mouth. We were given a Vetri gift card this Christmas but were told as we were paying that the gift card we had was only valid for Vetri Ristorante, not all Vetri family restaurants. No where on the card does it say this. Unfortunately, we are moving this week and will not get a chance to sit down for a seven course tasting menu. Had we known this strange policy, we would have arranged a time earlier this year. (However, I should also mention the gift card was $100 which does not even cover the cost of one meal.) The purchaser of the gift card does not live in Philly so I can see how this was confusing for them when they bought it for us. Finally, I emailed Vetri to express my disappointment and they were not very understanding or accommodating. The chicken liver rigatoni delicious, the bartender was a delight, but I don't think I will return to any Vetri restaurants next time we are in Philly.
