I don't get why the yelp reviewers have given such high review. Granted, it's very cozy dining environment, very intimate too. It's like eating at someone's living room. Quite creative too to not give out a public phone number for reservations and hide it behind a butcher shop, successfully made the restaurant mysterious. However... Food is just average. If you want real Japanese upscale food, go to Sakagura or Aburiya Kinnosuke at midtown east. Food in Bohemian is at most American Japanese. I even found it's a little too heavy. I guess it'll be an ok experience if they didn't make it so "hard-to-get", or if I didn't expect to have a real Japanese dining experience.
