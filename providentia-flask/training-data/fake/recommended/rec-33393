Best thing about tapas is you get to pig out in smaller portions, tasting different things and not get super full (super broke maybe if you have a big appetite)!!! At Traif, however, you should be fine. The prices are very reasonable, which is the best thing about this place!! I wont bore you out with what my friends and I ordered for dinner, except to suggest the bigeye tuna over tempura eggplant (delightful), large scallops on risotto (extraordinary) and the pork croquettes (hmm). For dessert, we tried the bacon flavored donuts (a little disappointed). Bottom line, if you want to try something different and happen to be in the area (or make your way over to that part of town), I'd say do it!!
