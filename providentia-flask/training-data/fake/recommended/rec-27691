Came here to eat after a bike event. My friend and I just finished riding around on a bike for maybe a little over or hour or so, and we needed the welcoming break. We both had the mussels. They were delicious! They were small and sweet little crustations from the sea. They were seasoned with I think bacon, wine and garlic and other seasonings, and two pieces garlic toasted bread. They came in a cute little pot with a top for throwing the shells in. The place itself is pretty big gas two floors and I like the decor.
