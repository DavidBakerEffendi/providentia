This was about the 5th pizza joint I visited during my trip to New York. This was also what I felt to be the most authentic New York pizza I had ever tasted. I ordered a single slice of the margarita pizza as I was saving room for every pizza place I passed. I sat down with my single slice and for the first time in my life I tasted fresh mozzarella. It was warm and gooey, and super stretchy! The sauce tasted fresh and fresh basil leaves top the pizza as well. Â The crust was thin and crisp and added just enough to the flavor without overpowering the freshest toppings I have ever tasted. Well, I gave up and saving room for another pizza place, stood up, walked over to the counter, and ordered a second slice before leaving Prince Street Pizza. It was just as delicious as the first. Environment: This was one of the cleanest pizza places I visited on my trip. The walls are lined with Italian celebrities that have stopped by to enjoy this authentic pizza. Apparently this place is a favorite of the former Soprano's cast. Verdict: A must eat!
