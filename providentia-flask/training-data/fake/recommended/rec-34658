My Brazilian bro (who is responsible for the development of my Brazilian alter ego) took me here and we stuffed ourselves with abandon to buffer against a night of drinking & dancing. And what a buffer was this buffet! I had previously eaten Brazilian food at festivals, rodizio-style restaurants, and at his place many times. But this spot is unique. No where else had I been able to try chicken hearts alongside my picanha. Those turned out to be my favorite meat on the night we came. They taste so beefy and juicy. Of the bountiful vegetables, collard greens and black beans were like his mom makes. But everything I tried was delectable. Â This absolutely includes desserts. As my bro was watching his figure, we split a slice of tres leches and I had a coconut ball sweet. Both sent me into ecstasy. These sweets would have high street value---if they ever make it out of this cozy restaurant.
