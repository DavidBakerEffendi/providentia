Ok I normally do not give reviews that are negative but today I have to give my opinion. 1- not authentic Thai, they spoke Chinese 2- the service was beyond what I am even accustomed to with Chinese restaurants. Just terrible and rude 3- for someone who spent a lot of time in Thailand, the food is OK. Good not terrible but not great. It tasted like Chinese food with curry. But just the terrible service makes me loath it more. If you really want Thai food that's authentic and taste like real Thai food, go to 4 season in South Plainfield. It really saddens me that I have to drive 30 mins for real Thai food that is delicious but I'd rather the drive than eat here again.
