New bar/burger joint on Avenue C. The place looks nice inside, and has ample outdoor seating. I found that they charge a bit too much for their drinks, however. You shouldn't have to pay $6 for a Brooklyn Lager in this neighborhood. The burgers are very good though ,and actually cooked to your specifications. I can't remember the last time I ordered a burger medium rare and actually got it medium rare. The french fries are pretty good, but only about 5-6 large-cut steak fries for 3 bucks. Beware the waitress on weekdays. Although very friendly, she seems to have absolutely NO short term memory whatsoever.
