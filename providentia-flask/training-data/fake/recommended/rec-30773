Being in the food business for over 30 years along with being married to a chef, having a son who works in a well known  CT restaurant and a daughter in the hospitality industry, the whole family  expect a lot when we finally get to go enjoy a good meal and actually be served.   My son just started at a local university and chose this place from "yelp"- the first meal he has had besides cafeteria food ... This place is phenomenal! From the greeting at the door, to our server Sue and the Chef- customer service was spot on they all had a true interest in their customers. Appetizers, entrees and the dessert were more than I had expected. To find a restaurant that has it all- customer service, quality, location couldn't ask for more ... well except... a LARGE to go order when I return to pick up my son for the holidays! This will be our ONLY restaurant when we visit MCU- when you've found the best why go anywhere else!!
