Even if the food wasn't terrific, I'd still have to give Tom's 5 stars because the people there were so darn nice. As we stood in line, we were offered coffee, orange slices, cookies, and fries with dip. They clearly are interested in making waiting as pleasant and experience as possible and aren't worried that you'll fill up, because actually, the line moves right along. The inside is a bit cramped, but then, it's a typical diner. Diners are normally cozy. And since this one is so friendly, it added to the "we're all one big family" atmosphere. Everything we ordered was yummy. Sweet potato pancakes, special pancakes, broccoli and cheese omelet, crab cakes Florentine, lime rickeys, grits, home fries... and we ate all of it - big portions, but soooo good there was no way any of it was getting left on the plate. I loved the little plate that came along with lime, strawberry, and cinnamon butter. Nice touch - the cinnamon butter went great with my sweet potato pancakes. Tom's does a great brunch business and it is easy to see why. Even though it was crazy, busy, we never felt rushed. The service keeps things running smoothly, and although they are probably running their toushes off, there were always smiles all around. Don't go to Tom's if you aren't prepared to wait. But if you are, your patience will be well rewarded.
