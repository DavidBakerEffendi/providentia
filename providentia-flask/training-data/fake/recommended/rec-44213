This is a cool place.  Vegan friendly with some organic stuff.  On the healthy side as far as I'm concerned, but still very tasty.  Worth checking out if you're in the area. We parked across the street.  You have to go across the parking lot, down the steps and into the building on the corner to get in.  The outside seating and giant sign over the private parking lot threw us off.  I guess you can also come in through the alley-way on the other side street as well? Wasn't crowded on the Thursday morning we went.  Service was acceptable and the food was good.  An orange on one of our plates that came out appeared to be half-eaten already.  We forgot to mention that to the staff - it wasn't a huge deal.  As a few other places in the area, this place doesn't serve Coke or Pepsi products... just an FYI.
