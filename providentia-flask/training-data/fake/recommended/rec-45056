Empanada Friday has been announced! Yes, the lunch planner(me) said so! We planned to go get these empanadas since Wednesday, and we finally did it! I visited their website, printed the menu, visited all my colleagues and asked what they wanted, wrote down their choices, went to a meeting meanwhile, came back, and placed the order on the phone for pickup. All these happened in 1 hour. Yes I know I am a great lunch planner.(hell ya!) The place was real tiny with so many people inside. wow popular! Empanadas here are cheap. Prices are between $1.10 and $1.75. You have 28 different choices of empanadas. You can choose corn flour, white flour, or whole grain empanadas. I had 4 empanadas for today's lunch: Corn flour with ground beef & cheese, corn flour with shrimp, white flour with ground chicken, and the "Nutella Chocolate Banana!" Those were all great except the shrimp one; I expected more shrimp then mashed potato(?).. But they were all great! The nutella chocolate banana empanada is the guerilla; be careful of nutella popping out of empanada! just two complaints: 1. empanadas are small.(hm.. maybe that's why they are cheap.) 2. only one employee taking orders/answering calls/etc? hm. you should have one more employee!
