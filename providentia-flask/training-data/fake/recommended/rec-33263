Taqueria wanna-be- yes, real Mexican - not a chance.  This LA themed Mexicali joint claims to serve no nonsense, authentic Mexican cuisine.  So, when does an authentic burrito come with all the ingredients and condiments "on the side"???  We asked for a Machaca burrito "al la Mexicana", which is standard fair in Mexico...both the machaca and the "al la Mex" portion.  However, based on the multiple streets signs for Sunset Blvd/Venice Beach, we felt it appropriate to clarify,....please put some pico in that puppy.   Nope, not a chance.  The dried shredded beef, on the side, the pico - on the side, more cilantro?  You guessed it, on the side.  Presenting just a plain egg buritto wrappede and rolled.  Apparently, I am now line cook as well.   The waitress claimed "it's the authentic Mexican way" and the owners do not allow ANY changes; they are from Mexico City - they know.  Without boring you with either my years in Mexico, or my fiance's Mexican heritage, I can guarantee cooking ingredients together to enhance the flavor IS the Mexican way.  Throwing everything on the side, so I have to reassemble my food to bring in some great Mexican flavour IS NOT. A side note - if you are a fan of national homemade sangira - I encourage you to pass, unless you're looking for the bar mix version of a sangria cocktail, sans recognizable alcohol. The waitress didn't help either..."I'm just the waitress, I don't make the rules.", she huffed. Obviously, the great Mexican service and hospitality of the Mexican culture is not present here either.
