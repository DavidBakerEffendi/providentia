I wanted to like to this place.  I've actually had some pretty good food and beer here.  The staff is pretty friendly as well.  In terms of quality, however, they're just not consistent.  Some times the service will be good.  Other times you might be wishing you'd brought some brand of signal flare with you to flag someone down.     My last visit killed it for me, though.  I'd ordered a plate of nachos that were suppose to come with pico de gallo, cheese sauce and guacamole. Apparently the kitchen was out of guacamole.  This normally wouldn't be a huge deal.  Restaurants run out of things.  Had I known I would of just changed my order, but they decided to just serve it without the things they didn't have.  Add to that the fact that the "cheese sauce" amounted to what seemed to be a tablespoon of melted cheese and the it was equally hard to locate any real quantity of the pico de gallo.  It's a shame because what actually made to the plate was good.  Maybe they were hosting an episode of Chopped.  They did comp me a beer, but at less than half the cost of the nachos it still left me feeling a bit slighted.   I almost gave them another star just for the Shame Burger.  If you do go, I recommend that.  It's on the pricey side, but it's the best thing I've had there.
