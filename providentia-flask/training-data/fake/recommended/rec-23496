Good food, good service. Yes, it must be family owned. Probably, need a mindset to go to a place with only 4 tables and being served by people that may not be in your same culture. I believe that they do the best that they can despite cultural differences. and how they move and serve the food. And the times that I have ordered delivery, yes, it took sometime. But the order was always right. No complaints.
