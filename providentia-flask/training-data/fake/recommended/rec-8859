Went here based on a referral from a friend.  There was no wait- my friend and I were seated immediately.  We ordered the oxtail marrow and beef marmalade- delicious!! Great drinks!  We ordered the lamb chops and skirt steak....mmmmhhmmmm!  We went for my friend's birthday and with no arranging on my part, our waiter had the thoughtfulness to add a candle to her creme brulee. The Chocolate Bruno (Flourless Choc Cake) was decadent and memorable.  The service was great and that makes the experience that much more fulfilling.
