It's not common for me to give out a 5-star review but Toast has earned it.   They earn an easy 3 stars from the food and coffee.  It tastes great, eggs and bacon done perfectly to order.  I feel like the prices are low enough that I don't feel guilty stopping in a few times a week. The fourth star is earned by having an unfussy but cute cafe seating area and free wifi.  They don't mind me hanging out for a few hours on a weekday to get some work done while enjoying coffee and an egg sandwich.  Way better food and ambiance than chain coffee shops - this is a great place for a casual morning business meeting. We've been to visit for Sunday brunch too.  They have a few extra people on and there's never been a wait. The fifth star is due to their wonderful customer service.  The two girls that I see there almost all the time are welcoming and friendly.  After my first few visits, they recognize me and know what I'm going to order.   I will definitely keep coming back to Toast, and I hope it fares better than YOLO and Odd Fellows.
