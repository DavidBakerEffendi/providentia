I've been here a number of times and want to like this place. It has a beautiful outdoor bar and dining area. Inside is 1950 country dungeon (it has a charm actually). Brings me to the 2 stars. The food, the prices, the service. If any one of those 3 matched the potential of this place it would be 4 stars and could be 5 with good management. What a waste. It has such potential for greatness. It actually could get 3 stars for the setting alone. I guess with the right company and a few drinks you might enjoy yourself here. Maybe I'm just too annoyed that this should be my favorite spot, but I'm always disappointed.
