First review on yelp ever.....and im a yelp addict with usually zero complaints which is probably why ive never written. I am so dissapointed in this place. Waited 1.5 hours for food to come out. When food finally came the eggs were overcooked the potatoes were hard as rocks and the food was simply unnapetizing. Drinks were good but thats about it. The korzo burger was overrated and nothing special. So dissapointed on a whole. Will never return.
