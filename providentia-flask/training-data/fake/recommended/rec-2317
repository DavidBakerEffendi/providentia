Pretty good and the cajun fries....  Eeeehhhhh they were O.K.  Nothing special. Now the reason I wanted to go was to get the deputy dog, and guess what they ran out...  CRAP. So I settled for the Philly Cheesesteak.  It was tasty and the people are very friendly.  So if you have a craving for a HOT DOG done right and you can add anything you want; sauted onions, kraut, anything.....  The bun is toasted so that just adds to the flavor.  I give Woody's a Thumbs up.  Oh and the bar does have happy hour specials whats better than alcohol and food?   So if you are in the Hartford area and want a dog and a beer with a side of fries this the place to go.  It is inside an office building right on Main you will not see the sign from the outside unless you go in the side entrance through a small alley.
