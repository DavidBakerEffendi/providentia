Okay, so we went to brunch...3 of us...I scored a chair for the almost hour wait but my compadres had to settle for the stoop to the right.  It was hot...high noon on a Sunday, and I tried not to let my hunger onset moodiness effect me.  Finally we got in and I must say... Biscuit sandwich w/ homemade tomato jam is the bomb diggity!  Me and another member of my party got it and we both enjoyed it.  The other got granola and strawberries, whatever SNOOZER!  The biscuits were amazing and service was okay considering it was so busy.  I did not feel rushed although to be courteous we did not hang out too long after plates were cleared. Everything looked amazing and next time I would like to go for dinner.   My only complaint was that there were biscuits on the shelf right outside the bathroom.  I mean, I am not too skeevy of a person, but one might assume that some airborne ass molecules might penetrate the otherwise yummy flaky crust of the biscuit.
