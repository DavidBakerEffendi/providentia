Don't think, just do it. Here's how it'll go. - You'll look at the menu and think it over for a while, but you'll end up ordering the red white and blue and a burger every time. - Honestly, why wouldn't you? Don't feel bad about ordering a burger at a place called fish... it's pretty fantastic. The only real question is white wine to go with the oysters, or the red to go with the burger? Or you could do what I do... order both! 1 dozen oysters, a glass of white, a glass of red, and an awesome burger and fries... $26. Done and done.
