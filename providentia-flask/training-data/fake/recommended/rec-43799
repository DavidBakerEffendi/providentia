yummy...ordered the chicken yakitori and the chicken meatball yakitori, the chicken meatball definitely fared better but not as good as the chicken meatball yakitori i've had at Soba Totto. Also ordered the Spicy Cod Roe Rice Ball which was really yummy!!! as it was savory and spicy at the same time...and fresh espcially since the rice was still soft and cold. Also tried the Eel Tempura...which I would not order again as it is simply fried eel a little too oily for my taste. The fried chicken with citrus was a definite good choice as it had this tangy flavor and made the chicken seem less oily. I would definitely go back if around the area and would like to try their other specials this time as well as their desserts as we were way too full to eat dessert this past friday night.
