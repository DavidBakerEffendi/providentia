Yummmm.  I went at about 1pm on a Monday afternoon.  Since there was only me I didn't have to wait very long at all for my seat at the bar, only about five minutes.  From there I quickly ordered coffee and blueberry pancakes based on Yelp reviews, and I was not disappointed.  The pancakes were not life changing, but they were extremely good.  Some solid pancakes with some really yummy maple butter. The coffee was excellent too, and was refilled promptly after I drained my first cup.  That's all I need in the world, ladies and gents, delicious pancakes and quick refills on the coffee. The hostess and waitresses here were all super friendly, and after we chatted for awhile they left me to read my book in peace, proving to be both nice and unobtrusive.  This is not exactly pertinent, but the music they played was also perfect.  They went classic (Dylan, The Beatles, American Pie), and it hit just the right note on a lovely summer afternoon with pancakes and a good book. I would definitely eat here again, maybe I would even stray from the pancakes, the woman's sandwich next to me did look mighty fine.  I'm not sure I can make such a big decision too quickly though...
