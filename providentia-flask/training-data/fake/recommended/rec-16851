Contrary to many bad experiences/reviews on Yelp, I pretty much like the food here. I go here often and never had any bad experience with food or service. Their lunch platter is a winner and most of their appetizers taste good. Service might be slower during peak times. The only complaint I have is the price...Many of the dishes here are not worth the money you pay. Definitely over priced.
