1 Taco de pollo + 1 taco de rajas. Amazing. The first bite reminded me of my childhood; so delicious I was literally transported to another time during that bite. Fresh, hand made corn tortillas, cojita cheese, roasted corn, juicy-tender chicken, what else do you need? I thought about adding salsa that they have on the side, but quickly realized these tacos need no additions.
