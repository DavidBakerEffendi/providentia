I'm always searching for the best pizza everywhere I go and Dough is definitely my favorite. So far I've introduced 4 of my closest friends to this place! In an area full of mediocre pizza places, I'm so happy theres one that is actually amazing! All of the ingredients are fresh and organic and the food is so well made. You can tell that the owner really takes pride in his work! My favorite pizza is the white pie - and I usually add pancetta which makes it even more amazing. The caesar salad is great and the dressing is light, like an authentic caesar dressing should be. The zucchini crisps are another favorite appetizer. The staff is also really nice and accommodating. One time my friend's pizza was a bit too burned on one part, so they gave us another free pizza, without even asking for it.
