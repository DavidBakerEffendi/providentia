So maybe I'm too in love with the old Kefi location. There was something quaint about walking down under an apartment, into a back room and dining with a small group of people. The new location, while infinitely more accessible has lost a lot of its charm. Its gone from one of the best date locations in the city, to a family eatery (not that there's anything wrong with that). The food is still amazing (If I could give the food 6 stars I would). For appetizers, nothing beats their spread of Greek spreads, the sheep's milk ricotta ravioli is still light and rich and the broken moussaka is still one of the best dishes being served in the city. I tried a lot of their menu at their last location and was never disappointed with anything I ordered. The service also makes me yearn for the old Kefi. I went for an early dinner (6 PM) on a Saturday., but before our coats were off our waitress was already up on us. Next, we received our entrees well before our appetizers were done (which also happened at the table next to us). I know that they just opened, and that there were a lot of mouths to feed, but with a 120 table restaurant, you gotta figure that we shouldn't have to be rushed out the door. So 4 stars, because the food is still incredible and cheap but the new mega-sized restaurant has lost what made it special and is now just another solid eatery on the UWS. Kinda bummed.
