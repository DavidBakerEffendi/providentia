Dinner! Ever since I attended one of Brooklyn Commune's Supper Clubs a few months ago, I've been crossing my fingers for a regular dinner service. I was thrilled to attend the soft opening last week, and by the end of my gluttonous meal all of my senses were happy. We ordered the calamari, polenta with meatballs and carrot risotto. Everything tasted delicious, presentation was beautiful, and service was outstanding. Â I have been frequenting Brooklyn Commune since they first opened and have always been able to find tasty vegetarian-friendly dishes for both breakfast and lunch. I was pleasantly surprised to find that dinner was no different. I'd definitely recommend popping by Juice Box for a bottle of wine before heading next door for dinner. Very thankful to all these guys for supporting the community, and for making it possible to simply walk out my front door for a fantastic meal.
