First let me start by saying that I have eaten here about 30 times.  The food is absolutely delicious and the chips and salsa that they give you while you wait for your order to arrive are to die for.  Up until recently, I have been a very loyal, frequent customer.  If it weren't for the food, this place would deserve 0 stars. However, in the past year or so I have noticed a severe decline in customer service.   The first time I really noticed was my birthday.  We had a party of about 7 and we ordered a lot of expensive food and drinks.  It wasn't even that late in the evening but our waiter started rushing us, hovering around the table, and clearing away plates and half-empty glasses of margarita before we were even finished.  It was a really annoying experience to have on my birthday. Just yesterday I made the mistake of choosing to make a reservation here for my boyfriend's birthday.  It was a party of 9 and we requested to be seated in a particular room that is quieter than the rest of the restaurant.  They said that they would make a note of that in our reservation.  When we arrived for our dinner, they said that they would not be able to seat us in that room because there was no note of our request.  IT THEN TOOK THEM 45 MINUTES TO SEAT US.  They finally ended up seating us in the room we'd requested since I made a fuss to the manager about what a crappy experience we were having. One last small thing...The waitstaff was definitely aware that it was my boyfriend's birthday as it was mentioned several times.  They typically give a special complimentary tequila shot to someone celebrating their birthday there and I saw this being done for someone else while we were eating,  however they skipped that for us. In conclusion, don't even think about about taking a large party here since they clearly don't like it.  In general you may want to consider a different restaurant if good service is important to you.
