I have to say this was the best steak ive ever had. Forget Peter Lugers, Im coming here from now on!! Everything came out so fricken good! I am the pickiest Tres Leches judge thanks to my mom being amazing at making it and i have to stay in the 2 years ive been here in jersey and the multiple spanish/latin restaurants i have come across this place beats everyone by a fucking mile with their Tres Leches. Its legit! I love this place. And its so cheap! **********NOTE************ Entrees are in portions for 2 people!!
