The first time I went there was with my son and I could not have brunch because at 1 PM I need to wait 2 hours. I asked if I could make reservation and they don't accept reservation it is a small place first comes first services. So today I decided to bring my daughter and I got there at 11:00. The place was not full and they still told me that it was the standard  2 hours of waiting. If you don't take reservation and nobody is waiting on line how could be. Really. We went to another place less attitude  and better food
