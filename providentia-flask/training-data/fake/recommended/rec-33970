Growing up I was always the one in the kitchen at slumber parties, baking cookies and throwing in weird ingredients like cantaloup and trying to make my friends eat them. Even as an adult I crunch up potato chips on my salad. This place takes that same spirit and actually makes it good. Maybe that's why it speaks to me. I love everything about this place. These guys are ignoring all the Brooklyn culinary rules, and it works. The odd combinations of food are sexy yet scientific, and always delicious. However, it's not the place to bring your dad visiting from Kansas who only eats steak and a baked potato.
