A friend introduced me to this place, as fantastic Italian food, in a great part of the neighborhood, that doesn't make your jaw drop when you get the check. Boy was she right! The atmosphere in here is friendly, casual. Even on a Tuesday night we had to wait 10 minutes for a seat. We got a bottle of Pinot Grigio, which was amazing. I has the spinach gnocchi, it tasted so good, the white sauce wasn't overbearingly thick or heavy, just light and flavorful. My friends had the potato gnocchi and the pasts special, which they both loved. Service was friendly and attentive. It is cash only, there's an ATM next door. It's not a big deal.
