Although it probably doesn't seem like it from the outside, Doc Magrogan's is surprisingly huge! My friend and I were led through a veritable labyrinth of hallways and different dining rooms before we were seating at a table near the back of the restaurant. Mondays are buck-a-shuck oyster days, where almost all of the oysters are $1 each. If you're not really sure what you're doing when it comes to oysters (like me), this is a great opportunity for you to try a variety of oysters for cheap. If you're a big fan of oysters, have fun stuffing your face. My friend and I took advantage of this special and tried 4 - 5 different kinds of oysters as a starter. Based on the recommendation of the server, I got the Wood-Grilled Ahi Tuna for my main entree. The dish was...not exactly what I was expecting. Take a large, raw piece of tuna steak, add a nice sear to the outside of it, and you have an idea of what the Wood-Grilled Ahi Tuna actually looks like. Taste-wise, the raw flavor inside the tuna steak combined with the grilled taste on the outside seemed a bit unusual to me. Although the dish wasn't awful, I kept feeling like I was eating an improperly prepared (and huge) piece of sashimi. The roasted tomato ragout and zucchini pappardelle were light but unmemorable. I really didn't get the impression that they contributed to the dish's overall flavor in any way. The service here was excellent. Our server was welcoming, helpful, and very attentive. While I kind of wish he recommended a more satisfying entree to me, I can't fault him for trying to help me out. My main dish aside, Doc Magrogan's still offers an excellent seafood dining experience on Penn's campus. I'd definitely go back on a Monday to try some more $1 oysters.
