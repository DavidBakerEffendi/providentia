I am a huge sushi snob. I did not expect much when I ordered their food but it was even worse than I thought and I am sitting in me room now frankly rather annoyed and amazed at how bad it was. The rice was god awful, almost sweet. The fish was not particularly well cut and it took forever to get. Save your money for when you go to a real sushi joint.
