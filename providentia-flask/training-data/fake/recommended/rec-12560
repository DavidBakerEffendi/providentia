Great place to go for a late night drink or meal - I'm a bit biased since I'm a regular, but you should really stop by! Food wise: Brunch is amazing, the shrimp and grits comes in a big portion, but don't plan on sharing .. it's that good! For dinner, if you are starving: try the soup (it is more like stew, filled with brisket, mussles, etc.), if you are Â trying to not intimidate your date: the rice and beans is a great option (the name doesnt do it justice). They recently started a late night menu: fantastic .. and you won't regret it as much in the morning as you would that slice of Artichoke Pizza .. Drink menu: Duck Buck is a winner! And they always keep the Gennesse well stocked. I'm looking forward to seeing what sort of seasonal drinks they come up with this summer : ) Everyone who works there is so friendly and they give great recommendations! They are constantly adding things to the menu, so if you love something, let them know. Check them out next time you are in the neighborhood!
