The bread is great. But if that's all most people can say about this restaurant, then it means the restaurant's food needs a little improvement. The pastas are usually in thick sauces and the sandwiches are mediocre. I usually just come here for the cheap margaritas and bread. And the crayons that are provided for immature college students like me and my friends to scribble profanities and sketch inappropriate images on the construction paper tablecloth. It's okay, for a relatively quick, effortless meal in town, Molly's is satisfactory.
