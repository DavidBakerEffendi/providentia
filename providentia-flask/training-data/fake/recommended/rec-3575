Oh, Tom's! Get in my mouth!!! I brought a boy here early one morning, and his immediate reaction upon walking in was, "YES." I couldn't agree more. The decor is kitschy and charming, and apparently pleasing to even the most curmudgeonly of male companions. The food is good, solid diner food, which is basically all I want in life. Breakfast, and lots of it. I've never tried their famous pancakes, but I hear they're to die for. You can tell they take care and pride in their food preparation. The staff is super sweet and quick to force delightful little samples on you if you happen to wait more than five minutes for anything, which is rare. (I hear it gets pretty packed for weekend brunch, though, but trust me, it's worth it.) Great for groups and families, too!
