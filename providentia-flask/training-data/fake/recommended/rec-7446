Skipped the large plates on my visit for two and ended up just getting small plates to munch on to go with out drinks. The Sizzling Sisig was amazing. It reminded me of a upgraded traditional Taiwanese dish I used to have at home. Make sure to have it with some coconut rice though as it is very flavorful and savory. The Quail Adobo and the Grilled Pork Jowl were good but not terribly interesting. As for drinks, make sure to get the PX Puko, a blend of coconut water, sherry, whiskey bitters that comes in a freaking coconut with a stick of sugar cane to boot. Absolutely fantastic
