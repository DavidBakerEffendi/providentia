Was in Philly for New Years Eve and went to this place the next night for dinner. It was a few blocks away from my hotel. When me and boyfriend entered we instantly knew we'd be waiting for a bit..It was busy..but not so much in a bad way..There was still room to breathe..the hostess took our names and we went over to the bar to get some drinks.. While sipping on one of the best margaritas I've ever had (Pink Cadillac I heart you!!!) I took the time to look around..The atmosphere and decor is very cool and different (They have a tricked out bicycle in the middle of the bar! Definitely a must see)..We didn't have to wait too long for our table (Or maybe I was too much into my new best friend Pink Cadillac to notice :-P ) Once seated we surveyed the menu and I decided on the Chicken and Cheese Enchilada and my boyfriend got the Beef Tacos..We loved our food! Just the right portion to have us both stuffed and both our plates empty. Service overall was great here..Friendly and welcoming. I will definitely be going back :-)
