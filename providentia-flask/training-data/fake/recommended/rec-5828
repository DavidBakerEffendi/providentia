This is by far my most favorite hang out bar...mostly because I was first introduced to Stella here. It's a great neighborhood bar and since I lived down the street for many years, I was always a loyal customer! They have great burgers, a good beer selection and a friendly staff. I also like that the crowd on any given night is always mixed--all ages makes for a lot of fun times. And their jukebox always has good selections. The weekends it gets super crowded and a lot of people from the neighborhood hang out there...always a good time! You should def check it out!
