My first foray into Italian dining in NY was a disappointing one. I had such high hopes and I know this isn't Manhattan so perhaps that is the difference here but I wasn't all that impressed. I had the gnocchi in butter sage sauce. The gnocchi itself was ok but the sauce was really bland. When I think of a butter sage sauce I envision browned butter, large crispy pieces of sage maybe some garlic and white wine but this was literally melted yellow butter with small slivers of sage and that's about it. At least, that's what it tasted like. I had a bite of the girlfriends red pasta (don't remember the dish) and it was mediocre as well. Nothing was really bad, it's just that I feel unless you live on the same street, you can find better options in NY. The prices were ok but they were also cash only.
