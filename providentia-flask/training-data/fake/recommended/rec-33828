Hidden neighborhood gem in Brooklyn Heights. Really easy to get to as it is right off of the Clark St. 2 and 3 train station stop. Don't let the bridges or tunnels stop you from enjoying a quiet Weekday night dinner at Iron Chef House. Prices are very reasonable and the food is amazing. The lotus root appetizer is great way to start the meal. The special rolls are usually your best bet for the buc. Two special rolls and an appetizer and you should be more than satisfied. Â Spicy lobster roll recommended. No complaints about the decor and service either. Very zen and peaceful atmosphere where you can just relax and enjoy some fresh sushi.
