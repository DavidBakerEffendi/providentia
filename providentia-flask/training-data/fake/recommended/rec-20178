***This is a review of the new Bier Haus next door*** I was really excited to try the new Bier Haus. I've always had a good time at Nurnberger, be it inside or during the warmer months in their outdoor biergarden. The inside of the Bier Hall is beautiful, with a lot of dark wood and German decor. The beer list is excellent, with many good European choices. Don't come here wanting a Bud Light, because there are so many good authentic beers to try. The kitchen was serving a limited menu, but the pretzels my friends and I tried were very good and were served with two excellent mustards. The fried pickles were not as good because they fried up a whole spear, instead of using pickle chips. I look forward to my next drinking adventure here.
