Pictures of cute dogs cover the walls of this bar that serves food. The food is very good with a surprising level of finish for the environment. The good dog burger is really good-a burger stuffed with Roquefort cheese, served with sweet potato & regular potato fries. The fried cheese squares are also great, but when is fried cheese bad?
