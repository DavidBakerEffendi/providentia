Cute cozy restaurant- but not much seating! I tried the bronte burger. I loved the crisp ciabatta bread, and the sweet chili flavors- not your typical burger. The only downside was the meat patty, which sort of reminded me school lunchroom mystery meat. The side salad was delicious with the tangy vinagrette dressing. Next time, I would return for the $1 beer before 7pm.. sounds like a good deal!
