Good lord, this place is the cat's pajamas. I had the crepe berg√®re, my companion had the crepe normande, and we both sat silently as we savored each fantastic bite. It doesn't hurt the owners/servers are super sweet and friendly, and the decor is perfect for brunch/lunch. If you're hungry in Williamsburg, Pates should be at the top of the list.
