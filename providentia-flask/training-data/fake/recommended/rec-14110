The line might seem frightening, but it really does move. We got a party of twelve in without too much trouble at all. Pizza damn good. Chewy, thin crust just the way I like it. And the toppings stay put on it unlike other places I've been. Customer service is a bit brisk, but it's a mad house in there so I can't really blame the staff. Don't expect a nice relaxing meal, only really tasty pizza.
