I base most of my out of town food choices on Yelp and its places like Devil's Alley that assure me my reliance is not misplaced. We started with the Fried green tomatoes. To be honest, this was my first time having fired green tomatoes though I'm not sure how any other place could to better. They were perfectly fried with a delicious marinara sauce topped with yummy cheddar cheese. Wow. The dish itself isn't mind blowing, the ingredients are nothing exotic but the total combination was out of this world. For dinner I had the dry rub wings and a side of the mac and cheese. The wings were tremendous. Expertly seasoned and cooked perfectly cooked. The mac and cheese was good - but not amazing. I'm a fan of S'Mac on NYC's lower east side where Mac and Cheese is what they do. While that may not be a good comparison, you can't argue with good food. Overall I would defiantly go back next time I'm in Philly.
