This place's motto is "I will definitely sex you up" ((true story)) and boy do they deliver. Very cozy place, super sexy and perfect for those lonely and cold winter nights (ladies can I get a heyyyy). The place is ALWAYS packed which is a bit of a bitch but if you're privileged enough to know Daniel, the chillest and cutest Mexican manager ever, then you're good to go. Literally, if you're an attractive twenty year old girl with a brain and actually can line up a conversation, you'll get a taste of their best cocktails for free: morning rhum, mimosa twist, their Bloody Mary , their little bee cocktail made from vodka or even Magdalena which is a pear egg white tequila heaven... INCRE√çBLE. But now for the part that you're most likely reading this for... Food; it's great American dishes but for once; properly portioned! This ain't the Cheesecake Factory if you know what I mean. I highly recommend their avocado toast special for brunch. Their specials are usually on point and tasty. Their sausages are thick and yummy. Great salads - ladies they do kale - and pretty much your usual eggs brunch dishes but soo nicely put together and the eggs are never overcooked! Great atmosphere, great music, great bartenders and waiters -- overall a great experience that makes you feel at home and makes you forget you're living in a toxic city. I give this place an AMEN.
