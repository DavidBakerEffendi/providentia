I really liked this place, even thought it was slightly hard to find. My friend and i met here for an early dinner on a Saturday night, it was empty and still the waiter refused to let us sit in a 4top, so we had to sit by the door, thank god there was no blast of cold air. There was only 1 other table in there, so we could have sat anywhere. We ordered and got our food pretty quick. My pasta came with the best roasted tomatoes ever! yummy The place is pretty basic, good place to grab a bite if your in tribeca.But not really worth going out of your way to get to. The place is quite small and i would hate to be there if they got overly busy, there would be no room. On the upside the place is so small that you can actually see the guys cooking it in the kitchen, gives the place a very homey feel. And at $58 for 2 meals, 2 glasses of wine, and 2 desserts , i will def be back! P.S they don't take cards, cash only, thank goodness Bank Of America is directly across the street!
