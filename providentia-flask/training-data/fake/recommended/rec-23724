This review is based solely on the falafel sandwich platter. The sandwich as a whole is good, but I'm not a fan of the falafel itself. Mine was heavy, pasty, and possibly undercooked. The texture was entirely unappealing, almost wet inside. The flavor was not much better. It was super salty, and the parsley is way too dominant. At first, I thought it was just a cooking mistake, but then I remembered that I had this sandwich once before, and the falafel was a problem then too. The condiments (pickles, tomatoes, lettuce, sauce), wrap, and fries are excellent. Â I will definitely give this truck another try, but will get a shwarma sandwich next time. The service is pretty friendly.
