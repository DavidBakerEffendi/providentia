Joya=Thai place with a DJ. For the Thai food, it gets 5 stars, it was almost a perfect representation of what I've eaten in Thailand, except for the portion sizes (bigger of course). For the DJ, it gets -1. No offense to the DJ, he was a good DJ, there is just something unsettling about listening to loud house music while I'm eating. The Kang Panang Gai is my favorite, it's extremely spicey-hot. A delicious Fire in your mouth. My husband (heehe) had the Pad See Yue and it was very delicious as well (not spicy). Prices are excellent.
