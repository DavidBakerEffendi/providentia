I came here with a friend one weekday morning to avoid the line of their weekend brunches.  We had been looking forward to it given that so many people have raved to us about this place. When we walked in, were were welcomed by the warm feeling of the restaurant.  The staff was very friendly and were were promptly seated at a table (remember this was a weekday for lunch).  The restaurant was an escape from the cold NYC streets into a small, quiet cafe.  My friend and I both welcomed the rustic, casual ambiance. We had heard great things about their breakfast and brunch options, but because we were visiting around lunch, their lunch menu was offered to us.  We ended up getting the When Veggie Met Sally salad and a grilled cheese with artichoke hearts.  Both were delicious!  I don't know if I would have waited an hour and a half as some others have commented waiting on the weekends, but it was good and we were happy given that there was no wait. In general, my friend and I were both pleased with the service and the food at Penelope's.  We are looking forward to coming back for a brunch sometime in the very near future.
