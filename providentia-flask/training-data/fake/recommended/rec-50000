I'm glad I found this place.  The number of sushi places that I would eat at in this area is little to none.  I saw this place on Yelp and it had a lot of good reviews so I figured I'd give it a shot. At first glance the location and exterior is nothing to write home about.  It's right across the street from the train station.  Once you go in you'll find yourself in some cramped quarters as well.  The tables and the rugs are kind of worn out.  I'm sure this place can be uncomfortable to eat in once it gets packed.  For that reason I knocked it down to 3 stars. On the filp side, the sushi was good.  It's nothing like eating at Oyako Tso or Hotoke, but for a local sushi dive, it's good.  I had rock shrimp as an appetizer that had an amazing glaze on them, followed by a spicy shrimp roll and a philadelphia roll.  It's a BYOB but for some reason they have a bunch of bottles of liquor lined up behind the sushi bar.   The bill came out to about 50 bucks for 2 people.  5 rolls, and an appetizer.  Not a bad price in my opinion, but there are other sushi restaurants that offer better rolls for the same price. Overall this is a great location if you are local and don't feel like driving just to have a couple of rolls.  It's not amazing, and it's definitely not bad.  It's just good.  A gem for locals. Go here.
