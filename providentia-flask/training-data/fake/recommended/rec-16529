"You look good, you lost weight." - Pedro the server. Needless to say, I come here a lot. My visits were even more frequent before I starting being more healthy. But still enough for the servers to notice my weight change lol. Corner bistro makes the best no frills burger in town. The burgers are small, juicy and perfectly seasoned. The fries are great too. And get a McSorley with that burger. This place isn't fancy, it feels like a dive bar but it gets the job done. Prepare to wait in line it'll be worth the wait and the calories! It is better to come during the week as the wait may be over 30 mins in the weekend.
