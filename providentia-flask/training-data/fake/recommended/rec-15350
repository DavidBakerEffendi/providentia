I went there today for lunch. We were recommeded this place by a local and stopped in. The guy working had his job down like the back of his hand. He knew his stuff and knew our whole 7-person order without writing anything down. He whipped up cheesesteaks, fries, drinks and chicken strips all within 5 minutes. He directed us to the "Out of Towner" special that gives you everything that you'd want if you came to Philly to eat a cheesesteak sandwich. You get a cheesesteak with "whiz" and fries. You can add grilled onions and peppers if you want. If you don't want Cheese Whiz, he has a cheddar/colby jack mix he can use. But whiz is best tasting/worse for you. It's a trade off. Locals came in and talked with this guy. He knew different people and was very friendly. Be sure to check out of the language guides on the menu. They tell you what to say in shorthand rather than spelling it all out in long sentences. You can order a full meal in about five words.
