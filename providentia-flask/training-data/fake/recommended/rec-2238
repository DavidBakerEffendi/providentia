Fucking crack. that's what this place is, pure crack cocaine in all of its bloody good addictiveness. I went to New York for my new years celebration, and went to this cart on the first night of my trip. There were a group of us on our little escapade, and we just had to see what all the fuss was about. Chicken and rice? It couldn't be that good could it? Well, it fucking was. Let me tell you, the second night of our vacation, we went back again, but this time, each of us ordered two servings of combo (chicken, beef) and rice (extra white sauce please, and hold the lettuce!), and so our chicken and rice vacation went. I'm back home in California now, and after eating chicken and rice at least once a day while in New York, I must say, I think I am having withdrawals... A fair warning, the line is long, but it's worth the wait. Get extra white sauce, but unless you want your tongue burned off, sample the hot sauce before pouring a whole cupful onto your chicken and rice (I did it and was sweating after a few bites--that still didn't stop me from eating the whole thing of course). The servings are large, and on the first night we split two chicken and rices between four people and it was plenty. If you're on a tight schedule while in New York, forget the statue of liberty, just go get yourself some chicken and rice **Edit: I have just received news that my friend will be going to New York and returning to California with some chicken and rice for me in January. Thank the heavens!!! She just saved me a three hundred dollar flight. update again: she didn't bring me my chicken and rice. we are no longer friends because of it... kidding.
