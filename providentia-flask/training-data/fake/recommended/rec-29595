Without a doubt one of the best Italian meals I have evet had at a restaurant. Went with a family of 4 and the menu was large enough for everyone to have multiple choices. The portions were generous and the risotto was so chocked full of seafood we had left overs. To top it off, the service was warm and friendly and the prices very reasonable. Could not have had a better experience.
