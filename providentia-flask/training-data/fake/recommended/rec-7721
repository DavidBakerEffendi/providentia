I am terrified of head cheese, as is my mother.  So, being a massive douche, I ordered us the Lam'bretta and a Super Cub Classic, sans head cheese.  The guy working the register replied, "Are you sure?  The head cheese makes the sandwich.  Do you want to taste it first?"  So, we figured, what the heck?  We took him up on the offer.  The delicately thin slices of meat he gave us looked nothing like the floating bits of meat in gelatin that I so despise.  It was light and spotted with various shades of pink.  The taste reminded me of a less dense version of kielbasa.  Excellent.  We ordered a Super Cub WITH head cheese. Super Cub Classic:  Considering there is four types of pork in this sandwich, it was not as meaty-tasting as I was expecting because the slices were paper thin.  It was surprisingly light with many layers of flavor, best appreciated by chewing slowly and savoring the bite.  However, it would've been better with a little more meat on it. Lam'bretta:  Holy moly, words cannot describe the explosion of flavor and spice that filled my mouth upon the first bite.  The spicy mayo on the carrots blends perfectly with the curried grease dripping out of the tender lamb shavings into the warmed, crusty bread. Basil Limeade Fizz:  Refreshingly citrusy with a delicate fragrance of basil.  I would love one of these on a hot summer day. Iced Lychee Green Tea:  Tastes exactly like lychee in liquid form.  It had a full-bodied flavor and was very interesting.  I'm not a huge lychee fan, so I obviously preferred the limeade.  But, I can see a lychee lover relishing this drink. Overall, really really excellent and unique sandwiches and drinks.  The staff is also incredibly nice and clearly care about their food.  I have every intention of returning to try their whole menu.
