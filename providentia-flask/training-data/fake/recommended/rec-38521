Since we had a few things at happy hour, my friend and I shared a mushroom burger, fries, and a frozen custard (the Rittenhouse Concrete). The fries were very good. The burger was okay, but I must say the custard was the winner. I would only go back if there was no line, like when we went. Not sure why people would wait over an hour for this place. Maybe we're spoiled b/c we have In-n-Out here :)
