Part of my "Best of Burlington" list.  Guess what people?  They don't serve any beer here but their own.  So suck it up uncultured Budweiser drinkers and indulge in something different (and I don't mean Zima).   If you're a total pussy the staff will tell you what each of their beers are comparable to.  Of course that's ridiculous because VPB's beers are far superior than any of their domestic mass market counterparts.  If you like beer, even a little, prepare yourself for a religious experience of wheat and hops.  Go ahead and get the 3oz sampler set if you've never been here before.   Regarding the food:  VPB is pub food at its finest.  The menu is HUGE.  I can sincerely say that I dine here for the food just about (but not quite) as much as I do for the beer.  As far as I'm concerned, you never visited Burlington if you didn't stop by VPB while on your trip.
