So, 2nd day it's open I went, so I will definitely say that it was new, but the staff was working hard to learn and know their stuff, which I appreciated. This is the Van Leeuwan crew, and they have ties to Aussie culture, and if there is one place Aussies love; it's Bali, and missing from the New York scene was a Balinese restaurant. So  the cuisine, similar to Indian, Thai and Creole has been made with utmost care by a growing food micro empire. Now for the food: We started with the Prawn and Fish Satay, which was a mixture of both ingredients in a smooth , sausage like shape. Skewered on Lemongrass and served with a chutney-like Tamarind sauce, it was fantastic The Beef Rendang was described as "toothsome", and that was a very accurate description. Rich, complex, falling apart beef with rice or roti. I suggest the rice   The other entree` was the Lemongrass Fish Curry, which had noodles at the bottom. This curry disappointed compared to the other items. With a Lemongrass dish, you typically expect bright notes, and this had very little if any. It was a more of a melding of flavors that while delicious, could be much more. I did not have the coffee, but I know it is a high end machine used for Toby's Estate coffee, espresso and other barista drinks. Overall, the only reason I can wait to go back, is that the line food-centric Brooklynites eagerly waiting outside. Expect this line to grow, along with its press; especially as this place finds it stride. Looking forward to sneaking in again!
