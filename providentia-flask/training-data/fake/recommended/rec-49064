Great Korean food... its as authentic as restaurant food gets.  I had the  beef soft tofu soup, and it was great. It wasn't overly spicy or too saturated with MSG.  You could taste tons of flavor. The side items was great as well.  The kim chi wasn't over fermented and still crunchy, as well as the cucumber.  I also really enjoyed the fish cakes.  I also tried the chicken skewers, which I didn't care for, because it was drenched in teriyaki sauce. FYI, they don't have the grills here, everything is prepared for you. So, good food that you don't have to work for.
