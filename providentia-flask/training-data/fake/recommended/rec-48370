One of the staple restaurants on the constantly reworked rotation of Park Slope eateries. Very good service, fantastic Austrian-Germanic grub, and a relaxed and very comfortable bar. Very consistent and usually full. A great place to eat or imbibe scrumptious German brews from the tab. Always a good rotation of tunes, to boot.
