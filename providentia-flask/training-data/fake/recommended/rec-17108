I came here after my cousin's graduation and wow I was impressed. The only flaw was while we were waiting to get seated along with others we had to wait by the steps which caused an annoyance to many people including the workers who worked there. Other than that the quality of the food was amazing. If you haven't been here, I suggest you go. Did I forget to mention BYOB?
