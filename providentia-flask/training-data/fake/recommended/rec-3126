It's getting harder to find home style Puerto Rican restaurants in NYC but Casa Adele is going strong. We had the mofongo with pernil and tostones. They really hit the spot. They even had some local folks playing drums and singing traditional songs. I am giving them 4 stars because no one's pernil or rice and beans is as savory as my mother-in-law's. We have found our new regular haunt in the city after the closure of Papasito's in midtown.
