Outstanding dinner! Gourmet dining. Had the lamp chop. Wife had the swordfish.  Compliments to the chef and the staff!  We came 30 minutes earlier than scheduled (no traffic when u r walking from the subway). Preference of seats by the hostess and seating us by the front door was NOT ok, but was not a deal breaker. Cannot brag enough about the dinner that night.  Did get busy later as the evening progressed.  Good luck to you chef on  reopening your atlantic city location and the cleanup after Sandy.
