Absolutely fantastic. Addictive grilled eggplants and super crunchy falafels. Garlic sauce is also unique. New go to place if you're looking for vegetarian options!! You can add as many toppings as you want, and the portions are generous. It's my second time at Pitaziki (got the rice bowls both times) and I definitely intend to come back for their namesake!
