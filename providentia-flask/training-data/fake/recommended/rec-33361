Can't think of what I'd want more out of a Sunday brunch.  What a great spot.  The breakfast pizza was delicious, and absurdly filling (eggs, bacon, arugula leaves, parmesan).  Nice beer selection too.  My wife had a granola thing that was really good.  We also had a side of roasted cauliflower that was out of this world.  Staff was friendly, and the decor was very clean and open.  I also really enjoyed watching the chefs in the open kitchen.  The price was definitely fair for a Sunday brunch, and I'd definitely go back.
