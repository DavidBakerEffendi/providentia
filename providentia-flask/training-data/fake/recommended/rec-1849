Delicious and cheap. That's what good Chinese food should be.  We weren't that hungry so we just got the spicy tendons app and the duck noodles. The tendon is sliced paper thin and flavored well...it was a little too salty for my taste, but still good.  The heat doesn't get to you until you've had a few bites of it. We got the noodles razor cut and they soaked up most of the soup before we were half way through the bowl. Nevertheless it was still delicious. Next time we'll get the regular hand pulled variety.  One thing though...an hour we were so thirsty we both downed a liter of water.
