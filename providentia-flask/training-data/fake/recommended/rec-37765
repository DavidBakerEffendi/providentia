Visiting from Charleston and we stopped to eat at this corner bistro. Walking in we saw plates of fresh vegetables that had been roasted waiting to be served. It is a small corner spot and we had to wait but so glad we did. We ordered a pork ragu fettuccini, meatballs and a sopressata pizza. The fettuccini was fresh and the pork ragu had a dense tomato sauce with chunks of pork and just sweet enough. The meatballs were equally spiced with pork and veal and stuffed with ricotta. The spices were spot on and not overwhelming. Pizza we'll if you like bubbly crust and fresh mozzarella then dive in. We were full but wanted something sweet so we topped it off with tiramisu, perfect creamy melt in your Â mouth deliciousness. Amazing meal and great service. You will enjoy the ambiance and walk away feeling satisfied.
