Nooooo.... Zento... what happened? The former owners must have sold the business, because now that it's in a new location it is unrecognizable. Not just for the interior -- I could forgive the too-dark nightclub lighting, the TV screen hovering above my date's head, and the elbow-to-elbow tight seating plan, if the sushi were good. But no. Everything was wrong. 1. The sushi bar has been relegated to a back room somewhere. Maybe in the weird, low-ceiling basement kitchen? So I don't even know if the original chefs are still there. 2. The wait staff were unprofessional. The hostess basically ignored us until some guy (the manager?) told her to find us a table. Our waitress had a cold and rubbed her nose with her hands... just after carrying food to our table. Gross! It was impossible to get anyone's attention until they arrived with the next dish. 3. The food was not good, not at all. This is not the Zento I once knew. I had the Groupon for the tasting menu, and it was so not worth it. The dishes were plain and uninspired. And the sushi... gristly tuna, boring rolls, basically on par with average-quality supermarket takeout sushi. I was really looking forward to going back to Zento after being away for a while, but sadly the Zento I once knew is gone forever.
