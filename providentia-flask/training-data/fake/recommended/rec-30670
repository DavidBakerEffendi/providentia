Transcendant! I was here for a wedding 6 course dinner, and they certainly take perfection very seriously . Snow pea and snow crap soup. The use of tarragon and saffron! The omnipresent lobster! The lavender and vanilla infused lamb. The molten chocolate, the banana marzipan wedding cake. The warm address from the twinkley-eyed David Bouley himself. I was swooning from more than Chateau Margaux by the end of the evening. But to take respite from the cavernous acoustics of the wine cellar, the restrooms are sexy boudoir style. Bouley makes me rethink all other star ratings bestowed to restaurants. This was *beyond*.
