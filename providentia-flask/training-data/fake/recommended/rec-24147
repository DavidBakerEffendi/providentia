I'm not a person who goes out often, but when I do, I think of Yaki, as it was the place my friends and I visited the most during our high school years and into college. Their food is solid, even if it's not out of this world, and I do enjoy their okonomiyaki(seafood pancake) very much. I've had their mini ramen, which has slightly false advertising, as there is no meat in it, and nothing special but still filling when you're not very hungry. Their udon gets the same review as ramen, though no false advertising there. Their katsudon left me wondering if katsudon really tastes like that, in which, if so, I would just stick with a chicken or pork katsu bento box. I like my fried food crunchy. I do find that the bento box is somewhat expensive, but it is very filling and good, so I still think its partially worth it....? Maybe. Their yakitoris are pretty good, and my brother is in love with their bacon and quail eggs, especially on Tuesdays, with their specials. I don't remember if they used to have fried oysters on the menu, but that is one thing I'm looking forward to trying the next time I'm there. As for karaoke. It seems the standard type of station used in most karaoke places. Nothing special, nothing out of this world, just good old karaoke with friends where no one judges when you're behind closed doors, right? I don't know how often they update, and I don't keep up with music much, but when I look for a new song, at least it's usually already there. The only thing is, if you overstay your welcome, they will come in and turn off your machine while you are in the middle of singing and take away the mics. I know they're running a business, but there must be a better way to go about this?
