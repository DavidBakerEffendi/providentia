A group of four went to this place after a Broadway show. I selected the restaurant based solely on the awesome reviews by given by other Yelpers. I love the decor-- the planks of wood combined with quaint country furniture and finished with harsh metals and corrugated steel really set the place off. And I really loved the bathroom. The place is kind of small, and I wouldn't bother trying to fit a party larger than four to six in it. The four of us were seated at the large table in the front of the restaurant. The waitress immediately took our drink orders and had them ready and on the table with in a matter of minutes. The wait staff was also really friendly and helpful with making selections (specials or menu items). We ordered three appetizers: the papaya salad, the vegetarian spring rolls and the special crab and pork fried wontons-- and all were excellent. Three of the four of us got the curried chicken noodle special. It was braised chicken in a red curry sauce served on top of home made flat egg noodles. I found the portions were the perfect size for their price-- sometimes in NYC you spend a lot of money for almost nothing. The fourth person got pork and shrimp wok dish which they said was really good. For desert we tried the taro root/pumpkin special. I wasn't expecting balls (they called them dumplings) of pumpkin and tapioca with julienned taro floating in coconut milk (i was assuming it'd be more like a taro and pumpkin in a fried dumpling of some sort). It wasn't bad, just wasn't what I was expecting. My only complaint (if you want to call it that) is that I love my Thai food super (hot) spicy, and I think despite me asking for it really (hot) spicy, they cooked it for a typical American. Fortunately they have a condiment tray on every table where you can kick it up a few levels on your own. I highly recommend it if you love Thai food, and I would definitely return.
