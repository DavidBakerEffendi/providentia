Where do I begin? My hubby and I (me being half Puerto-Rican and he 100%) have been on the hunt for good Puerto Rican food since we moved to NJ almost 10 years ago. We are from NY and well...nuff said! I was put on to this place by a friend who lives in the area and OMG! This place is wonderful! Now, I must warn you, you will not get much by way of atmosphere. It is very simple. But if you have been to Puerto Rico, you would see many places like this. There isn't much put into the decor of the place, but the food and service more than makes up for it. They play great salsa also! My hubby always has the Pernil Asado with Tostones and being the health consious person I am, I had the Pollo Isleno :) Hubby is very picky about his pernil, but he said it was delicious. Well seasoned and juicy. My chicken was also well seasoned and juicy and the salad was fresh. We brought my father-in-law here once, who lives in PR and he was very satisfied. That says a lot! The service is also great. From the owner to the wait staff, everyone is always friendly and accommodating. And the prices are average. Not cheap, but not expensive either. A bonus is that you can rent this place out for parties! Overall, we LOVE this place and will come back again and again.
