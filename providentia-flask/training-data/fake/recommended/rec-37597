I hadn't planned to end up here tonight but nonetheless, after a full day of walking around the city, one of my friends suggested we come in for drinks. What an experience! The decor is equal parts backyard, front porch, and hunting lodge. The drink menu, specifically the whiskey selection, was expansive. After two hours of sipping I finally had enough of fighting the delicious smells coming from the kitchen, so I ordered 1/2lb of pulled pork and a few ribs to split with a friend. The pork was moist and flavorful, and the ribs were well-seasoned and fell off the bone. Really the only disappointment was the sauce selection - the hot sauce wasn't particularly hot, and the sweet sauce left us wanting a little more. I found that adding some vinegar to the sweet sauce put it right where it needed to be. Had the bacon brownie for dessert - the bacon added some texture and a little flavor but it wasn't overpowering. Location is great - just around the corner from the Girard stop on the El - so between the good food and accessible location, I'll definitely be back.
