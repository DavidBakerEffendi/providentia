I may be the odd one out on this, however, I have had two expereinces at JTH and both were poor. The first was for dinner with friends. The waiter was pre-occupied and seemed concerned with every table but ours. This meant the service was slow and left much lacking. That said, it was not enough to make me not come back. So, on to my second try. My sister and I stopped in on a Sunday for brunch. She ordered a sticky bun. Hair in it. Not on it, IN IT. Blonde to be specific. Ok, we thought maybe it was fate's way of telling us we didn't need to order the bun. On to our meals. Took a while to recieve them, but who minds? It's Sunday. We ordered an omelette and burger. The burger? Hair in it. AGAIN. Appetite lost. Absolutely gross. Just for reference, neither of us have blonde hair. My sister happens to work in the service industry and so she didn't want to complain. I decided to leave a commment on the card that was included in the bill folder. That was a waste. Never heard back from anyone. Generally, I have found the service to be lacking, rude, and frazzled. The food isn't that good to warrant such experiences. Good luck to all who decide to dine here. Just make sure you check your food.
