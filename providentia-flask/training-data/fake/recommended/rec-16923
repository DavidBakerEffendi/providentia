I found this place on groupon and i love it because it has my friend name.. The atmosphere is very intimate i love the mood, the service was not so great but once we got our appetizers we forgot all about it.. Amazing food our drinks where delicious and the main entr√©e was beyond any description. I had a great time with my friends i will def come back, only part was finding parking and the parking that we found around the corner was pretty pricey we paid 29 dollars for 1hr and 40min but it's the city so it was not that surprising., what i loves the most was the amazing view of the Empire State Building once u walk outside the restaurant was definitely worth the parking fee . Make sure you make your reservations as the place has limited sitting space..
