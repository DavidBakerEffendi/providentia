Before having even eaten here, I deduct 2 stars for the name alone. Is it just me or does the word Degustation have a not-so-appetizing ring to it? Anyway, decided against the tasting menu and went a la carte instead. Here's where Degustation went right: --Croquetas--kind of hard for fried balls of anything not to taste good --Seasonal Salad--fresh veggies, nice variety --Octopus--cooked really well, thai red curry sauce was a nice complement --Lamb--definitely one of my favorites, must try --Foie gras--rich and delicious And here's where Degustation went wrong: --Crudo--the scallop was great, but the crudo additions (avocado, corn nuts, corn) I found to be too heavy and not refreshing whatsoever. Not citrusy enough --Cheese course--I was disappointed they only gave us one type of cheese to try. While it was good, I expected some variety. Aaaand I found hair on the plate :-/ --Vanilla ice cream/french toast--eh, desserts were ok The atmosphere was nice and the waiters were very friendly. However, given the size of the kitchen and only a couple chefs working, prepare to wait a little while for food to come out. I'd be interested to go back and see what the tasting menu is like.
