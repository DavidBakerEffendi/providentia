After a shopping-filled day in the West Village, my friend suggested Corner Bistro for a late lunch.  She'd been there once before, and said it was great, so I knew I'd be a fan. The menu is very straight-forward - a few selections on a bulletin-board (with those clip-on like letters).  $6.75 for the Bistro Burger (bacon cheeseburger)?!  Sold!  We split an order of fries ($2.50), and each indulged in a McSorley's: I had the ale, friend had the dark ($2.50 each). Within mere minutes of ordering, our food was on the table and piping hot.  In fact, I'd stepped outside to make a phone call, and by the time I actually reached who I needed to speak to, my friend was motioning to me through the window that our food was there already! The burgers weren't huge, but rather just the right size for a refueling lunch.  And they were damn tasty.  Mine was cooked to medium-rare perfection.  Tons of crispy bacon added to the deliciousness.  The fries weren't anything spectacular, but hey, I love fries of any kind. It's cash only, so be sure to have some on hand.  We arrived at the right time, and were able to snag a table upon entering.  But when we were leaving, there were clusters of people eyeing all the tables, eagerly waiting to snatch one up for themselves.  So, be prepared for a wait.
