*** I will remove this review if they remove the awful pork chop from the menu. *** FOOD It's very possible that this restaurant is great (it probably is, given the other great reviews), but they must take care to remove menu items that stay on people's plates. Three out of the four of us had the pork chop. Or, well, we tried to have it. It's basically a huge, dry chunk of misery in an insanely salty mess of overdone greens, and came with a rancid-tasting chunk of pork belly. I LOVE pork belly and this piece made me feel ill. The egg on top was supposed to be truffled, but it tasted like a bland fried egg. I'm a glutton and I couldn't get past the first third of my meal. The server noticed how put off I was. I thought my father and brother liked theirs, but it turns out they just didn't want to make a scene. They agree it was one of the worst plates they have ever been served. On a bad day, I cook better than this, no exaggeration. And I'm not a very good cook. This was actually the worst plate of food I have had in a restaurant in years, regardless of pricing. Sadly, the price tag added insult to injury. SERVICE The service was great - funny, attentive, constant - but terrible food is terrible food. Service gets 4/5 stars: I'm removing one star because they didn't do anything to make our misery better, but then again there wasn't much they could have done outside of giving us entirely new entr√©es. It's not fair to them. Chef, send them out with edible food! DECOR Gorgeous interior, classy. Unexpectedly poppy/90s music that kind of clashes with the decor instead of making the place hip, but it's really lovely overall.
