We went to Prime 16 on a Sunday afternoon, the bar was busy but with room. The beer selection was very good. I wish they had told us they did flights of beer, we ended up trying about 5 beers and it would have been nice if they offered that when they realized we wanted to try a few different  beers.  I ended up asking due to the fact I saw people trying little glasses of beer and thought, hey do they offer flights. We had wings and an artichoke dip, both were great. I will go back and have a burger, the couple next to us had great looking burgers.
