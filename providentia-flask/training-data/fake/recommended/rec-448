Get to the Chase: Pros: 1) Being a burger fiend, I had high hopes, and they delivered! 2) Out of curiosity I also tried the Ahi Tuna burger with wasabi flakes...which was absolutely delicious! So it's not just a beef joint...it's an all round star! 3) Service was quick 4) Staff was informative, friendly and to the point 5) Accommodated a table for 11 with a 40 min wait on a Saturday...not bad 6) Fun atmosphere, great vibes, and glad the tables were not sticky given how many greasy burgers were ordered 7) Not ridiculously priced, very reasonable for some downright good comfort food Cons: 1) Popularity brings long wait times...which can't be helped
