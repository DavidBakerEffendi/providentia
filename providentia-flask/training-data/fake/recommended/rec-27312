The only reason I didn't give five stars is because I failed at ordering a little bit with the barbacoa - definitely underwhelming - but that was completely our fault in not asking the waitress for recommendations. The tacos al pastor on the other hand were FANTASTIC, so delicious and flavorful, and the drinks were also both unique and very tasty. Service was awesome, with a hostess who managed to squeeze us in by turning a table into communal dining, and then before we ordered moving us to our own table as soon as it opened up, despite a line! The waiter was also hilarious and well-informed on the menu. Great place, just don't get the barbacoa!
