NO, NO, NOT!!!!!! In your dream... NOT! As you read my loveeeee for Red Eats in Maine, New Yorker highly recommend me to indulge at this joint!!! Are you HIGH??????? 4ounce of what? I don't know as it was petite lobster pieces I tasted on my wanna be lobster roll! Totally wasted of my time!!! Waste of time if you tell me next time about what New York can deliver of this simple eating... I CAN MAKE BETTER! Yep, I said it... BRING IT!!!
