Another star by chef G. Tiny little place that is old world and comfy; great service; great food and delicious drinks. Lunch time suits those that don't like to wait for the table. Burgers are huge, very well seasoned and mouthwatering. The selection of whiskey is solid. Duck fries were just okay, but that will not stop me from coming back.
