I came here on a Saturday night with a friend and we had to wait around 15-20 minutes which isn't bad at all in NYC (they do not take reservations). The place can get a bit crammed since the tables are very near to one another, so stepping out was a problem. I am a big fan of Thai food and this place definitely met our expectations. We had their regular Seafood Pad Thai, but it was so good. The dishes are not expensive and the portions are quite filling. Would definitely make my way back again.
