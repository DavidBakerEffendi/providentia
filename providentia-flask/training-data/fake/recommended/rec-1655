To be honest the hot dog isn't that special, but I always come here when I'm in Philly. I've only gotten the texas hold em which combines some of my favorite core food groups in hot dogs, bacon, cheese and bbq sauce for example. It's pretty good, that's about it. The fries are much better comparatively, and they are probably why I keep coming back for more. They are served in a cool funnel which makes it more interesting to eat for some reason. I also enjoy the numerous sauces that are available, most of which slip my mind at the moment. The joint is a fun place to eat right on South street and enjoy a good ole hot dog with some interesting toppings. It's not cheap, it's probably not gonna blow your mind, but I think you'll enjoy yourself.
