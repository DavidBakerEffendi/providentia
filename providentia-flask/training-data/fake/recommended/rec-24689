Just not good enough. Lousy, very slow, disorganized service and mediocre food. It seemed like the wait-staff really didn't have their act together nor did really know what to do in any spot of our meal. We had 3 different waiters ask us if we were ready to order. Then, we waited 50 minutes for the first dish to arrive. The waiters are nice and polite, but totally oblivious and spaced out. They mean well, but are very poorly trained. Getting a glass of water took 15 minutes. Our long wait time for the food was never acknowledged or apologized for by the restaurant until we said something. Our bill never was reduced either, which would have been a nice gesture given that the food took an eternity to arrive. On top of that, the food is just ok. We had an artchoke and prosciutto pizza (undercooked and floury), polenta with sausage (sausage tasted like it was from a box or a cheap diner), and a pork-chop entree (meat was dry and under-seasoned). Everything seemed to be missing something----it was bland, boring, poorly executed, forgettable food. The decor and ambience is inviting. Â The bar is a nice place for a glass of wine, but other than that, it's just not good enough for New York. It's too far west (Washington & Bethune, 1 block off the west side highway) to ever venture out of one's way for what we experienced. Furthermore, the competition in the west village for great Italian is simply too stiff. I realize the owner is the same one from the legendary trattoria also on Washington Street, Malatesta, which is terrific. I can't understand what happened here at Malaparte, but the owner and chef need to step it up and not rest on the laurels of success they have enjoyed at Malatesta. There's no room for a lazy slouch in this market.
