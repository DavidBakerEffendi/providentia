Excellent yet again. This has been my second trip to Rat's in the past two years and it does not disappoint. My filet was cooked to perfection. The service is always top notch, the wine selection is excellent and the atmosphere can't be beat. Would highly recommend. Leave yourself plenty of time before or after dinner to tour the grounds for sculpture.
