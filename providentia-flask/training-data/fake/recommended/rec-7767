Very good, good, good stuff.  Wednesdays-- for us upper midtown lunchers-- are happy days.   I've been meaning to try something other than the veggie couscous for ages, but its so damn good, I haven't wanted to branch out yet.   Calling ahead makes picking up swift and painless (which was more an issue in say, January, than now that the weather is better), and unlike Schnitzel & Things, Comme Ci Comme Ca has no issues with taking an order from just one person.
