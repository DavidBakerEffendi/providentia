This new spot in downtown Newark is where u wanna be if you love southern cooking!  The decor is elegant, classy and modern. The menu includes traditional southern ingredients like grits and okra, catfish and oxtail... Etc. The crab cake burgers were delish. Fried okra is a great side!   I've come for happy hour and for lunch, since I work a block away, but I hear they have live entertainment fri and sat nights and Sunday for brunch. Today my coworkers and I had a long lunch there and there was an awesome jazz pianist there who played for a little bit. Really nice touch to the ambience of the place!  The management and wait staff are friendly and attentive. The only thing I'd say is I wish my sweet potato fries were a little crispier. Otherwise I think we all enjoyed our food and the ambience!
