So Bed-Stuy and I have been seeing each other pretty regularly these days.  Last week I ended up at PHH for a late brunch with my homegirl.   First off - the place is tiny, so the seating is of an intimate nature.  In fact, the tables are so close together that when a young lady at the next table asked her waiter for ketchup, I simply passed her our bottle.  Did I feel guilty for, as they say, being all up in her business?  Nope, not at all, I was given no choice but to be a innocent bystander of her conversation. No secret is safe here. Where PHH is winning A convenient little neighborhood restaurant featuring an inventive menu at a great price point, a staff that really seems to care and patrons who are generally nice and down to earth.  I like that a lot. All that being said, this spot is an easy trek for me and I'm never motivated to go.  I suppose I haven't found a menu item that makes me want to keep coming back.  I've tried the shrimp and grits and the duck sandwich and both were tasty, but neither left my slightly siddity taste buds wanting more. My suggestion - try it - if you're in the neighborhood - and see for yourself.   Not the most glowing recommendation, but like Cheryl Lynn, I Got To Be Real... (That's a Yelp review and a music education tied neatly with a bow.  You're welcome.)
