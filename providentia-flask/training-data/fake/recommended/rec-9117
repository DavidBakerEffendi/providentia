After a nice day with a lot of walking around Chinatown and the village where do we end up?  Where else - Tavern on Jane for a late lunch at the bar consisting of a couple of tavern burgers cooked perfectly medium rare as requested, simply delicious.  And, as usual Mike the bar tender on duty expertly took care of all of our needs. TOJ the quintessential neighborhood bar where you are bound to find the best; food, ambience, service and people in the west village.  Like a magnet it keeps pulling us in, anytime we are in the area...
