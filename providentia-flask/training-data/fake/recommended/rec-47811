I must say, I love Ivy Noodle.  If you are hungry and have $5 burning a hole in your pocket (and it's 2 in the morning) you really can't beat this place.  I have only ordered one thing from here (Tofu Curry Noodle- chow fun noodle) and it is truly delish (Spicy and Coconutty).  I have been here more times than I can count.  My Chinese comfort food.  Perfect on a cold New Haven day!   New Haven really doesn't have a whole lot of places to eat for cheap, and this place sure beats the fast food restaurants!  Also, it's open late.  I could eat the pickled jalapenos on everything.
