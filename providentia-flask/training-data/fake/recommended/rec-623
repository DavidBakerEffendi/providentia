Ilili is very chic.  I was a bit underdressed for this place.  Thank goodness my two of girlfriends (uptown moms) dressed up.  All the hostesses looked like supermodel clones in their mini dresses.  So, ladies... you better glam up for this place otherwise you'll stick out like a sore thumb. Their mocktails & cocktails were very good... plus the cocktails were $6.  There's happy hour special on beer & cocktails from 5:30pm - 7:30pm.  My two friends order the same mocktail - cucumber mint lemonade served with ice.  This drink was refreshing and was perfect on a hot summer day.  I had the "From Beirut with Passion" which was a basil-cilantro-mint infused vodka mixed with passion fruit juice.  This drink was interesting... the passion fruit juice was tart & it didn't mask the dryness of the infused vodka quite well. We all tried their restaurant week menu.  The Restaurant Week Menu offered 2 tapas-style appetizers, a main entree, & a dessert: Appetizers: I ordered Baba Ganoush (eggplant dip) & Black Iron Shrimp (shrimp sautéed with cilantro, jalapeno, and garlic in a mini cast iron skillet).  The shrimp was very savory.  The dip was good... loved that the pita bread was served warm. I got the pink peppercorn crusted Black cod as the main entree.  The portion was a bit small and it was a tad salty though. Dessert: I ordered the traditional Lebanese dessert: Achta: a traditional Lebanese dessert with bananas, chopped nuts sprinkled on top with simple syrup which had lavender or some kind of floral essence in it.   It was way too sweet for me, only had 2 spoonfuls and I was done.  My friends loved it though... they have more of a sweet tooth and helped me finish it off. Service was quite attentive. I had a good dining experience here.  I probably won't be going back for dinner though.  I have had better Lebanese/Middle Eastern food elsewhere.  BUT I'd go back for the happy hour specials.
