Really nice decor, food was ok, we took a tasting menu, the some dishes were better than others (campachi was really good, ravioli was great too), the portions were tiny!!! Way over priced!!! I would expects something amazing for 460$ we left for 3 people.... I would recommend to order from the menu... hopefully you would get bigger portions of things you like and not necessarily of what was chosen for you... even if the tasting menu offers 8 dishes... they are bite size and not all great....
