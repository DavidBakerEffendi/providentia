One of the best tapas restaurants in New York. The restaurant has a great bar room and an elegant dining area with plenty of space. The menu has a great selection of choices (my favorite was the goat cheese with beets) and fine cocktails. The sangria is very popular and tasty and the service was quick and friendly. I wasn't too impressed with their dessert selections, however. They only offered 5 or 6 and the one I ordered was just average. This is a great choice for a first date or business dinner.
