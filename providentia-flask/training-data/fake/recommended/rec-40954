My favorite place to eat in Philadelphia! Who couldn't love it with all it's options. You can get mexican, vegetarian, philly steak, hamburgers, pub food, bakery items--you name it they have it! I have several places that you will have to try... 1. Basic 4 Vegetarian Snack Bar: amazing. I recommend their Classic Veggie Burger. You may also try the Class BLT with soy bacon. I loved this bacon. At first I was nervous not having tried many soy products but it tasted so similar to the real thing minus all the yucky fat. With either grab a cup of lemonade and grab the nearest seat you can find! 2. 12th St. Cantina. I used to eat here all the time before I stopped eating red meats and chicken. Plus, they offer their own seating so you don't have to fight for a table. Although, it's not the same! 3. Ice cream from Bassett's. 4. Metropolitan Bakery and Old City Coffee for your grab and go! You have completed my essential reading terminal guide. Now all you have to do is get lost in the crowd and find the next best thing! I do not recommend the vegetable gyro from Olympic Gyro. I just didn't take to it. If you don't like crowds you won't like this place but keep an open mind and explore because the Reading Terminal is A LOT of fun!
