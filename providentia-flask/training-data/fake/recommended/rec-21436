Wow, first time at a German Beer Garden! First impression of the place was pretty good; there were wide open doors, which open up to a nice indoor area that had an outdoor square right inside the area. There were ping pong tables, a lot of JENGA, and a foosball machine. Really chill place! Food: Frankford Hall servers German food and beer, which is pretty awesome because is in Fishtown of Philly. I think it's somewhat fast food as well. Their selection for food is really limited, but I think it's because they mostly prioritize on their beer. They have a bunch of appetizers, frankfurters, and burgers. They had a few sides, specials, and desserts as well. Everything is really pricey!! I had The Kanzler, which was the most expensive burger they have. It was good, but there really wasn't anything special about it. The side of fries that came with it was pretty decent; I think they were Idaho. The ketchup is a curry ketchup, which I was fine with (but my friends didn't like it). My friends had a frankfurter, classic burger, and their red cabbage. The red cabbage was ok, but didn't look appetizing. Overall, food wasn't that great. As for their drinks, they have a huge selection! A lot of them had German names, so it was a good experience! Entertainment This is a pretty good aspect of the place. The open area, the way the place is made for groups of friends/co-workers, the free ping pong, JENGA, and foosball, make this place a pretty good place to come to hang out. A lot of the people who come here are friendly. I believe there are also regulars here. Some people actually bring kids here, which was surprising! Service Not much service, but the staff is pretty nice. You just order from a window, and they bring the food to you. Pros: Space, Stuff to do, beer!! Cons: Food way to pricey, food was just average for the price.
