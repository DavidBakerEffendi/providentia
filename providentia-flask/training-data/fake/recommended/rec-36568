MELT IN YOUR MOUTH FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In general NYC pizza is the best. I wish they could open up in LA, it would be a guaranteed hit since I have yet to try anything remotely close to it. Really not much more to say, the 100's great reviews speak for itself. Â This place is amazing and def worth the wait and claustrophobia in the small waiting area.
