went on a thursday which is free sangria night! we had brought a bottle of wine but i'm fairly certian that they didn't use the whole bottle b/c the pitcher was a little on the small side. decor (asian/carribbean fusion) was interesting and fun. instead of chairs on one side of the table we sat on a cool couch w/ lots of pillows. i ordered the ensalada del caribe b/c the menu described it as having hearts of palm. however, salad did not come with any. the bf had the 3 course prix fixe and started off with homemade chicken soup that he said was tasty. i had the monfongo with pork and bf had the bistec and we shared yucca fries. my pork pieces in my dish were well seasoned (could see the seasoning throughout the pieces) but dry. the mofongo lacked flavor and the cruchy chincharron pieces i'm used to. the sauce bf's bistec came in was amazing. wine-based brown sauce, i believe. we ended up dipping everything in it. we shared coconut flan and it was pretty tasty, with toasted coconut on top. i thought maybe b/c we got there around 9 pm that the main chef went home, explaining the quality of my dish. the service was great, everyone was very attentive. b/c of that and the ambiance, i'd be willing to try mambo tea house again.
