My new favorite place in the city. I had brunch here on Sunday and can't stop thinking about it.   It was an absolutely perfect experience. The food was "Oh My God" amazing. We started with the Oysters and Caviar, Seafood Salad , the Peach Salad and the Goat Cheese. The oysters were the freshest I have had, and the Goat cheese dip was so good I was angry that I had to share it :)  We all ordered Eggs benedict for our main course, and if I hadn't wanted the homemade mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich so badly, I would have ordered a second Eggs Benny. Favorite drinks... Mary Pickford or the Dark and Stormy. Really good wine list as well.  Red and white Bordeaux by the glass. I can't wait to go back. I am thinking of moving to Queen Village just to be closer!
