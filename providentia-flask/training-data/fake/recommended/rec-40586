This dining experience was less then desirable. A gentleman at the Red Oak Tavern, just down the street, recommended this to our group and so we set "Jones" as our lunch destination. To be honest I don't plan on rating the ambiance because our surroundings became quite repetitive as we waited a solid forty-five minutes for 2/3 of our meals to arrive. But before I get to any of that any of that, I would like to throw a name out there: BRITNEY(our waitress)- made sure she did her job thoroughly, efficiently, and was the highlight of the lunch. 5/5 for her JOHN PARK (the manager)- was clearly unsure of how to deal with the situation involving the kitchen staff and their failure to do their jobs 100%. Oh yeah! Might I mention again that once we sat for nearly an hour, only 2/3 of our meals came out. Thankfully, JOHN was on the scene and made sure to visit our table right as the debacle unfolded with very little to say. Unsure of what was going on, our table watched as JOHN stood at the kitchen window and waited for our last meal instead Â of coming over to explain the mixup in the kitchen. Maybe he could've said something like, "Hey, I'm really sorry that you've been waiting this long for all of your food to come out." He could've AT LEAST said something similar to that or at least explain to us that the 3rd meal hadn't been made yet. So we waited... ...and waited... ...and waited until the kitchen staff and management had brought out the 3rd meal. Making it a grand total of 1 hour and ten minutes for the food to finally reach the table. I wish I could say JOHN PARK tried to right his wrongs but he sure as hell DIDN'T. He simply sat the plate down without a single word of apology. Sorry JOHN PARK but you successfully made yourself and the restaurant you manage unprofessional and therefore earned your 1/5 rating.
