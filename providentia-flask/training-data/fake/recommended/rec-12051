This used to be on of the best place for brazilian sandwichs and salgados, have visit this place today, and the food was horrible, the salgados were old, the sandwich very poor in quality and taste, not even close to what it used to be before!! DONT WASTE YOUR MINEY AND TIME AT THIS PLACE! You will sure leave hungry or disappointed.
