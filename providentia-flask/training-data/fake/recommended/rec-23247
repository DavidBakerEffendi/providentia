We went here as a party of 4 for the first time with friends who have been often.  I actually thought the food was good but don't go unless you like seafood because that is all that is offered.  We ordered appetizers and shared all of them including octopus, white asparagus, shrimp and a sea bass.  The appetizers definitely outshined the main courses.  We had dessert which was fine and coffee as well.  The space is cozy and intimate with a nice atmosphere and I loved the black and white details. I would have given 4 stars but after we ate we were repeatedly asked to move our conversation outside by our server because they only allow 2 hours for a dinner reservation and we had been there 2 hours.  It was really strange as that's never happened to us before. The party waiting for our table did seem pretty pushy so I'm not sure what that says about the clientele there.  I'm not sure we would go back. It was just sort of an unusual experience.
