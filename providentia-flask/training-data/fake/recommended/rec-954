Pat's cheese steak had all the cheese on top while geno 's is more distributed which I liked. Geno's gives a more consistent taste to the sandwich, not just a mouthful of meat. Service was quick although it may not be too accommodating. I wanted half the sandwich with cheese and the other without (wanted to share with someone lactose intolerant) and the guy at the window at first said they couldn't do it. Only when I asked again did he relent. Drinks are ordered at another window.
