Underwhelming. It seems like the restaurant is more focused on profits than serving good food in a pleasant environment, evidenced by the tables packed to the brim and excessive branding. We went for Restaurant Week lunch. The food was okay, if that. The prices do not reflect the quality. There are two (single, unisex) bathrooms for the whole restaurant. Service was also just average. My advice would be to avoid the food and target Max Brenner for dessert.
