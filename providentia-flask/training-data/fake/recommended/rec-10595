I never write reviews on yelp but I felt the need to write this from my awful experience yesterday.  I am 7 months pregnant and ordered ham, egg, and cheese on an english muffin.  Unfortunately, the eggs came back running all over the plate.  If you know about pregnancy, you cannot eat any type of raw egg because it is extremely dangerous for you and your baby.  I tell this to the waiter and he tells me that it is cooked, I said no it's  not because the eggs are running all over the plate.  I ask for a new order of scrambled eggs, toast, and hash browns, which were okay.  When the bill came it was a total surprise that I was charged for the nasty runny eggs and not the plate I ate which was the scrambled eggs.  I asked the waitress why and she proceeds to tell me that there was nothing wrong with the food. Right then, I should have asked for the manager but I didn't want to embarrass my friends who I was having brunch with. I told that it was unfair and paid the bill. Will never go there again!!! Be warned!!!!
