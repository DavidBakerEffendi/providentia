Hands down, BEST tacos in New Jersey. I have been on a search to find the best tacos on the east coast. I have come pretty close. I come at least once a week to get my taco fix. Taco Tuesday - 5 tacos for $5 - is a godsend. Ambience feels like a small chain restaurant, but food quality is nowhere near a chain restaurant. Fresh ingredients and tasty spices make me feel like I flew to Mexico. Crunchy fish taco are AMAZING! Open salsa bar is a plus with unlimited limes, cilantro, and yummy salsas. I can't wait to try their quesadillas and burritos.
