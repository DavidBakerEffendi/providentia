The tacos were delicious (I recommend carnitas) and everything was reasonably priced. We had to sit at the bar because a group was "taking forever" to leave their table.  Wasn't too bad though - the bartender was very attentive. However, the wait time is just ridiculous.  I understand it's a small place so a wait is to be expected... but the rough estimate they give you is way off.  At first, they said half an hour... We go to a nearby bar and return half an hour later only to find out it'd be another "20 minutes." 20 minutes comes and goes, and we don't get seated until another 40 minutes later.  That's a 1.5 hour wait! Don't go with a big group.  Also, don't expect to be able to catch up with friends here as the noise level makes it's hard to hold a decent conversation.
