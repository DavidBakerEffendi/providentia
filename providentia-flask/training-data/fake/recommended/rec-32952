I went there with my friends and brother. We are sushi lovers so we were expecting actual sushi (rice with raw fish) for all you can eat, but there were only rolls and appetizers available for all you can eat. Also waitresses were very unpleased to take our orders. We didnt ask much but still they werent very nice. One thing that I like about this place was the interior design of the restaurant. Yup.
