I just love this street full of restaurants, and Becco has such a bubbly atmosphere that it's great for afterwork dinner, a date, or entertaining friends from out of town. Becco has the most amazing LARGE list of $25 bottles of wine for the diner on a budget. I highly recommend the Montepulciano/Merlot meritage, who knew this even existed? It's a fusion of deliciousness, combining the best of both grape worlds. Their 3-pasta all you can eat entree is delicious and well worth the $23, or you can add it to your other meal for only $9. The olive and bread plate to begin with are an abundance of color and carbs, and fit the plentiful plates of food in Italian restaurants. The staff has ALWAYS been extremely friendly, which is always a breath of fresh air in NYC, and even when we haven't made a reservation, they find a way to fit us in. It's become my staple Italian restaurant. you can always depend on good food and great service at Becco.
