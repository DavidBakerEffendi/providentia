Bone marrow - you can't go wrong, but mix it with the dippings around the dish. Spicy chicken was fancy, but not very good. Escargot was also really good, get extra bread to scoop it all up. Paella (good for two) was flavorful with a wide variety of seafood and a side of salt and pepper shrimp made a great addition. Friends let me try a small bite of the filet mignon (special) and rack of lamb - both I would definitely recommend if I come back again.
