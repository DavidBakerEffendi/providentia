Definitely a hole in the wall place.  I wasn't even sure if it went out of business.  I got the #3 with the works based on another yelper's recommendation.  It was very good.  The meat was cut nice and thin, and the toppings were fresh and tasted great.  French fries were good also.  Everything was wrapped nicely to-go.  It came out to $8 which seems like a good deal. Way better than a Blimpee or Subway. Tips: it's next to the fire house.  I drove right by it because it's a hole in the wall place shared by some art studio.  That corner is chaos so just park somewhere and walk.  They have a lot if can get in there.
