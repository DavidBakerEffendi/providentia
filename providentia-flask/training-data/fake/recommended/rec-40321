What a complete disaster. Drinks were horribly over priced Ordered the octopus pizza. Instead of slicing the octopus the piza came with large hunks of the fish on top. Of course when bitten the whole chunk came off in one bite. Very poorly executed! I ordered the rabbit. Very small portion, taste was just eh. I have had so much better. My partner ordered the chicken breast. I was aghast when it came. Someone seem to pour olive oil all over the breast of chicken. It was just soaked with the oil. We sent it back. Did not want to order anything else. The whole evening was such a let down. Too many other places to go to in Philly. Very disappointing.
