Very good Asian food is somewhat inconsistent. Even the name is inconsistent, the sign outside reads MeeWah but the name on the menu is MeeMah. One week I had the Fish with black bean sauce, it was crispy and delicious coated with Panko bread crumbs. I went back a few weeks later and it was coated with flour and a little soggy. The spicy sesame dumplings are always delicious. This place is definitely worth a try, there is always much more good than bad.
