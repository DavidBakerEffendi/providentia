I've been a fan of Ruby's ever since I moved to NY. I came here based on the recommendations from fellow yelpers; and honestly, Ruby's definitely did not disappoint. Although the restaurant is humble in size, I think it adds to the uniqueness and charm to the place. Also, you might be sharing tables with some strangers, but its not that bad since everyone is usually in a great mood while enjoying their great food. And because of the small size of the restaurant, the service is always spectacular; you always feel more cared for especially when you are in a city where it's stereotypically normal to be given a cold shoulder here and there. But onto the food. Like the size of the restaurant, the menu is a little lacking. And like the size of the restaurant, perfecting what the already have is what makes Ruby's a tier above others and a reason for customers to pay around $10-12 for a burger. I've had both the Bronte and the Bondi burgers and as a true burger connoisseur; I can reassure you that they are definitely worth the price tag. All the ingredients are certainly fresh, the ground meat (for the bronte) cooked to order to melt in your mouth, perfectly melted cheese, a soft warm bun, and the presence of the sweet chili sauce that without a doubt give the Ruby's Burgers their character. When you dine-in, the burgers are also served with a side of salad which is completely different than terming it as "side salad." The salad is definitely edible and would be great in its own nature, but the star of the show was undeniably the burger. The pasta served at Ruby's is sometimes overshadowed by their great burgers. If you're not a giant burger fanatic, the pastas also are served with fresh ingredients and have that warm home-cooked feel. Overall, Ruby's is a place that provides a celebrated twist on your every day comfort food. Although, its a little pricey for burgers, pastas, salads, and sandwiches; you could do a lot worse, and by a lot, i mean a lot.
