My son's a burger fanatic, so we tried this place one day.   Just the facts...15 minute wait in a crowded bar; small, somewhat cramped booth; once seated we received quick service, but after that good luck trying to get another glass of water; burgers were ok, somewhat dry; chicken sandwich was ok, a bit dry; fries were over cooked; prices were cheap. This place was crowded, despite it's dive-y atmosphere.  I would go back if I were in college or ending a night of partying.
