Bravo.  Finally a sensible restaurant for the area.  The atmosphere was comfortable and fashion appointed. The food was excellent. The chicken ceasar  salad was very tasty with excellent dressing and fresh greens.   There was enough chicken for three separate sales. The braised short rib, though not on the bone, was tender and very tasty.  Since I travel for my job, I can compare this dish to many I tired throughout the US.    Tis ranks up there at the top of the list. The waiter, Dominic, was ecellent and very friendly.  He helped us decide our choices.  And his recommendations were excellent.  His personality and stories were helped to make the meal enjoyable Worhtthetrip while in Philly.  I'll be back.
