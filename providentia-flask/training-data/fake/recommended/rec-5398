This is a scam of a restaurant.  The aesthetics are nice but there are two very atrcious issues with this place 1) The portions are unfathomably small.  A $13 meal gets you three tiny pieces of chicken and enough rice to fit on one fork.  This is my second time coming here and my last.  Both times they fed me as if my stomach was the size of a dime. 2) They have windows looking into the bathrooms?  Like being watched while you pee?  Come here. Additionally, the manager refused to take the food back and made us pay even though we did not touch the food.  Do not come here.
