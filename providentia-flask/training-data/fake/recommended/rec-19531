I've eating at El Camino Real twice now and both times really satisfied with my meals. Lunch for the first visit and dinner the second. Got the veggie wings both times as an appetizer and they are excellent. Got the cactus and potato burritos my first visit and the BBQ seitan the second. Service was very attentive but with a more casual attitude. Great place to have a relaxing meal and a few good brews.
