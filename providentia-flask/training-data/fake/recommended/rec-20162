Enjoyed a leisurely Sunday brunch with the BFFs at this hopping local hot-spot. A latte got us through the 40 min wait. Nice decor and friendly staff. Tried the short rib hash..yummy!! I loved every bite! The cheddar waffles were excellent and my BFF enjoyed the fried pork chop & waffles. Will definitely return to try their regular menu items.
