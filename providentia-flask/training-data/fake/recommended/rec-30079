Wow, the beer selection is out of control. Immaculate tap menu. Food, on the other hand, was fine. Not a disappointment per se, but for $15-25 a dish I expect a bit more. My pork sandwich was dry. Fries were soggy. I'll be back for sure to try the wings and artichoke dip. Update: I went back. Beer was, again, fantastic, food was meh. The muscles were not great, but the scallops were very good.
