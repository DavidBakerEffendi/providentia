My new favorite restaurant. This place is so cool. I LOVE the decor. I know this is weird, but do yourself a favor and go to the bathroom to check out the walls. There are neat touches all over the restaurant that make it really cozy and warm. As for the food, I had a pizza. Normally I don't go for pizza crust that is on the thin side but after a friend recommended I try the pizza here I thought what the heck? It was SO good. I was not disappointed. I tried the Calabria pizza. Unreal. I like spicy and this was just the right amount of hot. My friend had the Sicily, which I wasn't sure I'd like because it has pine nuts on it but that pizza was incredible too. They were both so good. Now I want to come back and try them all! Best of all this place is only a few blocks away from my apartment. I say get in before it's packed all the time! The rest of the menu looked tasty too. I'll be going back for the seafood pasta next time!
