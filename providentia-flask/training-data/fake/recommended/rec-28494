Somehow everytime I eat here, and i KNOW what's awaiting me after I finish this meal, somehow I always talk myself into eating it anyways. It would be disingenuous to say that this wasn't one of the better halal carts in NYC. BUT that doesn't make it THE halal cart of the century. Location is key, smack dab in the heart of midtown, once it caught on this place was sure to succeed. But I have to give them credit too. Their meats are well seasoned and likely hand-packed themselves. The hot sauce is straight fire from the lower depths of earth. Mixed with the right ratio of white sauce and you've got yourself a winner. The line is typically ridiculous. EVERYBODY wants a bite of 53rd and 6th. Can you think of anything else that exists on 53rd and 6th? the mall of the americas could move to this location and if someone asked you what they meant by 53rd and 6th you'd still say, "Oh yea, you mean 53rd and 6th, the halal cart? Still, late nights I make bad decisions and like the werewolf when the full moon is out, if if I'm in the area and its past midnight, thats a cue for me to uncontrollably crave this place. ****4 stars for being one of the best halal carts on the streets of Manhattan. Just stop with the dogmatic worship of this place. Eat at EVERY halal cart in the city, (they are popping up faster than the octomom can produce kids) THEN let's talk about who's the best.
