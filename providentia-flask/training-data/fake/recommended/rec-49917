Aylan's is the bomb! Some of the best falafel I've ever had! I love it stuffed in a pita with their amazing hummus and slaw/yogurt mix. Not to be missed if you have midnight munchies on South St. The Greek salad is also fantastic. Portions and prices are great. Again, I love their falafel, but it always makes my teeth feel gritty afterward?
