Long wait, but I'm really underwhelmed by the burgers. They're slightly juicy, but not flavorful. Get it with bacon, and it's sort of okay then. Fries were mediocre, too. Standard not too crisp fries. It is a fun dive place to go after you've been drinking (or to keep drinking), but if you want a good burger, go to Shake Shack.
