Meh. The food was pretty good -- especially cheese/meats/oils/vinegars-- and portions are huge, but the details bothered me. The servers were dressed super casually, raggedy jeans and vintage-looking t-shirts, and seemed hassled, frazzled, stressed, and like they did not want to be there. We got there pretty late and the bread tasted really stale. But it was a fun spot for dinner and I don't regret trying it.
