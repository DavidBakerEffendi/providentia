Just got back to South Jersey from visiting a relative in NYC. We decided to eat at Casa Adela for dinner. We have been there once before. The mofongo was good but it was not what I had ordered. I ordered a plain mofongo with extra garlic and I receive a mofongo with pernil. I let that go, they made a little mistake. I'll pay the extra money for the pernil.   I asked at the beginning if they had white rice with beans, and I was told that they only had arroz con gandules. So I said "no thank you", and just went with the mofongo.  Later, as I'm eating my meal the waitress brings white rice and beans.  "Ok I'll take the rice and beans home", I said to myself, even though I no longer wanted the rice and beans. When we get the check, the waitress had charged us $12 extra. I had her add the check and she came up with the wrong number herself, but continued to say that she was right. Since we had six people in our group, we were charged 18% tip which it was fine, but she charge us 18% plus and extra $12.  The owner's son came to the register and gave me my money, but they were making me feel like I was in the wrong. I even had someone else add it up, and they were wrong.  Last time I was there, the owner, Adela was cooking in the kitchen, and the service was much better. Maybe her presence makes a big difference in the service. I will never go there again. The customer service was horrible. If you go there, make sure that your food order and your bill is correct.
