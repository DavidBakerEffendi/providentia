I am hopelessly obsessed with Pietro's. Although I haven't loved every single thing that I have tried from their menu (namely the tortellini... The alfredo sauce was a little weird), their fresh-from-the-oven bread and rigatoni a la vodka makes up for it. I love their bread and pasta so much that I kick and scream until my friends agree to accompany me to this restaurant at LEAST once a month. It's just so good!
