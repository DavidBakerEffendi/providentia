Tried In Riva recently on a perfect summer evening. Sat at the outside bar while we waited for an outdoor table. The view of the river is divine. i felt I had escaped to Europe. The staff were friendly and helpful. Loved the appetizer that consisted of a spread in a mason jar with grilled bread. So delicious! We also tried three small plates of pasta; a sampler.
