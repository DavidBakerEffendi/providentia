Hmmm, pretty good though I don't seem to be as smitten as the masses are on this one! Love the idea of the Latin seafood cocktail bar, love the ambiance, love the location. Also loved the menu options when I first saw them...despite the fact that I didn't end up loving the food. The place is located on 46th street and is great: narrow, dark, intimate, and enticing. My husband and I grabbed a couple of seats at one of the little tables along the wall. No issues whatsoever with the atmosphere...I thought it was awesome. To start with, we ordered the scallops tiradito and the taquitos de langosta. Both were good, but both were not as good as I'd expected. The scallops were fresh, and the mixture of flavors was nice, but they had a slight fishy aftertaste. The taquitos were definitely good, but maybe not as phenomenal as the yelp reviews had me believe? We also ordered the queso fundido, papardelle, and a corn and manchego empanada. All good, though nothing stood out to me...I really just felt like I've had better versions of each item before! I don't remember the name of our dessert, but it was a Latin-style crepe filled with strawberries and drizzled with strawberry sauce. It wasn't my favorite, I think because I don't really enjoy warm strawberries, and the whole thing was warm. A bit disappointed since I had high expectations, but it wasn't bad. If I end up with spare time in NYC at some point I might be tempted to try La Pulperia again...though the city has so many other options, who really knows??
