I seriously would like to recommend this restaurant for everyone who's coming to New York for a short visit. A dinner at this place is itself a show. If you sit at the grill bar, you get to watch the chefs process the  fish, seafood, veggies and rice balls and then grill them! Believe me, the chefs do an amazing job - they use traditional cooking utensils and make a show out of it. It was really a feast for the eye. The food was pretty good. The best part was the appetizers: amazing choices and wonderful tastes. We also loved the grilled shellfish. What we found to be a little disappointing was that the fish (flathead, bream, and another kind of fish) were less tasty than expected. I'd recommend that you try other grilled foods,  including the veggies. Super tasty!
