Phenomenal service and really romantic, fun atmosphere. Try to get a seat in the back garden, very Italian. Wonderfully attentive wait service and good food. I recommend the fris√©e salad with Gorgonzola and the whole wheat pasta with mozzarella and basil and tomato -- delicious and delicate flavoring, not heavy at all!!
