Stopped in with my parents on a Sunday before hopping on a bus. There is not much open for lunch in this area and we're always down to try Irish pubs. I had the mixed grill plate which was awesome. My mom had the shepherds pie and couldn't stop raving about the potatoes. Overall a nice place to grab a beer and quick lunch.
