I liked this place...I had the beef meatballs with the mushroom gravy....something about the sauce reminded me a little of those lipton noodle packets you can get in the grocery store though....i also tried the chicken meatball slider special, which had blue cheese and hot sauce and was actually quite tasty. this is the kind of place i would go to once, think it was ok, and never think about it again.
