Nice little spot, worth the short commute if you're venturing off the island. Good variety of fish, and my friend said the prosciutto-wrapped chicken was really delicious.Two out of our three visits, the chef came out to greet us after the meal, which was nice. Just cross your fingers that there isn't a graduation or birthday party at the table next to you - it can get loud very quickly in the cozy little dining room.
