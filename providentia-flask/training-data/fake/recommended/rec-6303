A couple years ago I tried a gluten free diet for a couple weeks. Searching for gluten free in yelp brought me here.  This place was so fantastic that after my 2 week diet I would frequent here for their gluten free food. Venue: (4/5) dimly lit and warm.  I've never had to have reservations and the the host is very welcoming.  This place is great for all types of crowds: dates, small or big groups, families... They accommodate all. Food: overall (5/5) Gluten free bread (5/5) I think better than the regular bread.  Very good. Gluten free mushroom and ricotta ravioli in pink sauce (5/5) perfection!!!  Just try it.  I cannot tell the difference between this and fresh wheat pasta.   Gluten free spinach and cheese ravioli (5/5) my second choice but still perfect. Sangria (sake based) (5/5). So good and refreshing.  They offer this in the warmer seasons. Service (5/5) waiters are great and the owner is always there.  He stops by to see how you are doing.
