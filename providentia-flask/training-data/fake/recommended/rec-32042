After searching out the possibilities in Old CIty, Spasso won for our rehearsal dinner site with its' really superb food (we had dinner beforehand to try it out) and extremely fair price (less than 30 a head if you cut out the pasta portion). They did absolutely wonderful handling our 40+ party. The servers were pleasant and attentive and we felt so comfortable in the private room. We got everything we needed and the price was great for what we got. Many of our guests commented on how great the food was and how yummy the dessert tray was. Thank you Spasso!
