After other plans fell through because of terrible train delays, we were thankful to get a seat at the bar at Xixa. The space was a bit cramped, but not bad for no reservations on a Saturday. If the review was just about the food, it would be 3.5-4 stars. We had the tasting menu and everything was pretty great. My favorites were the skirt steak and mackerel ceviche. The churros for dessert with lemon custard were delicious! All in all, the food is good but there is room for improvement. Go and try a few things but I'd avoid the tasting menu. The problem was service execution. First, some dishes were brought two or three at a time. It would have been crowded at a table and with our bar seats, it was just uncomfortable. Second, the serving sizes for many dishes were too large for a tasting menu. The last course being bone marrow and steak tartare followed by two heavy desserts seemed like poor timing. Â The five layer dulce de leche cake was far too heavy to end such a large meal. My boyfriend and I both left feeling heavy and gross and we did not eat everything. I have never left after a tasting menu feeling horrible about life!
