The group I was with really enjoyed their brisket and rib tips. However, avoid the fried chicken (for the price, I've had crispier and more flavorful KFC) and Mac and cheese aa it seemed so made in advance that it lost any flavor and they attempted to cover up the bland color and by slapping a slice of yellow american on the top of it.
