Never had I had Peruvian food before, but this was excellent, and others with me agreed. The rotissere chicken is fantastic, especially for the price ($16 for the entire chicken, plenty to split between 2-3 people) and the green chile sauce is delictable. The decor of this place was very modern, and was surprised by how large the downstairs dining room was. My main complaint would have to be the service. Super slow taking orders, bringing our food, and bringing the check. Waiting time was most liekly over 70 minutes total for everything. I did go with a large party, and I understand that it is difficult, but put more than one waiter on a table with over 15 people at it. That was outrageous. That being said, I will most likely go back with a smaller party and try again. The chicken was just so good not too. Maybe I'll try one of the other locations.
