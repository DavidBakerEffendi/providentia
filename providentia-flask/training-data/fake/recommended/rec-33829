I've been here twice. Once for a friend's birthday and this past weekend for my boyfriend's birthday/Valentines Day. Let me start off by saying that the food is amazing. There were no complaints in that department. However, I had made reservations for the later seating over a month beforehand. Because of budget stuff and the fact that we live in the suburbs, we really don't get out for things like this often and were really looking forward to a little romantic dinner. We arrived in plenty of time for our reservation. But because of overcrowding, we had to sit communally with two other couples. I wouldn't be so upset about this if we were told ahead of time that there would be a chance of this happening, but they decided after having us sit there in our coats for 10 minutes and didn't really give us a decision in the matter. It really did put a damper on the evening. Luckily, the other two couples were great people and we had some great conversation. And they did serve us as three separate parties of two, so we weren't sharing the plate with a bunch of strangers. But then, they decided to include the mandatory 18% for parties of 6 or more despite billing and serving us separately, which was a huge slap in the face. Unfortunately, they lost out, because even when I tip low, I tip more than that. I love to support smaller businesses and this restaurant is truly unique. But I can't help feel sour about our treatment there. You would think that after being in business for so long, they'd figure out how to handle situations like this. It really is unfortunate.
