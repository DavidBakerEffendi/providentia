Excellent, excellent pizza!  Just go and try it.  Best in Northern Liberties, hands down.  If you love thin and crispy crust try the square and if you love traditional, yet stil pretty thin, then try the round.  The sausage is delicious.  My only complaint is they are skimpy with the sausage, but this was my first time so maybe that was not the norm.  I'm going back and if you haven't been there yet, you need to go now.
