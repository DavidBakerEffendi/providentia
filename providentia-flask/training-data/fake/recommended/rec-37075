Brunch is $15 for an entree, a drink and coffee or tea. The portions are gi-normous! I love their mixed greens - their dressing is just perfect. The drink portion is good as well. My mimosa was in a wine glass instead of the standard champagne flute, which is a better bang for your buck. I had the short ribs w/ scrambled eggs and I have to say it is top notch. The short ribs were so tender and flavorful and the eggs were seasoned and cooked perfectly. Only downside of the dish was the under cooked potatoes, otherwise good flavor. I've also had the Three Your Way dish and the eggs are just killer. I never thought of throwing chives in my scrambled eggs. I only wish they had maybe 2-3 more options on the brunch menu - maybe their mac n' cheese, which I heard is great. They also have a lot of open space which can hold a good 2-3 more 2 person tables. This will alleviate the brunch wait time. Think about it Eastwick! However, I've never waited more than 20 mins - which is good? *shrugs* Love this place!
