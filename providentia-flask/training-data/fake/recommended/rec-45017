when I plan my trips to new york a good portion of any of my planning revolves around getting my butt into Tasty Hand Pulled Noodles and ordering the fish ball hand pulled noodles. The noodles are more satisfying than first love. Â Honestly they never disappoint you and you feel all warm and tingly after each bowl. Plus you gotta give props to the simplicity of it all - no clever names, flashing lights or half naked women...just "Tasty Hand Pulled Noodles"
