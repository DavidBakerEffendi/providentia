bacon cheeseburger.  yes!  i came here for lunch a while back and heard a lot of good things about it.  i love eating burgers and who doesnt like a good burger?  this place definitely provides that and even at an affordable price.  the bacon cheeseburger is five bucks with a side of fries...you're gonna' be good to go.  this burger is definitely worth the visit and if you have a late night craving, this place delivers the goods till four in the morning.  the place is a little small so it might be tough to get sitting, but regardless.  with a great neighborhood surrounding, this burger is definitely worth the visit.
