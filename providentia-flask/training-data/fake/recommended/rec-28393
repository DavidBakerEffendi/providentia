This bar is definitely an example of how Astoria is developing and adding new flavors to the neighborhood. One of these flavors is the Dirty Pickle Martini at Sweet Afton. I'm not one for sweet drinks and Sweet Afton carries a variety of unique and delicious cocktails. I went there with a few friends a couple of times, and my friends ordered the mac and cheese, which was delicious. Their sliced pickles are spicy and addictive. I'm definitely anticipating returning to try out their brunch menu. The only criticism that I have is that they don't provide a happy hour--if they did, I would frequent Sweet Afton a lot more.
