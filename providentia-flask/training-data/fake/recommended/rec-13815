Pancakes. Pancakes. Pancakes. Period. Don't bother with anything else when you make it to this cute little joint in Brooklyn. I've tried the most hyped pancakes in nyc (like Clinton St. Baking Company), but IMO Cafe Luluc has the best pancakes... The pancakes had an unbelievable crispiness what you don't expect... Everything else on the menu was not bad, but nothing to rave about either. I only wish this place was in the city.
