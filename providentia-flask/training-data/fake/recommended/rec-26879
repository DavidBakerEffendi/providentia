Holy mother of God! The Redhead just made me get all blasphemous and stuff. Â  Have you TRIED that pretzel or fried chicken or THE DELECTABLE COMPLIMENTARY SUGAR COOKIE THEY FEED YOU? Obviously not, or you would be there right now instead of reading this. So I am pretty jealous of YOU right now, because you're probably about to eat at The Redhead while I am most likely stuck in an office 1,547 miles away. Yeah, sucks to be me (not really). The seating is tight, but that didn't bother me. The servers were friendly and the chicken was juicy while remaining crunchy on the outside. This calorie countin' girl totally consumed like 34289034289042390234890234 calories at The Redhead, and ya know what? IT WAS WORTH IT.
