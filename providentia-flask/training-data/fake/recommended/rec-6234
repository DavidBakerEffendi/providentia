Scallops and octopus to die for. Melon with fresh ham was cool, refreshing and delicious. Mixed baby greens salad was wonderful. We shared six oysters that came from both coasts. Â They were fresh, briny and so so good. Service was very attentive. So why not five stars? Really really small portions and very dear pricing. That being said, I would very much recommend Prospect.
