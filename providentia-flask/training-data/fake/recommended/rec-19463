This was actually my 3rd visit here, and I couldn't help but get the same thing as the previous 2 times. Yes... it's that good... Got my usual Village burger medium rare with a fried egg along with the duck fat fries. Definitely one of my favorite burgers in Philly. But compared to the previous times I've been the burger wasn't as good. Maybe it was an off day. The meat just wasn't as tender and juicy as I would have liked for medium rare. Since my experiences beforehand were basically perfect Village Whiskey still gets 4 stars in my book =)
