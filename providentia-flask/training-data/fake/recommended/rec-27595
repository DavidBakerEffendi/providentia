Barrio Chino is fantastic!  Food, drinks & abmiance is worth checking out. A bit cramped but what isn't in NYC? The fresh fruit grapefruit margies are so worth the $10 & you can get buzzed off them if you so desire or have enough $ to do so!  $8 for 3 tacos - what a deal!   Look I'm from So Cal (the OC) and  while tacos are abundant any style you want - I am still searching for any fresh fruit  any drink around here.  I lived in LA for 10 years and am a bit jaded when it comes to drinks, food, establishments & the crowd of peeps who dine there. I reccomend Barrio Chino fo sho...wish I was there right now!
