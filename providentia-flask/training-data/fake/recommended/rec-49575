Some of the best sandwiches you'll find anywhere. I know an Italian butcher who told me in Italy that there was one restaurant that he believed to serve authentic Italian food outside of Italy--without my prompting him, he named Via. If that isn't a testament to its greatness, I don't know what is! My go-to's are the perfect cappucino, the Non Ti Scordar di Me with soppressata genoa instead of speck, the lasagna and the vegetable soup. But really, you can't go wrong. Also, don't whine about waiting--it's worth it.
