Went for Sunday dinner the restaurant was full but we were seated in 5 min. The food was delish!!!! I got the ludacris which is straight up fried chicken wings was so good my friend had the smothered chicken with the gravy which was just delicious and my other friend had the chicken with waffles... The waffles were fluffy warm and sweet the perfect partner to the fried chicken. Sides were Mac n cheese (ok) corn (better) and fried okra which was surprisingly really good with hot sauce. And the best part of my meal was the cornbread warm and sweet! This place is a must!
