One of the best dining experiences I've ever had! We arrived 30 minutes early for our 8:30 dinner reservation on a Sunday night, and had no trouble finding 2 empty seats at the bar as we waited on our table. Bar service was excellent! The decor here is just lovely! The nature theme of flowers/plants and fruit & vegetables made it warm and inviting. I had the 3 course menu for $92. First course- Pork Bolognese Tagliatelle Second course- Striped Bass Dessert- Rhubarb Almond Cake The striped bass came in the most savory garlic butter type sauce. It was so delicious! I also tried my friend's smoked trout, lamb, and devil's food cake, which were even better. One of the best parts about the experience was that the chef sent out 3 bonus treats during the course of our meal, including a cinnamon muffin to take home for breakfast the next day. Awesome! Service was top notch. I can't wait to go back next time I'm in NY!
