Hmmm I'm pretty surprised at how much this cart is hyped up. I figured over 2000 reviews, and it still has a 4.5 rating- it must be mind-blowing! That it is not. Good cheap food it is. We waited in a line of around 15 people at 10p on a Sunday night, and the line only took 15m. Once it's your turn to order, the transaction literally takes like a minute so know what you want before you get there. One man shovels rice and salad into the tray (with his bare hands?) and man-handles a pile of pita into the box while the other man takes the order/money and piles on the meat (using utensils thankfully). For $6, you get a sizable pile of orange rice, iceberg lettuce, chopped lamb, chopped chicken and strips of flatbread. I like that they use the thicker pita (but it just comes out of a bag). The lamb has better flavor than the chicken. Ordered a separate falafel plate for $5 that just had 2 average falafel balls on it. Should have known not to order that since they had been fried a long time ago and were sitting out for who knows how long unloved. My biggest disappointment was that the rice didn't have more flavor. Seeing that it was orange and so enticing, I expected some kind of spice or flavor, but it was just colored basmati. Boo. If it weren't so cheap and fast, I might be annoyed. Since it was both, I'll give it 3-stars for street food. My mind was boggled moreso than blown.
