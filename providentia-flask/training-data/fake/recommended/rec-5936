I love bagel train, it's been a Sunday staple for my family for some time. Their bagels are BIG and pretty tough to chew through as well, just the way I like it! Great variety of bagels and cream cheeses and delicious sandwiches as well. Not much room to eat in here, you're better off taking it to go.
