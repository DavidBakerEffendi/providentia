Vegetarian and tired of the same old avocado cucumer rolls at your sushi place? Get your butt to Beyond Sushi! These guys are awesome. Fresh, delicious, and affordable. Great, friendly, efficient service. I've had a few rolls and a couple wraps -- loved everything. The combo deals are great because you essentially get the individual pieces for free. Love the cute sauce tubes that you get with your takeout. I squeezed the crap out of the mushroom one to get every last bit of fungi goodness.
