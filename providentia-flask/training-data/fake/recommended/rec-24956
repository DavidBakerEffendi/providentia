I came with a group of six friends. Â We ordered the from the "Italian Brooklyn" special menu that they were offering. There were about 6 different appetizers and 6 different main meals that you could choose from. I had the Nonna's meatballs which were really juicy and tasty however quite small. My main dish was chicken Marsala. It was very flavorful but literally it was one small thin cutlet. The portions are extremely small. There were no sides offered with the meal like most restaurants have. Dessert was included which was tiramisu. Very good but again very small.
