Wow, this place was a top highlight of our Philly visit. Bakeries, eateries, meat markets, florists, and other cute stores fill this space. I enjoy anything Amish so seeing them in action made me happy. One could easily spend an hour or two checking out this market. Love, love, love Reading Terminal Market!
