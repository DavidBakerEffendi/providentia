This place is proof that all buffet tables do not have to suck. Very good Korean home style cooking with a rotating selection steam table dishes daily. Braised Pork Belly and Kimchi Fried Rice seem to be staples and are "must try's" when loading up your take out container. There is a strong case to be made about giving this place 5 stars because I do not know of any steam tables joints that are producing food of this quality. However, I have had better Korean Food and there is no one dish that gives me cravings, so they get a 4.
