Oh my goodness.  The truffle burger here is so good, I had to come on a Monday night just to have it again after trying it for the first time the previous Friday.  The manly fries are great, the sweet potato fries are even better.  Skip the ice cream sandwich and you're golden.  I intend to try every burger this place offers!  One of THE best burgers I've had to date.
