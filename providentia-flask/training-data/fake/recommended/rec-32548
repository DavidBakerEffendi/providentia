Pros: Great Mediterranean and Lebanese inspired food and drinks. Excellent service and atmosphere. Special call out for the bathroom service. I mean it's often an overlooked part of any establishment but Ilili has a very nice lady taking care of the unisex bathrooms. Super clean and tidy. Â Large space for parties. Cons: Bar area seating is kind of funky. It kind of blocks the exit and the settings are way too low. Alcohol prices are kind of high. Overall: It is pretty good food for this specific type of cuisine. I highly recommend it for a special night.
