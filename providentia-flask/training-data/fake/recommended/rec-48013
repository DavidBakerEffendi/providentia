My wife and i went here for our anniversary.  It IS cute, and we sat by the door in our own little private perch.  You gotta love those 2 tables that are impossibly THERE.  it's humorous, and it's fun.  The waiter has to be a contortionist to serve you there.  We were left lone for a while but the waiter made up for it in GRAND style.  So, please, leave me alone more often.  The food is a B+ to A minus in terms of deliciousness...but I'm spoiled.  The prices reflect it.  It's pretty easy on the pocket book.  Really nice place for a date.  Great vibe.  I will come here again.
