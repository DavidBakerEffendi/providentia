I really enjoyed this restaurant. My hubby took me for my birthday. I had the Lomo Saltado. It was delicious. The filet mignon was so tender. I had a kiwi drink that my waiter recommended and it was great. You have to like sweet drinks to really appreciate it. The service was great. My waiter was able to recommend drinks and food. My husband doesn't eat meat and he accommodated him by adding extra veggies to his dish to substitute the meat. The ambiance was great. It was a bit loud, but nothing that I couldn't handle. Coming in the restaurant looked pretty small. The downstairs space was a nice size. I will definitely be coming back !!
