I had heard a lot about this place, and the food was good, but I don't think that it was worth the really long wait time and the less-than-stellar service. Plus, don't even think about going to the bathroom.  There's only one, so there was a huge line for it when I tried to go.  Then three different members of the waitstaff hollered at me to get out of the way when I was waiting on line for it.  I would have liked to stay and try the dessert but I had to leave so I could go elsewhere to use the restroom.
