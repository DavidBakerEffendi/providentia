This place makes me wish I live in Williamsburg.  Food is awesome, service is great, and the restaurant itself is roomy so you can actually get a table without the hour-wait that's standard at the East Village location.  They also have really cute garden seating when the weather is nice. Both the food and drinks here are top notch.  There are vegetarian options, and they seem really accommodating about (reasonable) substitutions. The service slows down a bit if it's crowded.  In that case, I highly recommend ordering a drink and the tostones mochimero appetizer (plantains with mojito mayo) and just enjoying the laid-back vibe. P.S. The mango (?) sauce at the tables is great on EVERYTHING.  Try to resist the urge to sneak the whole bottle home with you.
