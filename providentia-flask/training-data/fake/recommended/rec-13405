Date/Time:  Wednesday 9pm Occasion:  Dinner Party of:  Two Location:  A few blocks from Times Square. Trendy, black lighting, extremely tight restaurant Ordered:  Spicy basil beef noodle, Chicken pumpkin curry, Butter & almond string beans, and lychee sangria. Total incl gratuity: $51 Recommended from a sales associate at Swarovski. Thank you!! This place was spot on.  Food was delicious!  Many of the entrees on the menu sounded incredibly appetizing so it was really a challenge to order with our stomach and not eyes.  I thoroughly enjoyed everything we chose.  The spicy basil beef was generously portioned and very moist.  It was not very spicy so we had to toss in extra chili sauce for the kick.  I'm normally not a fan of pumpkin however the ingredients sounded like the perfect combo so I opted for it.  Chicken was moist and the curry was delicious with the rice.  For some veggies, we went with the string beans and they were AMAZING!  The beans were perfectly sautéed and the flavor had a hint of charred teriyaki.  String beans probably would be an unlikely selection for many if you're in the mood for some awesome veggies, try them! The service is quick and minimal.  The servers are friendly ; the food is delivered quickly.  I highly recommend this place to anyone around the Times Square/Midtown area with a hankering for delicious and inexpensive Thai food.
