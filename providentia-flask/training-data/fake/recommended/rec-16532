I feel like I have had almost every burger in NYC that claims to be the "best" and it has been a long time since a burger has blown me away....until today.  I had the day off so I made my way over to Umami for a late lunch, early dinner around 4PM.  The wait was about 25-30 minutes and when we got inside the staff was incredibly friendly. Our waitress was great and even though the restaurant opened today she had tried every burger and was able to give me information on each one.  Her favorite was the Truffle burger so I decided to go with that one.  As other reviewers have said, they recommend getting the burger medium rare.  The burger came out in about 10 minutes and it was AMAZING.  Every bite was perfect and I was sad as it started to get smaller and smaller.  It probably was the most rare "medium rare" I have ever had but it still stayed together as I ate it.  We also had the sweet potato fries with the 4 dipping sauces.  The fries were good but no different then other good fries you can get anywhere.  I can't wait to come back again and again although I can't imagine anything else on the menu being as good as the truffle burger.
