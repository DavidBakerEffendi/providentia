I am a total pizza snob and it takes a LOT for a pizzeria to get a five-star rating from me, but American Flatbread is so worth it! Seriously, one of my favorite pizza places I've ever been to! It's not authentic pizza but it's not trying to be--illustrated by the fact that they refer to their offerings as "flatbread," not pizza. It's really a whole different ballgame. We had the two daily specials. One was a vegetarian pizza with ramp pesto, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, and queso fresco. The other had apples, sausage, carmelized onions, spinach, and cheddar. I couldn't decide which was my favorite because they were both so amazing! The topping combinations were creative while still working really nicely together, and the crust struck a perfect balance between chewy and crisp. I'm jealous of Burlington for having American Flatbread!
