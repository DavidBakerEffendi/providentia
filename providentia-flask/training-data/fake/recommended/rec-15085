This review is of the cafe. which should have been vegan-yummy. The online menu says tofu, lentil burgers, hummus. Of those, they had only hummus, and they were so low they would give me only a tiny schmear. Â The salads were boring and too small for the money. Both stars in this review go to the delicious greens & split pea soup, vegan and delicious. Even the low level of salt was perfect.
