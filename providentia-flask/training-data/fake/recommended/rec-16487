So this place was right down the street from the apartment i was renting when staying in town for a couple of days. I had just gotten into town and searched Yelp for what i thought may be the best restaurant within a block or two and i found it. When i got there they were definitely very busy!! i was alone and able to squeeze into the very last seat at the bar and i mean squeeze!! haha The interior is rustic and minimal with great accent lighting in the evenings. Definitely gives you that lounge feel. The staff here is top notch. They all know the menu and the foods front to back. I found the leather aprons that the staff wore a very cool touch. The menu here is very sophisticated but yet simple and short. Like i said the staff knows every last thing about the menu and can give you wonderful explanations of the items. The presentation of the food is spectacular. When i checked in here on Yelp there was a coupon for 6 Oysters and a half bottle of white wine for $30, so i went with that as an appetizer. When i ordered i was speaking with the bartender about my main coarse and she recommended that the sesame crusted tuna with sabra noodle and cucumber soy broth would pair perfectly with the oysters and the wine. Wow, the Oysters were amazing, very fresh, prepared well with a delicious relish on the side. The tuna dish was out of this world. First perfectly seared tuna that was very fresh , and the noodles and broth were a perfect fit. I may not have all of the words to express the flavors but they were amazing. The main dining/bar area can get pretty loud at times but what NYC restaurant doesn't. Overall i cant wait to get back here next time i come to town.
