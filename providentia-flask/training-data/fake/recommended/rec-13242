I enjoyed my lunch at Ippudo.  Definitely one of the best ramen noodles I've had. The Tori Ramen was absolutely wonderful.  I was craving ramen noodles, this not only satisfied my craving but exceeded my expectation in term of flavor.  I would have wanted a little more fish and pork for that price but what is good is that you can ask for a second serving of the noodles but you cannot finish your broth because you will need it for the second serving of ramen.  I did have the second serving of ramen.   I was quite satisfied with the Tori Ramen.  I didn't want anything spicy or with garlic since I cannot have garlic now.  I am glad I tried it.  I went on a Monday during lunch time on a rainy day and I still had to wait.  The wait was not long, about 15 minutes. I cannot wait to try Toto Ramen to compare.
