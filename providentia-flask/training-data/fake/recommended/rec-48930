So I dined at Bove's for the first time yesterday on a business trip to Burlington.  I'll definitely be going back to try other sauces.  Just the basic marinara left a great taste that lingered. Prices are reasonable and the ravioli and manicotti were very good. Unique atmosphere, definitely old charm.  I understand the place has been around for about 50 years. Staff cool with Dad and kids getting a bit silly. My wife now buys Bove's sauce at the grocery.
