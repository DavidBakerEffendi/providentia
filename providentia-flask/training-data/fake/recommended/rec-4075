This is not you average thai joint- before they started to spring up everywhere most thai places had bullet proof glass and a few fromica tables under harsh florescent light...Joya is the extreme opposite of this. You really have a dining out experience.  They ususally display local artist's work on their exposed brick walls, nice low lighting for intimacy and a lovely garden out back lit with candles.  The food is amazing and unebelievably inexpensive.  If you choose not to booze you can get out of there spending about 10 bucks for massive portions.  The specials are awesome and even their wine selection is good for such low prices (bottles start at about 22 dollars...a steal in restaurant world).  I only take away one star because it is very loud due to the exposed brick, concrete floors, and a dj that spins live almost every night.  That's just the geezer in me but I likes it how I likes it what can I say.  Usually I just opt for the serene garden when weather permits to escape the noise.
