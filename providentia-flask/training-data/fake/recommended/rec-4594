Went here for a bite with friends and family after going to the Owl Shop.   Hadn't been here in years.... Decided to have one good for you pie and one not so good for you pie... We dubbed them good and evil.  "Good" was the pizza primavera... It was loaded with veggies, including a first for me, carrots.  Yes, carrots on pizza.  Surprisingly good.  "Evil" was the Yorkside Special which had pepperoni, meatballs, bacon, sausage, mushrooms, and onions. It was great!  We had a tomato/basil garlic bread as an app... That was really good too. The pizza isn't your typical thin crust New Haven style pizza, it's more of a Greek style pizza.  It's good for a change every now and again.   Service was quick, friendly, and overall good.
