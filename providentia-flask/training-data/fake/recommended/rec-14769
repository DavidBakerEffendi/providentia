wow. this is where it is AT! we just cooked some of the frozen prepared beef tortellini with the frozen vodka sauce, and OMG. it is totally top restaurant quality. no joke. i cannot wait to try the black lobster ravioli next! the fresh spaghettini is also great! any trip to the italian market should include a stop at Talluto's. it's a must! Plus, you can find canned san marzano tomatoes here if you want to venture and make your own pasta sauces. but in light of how good this vodka sauce is, I'm not sure that I'm ever going to want anything else.
