You bet. My kind of place.  So grateful for my son's suggestion. Coming from my  hometown of San Francisco, its nice to find a restaurant that has the old feel without loosing the quality. Great wine suggestion, good prices, just a great atmosphere.  I sat at the counter which is just fine, Tables were filled with happy people not bothered by waiters insistant that they eat and run.  Thats it. They leave you alone to talk, eat, and drink. Thanks.
