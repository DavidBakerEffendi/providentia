Based on the other reviews, I expected to almost see God when I had the food at Soul de Cuba.  As it stands, it was good.  It was good, and I'd go again, but not necessarily with any great anticipation.   The restaurant was cute and well done, made you feel nice and cozy inside.  The wait staff was friendly and competent.  The food was good, not great.  All in all, it was a pleasant experience, "A-OK" as the 3-star rating is described by Yelp. We had a pitcher of the sangria, which I enjoyed.  That was pretty delish, though a tad pricey.  I had the Ropa Vieja, a Cuban classic, and the husband had Soul de Cuba Pollo (I think that's what it was called).  The Ropa Vieja was a bit tough, my jaws were tired by the end of the meal from chewing all that meat, which I had expected to be very tender.  The rice was good and fluffy, but in the end it's just white rice.  And the platanos maduros were fantastic, but they were just a side and 3 little pieces, not exactly making or breaking the entree.  Husband described his food as, "Good, but in the end it was some fried chicken with rice."  We decided that the food was really worth a few bucks less for each entree. So, would we go again?  Yes, but it's not like we can't wait.
