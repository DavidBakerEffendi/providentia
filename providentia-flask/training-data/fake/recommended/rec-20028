I came here on a Friday night with 7 other friends. We knew there was going to be a long wait so we put our name down and went to a bar in the area. The wait was about 3.5 hours for a table of 8 and though this might bother some people, we knew it was going to be about that long and didn't mind going for drinks in the meantime. Once our table was up, they called us on our cell phone and we were seated pretty promptly on arrival. I must say that this place has the best truffle fries I've ever had. Their sweet potato fries were not bad also. I tried the duck burger and the truffle burger. Of the two, I liked the truffle burger more. The duck burger is definitely very unique and the first bite was excellent, but after a while, it got too heavy. My pregnant friend ordered her truffle burger very well done and it came out a little pink so she had to return it. The second time around, they got it right. I'll definitely be back, maybe with a smaller group!
