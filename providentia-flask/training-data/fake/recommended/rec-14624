First off, I love the name of the place.  "Our house" is a cute, welcoming name that goes well with the food inside.  I come here whenever I'm in the neighborhood for karaoke and we want a bite to eat for cheap.  Prices here have a huge range, so you can get whatever fits your wallet. I like the hot food buffet because I can try whatever the heck I feel like, and get as much as I want.  In theory, this lets me save money.  Realistically, I get a lot of food so I spend even more.  Oh well, it's worth it!  A lot of the buffet food is commonplace; nothing you'd find at a higher class Korean restaurant.  But it still tastes amazing. My boyfriend likes the packaged boxes of food.  It comes with steaming hot rice and soup or salad for ~$5.  I don't think I've had a bad tasting meal here, so quality is quite consistent. The seating is quite cramped, but it's not a huge deal.  It's a small sacrifice for cheap food.  The people working here are really nice and accommodating. I gotta say, I just sat here looking through the pictures and now I'm craving some kimchi fried rice.
