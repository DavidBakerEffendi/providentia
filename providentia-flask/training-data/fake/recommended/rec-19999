I love this place, the food, the service, Â and the owner. I had a good experience with all on my first visit, and am glad my husband came back and brought me. My husband enjoyed the popovers, cornbread, fried chicken and waffles. I ordered the housemade pickles to start after seeing a picture of them on Yelp. They were a mix of sweet slices and mild dill with great flavor and perfect presentation. I had the fried chicken, slaw, and subbed mashed potatoes for the waffles. The chicken was moist, had great seasonings in the breading, and perfectly browned. The mashed potatoes weren't burdened with garlic or pesto, just butter, salt, and pepper. The slaw was fresh and peppery. Both great compliments to the chicken. The server was attentive, polite, and accommodating. Doug, the owner, showed a great deal of passion and care. It is no wonder the restaurant is so successful and popular. I cannot wait to go back and bring others who appreciate quality comfort food.
