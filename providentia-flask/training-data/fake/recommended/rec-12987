I happened to see this place featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives a couple of weeks back, I made a note to try it the next time I was in NY, so this was the chance. The place has a old feel to it a little tacky and the tables are a little too close together, but that also adds to the ambience. And who can complain about Gloria Estefan music playing in the background. I ordered the Ropa Vieja with rice and beans. It was delicious but though I hate being critical the tomato sauce is a little overpowering, if you saw my photo its almost a stew, it has a good flavor but the sauce tends to overpower the steak and green peppers that are a part of the dish, having siad that the dish was delicious but compared to Ropa Vieja elsewhere this was just OK. Service was good, I will definitely return and try other dishes. One thing to be aware of which was a little strange is that they only take American Express so make sure to take cash if you dont use Amex. Later....
