Small but intimate dining room gives this place an intimate feel. They ended up bring us the wrong bottle of wine, which was partly my fault for not realizing it before they poured it out. I ordered the lobster cannoli ($22). It was two long rolls that were packed with fresh lobster meat. The waiter recommended that I get it with the vodka sauce, which I did. It was absolutely delicious. She got the gnocchi pasta ($19). That was also delicious. Freshly made. Overall, a fabulous meal.
