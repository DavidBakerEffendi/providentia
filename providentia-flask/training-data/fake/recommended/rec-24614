over rated....very very over rated. the good: 1) cheap 2) nice portions the bad: 1) flavorless chicken 2) OK gyro meat 3) COLD falafel...WHY IS IT COLD? if its a fried dish..it should be fresh or else it would taste like crap when its cold...which it did. i think people love this place so much bc they are drunk.....people should try it again when they are actually sober. Also there are SO many great places to eat in NY..WHYYYYYYY would you choose to go to this food cart..and the line is freaking long. i just dont get it.
