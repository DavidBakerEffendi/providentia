THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU COME HERE.....HORRIBLE SERVICE, FOOD IS AWFUL, MOSTLY HORRIBLE SERVICE THAT YOU WILL NOT ENJOY YOUR FOOD. I have been to this restaurant one other time before tonight's dinner.   Let's start off to say that we went this evening knowing that it will not be as crowded as it usually is, which we were correct.  We were seated right away and they took our orders promptly. We received our appetizers immediately after we ordered them, but the problem began with our main entrees.  It took another 30-40 minutes to receive our entrees.  The other guest to the left and right of us received their main entrees before us, when they arrived and ordered later than we did.  We waited and kept giving the waitress a dirty look as to where the hell our entrees were.  Was our food being flown in from your f*ckn" mother land that we had to wait for the food.  My husband and I should have left already without paying at that point. Finally the waitress noticed that me and checked on our food.  Mind you we only ordered panang curry - one vegetable curry and one chicken dish.  It was nothing special or different from one another - so why did it take so long for the food to come out.  THE FOOD FINALLY CAME OUR AFTER 30-40 MINUTES AND IT WAS SOMEWHAT COLD.  My husband and I only 3-4 spoonsful of the food.  The waitress knew we didn't enjoy our food that she didn't even bother to ask us if everything was okay. So we had the food packed to go, THE DUMB WAITRESS PACKED IT IN A CHINESE CONTAINER  (THE CARDBOARD BOX) THAT WOULD LET THE CURRY SEEP THROUGH THE BROWN BAG AND BY THE TIME WE GOT HOME AND TO STEP OUT OF THE CAR, THE BAG SPILLED OPEN  AND THE FOOD SPILLED OUT AS SOON AS I STEPPED OUT OF THE CAR, ON MY CLOTHING, AND MY POCKETBOOK.  THEY SHOULD PAY FOR MY DRY CLEANING. YOU WANT HORRIBLE SERVICE, THIS IS THE PLACE TO COME.  HORRIBLE SERVERS THAT HAS NO MANNERS AND DOES NOT EVEN CHECK UP ON YOU. JUST FOR THAT I LEFT THEM $2 TIP, WHICH I THINK WAS A  TOOOOOO MUCH TO LEAVE FOR THEIR STUPIDITY AND LAZINESS.
