Olea was outstanding! Initially, we were worried about the wait (host estimated 30-40 minutes over the phone) but instead waited 15 minutes as we sat at the bar and enjoyed some tasty cocktails. The ambience is great; festive and loud, perfect for our noisy Mediterranean family. The decor is great with cushions in booths, and palms interspersed throughout the restaurant giving little private oasis spots, in an otherwise tight space. Our waiter, Malouk was attentive, even though the restaurant was incredibly busy. All of that is wonderful, but even if it wasn't, the food was to die for! I would recommend about 3-4 tapas per person, although it's hard to say which because almost everything was outstanding. I had goat cheese croquettes with red pepper flakes and honey, Spanish "pitza" Â (probably my favorite), the Haloumi, and Romesco dip (probably the only one I would change, though my boyfriend loved it) and we shared a ton of other tapas (so delicious). I would describe all their food as complex and exciting. Flavors would work both harmoniously, and individually in rapid succession, having sweet and savory in beautiful unison. Delicious.
