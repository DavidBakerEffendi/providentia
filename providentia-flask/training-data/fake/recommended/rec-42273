Good thing about this place? The chicken is the best answer for heat seekers looking for punishment. The extra hot is GOOD but you'll pay for it in the end. The bad? I paid cash for a three piece chicken and side and while the waitress gave back my dollar bills from the change, she (at her convenience) did not return any of the coins of my change. While Peaches Hothouse is ok, I've had better times and more dining space (and all of my change) at Peaches which is further down on Lewis Avenue.
