So we drove to Philly over the weekend and wanted to experience what all the rave was about at both Pat's and Geno's (you can find my review for Geno's on their page). Well where do I begin? The location is horrible, such an unsafe neighborhood in an unsafe city, parking was horrendous (we had to park nearly 3 blocks away) and I for one felt really uncomfortable leaving my nice car parked in such a torn down neighborhood. So, we walk over to the stands (they're not restaurants.. just stands where you order food) get in line and wait approx 10 minutes which wasn't bad for a "tourist trap" food stand. The service was horrendous, if you don't know how to order or have your cash in hand you will get scolded told to move away for others (who does this?!?). Once we ordered we walked across the street to an open field and sat on the fence to eat (not enough tables or counter space). We got a "wit provolone" sandwich which was OK at best... the meat was under seasoned and the cheese wasn't properly melted, the bread was the best part, especially after it soaked up some of the juices from the meat. Overall, it was very disappointing, after all the talk and hoopla about this place it truly wasn't anything special. People say "well you go there for the experience" what experience are they talking about? horrible parking, bad smells, rude people and mediocre food?
