I've heard the tales, let's face it men talk , but I maintain my swagger, confident I can handle the heat.  "I'm a Man" I exclaim along with Muddy Waters playing in the background. It starts off pleasantly enough, impressive but I ain't no boy , I can handle it. Then comes the sweats as my pores open up, the clearing of my  unsick sinuses, and .... are my lips getting numb ?  Never one to back down I roll and tumble on until I notice the tears streaming down my cheeks. I give in realizing I can't do this in public, I need to be alone, in private to ravage my fried chicken. Not just any fried chicken but possibly my favorite fried chicken, Peaches HotHouse's take on Nashville hot chicken. Yes it's hot, but it's no one trick pony. It's also delicious, not greasy, quite juicy and the spice goes beyond the skin down to the bone. The mild may lose some heat but none of the flavor. $12 for 3 healthy sized pieces and 1 side are hard to resist. So hard that once after a excellent brunch of ($7.50) oyster po' boy  (not NOLA quality but still good) and sweet potato fries I got envious of the people around me eating chicken that I got an order to take home, for some quality alone time. I consider this a southern-influenced as opposed to traditional southern restaurant. The difference being you won't see potato salad, turkey wings or smothered pork chops on the menu. You will see bacon topping fried green tomatoes and sweet corn and black eye peas salad. While the chicken is the star,  Peaches HotHouse really excels at  being a great restaurant. From the egg scrambles at brunch, to drinks served in mason jars, to the  blues soundtrack ( Taj Mahal, Muddy Waters etc) and pretty affordable prices  it's a near perfect , southern influenced dining spot.
