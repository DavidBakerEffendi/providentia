if you are looking for a casual place to eat a good meal with out a crowd, this is it.  it isnt on Willie b's main strips so Friday night isnt that bad. I had the chorizo burger which is great.   the spicy fries were just as good.  i think that the Friday rush caught the staff off guard but still it was handled fairly well
