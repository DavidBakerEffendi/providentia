This place is great.  So far the best cheesesteak I've had in Philly. And the staff is really friendly too! The downsides are that it is cash only (relatively common in Philly), and personally I think their steaks are somewhat lacking flavor. The meat quality is pretty decent and reasonable. I do encounter the occasional gross chunk of fat.  Still I think it'd the best in the roxborough area by far, and absolutely recommend it.
