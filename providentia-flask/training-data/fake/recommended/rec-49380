Had falafel bowl and the food was wonderful: very smooth hummus that I even tried to order a take-out afterwards, brown rice was very properly cooked, chewy, mixed with soft chick peas, and the falafel balls so crisp outside & flavorful and tender inside. Great deal for NYU students (10% off) and "falafel Friday". I'll definitely come back very soon ...
