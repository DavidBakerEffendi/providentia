A solid Italian restaurant.  Farm house chic interior accents over raw brick walls.  Noise is a nice burble of conversation.  Relaxing.  The food was good.  The daily specials included 3 salads and a soup.  All with fresh in season ingredients.  The pasta was made fresh that day and portions were a little large.  I would suggest splitting a main plate.  Wine selection is decent however prices are definitely restaurant and soho inflated.   Yes I would go back.
