One of the best mexican restaurants I've tried! 5 star service, very friendly staff. The food tasted very authentic and the meat was cooked perfectly, a lot of mexican places tend to over cook chicken and beef that was not the case here! The chocolate pudding for dessert was great, drinks are awesome. Will for sure go back. Also thought it was funny how the Yelp cover photo for Fonda is sone woman's boobs with some food....
