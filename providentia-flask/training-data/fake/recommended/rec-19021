Jadis is such a neighborhood gem. A small wine bar in a rustic setting with exposed brick walls and low ceilings, it's super romantic and cozy. My boyfriend took me here as a surprise date, and we both had such a wonderful time. We started off with a few glasses of white wine, and took a while to order but didn't feel rushed at all. When we did finally order, we weren't sure what some of the cheeses on the menu were but our waitress was really helpful with recommendations. We wound up with a selections of cheeses and meats that were delish, as well as some olives that really hit the spot. We wound up ordering MORE food - the mushroom risotto puffs, which were out of this world, and the bacon wrapped scallops which were also very good (though slightly overcooked). And when we wanted to order a bottle of wine but couldn't decide, the waitress brought us a few different types to try so we could pick - so helpful! In the end, we spent a couple hours here and had such a great time! And to top it all off, our waitress wound up sending over a free dessert - creme brulee, one of my faves - at the end of the night. If you live downtown or are looking for a cozy romantic date spot, or somewhere chill to have wine and catch up with friends, I'd definitely check out Jadis.
