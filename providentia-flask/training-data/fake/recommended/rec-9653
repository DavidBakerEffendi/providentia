So packed and so small! The food was delicious, must admit, but I was literally rubbing shoulders with the person next to me and I was there with a friend and we literally could hear the entire conversation of the couple that was next to us. I get that New York restaurants are like that, but it was just too much, especially when everyone is wearing huge oversized winter coats and looking for places to store them since there are no backs to the seats. Ugh! But anyways, I digress. The pad thai was pretty delicious and the service was spectacular which is why they are getting 4 stars. Although, we were packed, the server made sure to stop by and ask occasionally how we were doing and if we needed anything. In addition, we didn't even wait THAT long. It was Thursday around 7:00pm and we were told the wait would be 40 minutes, it was more like 20 minutes (party of 2). So they seemed to move pretty fast! Just be prepared to be in a compact space!
