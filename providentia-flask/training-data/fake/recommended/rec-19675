Frequent this place, but had to down grade to 3 stars due to the declining quality of food. Despite variety, the food just don't taste as good as I first visited years ago. I consider Woorijip the equivalent of a pricy Deli or MickeyD that serves alcohol. (They do check ID.) Pro: Self service saves time."eat & learn Korean" placemat is cute. Like that there are variety of rice cake sweets. Facility is kept & smells free from odor. If u can't find a table to sit down, ask to share one. con: $6.99/lb buffet is a bit stiff. We were disappointed that the vegetables in the buffet were COLD. Good luck finding a table during lunch time. It is so crowded that the street outside seemed spacious. Alcohol and drinks are pricy. Patrons are usually rude and loud, so is the background noise. Minimum credit card charge is $10. I usually get my cellophane noodles $3.50 Â and kimchi egg free pancake $3.50 from the take out to avoid paying through the nose for the cold-vegetable buffet.
