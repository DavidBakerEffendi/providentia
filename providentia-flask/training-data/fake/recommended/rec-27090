I had never been there before, and I went with a Yelp deal ($10 for $20 certificate). My girlfriends and I went for lunch and the owner served us himself. He was very pleasant and accommodating, and we had everything we needed immediately. They even served great fresh bread before lunch (and I'm a carb-junkie so I was extremely happy about this!). I ordered a panini (I sort of made my own, which he was fine with), and it was the size of the entire dinner plate. It didn't come with a side, but I honestly didn't need it, I had to take half of the sandwich home. My friends ordered the chicken caesar wrap (with a huge portion of amazing french fries), and the tri-color salad with grilled chicken. The food was great, the service was excellent, and we loved that we were able to sit and enjoy our conversation without any pressure to pay and leave. The owner even brought us a complimentary lemon-filled biscotti, which was great! I will definitely be returning soon!
