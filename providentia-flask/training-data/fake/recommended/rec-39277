I miss Papa Frank's. When I lived in Burlington this was a great place to go for "American-style" Italian food. It's nothing fancy, just a great little hole in the wall pizza joint with comfort food. I know it's hard to compare Papa Frank's when you've had Italian food in the bigger East Coast cities. My advice to you, don't. Just enjoy the restaurant for what it is, you will like it.
