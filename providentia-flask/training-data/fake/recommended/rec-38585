I've been here a couple times, and I'm always impressed with the beer selection.  There are lots of interesting beers to choose from, and they seem to do a good job of selecting the beers appropriately for the season. I definitely enjoyed my food (a tomato-mozzarella sandwich that was on special), and the others in my part liked theirs as well (definitely a thumbs-up vote for the mussels).  A fun atmosphere.  It was pretty packed on a Thursday, so I imagine it really fills out on the weekends. Some of the desserts (vanilla beignets) looked awesome, but unfortunately didn't have room!
