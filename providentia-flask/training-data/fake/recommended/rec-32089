On my first visit to New Haven I had to try Claire's Corner Copia. For lunch the curried chicken salad was delicious as was the middle-eastern spiced chick pea soup. Enjoyed them with a super - healthy smoothie. Went back for a breakfast of whole wheat pancakes with lots of sliced banana, split & fried Tofurky sausage links (yum) & a good cup of java. Will be back once more to get some of their famous Lithuanian coffee cake to take home!
