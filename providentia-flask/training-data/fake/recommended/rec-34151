On of my favorite restaurants in all of New York--not just Brooklyn but all of New York City. Menu changes daily and consists of local food from the region. This keeps things interesting but only works because you can rest assure that whatever is offered will be incredibly fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is very neighborhoody and cozy and the staff is knowledgeable. I try to go once each season as not only is the menu distinctive but the feel of the places evolves to reflect the feeling of the season, as does the large tree right outside the entrance. Â A bit pricey so plan your visit accordingly as you'll want to splurge when you settle into this park slope gem.
