DELICIOUS Mexican - great service - great food presentation - great ingredients - great food - great decor... All for pretty modest mid-range prices. Kind of surprising. Lately, seems like Mexican is only best when it's dirt cheap and super authentic in that back-of-a-truck taco kinda way, and really disappointing when it's anything else (especially "high end" (hahahahahahaha) Mexican....) But this place is great, and middle of the road price wise. Came here for dinner on a Friday night. The vibe is very warm, and the decor is modern (white everything) with a pixie dusting of Mexican rustic. The staff are friendly and helpful. I never had to ask for anything, water filled, all needs attended to. For apps, the Guac is great. And when you ask for it hot, it ACTUALLY comes hot. Miracle it would seem in NYC... Their salsa trio is homemade, flavorful, fresh and delicious. As are their tortilla chips. The tomatillo salsa Oh Em Gee, I want to pile this onto everything! Chile Relleno - delicious. Not overbreaded or overfried, filled with legit queso blanco. And delicious corn/rice combo on the side. Flan for dessert - I'd give theirs a 9 out of 10. Bonus points for visible vanilla bean specs... ...and all of these came marvelously presented. And get their margaritas too! We had a tamarind one, and one with Â cucumber/peppers. Really surprised that both were really great and well matched to the food.
