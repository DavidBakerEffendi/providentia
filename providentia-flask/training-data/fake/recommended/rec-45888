I go here for work lunches, and would have no problem going here 1-2 times/wk. They have a lunch special where you get an appetizer/entree for 8 bucks. I've even brought coworkers here who've never had Thai food before and they loved it. They have vegetarian duck, tofu, and will double up the veggies for you if that's how you're feeling. They have brown rice, too. LOVE. The space is big enough to have a large party, and they're fairly good about getting you in/out the door.
