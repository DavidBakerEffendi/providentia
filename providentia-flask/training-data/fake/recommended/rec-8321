Some of the best Ethiopian food I've had. Everything was delicious. The lentil sambusa was great.   The coffee is also wonderfully unique, spiced with cardamom.  We had three people and shared the feast for 3. It was enough for us, but we did have the appetizer as well.  The food was so vibrant and delicious. We are not vegan/vegetarian but we did not miss anything. Even our guest, who was not enthralled about the idea of visiting a vegan restaurant, left saying that she was impressed and would return.  From speaking to the staff, it sounds like they will get their liquor license soon. I will definitely be returning here.
