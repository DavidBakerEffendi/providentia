Cheap drinks. This was a local bar that had a line on a Tuesday at 7pm. Â The food wasn't the greatest. If you're a local that's looking for a good bar (meaning cheap drinks) and want to grab a bite then go here. The party next to us said the bar was featured on Food network. If this was true then it definitely contributed to the bars popularity.
