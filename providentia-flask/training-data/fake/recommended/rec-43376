What's not to like?   The restaurant's a great back-up, and I mean that as a complement.  It's a big space and has plenty of seating, so it's relatively easy to get a reservation.  The atmosphere is energetic but relaxed, and the decor is simple and peaceful.  It's an excellent date spot, has a big room for large groups, works well for friends and family.  The food is delicious and inventive, although the drinks are a tad lackluster.  I would particularly recommend dinner, as their brunch is a little more standard, and you can probably get a similar brunch for a few dollars less.   All together, it's a great spot.  It's flexible enough that it can work for nearly any occasion, so if you're waiting around, just hoping something will open up at Laconda Verde or Grammercy Tavern, it's probably worth keeping a reservation at Public in reserve.  It's a win-win situation.
