The food was really tasty and you can tell they used good ingredients. However, was it a mind blowing delicious meal? For all the hype on yelp, naw it wasn't. I was also hoping for a ropa vieja dish and didn't find one. A cuban restaurant that prides on it's culture yet has no ropa vieja?? Most dishes are mexican. haha, which is cool, i enjoy mexican, tex-mex food. But from the name of the restaurant I was expecting more authentic cuban dishes. I found the prices to be a little more than average. This place is obvious that it is meant to serve the more than average wealthy hipster, then the common folk people. The place has great decoration. The ambiance is great. Too bad it draws a certain crowd of people, and not a socio-economically diverse community.
