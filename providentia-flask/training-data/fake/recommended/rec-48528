I was here for dinner, and the 25$ meal was delicious, well except for the dessert [something sorbet with peach], which is really hard to cut. Whatever they did to the cookie thing was not right, sorbet was sweet But the duck was good in general, part of the meat were not consistently cooked. However it was still an excellent dish. The spinach artichoke is rich and favorable; the goat cheese was paired with the spinach artichoke is decent. Service was good and attentive. I will recommend people about this place.
