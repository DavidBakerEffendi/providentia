I hate to give this place such a low a rating but the food is scary. The downstairs space they have is wonderful. Great place to have a beer.   However, stay away from their food! I ordered the chicken if it had just been bad bar food I probably wouldn't be writing this but after the second bite I wasn't even sure if the chicken was safe to eat. Otherwise frozen vegetables and instant mashed potatoes for a price of close to 15 bucks. My wife got a sandwich which was edible but disappointing.   The waitress who was far from attentive, even though I think we were about one of three tables at the time, ignored the fact that my chicken was barley touched.
