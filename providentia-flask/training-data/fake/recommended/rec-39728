When friends invited me to Yerba Buena, I was immediately excited by the name because of the popular yerba mate in Argentina (like as popular as Starbucks in the US).  As a pisco sour fan, I wasted no time in ordering a yerba infused pisco cocktail.  It is incredible.  Get it and drink it.  Overall, cocktails are creative, south american influenced and diverse.  For dinner, we went with four people and sampled most of the appetizers for dinner.  We had plaintains, potato croquettes, chicken empanadas, hamachi ceviche, tilapia tacos, and choclo (that huge kerneled peruvian corn).  The ceviche and choclo were favorites, but everything was delicious and happily devoured.  Only complaint?  No reservations, so expect a wait (tragically, at the bar with a yerba pisco cocktail in hand).  It is too small for big groups, but 2-4 is ideal.  If the wait it too long, try "Supper" kitty corner from the restaurant, which is also great and does not take reservations.
