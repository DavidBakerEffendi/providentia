We went to Walter Foods on one of those night where you get the barbecue just as the last burger gets spoken for and all that's left are the discount hot dogs. And you're with a vegetarian. Walter Food saved the day with a killer burger, a warm beet salad for the veggie, piles of oysters, and a great list of classic and creative cocktails. We sat in the yard to revive that BBQ feel, only if your friend's BBQ was Â in a gorgeous and clean. And the servers? As welcoming and full of banter as your most gregarious BBQ host.
