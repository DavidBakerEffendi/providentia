Let me say that if you are trying to look for a fusion inspired dining vibe. This place is the one you should seek. Located in East Rutherford, NJ this Asian-Spanish fusion with BYOB drinks are perfect for those spontaneous date nights, GNO (girls night out), bachelorette dinners, and whatever you have in mind. The ambiance is on point with their rich fusion of color and decor. Some tables provide comfy couches along the restaurant walls (and they are super comfy) with tea lights to give it a comfy outdoor look and feel. Their music simply makes you want to do salsa's and bachata's in your seat. Service and Staff were great with taking your orders to refilling your water every so often. The only con I have to say about this place are the prices of the food. In my opinion, for the price I paid I know I could have gotten a little bit more. I've had several spanish style dishes and certainly the prices could have been altered in my opinion. Overall, food was ok and in conclusion my rating of 4/5 stars went mostly through service and ambiance. Happy Eats!
