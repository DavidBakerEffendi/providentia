Great little gem in the Fidi area! I have a soft corner for all things Irish, but this was indeed a good find. The Irish inspired menu is for-loss-of-a-better-word, yummy. We had the chicken pot pie and zucchini fritters. I know it's fried, and fried food always tastes good, but it takes more than just that to make grated zucchini taste so good! Also tried a ginger flavored beer from a selection called pop-inns - amazing! refreshing, crisp and perfectly chilled for a warm evening. The place itself is dimly lit and with saw wood strewn on the floor, gives a well balanced rustic feel. There is also a more sophisticated cocktail bar upstairs that serves just the appetizers. Dress if you may, or go in pajamas, the place embraces you in either form with open arms. Loved it. Will be back, and again..and again. You get the point.
