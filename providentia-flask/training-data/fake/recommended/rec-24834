Came here after a concert at the pier (walking distance and I would suggest walking with a group if you do) but breezed right past it before realizing we walked too far, maybe it was because we were on the other side of the street? I'm not sure who's at fault, but I'm like a moth to a light and I saw some christmas lights on a tree, and started walking towards it and it was the beer garden! score! It was a nice venue with the entire building indoor/outdoor sections connected in a large open space. After entering the place you'll hit the courtyard with an open roof, lit up trees, and gravel which is pretty and perfect for a summer night. This place also has ping pong tables which is kinda cool. We sat at a table near the ping pong and I thought we would be safe because we were sitting at the far end, but the people playing were a little competitive and we became the victims of some flying balls. The beer selection was decent, but not as expansive as other beer gardens I have been to. Bar tenders were pretty nice and helpful in deciding new beers to try. Price was as expected for a beer garden. WARNING: they don't sell pitchers of beer. Also, I went on a Monday night, and I could hear the crickets. We got there around 11 and there was about 10 people which I guess might be good for a weekday. I would definitely come back and try it during the weekend.
