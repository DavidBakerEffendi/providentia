I don't understand how there are so many negative reviews! I eat at Sakura pretty regularly, either with my friends or my boyfriend. The food is always good, and I've always had very attentive wait staff. For people who are newer to sushi, I usually recommend the Alaska Rolls, Salmon Sashimi, and any of their vegetarian sushi roll options. The teriyaki, tempura, and Hibachi are all very good. The hibachi showmanship is fun but usually the same each time. But you can get hibachi dishes even if you're eating in the dining room. Sakura recently changed their menu, and even though one of their old appetizer items was no longer available the waitress still convinced the chef to make it for me. To be honest there are only two "negative" things I've ever had. On one occasion, a waitress misunderstood something I asked for. She promptly replaced it. The only other thing was that it was busy a few nights ago and my take out took a little longer than expected.
