Kefi = greek for tasty in my universal translator. Try getting the dipping spread plate for the table and everyone will be happy after the long wait for a table. The spreads are 'unique' They remind you of tzatziki or hummus, but, different (in a good way). Typically a bit more sour then the standards. This place is always popular. I have been here a couple times, and everyone I have been with has been a fan. I had the ravioli and the egglant 'falafel pita.' I felt the falafel could have been cooked more thoroughly and there should have been more of the 'white crack sauce' to balance the dry-ness. I really wished I could have switched the forgettable fries for something else without paying an extra $2. The ravioli was scrumptious, including the fried onion toppings. All my friends raved about the meat dishes, including the steak and the fish. All 'must gets.'
