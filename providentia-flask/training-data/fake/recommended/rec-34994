I've been eating at this local "red sauce joint" for 15 years, and I've never had a truly bad meal ... until last night. Maybe it was just too crowded, or perhaps the huge interconnected party table directly behind us overwhelmed the kitchen. I will admit that the overflowing plates of Chicken Parm and Rigatoni w/Vodka Sauce that were delivered to those tables ... looked mighty delicious. Unfortunately, everything we ordered was awful, from the boring, tasteless $8.50 Arugula Salad; to the Pizza w/Bacon; and the Grilled Chicken w/Pasta & Eggplant Parmesan Special. Even the normally delicious fresh Italian Bread arrived at the table way too late after we sat down, and it was quite burnt. Overall, the entire meal service was incredibly slow. We actually sent the Chicken Special back; and we substituted our old standby of Grilled Chicken w/Saut√©ed Spinach. Yucch ... The two chicken breasts were dry and tasteless, and the spinach lacked its traditional garlicky zest. And why the normally hefty portions all seemed much smaller than usual, I have no idea. However, the prices on the menu seemed to be at least 15% higher across the board than the last time we dined there, a few weeks before. As you know, it's "Cash Only" at Reservoir. Let's hope "the Boss" isn't making a final blitz to stuff the mattresses in his McMansion with cash ... before he opts to ride off into the sunset. Not sure what's going on at the bottom of The Reservoir? For now, I'll chalk it up to a crappy, overcrowded Friday night. Guess I'll just have to cross my fingers, and try again a few weeks from now.
