Getting a cheesesteak from Pat's is like getting cioppino from a place on Pier 39 in San Francisco. It won't be bad, but there's better stuff out there that doesn't have the name recognition. Don't get me wrong, the cheesesteak is good at Pat's, there's just way better ones out there. Do a cheesesteak crawl and you'll see. The meat was better than Geno's, but i like crustier bread. I've been in to Pat's 3 times (not bad for someone who lives on the West Coast), and I'll probably go back to show it to people who haven't been, but I found where my heart lies :)
