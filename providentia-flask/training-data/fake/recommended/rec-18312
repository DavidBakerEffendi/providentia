Good Dog is one of my favorite bars in Philly.  They have an excellent beer selection which changes pretty frequently.   Their food is awesome -- I usually go with the Good Dog burger which is off the charts.  This place has a great vibe - ususally pretty crowded and dark inside, there are 3 floors as well.  If you get there at the right time you may be able to score a booth downstairs which is great.   Overall - great food, great beers, great spot!
