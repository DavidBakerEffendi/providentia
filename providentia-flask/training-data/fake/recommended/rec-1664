This place has terrible reviews, but is the best Americanized Chinese I've found in the area. The prices are low, the service is god, and the food hits the spot. The dining room is small and a bit dingy (I usually get takeout, though). It would be 3 stars if not for the fact it's so much better than the others nearby.
