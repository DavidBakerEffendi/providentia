Have been here only twice due to the prices. I am particularly a huge fan of the fresh oysters and always crave more. The sweet potato fries and its dip are also excellent. I ordered the wasabi tuna last time and it was too much on the thick, steaky side for me. Not very easy to eat, but that may simply be due to the fish. I also was not a big fan of the wasabi sauce, not sure it went so well Â My boyfriend ordered the charred mahi mahi which was much better and is of course a much more tender fish. It is very loud and crowded here and sometimes the service can be slow (it really took a lot of effort on our part to get the server to come to our table to give us our check for example). The fish is super fresh though and this is definitely one of the better places to go out in Princeton. I hope to go back soon and to improve my rating!
