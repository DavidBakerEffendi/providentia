I love this place.  I've tried a couple different breakfasts here (cheese grits and the nicoise breakfast), and they're both really great.  I've also had some excellent soups and I swear by the vegan TLT on nights when I get home from work too tired to cook.  Great coffee, great pickles, excellent sides, and their commitment to local and organic food, not to mention really interesting cooking, make Brooklyn Commune one of the best restaurants in Brooklyn.
