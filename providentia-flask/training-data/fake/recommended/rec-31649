Thai is one of my favorite cuisines so I'm very critical of Thai restaurants. Tuptim did not disappoint. I came here on a Wednesday night for dinner with a friend. I had the Shrimp Pad Thai (my favorite dish). The dish was flavorful and had just enough spiciness. I appreciate the fact that our server asked what level of spiciness I preferred as well as if I had any nut allergies. The portions was enough for dinner that night and lunch the next day. I also ordered the Thai Iced Tea which was perfect. This will definitely be my "go-to" Thai place in the area.
