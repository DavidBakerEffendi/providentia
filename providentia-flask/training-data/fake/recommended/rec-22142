I'm pretty sure this is my favorite restaurant in all of Manhattan. No one likes to wait about an hour and a half for a table but this is the ONE place where I think it might be worth it. So sit or stand at the bar and order a leche martini - on a weeknight you can also get 2 for 1 Japanese. Use your time at the bar to get ready to be stuffed full of Ramen goodness! Start off with the Pork Buns. Although you go there for the ramen, these are out of this world. To this day, I can't figure out how they keep the buns so moist. As for Ramen, The Classic and The Akamaru Modern are both AMAZING! I always order it with the pork belly and extra hot paste. Don't expect to do much after you leave, Ippuddo always leaves you completely full and ready to fall into a food coma.
