I have loved this place since I moved here four years ago and their new location is terrific!  Because it's such a neighborhood favorite and they only seat complete parties, you may find yourself waiting for a table, but it is more than worth it.  Also, you can wait at the bar and sample some of their excellent adult beverages! Honestly, I have a lot of favorites here.  First, their chicken mole is out of this world!  The mole sauce is the perfect blend of sweet, salty and spicy and served with rice and also tortillas, this dish is perfection.  Second, their tortilla soup is the best I've ever had.  I can't say enough good things, really.  It can be a meal in itself if you are not ravenously hungry (as I usually am), but it's just excellent.  Third, their huevos rancheros are an amazing brunch item.  I almost licked my plate clean.  Fourth, and last, their salads are wonderful as well!  Strange to be recommending salad at a mexican joint - and this is not a taco salad - but the dressing and avocado make this an excellent choice. Just go.
