Was in town for a work trip and am SO glad we stopped here. The server made excellent suggestions, including fan favorites and dishes he thought we'd like. We loved everything, including the delicious cocktails as well. They also allowed us to sit outside with our dog. Will definitely be back again next Philly trip!
