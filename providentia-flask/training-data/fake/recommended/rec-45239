Yuck! I called in an order of nachos for pick up, I walked in to an empty restaurant on a Sunday evening that smelled of stale beer and mold. I waited an additional 7 minutes for nachos, no idea why it took so long considering there was no one else there to prepare food for. Anyway, got my food, went home, open it up and I had a plate of stale chips, with a sprinkle (actually, less than a sprinkle) or cheese, old soggy lettuce and a glob of sour cream.. oh and jalapenos just plopped on top! It was utterly disgusting! I ate two bites and threw it out! Waste of time and money!
