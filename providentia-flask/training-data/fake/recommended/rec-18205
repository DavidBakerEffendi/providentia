Get the Greek.  Just get it.  It's easily among the best in the city...far better than Kanella, for instance, and at one third the price.  The food is spectacular.  We had the chickpeas, the daily special (stuffed eggplant), and the stuffed tomato/stuffed pepper.  The first two were the best, but the stuffed tomato and pepper were pretty darn good in their own right. The decor is nice.  The service is friendly and competent but not always up on what's available on the Greek side of the menu.  The real problem is that there's not enough separation between the dining area and the bar, so you have to tolerate some drunk student chatter that's fairly muffled but still noticeable in the background.  It's tolerable, but given the out-of-this-world food, it would be nice if the ambiance were equally upscale.
