Such a fun, casual, and modern place with unique dishes and beverages. (Also great service!) I don't think they have any normal beverage, like coke. I forgot the name but they have something similar to coke. Also they had beers that I've never heard of, such as mother's milk. It was fun choosing and trying them out for the first time. They give you bacon fat popcorn as a snack and I can eat this popcorn for hours. Tasty snack means awesome food. I ordered several tapas and they all tasted amazing. Pork in the pork buns were so tender and flavorful and other dishes were also fresh. I was satisfied. They had unique ice cream flavors. I had wasabi which actually didn't taste bad at all. It was more like a sorbet. Chai ice cream was really really good. I tried miso ice cream too and it really tasted like miso which was not a good ice cream flavor but it was for fun so my friend and I kinda laughed about it. I heard that their menu changes every season so I'm probably gonna go back for some new dishes with my friend. Definitely recommend it to everyone.
