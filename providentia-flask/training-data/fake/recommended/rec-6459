Underwhelming is the only word I can think of to describe this place. My girlfriend and I came here wit high expectations, we had heard great things and the yelp reviews were convincing. So we get there and were awkwardly greeted and told we could sit wherever we wanted. We had a nice seat outside (which was by far the best part of this meal, the table). We were promptly brought bread with balsamic and oil. Quality was fine, but nothing to write home about. We ordered the mushroom salad, the scallop special, and the pasta with ragu. Each course was more disappointing than the last. The mushroom salad was by far my favorite, however it was flavorless. The scallop special sounded fantastic, but it turned out to be a crostini rather than a scallop dish (which was not clarified in the description), flavor again was fine but It needed something more, spices or salt or something. The pasta was overall the most disappointing. The restaurant prides itself in being homemade but nothin about this dish tasted homemade. If you'd have told me this was from a jar I would have been more impressed. The staff, while not bad was quite odd. They took the oil and vinegar on and off the table at least 4 times. They attempted to clear our plates before we finished eating, which we promptly vetoed. Instead they actually cleared our plates while the last bite was literally still in our mouths. While it's not the worst place I've ever been, I would never go back here. The best parts were sitting outside and the fact that the prices are cheap, but then gain I guess you get what you pay for.
