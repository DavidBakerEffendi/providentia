Some of the best cart meat I've had.  I tried the chicken, sausage, steak, and lamb.  This may be a surprise, but the chicken is where it's at. We're talking marinated then char whole chicken breast, sliced right in front of you for your order.  Had it with both bbq and hot sauces and it was tender, moist, and flavorful.  Not usual cart food here! The line may take a little while so bring a lunch mate.  You'll notice that no one around you complains - they seem to know it's worth the wait!
