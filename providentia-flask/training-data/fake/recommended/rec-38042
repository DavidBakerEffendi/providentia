Apparently things have changed here - a lot - since my last visit.  I went twice in one week and LOVED the food.  The scallops were fantastic, perfectly cooked with a delicious sauce, and the brussel sprouts with bacon were delicious.  Then I took my fiance back there for the lobster fest - I think it was $25 for 3 courses - really good.  Lobster slider app was great, they had 5 choices for lobster entrees (3 were split with different seasonings, 1 whole or lobster mac and cheese), and dessert.  We ate in the bar area so were able to take advantage of the great martini specials at happy hour.  And both times the service was fantastic - so a big difference from my first visit.  Can't want to go back!
