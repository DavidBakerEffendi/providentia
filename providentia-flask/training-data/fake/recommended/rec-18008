Crispy and warm bread. Delicious Olive paste.The salad had vegetables cut to perfection and the surprisingly good accent was the pumpkin seed dust. The fish was perfectly cooked and the skin ( which is not my Cup of tea ) was fried enough to enrich the flavor. The carrot puree was very tasty without being too buttery. The sorbet, in three different flavors, was a refresh and digestive combination. All this beautifully presented with a very good service and elegant atmosphere. The not so good note was for the espresso. The choice of coffee grains was too acidic and not enough foam. The cost benefit analysis was fantastic and I highly recommend Juni! Alice B.
