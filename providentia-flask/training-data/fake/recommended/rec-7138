The burgers here are good and the place is cute but I just can't stomach waiting over an hour for a burger.  Yes, it's in a location with tons of bars to fill your time but my expectations are always higher when waits are involved. And I had some issues with my meal aside from the wait.  In terms of positives, I thought the meat was incredible, cooked medium rare and tender and juicy. And the flavors were good but I didn't get as much of the umami experience I would have expected from a place with umami in its name.  I had the original, the manly burger, truffle fries and the pickle plate.  The original was good, however, the main flavors were the meat and the parmesan crisp.  I had difficulty seeing or tasting any evidence of the mushroom and roasted tomato and while I saw the ketchup, it didn't taste any different from normal ketchup to me because the flavor of the parmesan crisp overpowered it.  The manly burger was very smoky and delicious but with those ingredients, you can't really go wrong.  The burgers are definitely very good, however, I expected more umami flavor particularly with the original.  Also, my truffle fries were COA (cold on arrival).  If I was craving a burger one day and could just stop by and pick up a burger with no wait and bring it home, I would revisit this place but I don't think I'm inclined to return with these wait times!
