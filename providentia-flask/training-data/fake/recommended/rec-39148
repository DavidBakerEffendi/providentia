Second stop on the Magical Mystery Tour found me in a line waiting for some Halal (which I kept pronouncing "Khe-lel"). Ordering was easy, meat on rice.  Extra sauce.  Please keep the dog away from the cart. Actually eating the food proved to be an adventure in of itself.  The plate was so hot I had to place it on the bench and squat like how my people do when they play cards.  But when the food hits your lips, it's so GOOD. Very savory.  Very hot.  And about 3 minutes into it VERY SPICY. The hot sauce has to be some sort of mix of chilis and napalm, so dumping the entire thing into my bowl was not the smartest thing I've ever done.  Somehow I got a bit on my nose and there was a slow burning that lasted until I was able to wash it off half an hour later. San Diego needs to get a bunch of these set up, because I could do this every night and not get tired of it.
