it's just ok, and WAY over priced... in the sandwich department, I've tried the chicken meatball sandwich with Alfredo sauce and beef meatballs with marinara and provolone... the chicken was more exciting.  in the sides/salad department I've had the spinach with beans and the Cesar salad.  all items again over priced for the amount and quality.  the only item I actually liked were the spinach and beans, but that alone will not keep me going back for more. sorry...
