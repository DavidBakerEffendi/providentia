You're better off going to Taco Bell. Ever since this place opened up I wanted to go. I finally got the chance but I was very disappointed. From the outside the place looks gorgeous. It looks like a high-end restaurant from the outside. From the inside it's terrible. Nothing about the inside of the restaurant is high-end besides Prices. The food is terrible. Straight up nasty. I got a burrito and Tamale. Tamale was disgusting. I literally almost puked. The only good food was the fried ice cream that i had for desert. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone!!!! Think of this restaurant as a high-end Taco Bell with super expensive nastier food!
