MY NEW FAVORITE BREAKFAST/LUNCH SPOT(even tho I live out in queens)! Went in at about 11 on a regular monday so it wasnt more than a 5 min wait, thats probably different at peak times as the other reviews say. Small place, Great food, Good Service, reasonably priced menu, weird hipster-esc photos and painting, and did i mention GREAT FOOD! Finally tired out Chicken and Waffles and I could not have been more delighted to have ordered and consumed this fluffy waffle from heaven that was topped with a fresh fried chicken that was smothered with some amazing gravey, the gf had "The Big Boy" which was 2 eggs, bacon,2 pancakes, home fries and corn bread which was equally amazing. They do offer spiked milkshakes that we didnt get a chance to try maybe next time. I'll be back for the steak and eggs!
