Came here because people in town recommended this place. The lasagna was huge and delicious, but the mountain of their homemade sauce (not sure which sauce) was too salty for my taste. The rum cake is pretty good. The meal is overall good and the food is very reasonably priced. There is no reserved parking for the restaurant, but luckily we were there after 5PM...no need to put money in the meters in the rear parking lot.
