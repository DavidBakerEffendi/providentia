The home of the hamburger.  It's brilliant really.  No frills, just meat.  History surrounds you as you sink your teeth into the juicy patty perfected over 120 years. Plain and simple, don't ask for ketchup.  You don't need it anyway.  The cheeseburger with tomato and onion is what I would recommend.   Catch them during non-peak times and the staff will be happy to BS with you, whether you've been there 1000 times or never before.  Amazing atmosphere.
