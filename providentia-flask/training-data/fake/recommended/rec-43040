Beyoglu is one of my favorite restaurants in New York.  I've been here both by myself, where I sat at the bar, ordered a glass of wine and a few appetizers and chatted with the friendly bartender and the people next to me, and also with my "foody" friends, all of whom have loved it.  The atmosphere can't be beat--lively, colorful and friendly--the food is to die for, the wine is great and the service is always excellent.  It's always crowded but I've never made a reservation and have always been able to get a table after a brief wait at the bar.  I couldn't recommend it more.
