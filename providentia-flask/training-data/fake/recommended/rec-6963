I recently made the discovery of this little chinese place in West Windsor near the train station. It is in a tiny run down strip mall located near the tracks. The wooden banister is rotten and there was a sign that said to not touch it. The outside was a dump. However, the inside was a little better.  This place is small, just a few tables and a bunch of booths and smaller booths that seat 2 people. The place wasn't really new looking like you would expect from a new restaurant but it was decent and clean enough. I also didn't appreciate that they serve hot food in plastic bowls with plastic chopsticks. This is a huge no-no for me... Why have chinese joints not made the change? Don't they know that toxic from plastic leaches into what you're eating? I hope they upgrade their bowls/chopsticks soon. What they lack in decor and ambiance they made up for in food. The soup dumplings were very good. They serve 6 per order. The inside was very good with flavorful broth, but the skin was not as tender as other soup buns that I've had but still very good. The beef noodle soup was flavorful with the beef falling apart as I bit into it. The broth needed a bit more flavor though. The chicken with hot peppers was very spicy (which I love)  and flavorful. The peppers were fresh and not over cooked. However, there was something gritty in the dish... kind of like sand, did the chefs not wash the vegetables well enough? The dish would've been perfect besides that. But I am willing to try the dish again to see if it was a one time thing. The service was attentive enough albiet, I had to hunt down the owner to get another bowl of rice. Overall, I would definitely be coming back to try out some of the other dishes. I hope they are just as flavorful and good as my first visit! Just please upgrade from your plastic bowls/chopsticks and keep the sand out of the dishes... if they do that I can see myself  coming here weekly.
