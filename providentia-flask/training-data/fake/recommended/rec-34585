The food is incredibly fresh & delicious, all hand made, and  no preservatives. They have a friendly staff & a fantastic Human Resource Manager. I would recommend the shrimp roll , unda chicken, and the Mango Lassi. AAAAAAAAmmazingggg !!I give them an  A+ on food and staff. 5 star, would recommend for catering!
