Went here late on New Year's Day for dinner.  We were seated right away, the inside is comfy and adequate.  Waiter quickly stopped by for drink order, had a beer and Sangria.  Sangria has whiskey which I did not like.  For food we had a pizza (spicy fennel sausage) and veggie lasagna.  Both plates were great, the pastas are small portion size so be prepared.  Good place, recommend going.
