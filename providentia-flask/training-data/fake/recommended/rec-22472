It was University City Dining Days and time to head to Vientiane Café.  Vientiane Café is named after the capital and largest city in Laos and it is a fantastic Laotian restaurant.  It also serves northern Thai food as the two cuisines can be very related. Café Vientiane began life as a word-of-mouth unlicensed speakeasy restaurant in University City before more than ten years ago getting licensed and moving to its current location on Baltimore Avenue.  In fact it has expanded into the building next door.  The staff are always accommodating and friendly and the dining room has an airy attractiveness about it.  But it's the food that takes center stage here. Tam som is Laos's famous green papaya salad which has also entered the cuisines of the other southeast Asian countries.  (In Thailand, you reverse the word order and call the dish som tam.)  Vientiane Cafe's version is awesome.  I could eat this every day of the week.  The Laotian main course of Pad Kee Mao or more popularly named "Drunken Noodles" was just as excellent.  So many different flavors melding together to produce a symphony of tastiness.  Capping off the meal was a coconut rice pudding. This was the best Asian meal I have had this year anywhere.  Def two (or twenty) thumbs up!
