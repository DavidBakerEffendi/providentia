Mister Hotpot has a great atmosphere to hang out with friends and eat hot pot on a chilly cold night.  Whether its during the weeknights or weekends, you will enjoy many varieties of good food.   The pork belly and beef fatty meat are the best, while chugging a can of herbal Wong Lo Gut.  As a bonus, if you check in from yelp, you get a free dessert melona ice Popsicle.
