Brilliant. Farm fresh local ingredients.  Killer beer list.   Hosts for many a great event. Multiple seating options with something for everyone.  Open main restaurant, casual outdoor backyard feeling patio, and a cozy speakeasy of sorts lower level bar/lounge.   A great deal of care goes into everything they do here.  From selecting local produce, meats and cheeses, to their presentation.  Always top notch.   You cannot go wrong at the Farmhouse, except perhaps to over indulge.
