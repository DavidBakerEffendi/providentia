1 hr wait, take out, lined up at 4:30 This is one of my favorite pizza places on the east coast right off of the Brooklyn bridge. The wait is long, but well worth it. One of the oldest in the area, I am a big fan of brick oven pizza. Especially if the ingrediants are fresh and the crust is crisp on the outside with the right amount of chew on the inside. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. It must be in the water, East coast pizza's have a unique taste in their dough and the style of pizza is simple yet delicious. I definitely recommend walking over the Brooklyn bridge before or after to walk off all the pizza you are going to eat. Don't forget to check out the river view at the end of the street and try some "Ice Cream Factory"
