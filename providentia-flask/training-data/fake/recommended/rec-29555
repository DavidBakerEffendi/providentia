So, for the past couple of months we've been getting pizza here on the regular - once a week. They are super consistent and always delicious. Fast, friendly delivery, too. We had just gotten their pizza a couple of days ago and were hungry for something else. I got the smoked turkey with arugula, red pepper mayo, cheese, lettuce/tomato on an italian roll and my husband got a cheesesteak. These sandwiches were out of this freakin world. So good. The french fries are great and they come on the side of the sandwiches. Again, mind-blowingly fast delivery. I had to stop eating to write this review....gonna go finish eating now.... This is our go to place for everything....thank you Santucci's....yum
