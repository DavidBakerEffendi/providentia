I've been here a couple of times for dinner and had a mixed experience, but I want to review my recent weekday lunch: for $12.95, I got papaya salad (more than 1/2 the size of an appetizer order), tom yum soup (ditto), and a choice of about five entrees, plus a choice of drinks (I had coconut water, my friend had longan juice). It's not the cheapest lunch special, sure, but it's an excellent, very filling value. And the food was very good. Remember, cash only.
