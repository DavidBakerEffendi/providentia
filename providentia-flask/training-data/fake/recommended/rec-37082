Yes, it is that good. If you somehow haven't eaten here yet, your friends aren't lying; the food really is different from just about every other cart in the city. The meat has it's own seasoning, the lettuce is crisper, and the bread is soft and warm. Granted, it's probably helped by the sheer volume of food they put out. They move it all so fast, there's a good chance your food was made 10 minutes ago. If you see the cart 500 feet down the street, those are employees whose sole job is to cook meat and take it down to the main cart surrounded by hungry fans. The cart you order from is really just putting everything into a container when you make an order. White sauce? Yes, unless you somehow dislike yogurt. Red sauce? It's up to you. All of my friends say "You HAVE to get the red," which is false. If you like really spicy sauce, then try it. If you're more sensitive to spice, be cautious. The food will taste good enough without it. The downside? Hands down, how your stomach will feel after. This is a treat for your taste buds, not your digestive tract. I don't think anyone believes this cart would survive as a business once health inspection came along. Not that the food is rotten, but I doubt they splurge on the freshest ingredients. This is a late night favorite for a reason. Sure, it's open during regular business hours, but if you're looking to grab a delicious lunch and you have an important meeting in the afternoon? Maybe save this for another day.
