Good food and ambiance, whatever service. Place is very cute and we were surprised that the portions weren't skimpy. Had great wine and little plates at the bar where we were seated surprisingly fast. Very cute but nothing putting it head and shoulders above any of the other semi pricey cute west village spots.
