Cosmi's Deli by far makes the BEST cheesesteak in the city.  Don't waste your time or money elsewhere go directly to Cosmi's you will not be disappointed.  The guys that work here are great when you call in your order, and their delivery man is a gentlemen through and through.  I am so glad that a good friend recommended Cosmi's otherwise I would have thought I had already eaten the best cheesesteak in the city which would not have been the case.
