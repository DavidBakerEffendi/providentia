The Cellar is just a couple of blocks down from my office, so twice a month, I grab a couple of colleagues and skip down here for happy hour.  We really cannot get enough! I'm kind of hesitant, though, to even write this review because I don't want this wonderful neighborhood spot to get discovered!  I'm certain that when everyone else discovers this tasteful, laid back place, I'll never be able to set foot in here again! The atmosphere is really what makes the place, I think. I love the armchairs. It's great if you're here with just another friend for a chat or catching up. If you're with a group of 3 or 4, the tables are great.  Some people complain that the benches are too high and are awkwardly shaped, but I think it's part of their charm. The music is always great as well. Drinks are fantastic. First time I came, my friend and I both got a drink that is no longer on their menu, but basically is an old fashioned with figs. I've asked for it since they took it off, and they're always happy to oblige! The special cocktails are always great as well, but I feel a little bit weird drinking vodka in a place like this, even if it is infused.  The happy hour wine special is a great deal though: really excellent glass of wine. What I've had of the food is alright, although I haven't had much.  The cheese plates are always good, but I wish that I had more.  I love the fruit preserves they serve on the side. I recently had the "World's Best" mac & cheese.  I'm not sure that it lives up to the name, but it was alright. Service is excellent. They've always been more than accommodating, and I'm often a harsh critic.  I think we usually have the same server, and we absolutely love her.  Great job, Beechers!
