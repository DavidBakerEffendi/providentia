What a great little place for Sunday brunch.  Love the Francisco with eggs, asparagus, and bread.  Add a side of grits, hot sauce, and bellini, and you are in business. Never too crowded, but watch out for private parties.  If they are hosting one, you may miss out on the deliciousness you are craving.  And one last thing, they always have the best music  playing!
