Great, seasonal delicious food. Amazing beer and wine pairings.  Great atmosphere.  Would love to come back.  Raved about the 'best chicken in the city'... which was just alright... I feel like I have had better. Their gnocchi, and seasonal squash/vegetable stuff is definitely a win.  Would love to come back later in november to see what they can create with root vegetables... Come hungry!
