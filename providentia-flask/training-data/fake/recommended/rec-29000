Nuts to cheesesteaks - the sandwiches from Tommy DiNic's are what Philadelphia should be known for! If I had to eat one thing for the rest of my life, I would happily indulge in the glory that is DiNic's Italian Pulled Pork sandwich, with broccoli rabe, sharp provolone, horseradish, and extra gravy... nommmmm!! Â The decadent, savory meat and its juices, mixed with the slight bitterness of the rabe and cheese, and the snapping bite of the horseradish, culminate into a flavor explosion that will haunt your dreams. I'd write more, but if I don't get over there and get one now, my head might explode!
