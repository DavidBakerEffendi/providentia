When we are performing on tour it is always a challenge to find restaurants whose kitchens are still open after our show.  So Jones definitely gets a point for serving good food late.  I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup which was very tasty.  They offer a great way to order salads as well : for a flat rate of $11 you can choose a whole range of ingredients from a list at the table to customize your salad. unrelated to Jones, I wasn't feeling well the night we visited here so I am sorry my opinion can't be fully formed.  I will however definitely try it out again next time I am in town.
