First had MQ's brisket at 'Smorgasburg' a few years back... it was glorious! Easily the best brisket I've eaten outside of my road-trips down south (BrisketTown is great too!).  Their ribs are pretty good too, and I'm kinda surprised that MQ doesn't have any potatoes, or corn bread.  Although their pomme frites could use some work, but with brisket this good, they can serve me 'Play-Doh' fries and I probably wouldn't care.
