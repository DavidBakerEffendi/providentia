I think this place is overhyped.  I am not sure any place is worth the hour and half wait for pancakes, eggs and french toast.  The brioche french toast was tasty but not the best ever. I know there are alot of amazing reviews for this place but I advise people to check out POCO just across Houston Street on Ave. B & 3rd Street.  Brunch is amazing and so is the vibe.
