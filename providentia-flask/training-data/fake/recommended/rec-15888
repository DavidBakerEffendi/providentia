Heard so much about this restaurant and was really looking forward to eating here.  Yes the and food was good.  Yes the wine was good. However, the service was very rushed and chaotic - to the point of being unpleasant.  Also, the noise level was incredibly loud.  When we left uva and stood streetside, 2nd avenue was as quiet as a library by comparison.  Eating here was deafening.
