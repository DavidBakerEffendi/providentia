My friend and I went here for brunch on a Sunday.  I ordered the "vanilla bean french toast", and I must say it was a disappointment for the price as the edges were too hard.  My friend ordered the "classic eggs benedict", and the potatoes were too salty and the quality of the meal was nothing special. Service was decent. Overall, it was not worth the 45-minute wait and one can certainly find something more affordable and better tasting in the area.  Do not recommend and will not return.
