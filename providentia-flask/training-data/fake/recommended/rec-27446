I like this place. I liked the bartender. I liked the drinks. I like most of the food. It's just for the prices, there are still a few things I think they need to iron out before it's worthy of 4 stars. Firstly, I don't think this place will ever be 5 stars. It's just not inventive enough. That doesn't mean it's not a great solid addition to the area, it's just not exactly doing anything new or exciting. Some suggestions: -scrap the food comes as food is ready thing. 1 person at my table got and finished both his app and entree before anyone else got a bite of food. Was awkward for him and us (we were all starving) -i wouldn't call it family style. There's nothing about a meatball sandwich that is easy to share with a big table. -lighten up the fare just a pinch! I know it's supposed to be heavy but it's REEAAAAAAALLLY Heavy, like coma inducing, sleep til noon the next day heavy. Maybe a pinch less butter and oil and salt? Mayyyybe? Other than that I think this place has some great stuff. Short rib was delicious and giant (that should be called "for two"), the drinks were well made and by a friendly guy. Atmosphere feels new and doesn't have a ton of character but I'm willing to look past that. My friend at the table summed it up perfectly by saying "If this place was within 2-4 blocks of me I'd go a fair amount, but it's not a destination restaurant worth traveling to" Fair enough. I'll be back again.
