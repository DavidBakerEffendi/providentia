The best meal I've ever had. Everything from the bread, sangria, desserts, coffee. Everything. And the tapas and service was out of this world!  Looking forward to returning.  Falafel-Crusted Artichoke Hearts with eggplant & tahini-yogurt and the Almond Stuffed Bacon Wrapped Date were my favorite.  Also the hummus and the beet skordalia were very special.
