This was a fun place to go with a group of friends.  Had good rolls and good service!  Lots of variety in the rolls!  Some of the rolls were a little "interesting" which I stay away from.  Like things with fruit in them and such.  I expected it to be a little more "trendy" inside considering the name.  It wasn't super amazing, just regular average sushi.  Also had edemame for our group, which needed some salt.  I'll go back to try it again!  BYO!
