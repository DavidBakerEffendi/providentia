My sizzling hot date brought me here after catching the movie Chef together at Regal Cinema and seeing close-up shots of buttery, cheesy Cuban sandwiches that looked more delicious than Sofia Vergara. The movie left us salivating and craving some good Cuban food, so we ended up at Rincon Criollo. We became excited after seeing a photo of Guy Fieri by the entrance. Apparently, this restaurant was featured on his show!  Good sign. I was half asleep (nothing to do with my date) so I ordered an iced coffee, which wasn't exactly my definition of iced coffee, but it was delicious nonetheless. My date ordered a sangria and enjoyed it.  We had oxtail and Ropa Vieja with white rice and beans, Yucca and sweet plantains as sides. We were also offered a complimentary flan which was a great way to end our already satisfying meal. What was more noteworthy is the exceptional service. Waiters were genuinely friendly and had smiles on their faces throughout our dinner. One even put the toilet seat down for me when I had to use the Men's room because the Ladies' room was occupied. What more can you ask for? It ended up pouring after our dinner while my date and I went hunting for his car. However, it was a memorable moment after a memorable dinner ... with someone I can now call my bf
