This is a terrific restaurant!  My wife and I were taken there last week by friends who live in the area. Since we are from Oregon where local sourced food is a given we were surprised and  impressed when the waiter announced that most of the ingredients are sourced from their own farm/garden, and about 99% of the rest  travel less than 30 miles to the kitchen. I'm sure it's unfair but we just didn't expect that in New Jersey. The menu is diverse and interesting. Because there were five of us with varying tastes we cut a wide swath through the menu and each of us got a taste a bit of what the other was having. The Salumi and Formaggi were wonderful, as was the Yellowfin Tuna Tartar. The Sweet Italian Sausage was a standout! The tuna, duck, short ribs salmon, and salad offerings were flat excellent.  The wine list is outstanding and there are a wide range of price options. If you are with with only one or two others you may want to opt for the multi course prix fixe dinner. There is a five and a seven course option so that you can sample as much of the menu as you can. Otherwise plan on poaching each others' plates. By the time you read this the menu will likely have changed to reflect whatever is in season, but based on the fall menu and the quality of what we had whatever is on the menu will probably be as good as it gets. One last thing: the wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive without being smarmy or intrusive. We had a great experience and I think that you will too.
