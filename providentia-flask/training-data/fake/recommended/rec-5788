This place is a really cute & petite place to eat brunch in the city with some gal pals~!  It's real casual- just throw on a plain white-T and a pair of jeans and go! I love the country feel to this place. The interior is chic and comfortable with wooden walls painted baby-blue.... bringing the country cool from such a rapid hustle n'bustle kinda city. The food is simply put, good! It's nothing out of the ordinary, but definitely affordable and delicious.  To top it off, they put your bill in a small tin pail, which is just... ADORABLE-- like I'm cooing as I'm paying.  Here are some things I ate (pictures for references): 1. Warm Brie And Green Apple Chicken Sandwich   (I love the mix n'match of the toasty, grainy, cheesy, crispy textures! It   was fresh & fulfilling) 2. Mac N'Cheese 3. Juicy Beef Burger (I mean, you can't go wrong) 4. Arugula With Warm Chicken Meatballs ***    (This was my favorite! The meatballs are really juicy!)
