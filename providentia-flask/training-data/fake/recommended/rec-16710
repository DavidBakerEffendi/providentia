Chef Mehta did not disappoint.  I came across Graffiti via Zagat (I'm fairly boring and typically sort by Food rank) and was pleasantly surprised to find that I recognized the name in the kitchen (courtesy of my DVR).  Mehta (and, I believe, his wife?) is exceedingly down-to-earth and painfully polite, both traits which appeal to my rural Virginian aesthetic.  More on point, the food is fantastic. I enjoyed, with a friend: - Chili Pork Dumplings - Pickled Ginger Scallops - Braised Pork Buns - Chickpea Crusted Skate - Duck Portobello Gratinee - Three Cheeses - Hazelnut Chocolate Caviar Cupcake - Warm Truffle Almond Strawberries Each of the entrees was a CIA lesson in complementary flavors and textures.  Mehta's dishes always have crunch, always have (the option of) acid and always leave you with a feeling of regret when finished.  It is of note that serving sizes trend towards the smaller side (typical boy + girl will likely need at least 3 12s and 3 15s + dessert). You can tell Chef Mehta was at one juncture of his life a pastry expert.  My affinity for health and no-diabetes means a strong aversion to desserts, but the Truffle Strawberries was ridiculous.  The unique combination of sweet and savory is memorable, to say the least.  If your female companion loves desserts, you owe it to her to take her here for that one alone. The wine list, while not comprehensive, will not disappoint.  I would recommend you trust Mehta in his choice of wine of the month.  I had a bottle of the Trimbach Gewurtztraminer '06 (excellent) and the '08 Apatsagi (pretty good) - certainly nothing to complain about given the reasonable prices. I cannot stress enough how much you need to try this restaurant before Chef Mehta hits it big and spends more time in front of the camera in Chelsea than in the kitchen.  Would put the clock at about 6 months so you had better get on the calendar. Now.
