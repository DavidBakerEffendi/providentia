9.4 / 10 The journey to this pizza parlor is truly memorable. You make your way to lower-mid Brooklyn, and find it on a simple neighborhood corner. The line does not appear long, but you will probably be waiting over an hour for a fresh pie. A single man perfects each pizza himself, as he a done for several decades. Places like these are truly special. The smells and sights that come from the open counter area is tortuous during the wait. However, make some friends in the meantime, as the locals are friendly and like to chat. Your finished pie comes out finished with freshly cut basil leaves and whatever ingredients you choose. Do select whatever toppings you prefer, there is no wrong choice. The finished pizza is worth the wait, as you will likely be unable to last long enough before taking a bite, and sitting on the sidewalk to finish, hopefully with new friends. Score is based on overall experience, considering food, comfort, and lasting impression.
