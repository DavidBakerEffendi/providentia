Came here for lunch. If you're a feta fan + mussels fan, get the mussels for the appetizer. It was incredibly good, especially when you dip the bread in the sauce... woah man! We followed the yelper's recommendation and get ourselves the lamb shank. Very delicious, but because of how salty/flavorful the mussels were, it almost overpowered the taste of the lamb shank. So keep that in mind as you're making your choice. My brother had the kefi burger. That thing is HUGE. Not a fan that you have to add money for cheese (who does that?!) but when you have an option to add feta in a burger... go for it! I like this a lot! Cool interior, we had a very early lunch so no one was there yet so that was nice since my family and I wanted to get away from the business of Manhattan... we're tourists...you see...
