Perhaps we came on a off night but the food was horrible ... We ordered a special on the menu, stuffed crab portobello mushrooms which were cold and tasteless along with grilled calamari which was also a cold, grilled shrimp were equally disappointing.  Won't be going back.  Great ambience and music but the food just did not meet expectations.
