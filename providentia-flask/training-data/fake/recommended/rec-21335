This is a good place to order from. In the summer it is great to sit in the back. I love the mango salad. All of the noodles are all good. With tofu or chicken... the beef is not good (tough and no flavor). Joya is well priced and fast to deliver. It think it is pretty standard fair- clean, fresh and tasty. Just don't get the beef dishes (I have tried them all)
