It was between here and Wondee Siam that I was trying to decide between. I ended up with Room Service because I came across it first. My friend and I stepped through some curtains to go inside and we were  immediately seated - very quick on the seating (this was a Thursday night). The menu was impressive with the descriptions, stating that certain dishes were traditional to certain parts of Bangkok. I was also pleased to see the service provided by people from Thailand. Maybe, that's why I was surprised when I tried the food - it was just slightly above average. We ordered the Pad Thai, Sweet Pork, and Duck curry.  If you get the pad thai, you definitely need to get the Room Service Pad Thai, which is the authentic one with an egg omelet on top. Probably the third best pad thai I've had in the states (I've had better in SF and Ann Arbor). Still very delicious and well balanced. The sweet pork is nothing to boast about - a bit tough and overcooked and the flavor nothing special. The duck curry was not bad, but again nothing more spectacular than any other good Thai restaurant I've been to. I will say that these dishes looked pretty nice when they were brought out, just the taste wasn't anything spectacular. Overall, this place has excellent atmosphere (kind of like a W hotel sort of vibe, though a bit more scaled down) and presentation (the pad thai comes with a flower), but in terms of taste, it's just slightly above average. Too much fuss and trouble for the money.
