On a mini-Spring Break trip to New York City with the parents, and wanted to eat some Filipino food. Looked at yelp and did not want to go to Queens since we were staying in mid-town Manhattan. Found Grill 21 and its reviews, so I decided to go here. Took the subway and walked 3 blocks North 1st avenue on with the parents tagging along. To make a long story short - we loved it! For 3 people during lunch, we were the third group of people to arrive to eat in a place that only has 10 tables that seat two, and more tables outside on the sidewalk. Was impressed that Caucasian people waited to be seated in order to eat here. At the time I was there, it was predominantly Filipino with hospital employees and businessmen on their lunch break. Had chichen and pork adobo, dinuguan, pancit palabok, pritong tilapia, lechon kawali, halo-halo white rice, mango ice cream, and buko pandan. Usually we have left-overs, but everything was eaten! I love the adobo and rice. The reviews are right....almost like home...or as good as home. Price was $93.00 for all three of us, but it was well worth it for out-of-towners and eating Filipino food on Manhattan. There was only one waiter, and he was respectful and courteous, and moved like crazy to accommodate the phone call reservations, the people coming, and delivering the checks, etc. From where I was sitting I could see the kitchen, and it was business. Working to get the food out, etc. On my next trip to NYC, will definitely come here again! From Filipinos from West Virginia and Florida - definitely recommend Grill 21, if you're in Manhattan!
