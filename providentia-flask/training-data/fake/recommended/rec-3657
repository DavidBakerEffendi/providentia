This place is really hospitable. We had to wait in line for a table, which wasn't too bad because during the wait, they came by twice, once with cookies to snack on, and once with orange slices. They also gave everyone a glass of water. I got the steak and eggs. The ribeye was GREAT and cooked exactly like I ordered it, medium. The eggs were good. I also made the mistake of ordering a side of bacon. I say mistake because I thought it would have two or three pieces of bacon, not the 6-8 they brought out. While we were eating they came by with orange slices again. I also got a chocolate egg cream soda, which was really good. My food was really good, definitely worth 5 stars. My wife got the chicken chipotle omelette which is what I would get next time, simply because it is something I can't get anywhere else. My wife loved it, but couldn't finish it because of the large portion. I saw at another table someone got eggs florentine which I almost got because it looked so good. The waiter also gave us a cherry limeade on the house, which was also worth ordering. The service was great, my coffee cup was always full. We can't wait to come here again.
