Our fourth time here.  The first 3 times, it was right after they had just opened.  This time, we went on a Tuesday night around 7:45 and the three of us were seated right away. We ordered the fried pickles, truffle fries and truffle burgers.  We also orders a bottle of Malbec.  We loved all of it.  The different dipping sauces as always great.  The burgers were cooked as ordered and always so tasty.  The bun is sought that it never makes me feel too full.  The truffle fries are amazing.  The fried pickles are nice.
