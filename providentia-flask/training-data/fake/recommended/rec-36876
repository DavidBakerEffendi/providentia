My roommate and I stood in 45 minute lines to get into Grimaldi's-- repeatedly-- just for our monthly pie.  Great pizza, but eat it while it's hot.  Once it cools down, it's not half as good.  Paired with a carafe of house wine, you will feel like you are back in old Brooklyn.  The decor wouldn't disprove it either.  The red-checkered table clothes, somewhat gruff service, and graying photos of dead celebrities are all part of the Grimaldi's experience.  No, maybe it isn't the best pizza in the entire world, but it's pretty good, and worth the trip across the bridge.
