Soooo excited we finally have a place like this in the neighborhood.  DaMikele offers a wonderful dining experience. From the gracious service to the delicious dishes to the quaint and cozy ambiance, this is a great local escape for casual rustic Italian dining. They also have great cocktails, fruit of the day mojito (mixed dark berries is awesome), fresh peach puree bellini and the spritz are all deliciously refreshing.     Foods we recommend: the meat and cheese platter, beef carpaccio, fried calamari (don't like fried food, but this was really good and light), rice balls (rice balls were a special, really good. Definitely order it if it's on the menu). The zucchini parmigiana was a big hit. The al prosciutto a cono (cone shaped pizza with prosciutto, mozzarella, baby arugula and parmesan) was also really good. The wines by the glass and bottle are very reasonably priced and good! The food menu is also very reasonably priced and portions are generous. Love DaMikeke!
