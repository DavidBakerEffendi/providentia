Being from San Francisco, I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of the sandwiches here.  The spices that come in the sandwiches are amazing.  Bread is perfectly toasted.  Although there was only one person working, which took a long time, it was well worth the wait.  I had the Iranian turkey and the curry spread that came with the sandwich was a perfect touch.
