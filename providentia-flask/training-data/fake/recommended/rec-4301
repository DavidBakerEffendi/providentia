I absolutely love this place, it was my first time here. I'm so glad I found it on yelp and decided to try it out. The staff is so nice, helpful, and made me feel so welcomed. Now the Dogs...amazing! If you love or even like hotdogs this place is a must! So many options and you get so much food for such a great price. I definitely will be going back :-)
