Since I'm giving the place 4 stars, I'll put the bad stuff at the top. The waitress lost my future mother in law's order and my future sister and I were halfway through our meals before she got her food. The waitress was apologetic and admitted it was her fault and offered us free drinks and chips, salsa and guac. I got the breakfast burrito and it was tasty and filling. I also got the plaintains which were great. My mimosa was solid, not too sweet. They kept the coffee coming but we had to ask for water which was a little weird. Overall though I'd go back. It had a cute vibe that fit the beautiful Saturday afternoon and I was definitely interested in trying their other drinks.
