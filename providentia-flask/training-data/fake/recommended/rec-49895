This place was pretty cool. I went for some dinner on a Friday. The place was pretty empty. Got a chicken quesadilla. It was spicy yet bland somehow. Their guac was banging though. Good for people watching since it's right on the edge of Washington Square. If you want some quick food, why not. Otherwise...chipotle may actually be better. Just bring the chipotlaway
