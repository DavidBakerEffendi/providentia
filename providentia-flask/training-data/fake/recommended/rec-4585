I admit, when I first walked into NIXS (Hartford), I was a little confused. Did someone throw up in a time machine? Does this place know what it is? On the wall they're showing old timey movies. They're blasting Arcade Fire and Radiohead. There's dudes with beards and sweaters everywhere. It's a goddamn hipster bar. But no, wait. There's an electro chandelier! Apparently this is a... dance club? Is that right? But you can also watch sports on the TV's, I guess. So. Yeah. A bit of an identity crisis. I am a forgiving man, though. Especially if you make some great food. And I gotta say, the buffalo shrimp mac and cheese, despite being a bit skimpy on the shrimp, was bangin'. And the crab- and lobster-stuffed poorly-named tater tots since as far as I'm aware they don't actually have POTATOES... ? Yeah, that shit was bangin', too. Pork belly sliders were also solid. Only downside is the cheese plate was brought out by a non-waitress (buslady.. ?) and no explanation was given. What kind of cheese was I eating? What does it go with? Mysteries of the universe. Now I'll die with them. Unfulfilled. Thanks, NIXS. I have no idea if this is a fun hang-out spot or a good dance club... ? But it was a solid place to grab a bite and the vibe was decent, if not a bit confusing. Service was also very good, minus THE CHEESE INCIDENT. I will definitely be back if I can figure out how the fuck to get onto Front Street.
