Every entree is delicious. Perfect-sized portions, with all the protein cooked to perfection and the accompanying sides matched perfectly with the meat. The short rib is my absolute favorite, and the scallops are sweet and buttery. I've been here several times for dinner and have almost the entire menu. No regrets.
