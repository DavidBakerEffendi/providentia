I wish Taim was located in Washington Heights near my house, however, where it stands its on the cutest block in all of Manhattan, so I always enjoy sitting on their outside bench. Definitely a friendly hangout of locals who enjoy a good falafel. The sandwiches are creative and superbly tasty. This place deserves repeat visits so that you can taste each thing on the menu. Each and every item is an affordable masterpiece.
