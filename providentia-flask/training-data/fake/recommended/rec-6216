AMAZING!! Just got back from there about an hour ago and rushed to yelp.com to leave this review. A girlfriend and I had dinner there tonight and it was absolutely outstanding. Ambience - Beautiful, as previously mentioned, the clay pots on the ceiling are a very creative touch. One of the waitors mentioned to us that it can be taken either way; some people love the claypots, others find it off-putting. There is an island, which they call the community table, for walk-ins. I thought it was a really cute touch actually as it is a huge table with stools. Feels like you're in a chef's kitchen.   Service - Terrific! It's as if they don't know what else to do with themselves. Very accomodating and knowledgeable of the cuisine. FOOD - Impeccable.  Very fresh. Beautifully prepared.  I already know that I will be craving everything I ate tomorrow.  It's been a very long time that I left a restaurant excited to go back. I already made reservations for my husband and I.
