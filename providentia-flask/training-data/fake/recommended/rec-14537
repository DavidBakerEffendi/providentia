This place lives up to the hype. We went mid-week around 3pm, an off-time, and it was about a 15 minute wait in line. I am sure most times, the line stretches down to the water, but we were lucky. Tables are nice, not overly big, but all parties sit comfortably. Staff is great. We ordered a small pepperoni pie and it was cooked to perfection. Loved the crust, it wasn't too thick or undercooked. They use San Marzano tomatoes and sauce which is always the best. It was delicious. The bill for lunch for two:  pepperoni pizza and one Ice Tea: $22.00 with tip. Not bad, and worth it!  I reccomend trying to eat here at least once.
