Unfortunately this was my biggest disappointment of a meal in the Big Apple, coming from Los Angeles. 4 stars with 1000 reviews would give you a great meal in Los Angeles almost every single time. I tried their two "most highly recommended and popular" dishes by the waitress and both of us could not finish half of it! Had the Gnocchi di Roccota with black truffle sauce. It's hard to screw things up when you add amazing Truffle sauce, but this was too sweet, the pasta was completely soft with no texture like it was overcooked. The second dish Fettucine con Gamberi e Zucchine was undercooked with difficult to chew pasta, a bit too salty, and unimpressive overall as well. The service by the waiters were good/average. However one of the hispanic busboys pissed us off when he slammed the olive oil bottle on the table in front of us when we asked him if he could get some for us. Ridiculous -out of place low-class behavior demonstrated in a place like this if you ask me. I hate to say this but given our entire experience for the night, I wish I never came here and had gone to the trendier Eataly instead.
