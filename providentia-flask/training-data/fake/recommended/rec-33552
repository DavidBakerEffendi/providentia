Never had a problem with the food, lived near there & ordered numerous times. Have since moved & was in the area today. Stopped in, placed an order & after waiting outside for a time, went in and was told they were closed for the remainder of the night. This was before 4 in the afternoon!!!  What was that about??Was given an apology but no excuse. Glad I wasn't the last one they served!!  FINISHED WITH THEM!!!  BEWARE!!!!
