This is pancake nirvana!  I've been here a couple times; luckily for me and my party, we've never had to wait long for a table.  Then again, I didn't go on the weekends.  We did drive by one time on a cold, January Sunday morning and the line went outside the door.  I had the banana walnut and chocolate pancakes (blueberries aren't my thing but will give it a go next time I return) and as I wrote earlier - best I've ever had!  Eggs and meat were good too; service was impeccable.  As other posters have written, it can get busy but the place is small so it's easy to get the staff's attention.  Fully recommended but try going on a weekday to avoid the long waits.  You know what they say - never go to an empty restaurant!  Conversely, long waits are usually for a good reason...
