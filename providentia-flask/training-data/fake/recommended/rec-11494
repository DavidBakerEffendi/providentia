I'm a pretty traveled BBQ eater. The food served here is legitimate though not without some transgressions. The brisket has been, on separate occasions, way too fatty, bone dry, or simply amazing. The pulled pork I got contained about 30% fat - not appealing. The meat itself was good. Hit or miss. The wings are consistently great. Staff is rushed and generally frazzled. They try to be polite but there's too much going on. The need a bigger workspace. Work in progress.
