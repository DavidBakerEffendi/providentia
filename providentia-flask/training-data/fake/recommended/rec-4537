The three stars are for the service only, not the food. We had lunch here on a Sunday afternoon. Not busy at all. There were 4 of us and it took over an hr. to eat. Not one time did they come to refill our drinks. I actually had to get up w/my glass to ask for more water. I only saw two employees and the girl at the bar had their undivided attention the whole time. We all ordered different versions of the traditional Cuban sandwich. They were all very good.
