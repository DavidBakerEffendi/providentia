i have been here more times than i can count. Â Great (small) atmosphere, my favorite time to go is in the winter, it's a nice, warm escape from the cold outdoors (though it's normally crammed to capacity for this very reason). Don't be intimidated by the squished crowd waiting in a squiggly-ish line with people squeezing by to get to the back... it's worth it! i'm from germany, so i can appreciate the authentic belgian fries... complete with mini forks! :) warning, there's like... 50 flavors to chose from.... good luck!
