Let's face it.  The TV show "Friends" took the coffee house idea to new lows.  Not only did the cast have a lot of time to piss away in an eating and drinking establishment (the beauty of make believe land) but it brought about a kind of trite nature that independent cafes have been trying to break free of. While wandering around Philly during a Tuesday afternoon, I wanted to just grab a quick espresso for five minutes and continue on with my journey.  Cafe Fulya fit the bill.  The seating area is not too large, but that's OK, as I wasn't planning on staying the afternoon.  The double espresso made the grade and the baklava is rich and delicious.  Some of the best I've had.  All in all a solid experience.  A cafe like this is something that no neighborhood should be without.
