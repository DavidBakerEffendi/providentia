I went to Kate's with my family when I was back east, wow was I impressed! My Brie sandwich was to die for and my husband had the Chicken Cutlet sandwich which was so fresh and delicious. Coming from a small business we found the service to be wonderful especially seeing Kate the owner herself making our food and serving us. I will be sending all of my local friends to Kate's and visiting when I return in October.
