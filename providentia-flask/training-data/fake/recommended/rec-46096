TERRIBLE service- waited 10 minutes before our waitress even took our drink order. Left before even looking at the desert menu. Food is decent- not bad, not amazing. Will not return- too bad too because it's beautiful there. I'm giving it 2 stars because of the grounds, and the food was ok- but don't go here unless you want to spend a good chunk of your time waiting for your waitress. Expect that at 99 not a 27 dollar a plate restaurant.
