Cafe Orlin isn't the best brunch place I've been to but it is definitely a very solid brunch spot. The service is prompt and friendly and they have A LOT of room so you won't have to worry about waiting 2 hours just for a table. The Eggs Norwegian was very yummy - there was a lot of smoked salmon and since it's on their special brunch menu, it comes with coffee and juice. The Steak and Eggs, which we had for the first time here, was also really good. The spinach sauce that comes with it makes for perfect dipping!
