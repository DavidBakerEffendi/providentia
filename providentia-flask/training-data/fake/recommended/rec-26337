Went there for dinner on a Saturday. Tip: This place is always packed so make reservation at least one week in advance. Ambiance: Mixture of trendy, fancy with a touch of traditional Italian.   Crowd was mostly people in their late 30s and up. Food: The bread that is set on the table is delicious and I love that they place olive oil and not butter (so reminds me of Italy). For appetizers we had 3 cheeses (pecorino, formagetta and parmigiano) and prosciutto and it was all very good although I wished the portions were bigger (but I guess this is how Italians stay slim- small portions). For Primi, I had Spaghettini alle vongole (with clams) and it was tasty.  My friend had the Spaghetti alle Chitarra and he seemed to love it and just wished the portions were bigger (we came quite hungry). For Secondi I had the Stripped bass which in my opinion needed some seasoning, thankfully, they had sea salt on the table, so I added some. My friend had the Hanger steak and it was deeelicious, I wish I had ordered this! Drinks: We had the Primitivo and Ettna Rosso; Light and full body in that order. Service: It seems like after he took our order our waiter went MIA and every time we had food delivered to the table it was a different person, but I guess it doesn't really matter as long as we got what we ordered? Price: Expensive... not that it wasn't worth it, but I think if it would had cost a little less it would had been perfect. Would I go back? Yes
