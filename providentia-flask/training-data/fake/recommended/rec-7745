I can't understand how anyone could give this place any stars at all.  This place is so overrated!  It's like a food court at a mall. It's just a room with some tables, with no view of anything.   The fixtures and design of the coffee bar don't match the period of the room and made the room seem messy. Bad Feng Shui. The food was awful:  soggy sauerkraut, crab salad with bits of crab shell mixed in  & the most DREADFUL coffee ever.
