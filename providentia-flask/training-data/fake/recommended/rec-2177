Apparently I'm a glutton for cheese steaks and I didn't even know it.  If you've ever had a cheese steak anywhere in Chicago, you'll know they just don't compare to the original from Philly.  Now, I had never sampled a cheese steak here in Chicago, but I can tell you that I sampled four different restaurants in Philly and Pat's was by far the best. As you can read in my review of Geno's, the establishment kiddy corner from Pat's, the xenophobic bigotry was a turn off enough to not even want to eat there, but the food was also bad.  Pat's was just higher quality, period. The service was great.  The guy that takes your steak order is a little hard to understand, but he totally gets the job done if you make sure to read the sign that says "How to Order."  If you're ready when you get to the window, he'll mumble what he needs to and ask for your money.  Definitely not rude service and ordering is really, really quick.  Your sandwich comes out the same window, so don't walk away without it! Proceed down to the next window to order sides and drinks.  These people were very friendly (not like the people at window #2 at Geno's) and they were interested in where I was from and that other kind of stuff.  Prices were a bit less expensive and the service is friendlier.  I'll take that (even with higher prices) over rude jerks any day.   There's no bathroom at either establishment, so beware.  We took a cab down here and back (about $15 total), so it was worth it to go to this part of town for lunch.  There's nothing else to do here, anyway, so you may as well hold it and just go back to wherever you came from.  Definitely worth a bus/cab ride down here just to get a delicious cheese steak.
