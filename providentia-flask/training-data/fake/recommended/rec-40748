Atmosphere: Late 1960s, early 1970s comfort food, mostly southern style with matching decor and a heavy hipster feel.   Food:  Little crazy on the salt, but otherwise solid entrees and excellent cocktails.  My free-range chicken with mashed potatoes was quite good and the rest of my party seemed to enjoy theirs.   Service: Pretty poor.  Our waitress was nice, but only served us our initial drinks and we had to get the kitchen staff who served us our entrees to track her down so we could order more.  The manager stopped by to check on us, which is always a plus.  Took a pretty long time to get any drinks or the bill though.  Not a deal breaker though, I'd go again.
