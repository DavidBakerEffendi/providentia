Whole family went for Sunday buffet. The people and the food were wonderful. Great food, diverse selection of food and dessert, great service, highly recommend! We will absolutely be back. Will also be a great spot for weekday business lunch. As an extra note, their was an older foursome behind us, two had buffet, two ordered from the menu. While it seemed they were very particular, they loved it. Even more, there were two Indian families there as well while we were there, always a good sign! We are happy to have found this new restaurant.
