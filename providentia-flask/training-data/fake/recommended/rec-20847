We were the only people in the restaurant and it took them 45 minutes to give us mediocre food.  It was okay, but I wouldn't ever pay $20 for lasagna ever again.  Seafood was rubbery.  Only nice part was that the owner apologized and they brought out our food as soon as we asked the owner about it and dessert was on the house.  Cannolis were tiny and they were $8 each, thank god we didn't have to pay.
