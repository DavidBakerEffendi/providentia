I used to LOVE this place. I came here for lunch today and noticed the dirty fry oil right behind register that I didn't notice before. It was lunch time and the oil was nasty dark as black already. I'm pretty sure they don't change the oil often. The guy threw my donkatsu into the nasty oil to fry and that was enough for me losing my appetite... It was rainy chilli day and the door was left open. I asked the owner if I can close door cause I didn't want to eat my lunch as shivering with cold. He said no and said that I'm wearing a jacket and I should be fine. What a nice customer care?! They should learn how Jananese care their customer nicely. (Ppl work here are not Japanese). Anyhow, I don't think I will come back here again
