My sister raves about this place down in DC. Best burgers ever! When they opened up a joint near my apartment, I had to go and see for myself. The menu is simple, kinda like In-and-Out, but without the shakes. Hamburger, Cheese Burger, Bacon Burger, Bacon Cheese Burger. They all come with two patties and your choice of any toppings at no additional cost. Definitely no vegetarians here. The french fries are pretty good. You choose between regular and cajun. I had the cajun. They fill up a styrofoam cup with fries and then dump in another bowlful into your bag. These aren't dinky fries either. Skin on, cut somewhere between shoestring and steak fries. Fried in 100% peanut oil. Five Guys has a big peanut theme. There are barrels of peanuts in the store for you and me to munch on. I wasn't expecting that one. I'd say Five Guys is like slow cooked fast food, if that makes any sense. Everything is made to order in a wide open kitchen space. No surprises. Great place for the burger and french fry fan. review 4/13/2008 I.M.Y.
