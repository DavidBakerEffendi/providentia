So my buddy and his friend suggested that this was "the best burger she ever had."  That's a bold bold statement i said.  Don't play this up...because I take my burgers for SERIOUS!  Mostly b/c the best burgers i've ever had are generally home cooked, massive, with tons of stuff or something.  At restaurants it's a little different, b/c you really can't mess up a burger. With that said.  Ruby's is a tiny tiny tiny place.  Literally a hole in the wall, and I guess I would call this a little cafe.  The whole restaurant is probably no more than 300 square feet including the kitchen which means...you will be crowded on the tables - all 4 of them...which are thick heavy planks of wood with matching long wooden benches.  There are mirrors on one wall (if i recall correctly) with some specials and smoothies listed on it. As for ambiance - eh, take it or leave it - I like quaint dining, but I don't like being bumped into by random people and wait staff during my meal.  (They do a good job though, it's just random people may walk into you while they are getting a seat...or getting up...etc) And now the FOOD: Ok So i had the burger with the egg, pineapple and beet (A Whaley's).  Yeah sounds interesting right?  Well...i gotta say - it was pretty good.  Tasty and sweet because of  the pineapple.  I also tried the "Bronte" which is a normal burger with sweet chili, mayo and cheese.  The burger is served on a baguette and the actual meat is made long so it can fit on the bread.  There was just enough to be enough, not too big or anything.  And your side was a salad.  No French Fries here. Was it the best burger I've ever had?  No - but it was still a very very good burger.  But personally - i can't get over the size of the place and wondering if i'll actually get a seat if i do go there.   What i do like is that it is a fun and hit place to go to.
