The food in this place is delicious and they are a great ambassador for Filipino cuisine. For those of you who are not that familiar with Filipino food skip your chinese next time and go to Grill 21 for quick immersion in a meaty cuisine. Be a (wo)man, do the right thing! We had lumpiang sariwa (vegetables in a crepe with peanut sauce) as an appetizer and it was solid. They put a little bit too much peanut sauce and fresh garlic over it. As the main course we had sisig (pig ears, stomach, etc) and pork adobo. Both were delicious! The cartilage in sisig was just right, it gave good texture to the dish without giving you a feeling you are eating something weird. Pork adobo had the right taste and the pork had just the right amount of fat. There was also no skin on the meat, which I prefer since in the saucy adobo it becomes slimy and chewy. We didn't order any dessert since the portions were generous. I also ordered a lychee drink in the beginning, which turned out to be canned lychee with some shaved ice, so I had to finish all the fruit. You know how Red Bull gives you wings? Well this place gives you strength. Once you eat all the delicious meat all of a sudden you will feel your chest and arm muscles swell! Oh yeah, nice. I would've given this place 4 stars because their strength is mostly in the entrees. However, they incurred some unjust reviews that I feel compelled to counterbalance, therefore, 5 stars.
