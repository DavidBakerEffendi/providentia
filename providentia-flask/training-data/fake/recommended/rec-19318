No advanced reservation so we waited a little bit (~15 minutes on a saturday morning) Not that bad 3* The staff is friendly and attentive although they missed my friend's order. 4* The portion is big but the taste is just okay. The potato is just right but a bit salty. My meal is good but nothing memorable. 3*
