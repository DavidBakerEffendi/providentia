If you're reading reviews on this place, you've already made the discovery of a lifetime in NYC. Don't be intimidated by the long line or the fact it's coming from a food cart. There's a reason people find themselves waiting around the block in line. You're gonna be getting a true meal on the go for very cheap. Bypass that by getting here early enough (i get here around 7) and you'll be pretty close to the front. Once they get going tho, the line just keeps moving. DONT FORGET TO TRY THEIR WHITE OR HOT SAUCE WITH IT
