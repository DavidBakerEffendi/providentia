i wish i could always be a lady who lunches, but i can only assume my alterego once weekly. two weeks ago, this lady went to tia pol for a light lunch at the bar.  not only did i have the most wonderful bowl of lentil soup (chock full of chorizo...yum), i had a delicious pork sandwich which was oozing with cheese.  okay, so maybe my lunch wasn't so "light" but whatever.  to top it off, i had a glass of wine recommended by the bar master.  pucho, from the bierzo region of spain.  try it immediately, and fall in love with it.  and then buy a bottle at tinto fino (conveniently owned by one of the gals that owns tia pol).  done.
