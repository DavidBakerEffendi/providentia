I personally think this place is fantastic. There is a wide selection of dishes that are gluten-free, vegan, and dairy free, which is great for people with a handful of allergies (like me). The only few things that I could complain about is bumped-up prices, and the smaller than average proportions. I guess that's what I should be paying for allergen-free food, so it is definitely worth it. Coming here again soon.
