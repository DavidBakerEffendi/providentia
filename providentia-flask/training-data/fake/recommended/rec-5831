A lot of mixed reviews about this place.  I hope I can help settle the steam.   Excellent smoked meats, cooked to near perfection with a delicious rub smothering them.  A basket of tasty sauces which need to be spread liberally to appreciate the flavor.  Combining the saaaawwwce and the rub leaves your mouth short circuiting. The mac and cheese also has a smokey hint to it and it was delicious.   It is very hard to find decent bbq in Essex County and well worth the trip to order from their BBQ menu.  I can't talk about the other food since it defeats the purpose of going to a smoke house for bar food.
