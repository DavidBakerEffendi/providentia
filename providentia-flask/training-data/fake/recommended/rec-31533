I went here for the first time with family after they raved about.  It was very good.  Cozy atmosphere and friendly staff.  Rustic bread, BYOB, gnocci with shrimp in a cream sauce.  Finished it all off with Limecello (amazing) and pumpkin cheesecake.  I would definitely go back and recommend it to friends.
