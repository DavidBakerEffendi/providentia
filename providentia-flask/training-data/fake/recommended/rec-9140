My mom and I both make mean meatloafs, but I have never, ever tasted anything like Rye's. Â It might seem audacious of me to suggest theirs is the best I will ever have in my life, in open-face sandwich form, but I am willing to take that risk. That said, the wine list could be slightly more approachable, but I think a lot of people order beer.
