LOVE, Carmine's!!!  The original italiano in NYC!! Family style so if there are only two of you, be prepared, it's a lot. We had the lazagna and it was huge! The salads were fabulous and the other food we saw was amazing.  We had the sundae and it was huge! Was my daughter's birthday and the waiters sang to her! Overall, a great experience, the restaurant is beautiful and right in the middle of the theater district.  GO. TO. CARMINE'S..!!!!!!!
