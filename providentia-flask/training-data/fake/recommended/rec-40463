This place is great! The food (spicy fries, chorizo burger, rib sandwich) were amazing. In addition, the owner is so friendly and clearly has a passion for food and for his restaurant. My boyfriend is a chef, and this is the first place in a while i've heard him rave about. I can't wait to go back and try all the other things this place has to offer. I went back again and had the shrimp scampi. I was weary to try it at more of a sandwich place, but it was honestly the best shrimp scampi I've ever had (and I've had a lot!). It was so garlicy and flavorful!!
