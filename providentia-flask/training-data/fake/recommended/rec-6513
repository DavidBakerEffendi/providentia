1st I must say that it was the space design and decor that 1st caught my attention for llili.  The wood tones, lighting and layout are spectacular.  Now the downside.  The seating and table arrangement are acceptable at best and usually awkward. The menu (and service) is very uneven with some dishes that shine (sauteed brussel sprouts) and some that miss outright.  However, if you go in with a mind to share and try different items you will probably be pleased with the result as it is a good location to have a dinner with friends.
