When i'me craving delicious and savory ramen, I go here. Every time I go, I try something new. My usual ramen of choice is their Tori Ramen because the broth is absolutely mouth-watering. The appetizers are also delicious, I would suggest Kurobuta Pork Tatsuta Age, Pork Buns, Samurai Ribs, and Agedashi Tofu as appetizers. The interior of the restaurant is impressive and unique, so I always enjoy going in. There is always a wait when you go. The place is extremely popular, so I suggest you get there before the restaurant opens if you want to eat early. Otherwise, there's usually a forty minute to about and hour and a half wait. The wait is worth it in the end.
