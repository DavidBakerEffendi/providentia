The woman handling take-out orders here is just down right RUDE.  Let me first say, that this is the first time that I've felt so strongly about an establishment to take the time to write a review.  The story goes..........my girlfriend and I walk into an extremely busy restaurant at 9:30pm on cinco de mayo.  Everything went well but after waiting 25 mins for our food (and witnessing people that were behind us get their orders), my girl decided to ask her about the status of ours.  After asking her name, the employee says "oh, I just gave your food away."  GF replies politely "why?? We've been standing here the entire time."  The employee claims she called out her name and someone claimed the food.  GF proceeds to ask her if she checked the customers' receipt, to which she replies "no" and beginning to take a disrespectful tone with her.  At this point, my GF is visibly upset but surprisingly hadn't lost her temper.........yet.  Right then, our order seemed to be coming up and we were all going to chalk it up to a misunderstanding.  But the employee then proceeds to say to my girl "are you gonna stop crying about it now??" Up to that point, my girl was respectful even despite her rude demeanor.  But that was the last straw.  What a ridiculous thing to say to a customer, a local who lives right up the block that is a potential repeat customer.  We both work in the industry.  I have for 17 years with extensive experience in boh and foh and the way this woman deals with people is astonishing.  While in line, we were even noting how this could become a regular spot for us as long as the food was good.  Not a chance now.  Rude. Inconsiderate.  Do not go there.  I want my money back.
