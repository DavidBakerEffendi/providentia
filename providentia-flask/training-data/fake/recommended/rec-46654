Cold brewed iced coffee. That's all you should need to know. If you're clamoring for more details, FINE: Grindcore House is not nearly as menacing as it sounds. The baristas are extremely friendly, the service quick and the value good. The decor is great, too; it's an old, old house that's been relatively well-kept and has tons of character. Don't let the name scare you away.
