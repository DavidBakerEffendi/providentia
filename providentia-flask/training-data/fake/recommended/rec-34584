#16 I went with a group of Friends because we heard great things about this place. I will give a 4.5 to this places just because they was so issues... This is the first time i see in a restaurant do not give you bread, and the order took forever. But why i am giving 4.5 start? well, 1. The server made sure that the entire table had their glasses of water filled and even the manager came around to check. 2. The food: was some amazing, I order the Seafood Paella, one of the best I had in my life, it was a little spicy, but just perfect, I thought they read my mind in these one. The Paella is probably the most famous and popular Spanish dish around the world; In this Paella was plentiful in fresh seafood and had perfectly cooked rice. It was just perfect for me. I also had some Platano (frito verde) and yuca frita very good. Two of my friend, they ordered, El Arroz con Pollo, they told me that is was incredible. Very flavorful, moist chicken breast over rice flavored with egg and peppers with a excellent avocado salad.My other two friends shared the lechon that was very juicy.
