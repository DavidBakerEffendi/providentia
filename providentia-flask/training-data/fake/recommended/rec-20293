Char No. 4 was a bar featured in Esquire's "America's Best Bars" list under the category of "Best Bar Food". Bars and food are two of my absolute favorite things and I was determined to visit this place to experience what this magazine wrote about them. I arrived on a Tuesday night and saddled up to the bar. Only three other patrons sat at the bar but towards the back there was a bigger dining area and it was packed. It was dark and hip but not in a meat market way. This is a place anyone can come and relax with a well crafted drink. The bartender comes up to me hands me a menu and declares, "We only have drinks tonight." Unsure if she meant only at the bar I asked if that meant to get food I needed to move to the dining area. No, she meant no food anywhere because there was a private party behind held. My stomach groaned in defeat. I came all the way from Seattle to eat this food! Not to waste my trip I ordered a bourbon drink. The name escapes me but it was bourbon, ginger beer, and a few other ingredients. While I am not usually a mixed drink girl this was crisp, somewhat sweet, and light. On my departure I take a picture of the sign outside and above it, looming over me like a divine comedy, is a note saying there will be no food served due to a private function. Even though my initial reason to come to Char No. 4 to eat the food and that reason was crushed I was glad I resumed my stay and had a drink.
