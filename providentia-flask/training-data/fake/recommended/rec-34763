4.5 Stars. This place is seriously a hole-in-the-wall. My friends and I wanted a quick meal and Yelp led us here. At first I was a little hesitant. The restaurant was kinda hidden and small. I'm glad we came here though because this is probably one of the best curries I've had. Restaurant is tiny and has Matsui's memorabilia everywhere. I ordered the Chicken Go Go Curry Single (M). The medium was big enough for me and I'm a fatass I eat a lot. It came with a nice amount of chicken katsu, rice, and curry. You can also add extra toppings such as egg, cheese, shrimp, pork, sausage, etc for a couple more bucks. Chicken was crispy and tender and the curry was really hot and flavorful. Service is a bit slow and it could get crowded. But, definitely worth it!
