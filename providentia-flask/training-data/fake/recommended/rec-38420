My husband and I built our road trip from Jersey to Massachusetts around a stop to Sandra's and boy are we glad we did!  We stopped in for an early dinner over the July 4th weekend and were greeted warmly and seated right away.   My husband ordered the church plate with mac and cheese, fried okra, collard greens, and candied yams, while I had the turkey chopped bbq church plate with potato salad, greens, mac & cheese and candied yams.  We had sweet tea with our meal and ordered the peach cobbler and chocolate cake to go and we both agreed that everything was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.   We really enjoyed Sandra's and are already trying to figure out when we can make it back.  The food and the hospitality were simply amazing!
