Though I've only been here once, there's nothing I can find wrong with this place. I was seated right away and the waiter brought bread and butter and water right away. The wait staff was friendly, happy and very attentive which is unfortunately (in my experience) the exception, not the standard. I mean if your glass was half empty they would fill it. I didn't have to ask for anything my entire time there. Except to move to a different table because it was chilly by the door. And they accommodated me without a problem. I started with a mango milkshake which was tasty. For my entree I ordered the ropa vieja which came with two sides so I tried the cassava in garlic sauce and fried sweet plantains. Everything was delicious. The ropa vieja was tender and flavorful and went especially well with the sweet plantains. I was getting full after eating half of my dinner so I took the rest to go because I had to save room for dessert. I tried the coconut flan and omg it was delicious! My friend ordered fish for dinner and dulce de leche for dessert. Her dishes were ok but I liked mine better lol. I got to see the waiter dance and sing happy bday to a couple of tables. It was fun to watch. Kind of small place but nice cozy authentic atmosphere with great food and great service. I can't wait to come back.
