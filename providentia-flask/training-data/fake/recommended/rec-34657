This place is so cute and the food is delicious. I got the blueberry waffles that came with orange butter and my husband got a breakfast sandwich. Sometimes I feel like its not too hard to make good breakfast food but what made this place special was little things like the sauce that went into their sandwich and the orange butter! The balsamic mayo in the breakfast sandwich perfectly balanced and cut through the buttery-ness of the egg and bread. It was really good. Blueberry waffle? Crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside and again the orange butter was such a good small touch! The place is super cute, waitresses are down to earth and friendly, and the food was not just any breakfast food... Delicious!
