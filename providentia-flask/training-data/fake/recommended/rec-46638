This is a great neighborhood bar.  If you're not sure what to you want to drink, the bar tenders are good about comparing their draughts to something you know and, if you're still unsure, they'll give you a sample. If you're hungry, get the onion rings!  They are huge and delicious and one portion can easily feed 2-3 people. They are good about having a mix of television shows and movies on (last time I was there they had football on one screen and Billy Madison on another, plus whatever was on at the other end of the bar). Did I mention that they have board games?
