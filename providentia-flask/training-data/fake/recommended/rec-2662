I was so excited when this place opened just a few blocks from where I live. The food here never disappoints--everything is really fresh, and you'll be pressed to find a place where you get such substantial portions of healthy food for the same price. But beyond the quality and value of the food, what has really blown me away about this place is the service. Everyone here is really friendly and goes out of their way to make sure you have a positive experience. Once, they brought out my friend's dish a few minutes later than everyone else's, and our server gave our entire table complimentary dessert. When my mom was in town, I brought her to Miles Table for breakfast, but they had just changed their hours and arrived 20 minutes before their new opening time. Disappointed, we were about to walk to Cosi, when the manager himself opened the door, invited us in to eat, and cooked our breakfast himself! In summary, if the food here doesn't immediately win you over, the people will.
