One of the worse dining experience.  The space is extremely small.  And an absolute fire hazard.   Whoever photographed this place did  great job in making the place look larger than it really is.  It is extremely cramped.  The staff is ill informed about the items on their menu. They do have a large whiskey selection, but who wants to put ice cubes in their drink.  It wasn't cheap, and it was a total waste of my time.  I was better off getting a hot dog from a street vendor. At least I would had space to consume my meal.
