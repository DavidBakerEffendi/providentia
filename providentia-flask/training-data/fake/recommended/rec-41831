Sophies! Big love for this place. I work nearby, so this restaurant is great because it adds more variety to the restaurants in the neighborhood (soup and sandwich gets old after a while). The price is good and the place gets really packed around lunch - fortunately the line moves very fast and the service is quick both for to go orders and sit down. The price is decent so folks come here often. Since I'm a vegetarian my options are a bit limited with cuban food (it would get five stars if there were more options for me) so I usually stick with a side of beans and rice and another side of plantains. Not that I'm complaining, it tastes great and the portions for a small side are more than I can eat. They have two kinds of beans that they switch every other day - black beans and red (pinto?) beans. I'm a big fan of the black beans. Also, don't forget to ask for the spicy green sauce - it makes everything taste even better. When my coworkers come with me, they always get the cuban sandwich, and given the smiles on their faces I would recommend that as well.
