Elegant Italian food, and should be saved for special occasions. It's got a great atmopshere; however, it's sort of a awkward layout. We sat toward the back of the restaurant, and it was a pain to get to the bathrooms. The staff is very knowledgeable of the menu and wine list. Yes, the prices are high, but that's what you get for the quality of the food. Oh, and the basil bread - to die for! I definitely recommend this place!
