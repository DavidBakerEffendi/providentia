Amazing from start to finish.  The margaritas, which I don't usually order when out because most are full of sweet/syrupy mixers, were phenomenal.  I could actually enjoy the taste of the tequila.  The guacamole is a must-do, even at its $9 price point.  My wife and I split the "tacos al carbon built for two" which are basically fajitas that consist of a heaping portion of onions, peppers and the meat (or 2) of your choice.  They bring it out to you on what looks like a cast iron grill, along with tortillas, a delicious homemade looking hot sauce, pica de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole.  Both the beef and chicken were tender and delicious.  The place isn't cheap, but the food is quality and the atmosphere is too.
