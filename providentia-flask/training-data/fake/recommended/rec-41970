Went to the recently publicized soft opening tonight. Verdict: A+ with extra points for huge potential. The owners and staff are very sweet and efficient and the food was tops. The Lamburger with Kimchee slaw is pretty mouthwatering. Try the truffle mushroom Mac n cheese & eggplant fries with spicy aioli. Got a tour of the outdoor space, too. This will rival Silk City for outdoor summer fun once the liquor license is in order (quoted at late June by the owners.) inside has a colonial feel complete with plush pink dining chairs and wainscoting on the walls and kitschy gold framed colonial paintings with llamas replacing the heads of people and outside Â is framed by sky-high tropical building murals depicting sunny Provincial Caribbean outdoor scenes and lit by string lamp lighting. It's almost a Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde feeling when you compare the outdoor to indoor space. This will be a fun summer spot, definitely.
