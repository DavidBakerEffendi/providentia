I still love this place and have been going for a few years now. The drinks are excellent. I used to come here more in the mornings for my to-go cappuccino. I changed jobs so it is not in my route anymore :-( They do have a lot of cool events for people during the day and music a few times a week. The art is always changing on the walls so there is always something new to look at. The food is quick and easy type. I wouldn't come here for a meal but more for a snack or dessert and drink. The last time I was here I sat on a very uncomfortable chair (at a table) that I quietly switched for a different one.
