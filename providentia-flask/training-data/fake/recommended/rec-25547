The food here is not terrible, just a generic bagel joint. Usually get the bacon egg and cheese, which compared to other places is good but not great. The big problem here is that the service is slow. Super slow. Now normally I know it takes a few min to get a fresh B/E/C and i'm cool with that but this places takes forever. Even when I just go to order bagels it seems like an eternity before I'm out the door. Also went there last Monday and it was closed, I guess they think people don't eat breakfast on a Monday?? With many other choices around I'd say skip this place unless you have an hour to kill.
