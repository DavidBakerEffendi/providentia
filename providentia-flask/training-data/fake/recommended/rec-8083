I'm sad that I've lived in Philly for three years without knowing about this place!  :( But so happy that it's now a part of my life... The noodles here are sooo...SO YUMMY! Perfect for a cold winter night... The knife-shaved noodles are perfect!  I had the beef and the brisket - I would recommend the brisket.  It's so succulent and tender... Pretty much everything you eat here will hit the spot...one of my favorite places, ever.  And the staff is so kind...:)
