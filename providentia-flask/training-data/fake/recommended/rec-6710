I expected the pizza to be pretty good with a name as Italian Tony V's, but quickly found out this was a false notion. I went here for a late lunch and saw no one else there...I thought it was probably empty because it was too late or no one knew about this small place...once again this was a false notion... this place sucked. I got TWO slices of pizza - wish I had gotten zero. It was dry, stale, and bland. The sauce tasted like sour ketchup and the cheese was like eating rubber from an old Pontiac. I would not be surprised if the Dosai Place across the lot had better pizza. I will never come here again.
