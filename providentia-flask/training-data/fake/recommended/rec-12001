Love love love Taim!  The falafel here is really first rate and in my opinion, the best in the city.  Yes, it can often get crowded and seating is at a premium.  However but if you have time for a nice lunch outside, Taim is the place to go.   I always get the Harissa falafel in a pita and I find a nice spot in the West Village to eat outside, relax and enjoy life in New York.
