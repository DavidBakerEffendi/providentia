soooooo good~ the wait is ridiculous though, even for just one person. *pork ramen - YUM! get this! a little pricey - ~20 bucks for a bowl of ramen?! *bun with pork belly thing - SO GOOD. kinda like peking duck but better *shishito peppers - mm no, sickening. maybe good if you share with other people *chicken wings - ewww, don't get this the only issue with this place is they wouldn't let me take stuff to-go and i had SO MUCH TO TAKE to go! some japanese tradition they said....sigh. so yummies, i want to go back!!! just for the pork buns things..mmmm delicious.
