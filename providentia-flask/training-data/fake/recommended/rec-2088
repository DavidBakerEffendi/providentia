sentimentality aside, being first does not always mean you are the best.   had a couple of hours to devote to a wiz wit taste test: pat's, geno's, and jim's. pat's was the lowest quality overall.  not enough meat and what was there was fatty and hard to chew.  as if to hide it - drowned in wiz.   in fairness, i have had pat's before (years ago) and was more impressed then.  perhaps a bad day?  or they've gone downhill.
