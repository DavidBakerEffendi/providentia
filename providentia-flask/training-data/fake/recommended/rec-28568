Tiny restaurant in Hell's Kitchen - seats about 20 people or so. Really attentive service and a small but mighty menu. I was just dining with one other friend so we weren't able to try as many dishes as we would like but the two big winners were the meatballs and the goat cheese crostini. The meatballs were delicious - moist and flavorful. We were less enthused by the "shrimp 'n' grits" - the rice porridge grits lacked flavor and the sauce on top didn't compensate for it. Pretty good wine list, especially for wines by the glass.
