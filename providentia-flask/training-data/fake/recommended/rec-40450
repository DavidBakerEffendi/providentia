I went last weekend with the rents for my moms bday breakfast at about 945am. We all ordered different items. I had the salmon hash, my dad had an omelette and my mom had the pancakes. All were just average. Honestly, my regular diner is better. The salmon hash was just so-so and the poached eggs slightly overlooked. My dad was not thrilled with his omelette. My mom only ate one pancake. Our bill came to $54 for 3 so for thee non-AM-drinkers, it was on the pricier side since brunch included a mimosa or Bloody Mary. We choose OJ instead which happened to be very good. Unlike other posters, I thought the service was excellent. Although the place is cute, I would not go back.
