There are some places that you just can't go wrong with. Whatever your little qualms are, I'm sure The Saint Austere will make you forget them. I wouldn't pass this spot up for anything, just walk in, order a drink and try a tapa. That's all that will be required for a good time to start off right. Wine list, beers? Relevant and awesome, the options are available, service top notch, and a lot of personality seems to be in the place.
