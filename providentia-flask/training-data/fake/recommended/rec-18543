I'll definitely be back to Wheated for drinks. Interesting concoctions from all over the world! If it isn't obvious from other reviews: this is fancy pizza, not 2 Bros.-type stuff. I usually like a big, greasy slice with a ton of sauce. At Wheated you'll get a giant personal pie with very thin crust. ~Half the pies have no sauce at all so I ordered mine with sauce -- next time I'll have to order double sauce. But it's very obvious all the ingredients are good quality and a lot of thought was put into the menu. Mostly, I'm ecstatic that higher-end places like this are popping up in the area left and right. No need to schlep farther north in Brooklyn for a night out anymore!
