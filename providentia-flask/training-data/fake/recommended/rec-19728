Sweet! Stopped in here on a Saturday around Noon. There was a bit of a wait because there was only one person working, but I'd say it was worth it. It was still breakfast time for me so I opted for the Omelette Crepe (without mushrooms) and it definitely hit the spot. The girl behind the counter was very friendly and she really knows how to work that crepe grill thing. My iced coffee was good too, probably the best in the area (although I'm new to Woodside and I'm still exploring!) One less star because it was about 25 minutes from the time I walked in, to the time I walked out with a crepe, and I was the only person there who ordered and was waiting. I wasn't in a rush so I didn't mind, but if you're looking for a quick in/out crepe before catching your train, you might want to consider something else. If there was another person behind the counter making the crepes/taking orders, I'm sure it wouldnt be an issue though. Also: Can someone please explain the "Please return baby elephant" sign in the tiny glass dome on the counter? I was baffled but never asked. lol!
