This is the best diner on Earth! The atmosphere in there is so lively and warm. It is always decorated for holidays - it has a fab Halloween decoration now so your kids are sure to love it. Tom and his Mother are always very nice and friendly. The staff is great and the food is awesome. I'm not a huge sausage & eggs eater but their eggs & beef sausage dish is the best. This place is so popular it's always packed. Weekends are very busy, sometimes you have to wait on a long line which goes around the corner, but it's so worth it. Plus Tom distributes hot chocolate & hot coffee to the waiting crowd in the cold winter months :) We love this place!!! Prices: couldn't be better. No cards, cash only.
