my favorite thai spot in the city - and that's saying a lot because i love thai food! they have great drinks (lychee martini's my favorite!) but this place definitely stands out when it comes to their food. The decor is great - grey and purple theme with lots of mirrors all around, even the ceiling! Definitely get an appetizer - the tom ka kai soup, assorted fritters, calamari, and thai salad are always great choices. For your main course - they have spectacular pad thai, massaman curry, thai basil chicken/beef, or their special duck dishes. I usually stop right there because by this time, I'm so stuffed, but I'm never disappointed with their meals and their service. This is also a nice place to go for company dinners because if you have to split the bill or require extra copies of receipts, they never even bat an eyelash or give you attitude. I would HIGHLY recommend this place if you love thai or are just looking to try it for the first time.
