I love tapas more than anything and this place has been on my list for the longest time, so I was especially excited to try it out last Friday. The space is definitely tight and the chairs aren't too comfortable either, but the food was excellent. Really loved the dipping sauces they served with the bread too. We ordered the scallops dish from the specials menu, and didn't realize it had bacon in it which I don't eat. When the server realized this, she was so apologetic and even took it off our bill. Talk about exceptional customer service!
