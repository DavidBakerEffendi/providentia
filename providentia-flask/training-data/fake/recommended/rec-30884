This place is so good! I've had jerk chicken, oxtail and fried chicken. I love the oxtail the most. The only things that I don't totally love is that the place doesn't have too many tables so you have to do take out most of the time. The tables are mostly used by people waiting for takeout. I also think that they could be more clear about their hours. Several times I have tried to go but it was closed. But, the people who work here are incredibly friendly and care about the food they make and serve, the food itself is delicious and authentic and not too greasy or salty. Get collard greens and oxtail, those are my favorites.
