Ordered a chicken club panini. The menu said 'breaded chicken cutlet, crispy bacon, brie cheese, tomato and ranch dressing'. Sounds promising right? Ehhh... The chicken was neither breaded nor crispy. It looked and tasted like a chunk of mystery meat and they forgot my bacon :( The one good thing is that the sandwich guy had no problem substituting brie cheese with American. I'll try this place again and hope that my next trip will be better.
