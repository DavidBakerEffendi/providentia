A step up from Geno's. Still not that amazing of a steak. But let me drop some real knowledge. STAY AWAY FROM THE PIZZA FRIES. I should have known what I was signing myself up for. The concept sounded like it could have been awesome. Fries, marinara, mozz or prov. But nope. It's fries, marinara, and CHEESE WIZ. DIS....GUSTING. What a waste of $4. But yeah, stay away from those, and you ought to be golden. Still, what a letdown in terms of steaks.
