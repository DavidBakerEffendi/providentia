Great food, nice atmosphere, friendly service. Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and was impressed by the friendly staff, reasonable prices and outstanding food. I suggest the butcher's platter with pulled pork, pulled chicken and smoked burnt ends (these are a must). I lived in North Carolina for three years and have had a lot of good barbecue, Butcher Bar is one of the best.
