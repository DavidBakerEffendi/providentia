Brooklyn Star is one of those hip, swanky, neo-Southern cuisine spots.  They take your usual, staple comfort meals and jazz 'em up a little.  I live two blocks from this establishment and at the time of this review, I've had dinner once and brunch once.  And brunch won by a landslide. My girlfriend Vanessa U. and I went on a Sunday.  Brunch ends at 4pm so we purposely went near the tail end (around 3pm) so we wouldn't have to wait long.  It was still slightly busy in there but we only waited about 15 minutes to get seated.  You also have the option to sit at the bar but that's first come, first served. By the way, with the exception of the booths on the wall (for bigger groups), Brooklyn Star has a communal seating setup.  If you're a party of two and trying to get some one-on-one romantic time or a business brunch sort of situation, this may not be the move.  You'll probably end up sitting next to strangers.  But it's not uncomfortable or anything.  It's a very casual and loose atmosphere. I ordered the masa cakes w/ chorizo, black beans and poached eggs.  Vanessa U. had the ham steak w/ mashed potatoes, red eye gravy and fried eggs.  Both were super on point.  Very nice-sized portions.  The flavor was bold and we were definitely satisfied.  We also washed these down with two cocktails each (that I wish I could remember right now).  And this is what shot our bill up.  Drinks are a little on the pricey side.  But it's hard to say no because the cocktails are well-made.  Please be advised that you're not going to get any special drink deal or anything snazzy like that.  This is straight, no-chaser BRUNCH. It's good to know that there's such a quality eatery in the area.  It definitely has a neighborhood feel to it.  I'd recommend that anyone give it a go, whether for a meal or to just pop in for a drink.  It's like Cheers with more facial hair.
