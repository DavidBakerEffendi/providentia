I went to Xochitl with a group of 5 other friends for restaurant week. The atmosphere and service was very good, even if it took a while before we placed any orders. We ordered guacamole for the table that came in a heaping pile and was fresh and tasty. For appetizers, I got a dish that was essentially a small pizza that was topped with mushrooms and chicken. It was decent and filling, but very greasy. My friend was not pleased with her empanadas appetizer. For my entree, I got shrimp in a poblano pepper smothered in cheese. The taste of the cheese was overwhelming, and unfortunately the cheese wasn't anything special. My friends that got the short ribs were disappointed with the lack of flavor in their dishes too. We got a bottle of hot sauce, and it helped a lot. I'm not one to love spicy foods, but I need a little bit of flavor. My friend who got the steak and potatoes enjoyed her food (though what Mexican place serves steak and potatoes?) I'd maybe come back for tacos & drinks, but I wouldn't bother with the high prices of restaurant week.
