If I had a complaint it would be that the bar is too small. We were seated on time for our reservation and our waitress was well seasoned and efficient. The house margaritas are delicious. Both ceviche appetizers offered on the menu are awesome. The fish tacos entree came with 2 tacos which were fresh and tasty. A restaurant well worth revisiting!
