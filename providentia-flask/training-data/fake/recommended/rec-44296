OK... let's get this part right out of the way...If you are looking for a family friendly, clean and modern place to eat, with friendly, attentive wait staff, THIS IS NOT IT!  Please go somewhere else!   All of the negative reviews on this site are dead on and you will experience exactly what all of the other reviewers have experienced as far as service and atmosphere!  Rude inattentive wait staff, CHECK!, Outdated 70's atmosphere, CHECK! Dirty walls, dusty pictures and cluttered surfaces CHECK!  Long wait times for no apparent reason, CHECK! No particular order as to who gets seated or when they get served, CHECK!  All of these things are very true and quite appalling, BUT...... .....If you are looking for an absolutely great pizza, and you can forgive all of the negative things, then you have come to the right place! The pizza alone is the only reason anyone should ever eat at Sally's!  The pizza is better than Modern Pizza, The Bar, and Grand Apizza.  It's about on the same level of Frank Peppe's and The Spot. There is one really odd thing I saw on their menu....they charge $.90 to $2.50 extra for Mozzarella on their Pizzas??  Why do they need to charge more for this?  Is this not included on all pizza pricing in every other pizza restaurant I've ever been to??? I give Sally's Pizza 4 Stars based on their pizza ONLY!  If I'm taking the entire Sally's Pizza restaurant, pizza, and experience into account, I'd give it 2 stars. I feel there is absolutely NO reason for this restaurant to be in the physical shape it is and have the horrible service that it has.  Pizza goers deserve a better overall experience to go with their excellent Pizza.
