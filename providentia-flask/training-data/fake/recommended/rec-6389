What a wonderful addition to the block! I am a huge fan if Russo's in the East Village, this place has the same level of high quality ingredients, but they bring a certain level of elegance and extra freshness. The paestum sandwich is unreal, beautiful presentation, they added some fresh basil and sun dried tomatoes and it was delicious. The inside has an Italian feel and a few seats to sit down and enjoy. The sandwich was served on a board and looked like it came out of a magazine photo shoot. Also try the green olives!!!
