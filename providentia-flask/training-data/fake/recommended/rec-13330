A great place for lunch. They don't take reservations but the wait wasn't too long on a weekday (I came at about 1:15pm and was seated by 1:30).  I had the Souper Sandwich so I selected the meatball sandwich and the chicken noodle soup.  Comfort food for a chilly day.  Unlike other meatball sandwiches which oozes of sauce and gets all messy, this was a bit on the drier end.  Still good but I wish there was a tad more pesto mayo for some added flavour.  It was tasty though.  The meatballs were moist.  The soup was nothing spectacular - what you'd expect from a chicken noodle soup. I enjoyed it and service was attentive.
