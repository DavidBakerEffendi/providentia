super fun place to visit for a few drinks. had an amazing experience here after visiting the best cocktail bars the city had to offer. was denied entrance on the first try (bouncer was a fuck head) but the second go made up for it. was really impressed with their selection and atmosphere. total change of pace from comparable bars and a much larger space than expected. steve schneider was behind the pine and pouring drinks like a madman - real, real fun guy. had about 4 shots of fernet and he had me and my pal pour another round for the three of us before leaving. this will be one of the first places i'll visit when i travel to the city again.
