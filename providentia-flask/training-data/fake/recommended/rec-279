Heard about this place from a friend. Boy was I glad that I did. Was easily able to reserve a table for 2 @ 10pm on a Thursday. Just in time for the flamenco dancers. Loved the decor. Had the champaign sangria was delicious. You'll wanna get the full pitcher. We had ordered 4 dishes to share. Steak was delicious and also had goat cheese. Any plate that passed looked great! Waite staff friendly and always kept my glass full. I will return
