Yay, I finally made it back to Hearth!  And it's still good.  We almost ordered the cheese plate for dessert, but we did not, so it looks like I'll be going back again soon.   The winter menu is wonderful, but I will say it's rich, so when reviews say, for example, that the fish is cooked with a heavy hand, I think this is what they mean.  Nothing too salty this time, and everything was good or great. Warm Autumn Vegetables - GET THEM.  I could have them for dessert.  I like cheese for dessert though, so do not think this means they are sweet.  They are actually like experiencing each phase of a meal in one dish (appetizer, entree, dessert) in a wonderful way.   Octopus, bam, great, and not chewy which is an easy fail for Octopus.  Duck - awesome, served rare, which is the only way to serve it, Tilefish, boo-ya.  (Is that how you spell boo-ya?).  The Tilefish was heavy for a fish, but still very good, because of the slight bite to the kale.   Hen of the Woods mushroom side tasted like the best of the Earth.   The only thing I will say is that I wasn't happy with the wine choice.  My friends liked it, so I still give Hearth 4 stars, but I wasn't pleased.  I'll just choose my own wine next time, like I did last time.  Also, didn't see this mentioned anywhere, so maybe it's only me, but the sommelier was a little intense.  He actually splashed our wine when he poured it.  I'm 99% this was my waiter from my previous review.   All in all a great meal.  See you soon, Hearth.
