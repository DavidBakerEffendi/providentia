There's a plaque at the entrance that says, "I would rather eat at a bar then drink at a restaurant". This is a sports bar with lots of TV's showing Philly sporting events. If you're wearing a Mets, Giants, or Cowboys shirt, enter at your own risk. Not much on the menu is any good, but what is good is VERY good - the crabs, the wings, and the crab fries (seasoned with C&P's own Old Bay-like blend and served with cheese sauce). The burgers and sandwiches are mediocre. I have never tried the pizza. If you like crabs, this is the place. Sizes and prices vary by season and availability. They are meaty and seasoned to perfection. The wings are also meaty and just spicy enough. The crab fries are legendary. The service is very attentive. This is a great place to watch a game, as long as you're a Philly fan!
