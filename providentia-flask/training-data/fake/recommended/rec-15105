We were going through Philadelphia to New Jersey to try to secure housing for the Fianc√© before the next school year. Even before our flight left San Francisco he was already talking about this place. We got to Redding Terminal right in the midst of the lunch crowd so the line was quite long. I got the Roast pork sandwich with rabe. The pork was a tiny bit dry so the rabe really helped in the moisture department. We took our sandwiches to go since there weren't any open seats at the counter; this led to a soggy bun situation that made the eating a little difficult. The sandwich as a whole was delicious but the broccoli rabe...oh how I love that broccoli rabe! I love it so much I could eat it all day, everyday. Even though the line was long, it is extremely efficient so make sure you know what you're going to order & make sure your payment is ready by the time you reach the end.
