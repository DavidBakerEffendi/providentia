Great BYOB in South Philly.  Informal casual atmosphere.  Good menu selection: pasta, seafood and meat all have great choices.  Seafood alla scannicchio is my personal favorite.  Portion sizes are large and you should have enough to take home for lunch the following day.  Complimentary limoncello is a great way to end the evening.
