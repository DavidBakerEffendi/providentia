A delicious and ridiculously affordable mean. 5 of us ate (with a few drinks) for about 50 bucks. Beers were only 3 bucks which is how it should be done. I had the Pho Ga (chicken pho) because I'm a big fatty on a diet but food everyone else had looked amazing. It was a light pho but very tasty. A couple across from us had a big plate of what looked like lamb chops and some greens and some sort of fish dish. I'll be back.
