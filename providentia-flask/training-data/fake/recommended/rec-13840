I went to Almond last night with a friend, per the suggestion of BlackboardEats. First and most unfortunately given the heat wave that is currently pounding New York, the restaurant didn't seem to have its air conditioning on. As a result, just sitting in the stifling restaurant resulted in an uncomfortable meal. For drinks, we each ordered a craft summer ale (apparently their only beers on draft are local craft beers--which is a rather nice touch). While I love trying new microbrews, the beer was a bit tasteless... I ordered the ravioli for dinner. The dish was good and had a nice summery feel but it was not something that I would crave in the future. I'm glad that I gave Almond the try but considering the high prices and average food, it's not a place that I will go back to anytime soon.
