When I was a kid I used to dine here every other weekend with family in glorious Bergen County, NJ. I'm so happy Houston's is in the city. The veggie burger is life changing. I am not a vegetarian at all and the term 'veggie burger' used to seem like an oxymoron to me. Now I go for it every time. A must-try.
