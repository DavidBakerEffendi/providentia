I've ordered from this spot a handful of times over the past couple years. I love how they pack the food, everything is tied up tight and securely, never any spillage or unnecessary food mixing. They always include plenty of house made salsa, which is fresh and delicious in my opinion. There's the orangey-red hot salsa, and the milder thick/green tomatillo salsa. I've tried a variety of flavors, usually from the Taco and Burrito sections of the menu. I unfortunately cannot offer advice to vegetarians, as most of my menu choices have involved meat. However, I can tell you the guacamole is fresh/tasty, and the corn tortilla chips are fresh/tasty and usually arrive to my SW CC home hot. As a repeated Mexican food binge offender, I can offer a few of my favorite dishes from this taqueria. The Mexican sausage/beef tacos are delicious, as are the al pastor tacos. The taco platters come fresh with sliced radish, slices of lime, and two corn tortillas per taco (3 tacos per order). I also enjoy the sausage/beef and al pastor burritos. I can say as a man who enjoys delicious meat and Mexican food, those two are unique and delicious flavors that will give you your money's worth. The burritos are large, and absolutely enough for a full meal. The burrito comes with pintos, rice, lettuce, sour cream and pico de gallo packed in with your choice of meat/vegetable. The tortilla used for the burrito is fresh tasting and chewier than it is crunchy. Also, try a Jarritos Mexican soda alongside the food. A beer would work just as well.
