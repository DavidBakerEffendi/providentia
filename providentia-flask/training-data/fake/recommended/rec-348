I agree with Loretta H. - it's only worth going if you can get a seat at the counter, because it's all about the show. But it's a pretty good show. When you place your order, your waiter shouts it out to the chefs, who yell back, "Eh!" or "Oh!" They then use a huge wooden paddle to dig out your raw vegetable or seafood from the ice in front of you, and serve it back to you on the paddle after it's grilled. There were two families sitting at the ends of the counter, and the kids loved it (as did the Japanese salarymen and Taiwanese tourists sitting around us). The food itself is not as great as at Sakagura - the grilled vegetables are delicious, but honestly nothing you wouldn't expect from grilled vegetables. You're given three condiments - pepper flakes, a sweet soy sauce, and salt - and you will definitely end up using them at some point. The tsukune comes in teriyaki and salt variations but seems to be precooked and reheated on the grill. The gindara (cod) with miso was deliciously tender but also less than a third the size of my hand (and $13). In any case, I'm guessing the owners never intended the food to be their main draw - that would be the atmosphere. But as long as you're going with that in mind, it's a fun and pretty unique experience for Manhattan.
