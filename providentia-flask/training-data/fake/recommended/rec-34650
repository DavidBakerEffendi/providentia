We came here from New Jersey. And this one beats a lot of NJ Indian restaurant hands down. We had the veggie buffet and it was authentic South Indian food. My friends had the chicken tikka masala dosa and were raving about it all. We ended it with the pan-kulfi. It has a unique kick to itself. Nice place with the right mix of spice and authenticity.
