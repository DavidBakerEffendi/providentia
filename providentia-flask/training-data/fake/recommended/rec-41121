I've been here a few times for brunch. At $12 it's a good deal but I was never completely satisfied with the food until I ordered the BISTEC. A filet cooked to order over chorizo hash topped with an egg and verde salsa. Meat-lovers should definitely go for the steak since the other brunch dishes are light on meat. Great interior and atmosphere but it gets crowded. When I get the chance I'll visit for dinner and drinks with friends.
