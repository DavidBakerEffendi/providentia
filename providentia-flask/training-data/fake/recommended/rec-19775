I have warmed to this place a bit after an outstanding turkey and provolone sub last week.  Fresh, tasty, and OK size-wise.  Their sandwiches are not typical-deli-sized - which is sometimes a good thing.   Would get more than three stars if 1) they had even half-way decent coffee 2) there was SOME type of atmosphere/banter with staff 3) It didn't always look like they were about to close for good and/or just opening.
