OK... I really don't see how people can seriously say Pat's is better than Geno's!! HUH?! Geno's is definitely KING in these parts! Since Geno's doesnt chop up their meat, it seals in the juices (fat)! You want a fatty cheese steak for that makes is so flavorful. Also, that dirty water of Philly makes for great bread!! I must say I was extremely happy that I was able to get a Geno's cheese steak at 2am while hurricane Irene was blowing away!!! When you get that craving, nothing will stop you!!
