I've never disliked anything from B2. They have some seriously great smoothies, and the option to choose fat free, sugar free, or dairy free frozen yogurt earns them extra points in my book. I've also been please with the baguettes. Something as simples as avocado, toffuti, red onion, and sundried tomatoes on crusty bread turned out to be seriously delicious. My only gripe is that they are cash only. If you have the time, run to CVS or Acme for a pack of gum and cash back and save A bit on the ATM fees.
