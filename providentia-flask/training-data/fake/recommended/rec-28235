This review is for a takeout experience. My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this joint while looking for a quick bite to eat on the way home & this menu looked totally scrumptious!  We ordered the same panini which was grilled chicken, mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and basil pesto. (& I snagged a cookie from the jar that was SCREAMINGGG my name!!) The sandwiches were alright.  They were definitely on the healthier side which was a plus, but they were a bit plain.  Plus they forgot to add tomatoes to both sandwiches.  The cookie was great.  My boyfriend isn't big on sweets and he kept asking for more of it. I think I'd give it another go if I was in the neighborhood, but probably wouldn't go out of my way to get back.
