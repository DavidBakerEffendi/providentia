Great place in alphabet city! Real mexican food that is delicious and staff that is friendly and attentive! It is my go-to mexican spot in NYC for things other than your run-of-the-mill tacos and burritos. Great margarita options and their happy hour also has appetizer specials in addition to drink specials (note: at the bar only)
