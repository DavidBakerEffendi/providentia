I literally just walked out of this place 5 minutes ago. I've been planning on trying applewood for around 3 years but never seemed to get around to it. I always forgot about it and it is kind of tucked away and hidden being off the avenue. But I must say this place is kind of like a hidden gem. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I started off with an appetizer of pork belly and bourbon soaked beans which was really amazing. The pork belly was tender on the inside with a crispy skin. It also tasted absolutely insane. For my main meal I had the blue fish with collard greens and roasted potatoes. The fish was very good. Tasty and cooked to perfection. The collard greens were the only part of the meal that wasn't extraordinary. They were average at best while the potatoes were also very good. For dessert I had the bread pudding which is one of my all time favorite desserts and they did it quite well. It was topped off with pumpkin ice cream and caramel glaze. It was very very tasty. I am quite glad that I finally tried applewood and I will most likely be back.
