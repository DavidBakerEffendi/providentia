Had an amazing night at Bayou for me and the wife's birthday with 12 of our friends. The place did a great job of accommodating us and making some adjustments to the table. The staff was fantastic and very nice even with a rowdy table of 14. The food was once again superb. They made a bunch of plasters made up of their appetizers and it was delicious. I once again beyond enjoyed the alligator bites as they were fantastic. For the main course Â I had the NY strip and it was cooked and seasoned perfect. My wife had the ribs and they were so tender and seasoned perfectly. Even when we were waiting at the bar the bartender was able to treat us right. We were a large group and the place is more of a cozy setting. But they made us have a fantastic night and birthdays! Thank you Bayou!!!!!!
