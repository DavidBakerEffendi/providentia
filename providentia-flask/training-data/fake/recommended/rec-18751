This place always seemed crowded when I've walked by so decided to give it a try - got a nice cozy table in the corner.  Was pleasantly surprised with the menu - lots of smaller tapas-type plates to share, and really great selection of entrees.  Had the almond-crusted scallops which were amazing, as well as the chicken skewer plate - lots of flavor and not overwhelmingly large - will definitely be back!
