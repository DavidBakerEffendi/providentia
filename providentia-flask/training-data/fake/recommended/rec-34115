Food here is pretty good, and menu is creative. Service, however, is subpar. Coming from LA and NYC, I guess I'm used to a higher standard of customer service, but it should never take 10 mins to get water or a check in from your waiter. When she did arrive (after serving ppl who arrived after us) she had an attitude. Will only ever do take-out here when desperate.
