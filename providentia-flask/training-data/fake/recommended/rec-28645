I have been dreaming about Lucali's pizza for weeks. In some ways, I wish I had never gone -- all other pizza pales in comparison. Me and my boyfriend went on a friday night, and couldn't get a table - they were full all night. We ordered take out, and ate the basil-garlic pizza on the bench outside the restaurant--it was unreal. The marinara is fresh and packed with flavor, the crust was both crunchy and bready, and the garlic and basil were perfect. It was unbelievable pizza. I rave. Bad things: the prices weren't great, and the wait was bullshit...one family was left waiting outside for hours, delayed and delayed by the restaurant. They don't take reservations, and there really aren't a lot of other options in the area if it's full. All of this is nonsense. But it is a testament to this pizza that I am still giving them 5 stars...it is really that good.
