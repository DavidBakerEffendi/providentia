My girlfriend and I thought we would check out something new for lunch, which brought us to the Continental.  We were both surprised by the polish and atmosphere inside; much more than the diner feel we were both expecting.  The waitstaff was also very friendly and kept our glasses full throughout, while electo-tunes gave a mild club feel.  A promising start! However, the food was a bit lack-luster given the pricing, which is where my rating stems from .  I guess it's the Center City premium.  The Turkey Club wasn't assembled with much more than toasted Wonder bread and lunch meat, and my Mexican chopped salad, while very tasty, felt a bit on the small side for $10+. The only reason I might come back would be to try out the fun looking swinging chairs that accompany some of the second floor tables, but otherwise I was underwhelmed.
