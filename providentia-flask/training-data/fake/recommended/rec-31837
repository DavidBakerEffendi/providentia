Prepare yourself for overpriced food and bad service. Shirmp curry. $23  a lake of coconut curry sauce with a few pieces of red onion thrown in and 6 shrimp. Immediate reaction: IS THAT IT?!  (thats like $3 per shrimp) Response from the waiter: "Shirmp shrinks after you peel and cook it" Okay I've had shrimp before, I had shrimp for lunch right before... the problem wasn't the size actually, but there is no substance to the sauce its presented in a way that its just so plain.  This should be closer to half the price.   If your not bringing stellar food and have bad service.... what are you getting?  I guess a new excuse to write a yelp review. We got the curry and roti appetizer I think it was $4 thats decent, someone asked if they could have more sauce? Response from the waiter: "You have to buy another one." Okay I personally wouldn't ask for more sauce but I'm pointing this out to highlight their lacking of customer service... there many ways to say "no" This place needs to work on the different ways they say "no" "yes" and everything in between. Food: Okay Price: CRAZY-too expensive! Space/Ambiance: Large space, many tables and chairs, looks nice.  With decor that one expects to see in a Malaysian/Thai restaurant.    Really unsure how this place could keep in business longer than a few months.  I could never imagine this place to even get half full. BYOB-I heard you can bring your own drinks, not sure if this is true. I personally would never go again, but here you may not have a lot of good food options and are willing to pay double the price and not question the service.
