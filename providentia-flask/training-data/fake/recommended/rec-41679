Delicious gluten free barbecue! All meats are from local New York farms! This place is very new, just got their liquor license new. And still pretty empty but I am sure will fill up once people catch word of how good it is here. They have pork belly, pork butt and another part of the pork I can't remember. The butt was the best! The brisket is also amazing. Chicken too. The sausage really tastes homemade and not store bought mass produced. Sauces were great! A stout tamarind sauce, also gluten free. And a standard amazing BBQ sauce and vinegar. The veggie sides were yum and standard. The coleslaw was light and a little spicy. I will definitely be back. It's tough call between here and Morgans.
