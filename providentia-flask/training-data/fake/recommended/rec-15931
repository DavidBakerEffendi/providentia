The food was excellent but the hostess was terrible. She took my name and number and I received the text notifying me that I was on the list. Shortly after a table was up, but it was near the door and it was freezing outside so we opted to wait for another table further from the door. She suggested we go next door to Booker and Dax (also amazing). We waited for over and hour before going back and asking about our table. At this point there were many open tables and she acted very blase about the situation. She suggested I missed her text or that she had the wrong number - neither of which were possible given that I received the original waiting list text. It's unfortunate that she was such a bad hostess, because Ssam bar is somewhere I could see myself returning to again and again. The dish with homemade tofu and uni was out of this world. I should have reported her to management, but instead, I am going to taunt David Chang with this low review. Really a shame- I've been a hostess, and in the age of Yelp, bad service can come back to bite you.
