Stopped in here on a whim during a trip to Hartford for Saturday lunch. It was probably wise to make the meal an early one, as I can only imagine how quickly this place fills up. It's difficult to review an establishment that's largely regarded as an institution. Even more so as a tourist, and one who knows very little about East Coast style pizza on top of that. I'll do my best not to embarrass myself or the Â establishment. The atmosphere was enjoyable. There are a lot of warm wood tones, large windows, and huge vats of beer that serve as decoration. The waitress was polite and helpful, probably an easy feat since we were one of two parties in the restaurant. The food was truly wonderful. The salad with pears and candied pecans was refreshingly on point, and served as a nice primer for the pizzas. Pie-wise, we ordered a tomato basil and a bacon onion, not realizing how massive they would be. The waitress brought them out on cookie sheets, still piping hot from the oven. It was far too much for two people, but we likely ate enough for six. The real standout, however was the beer. The Damn Good Stout I ordered is a rich espresso stout brewed by the establishment itself, and it certainly lives up to its name. I was mildly disappointed that I couldn't haul one of those vats of it home with me.
