You will never be able to convince me that I can find a better burger. I first went to Sketch Burger about a year ago when I saw how high of a Zagat rating it had. I was skeptical of a burger joint in the Fishtown area, but I went anyway. Best food decision of the last year! I've been back to this place about dozen times and every time I try something new. They update their specials menu often, so you always have new choices. The burgers are mouth-drippingly good, cooked perfectly, and have just enough options not to be overwhelming. Sweet potato fries are excellent. Milkshakes are pretty good as well (although I like mine a little more liquid-y than they serve em). The service is very good, not perfect, but definitely very good for a place like this. Locals flock to this burger joint and it's a perfect place to grab a bite to eat, stave off a hangover, or BYO for an early start to your night. Despite not having perfect decor or service, I can't give less than 5 stars because the food is THAT good. I crave this place.
