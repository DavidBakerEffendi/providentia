I have purchased food from Honey Bakery twice now. I used "purchased" because the first time was "to-go" and the second time was "delivery". First I want to say that both times their food was food was excellent! The first time I ordered the samosas (all three: chicken, pumpkin and another veggie type), cottage cheese cookies, sea salt shortbread and chocolate chip cookies. The samosas were flavorful and I especially liked it with the hot sauce (you might want one hot sauce per samosa - it's not a big container). Out of the three flavors I got - the chicken was the best. As for the cookies, since I read so many good reviews of the cottage cheese cookies, I order over a dozen to share with friends. Everyone loved them... But what was surprising... And I regret only getting four pieces, was the shortbread cookies! Those were a bigger hit and we were all fighting for a piece! On to the second time ... I had gotten food delivered via Seamless web. We ordered chicken gizzards, lamb and veggie pilaf, chakchak. The food came fast and once again food was flavorful and good. The chicken gizzards were tender unlike the what you get at a Chinese food place. Loved the pilaf - I think it's one of the best ones I've tasted. However, for the price, we thought the servings were tiny. We weren't expecting a lot of food but compared to other similar establishments we thought the quantity to price ratio was sub-standard. As much as I loved their food I cannot justify ordering from them a lot... Maybe only on days I feel like spending a little more or when I'm not very hungry.
