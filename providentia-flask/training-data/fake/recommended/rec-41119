Very trendy decor, attentive staffs. When I sit in there, I didn't feel like I was on 8th ave. The waitress suggests me to check in on the Facebook to get a free fish skin as the appetizer. I got half and half soup which was spicy on one side and non spicy on the other.  The spicy side - I wasn't liking it in the beginning since I was expecting the Szechwan type of spicy. But after eating it for a while, it wasn't so bad. It's just a different taste but good. Prices are reasonable. A little on the pricey side depends on what you order. Not much option on the sauce like other hot pot places. The only major complaint I have is the FLIES!  I went around 5pm (they open at 3pm) so I was one of the first tables there. Flies are everywhere and were flying over our food.  The server changed the table for us which doesn't help much.  All in all, food was good, but they need to do something with the flies.
