I was in NYC visiting for a week. Out of all my dining experiences in NYC for the week, I without a doubt ---hands down---would claim my meal at Northern Spy to be my favorite out of the entire trip. The restaurant was packed, but we were greeted and seated immediately. I liked the earthy, laid back decor. We were seated in the last booth near the bathrooms, and I thought I would be annoyed by the traffic to and from the restrooms, but I hardly ever noticed it. The booth was like a hidden nook--very quaint. I enjoyed the atmosphere and it was very fitting to just relax and enjoy the company and food. Our waitress was very helpful with wine and food recommendations. I ordered the Scallops and they were amazing. Perfect color! Cooked to perfection. Melted in my mouth! I had to remind myself to eat slower so I could enjoy and savor each bite. My friend had the fluke and he was enjoying his dinner so much that we both didn't really talk while eating. The staff there are very attentive and friendly. If it wasn't our waitress, another staff member would be at our table topping off our wine glasses for us. When I return to New York, it is on my itinerary to have brunch or dinner again at Northern Spy.
