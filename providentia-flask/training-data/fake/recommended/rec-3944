This review is hard to write because there are actually 3 different Joe Shanghai locations. I've been to the one in Midtown and the one in Chinatown (on Pell St), and would rate them each differently. Basically, go to the Chinatown location, which is the one I give 4 stars. The food is more authentic, and I suspect the prices are a bit cheaper. The only time I've ever gone to the Midtown location is when I have a large group and want to make reservations, or pay with a credit card, neither of which the Pell St location accepts. Yes, they are famous for their soup dumplings, and they don't disappoint. Certainly the best I've had anywhere. I recommend the pork; the pork and crab don't seem to do much for me. I also enjoy eating the cabbage leaf at the bottom of the steaming tray; normal people don't do this but I recommend it. :) Yes, Joe Shanghai is touristy and they have a more mainstream clientele, but that doesn't mean that their food is bad. The Pell Street location is very authentic, with a more extensive menu, while the food at the Midtown location is slightly dumbed down for the non-Asian business crowd, e.g. no ginger in the dipping sauce for the soup dumplings. However, the main reason I don't recommend the Midtown location is because the waiters cop a total attitude. Who needs that sh1t? Or at least give me a passive-aggressive Chinese attitude, not an "I hate my job and I hate you even more" New York attitude. One time at the Midtown location my friend and I tried to order our CHINESE food in CHINESE from our CHINESE waiter, and he rolled his eyes at us and snapped at us in English, because apparently he is too sophisticated to speak Chinese on the job. *whew* The bottom line: eat at Joe's - in Chinatown.
