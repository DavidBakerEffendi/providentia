I'm by no means a food critic...yet. The food at El Almacen was excellent, but it could never cover for the service. This place definitely had a case of the absent server. I was dining alone and I noticed that other tables were getting more consistent service than I was, but that's not the problem. The problem is I saw my waitress once the entire meal, to take my order. After the meal she dropped the check. I'm a waitress myself, I get it, sometimes you don't want to work, but a cheesy, "how is everything?" is definitely better than nothing. I hate to be picky about service seeing as I work in the industry, but even the bussers were supbar. He came to clear the table and left my knife and dirty napkin. This is a small place, it wasn't crowded on a Monday, there is no excuse not to be able to do your job well. On to the food, I ended up getting avocado fries and the rabas (which was amazing). At the beginning of the meal, I was considering going back to try the entrana which a lady next to me was having and it looked soooo goood, but I'd rather not after that service experience.
