I went here twice.  Once for a savory crepe, the Garlic Chic.  Very tasty!  My first time having a non-sweet crepe and I was very pleased.  They have a wide selection of craft beers and wines.  I loved my experience so much that I came back the next day for breakfast, and I was glad I did!  I had the Heartbreaker, which is nutella, strawberries, bananas, and whipped cream.  Their coffee is so good, too.  I love the decor which creates a campy, outdoorsy feel.  One of their servers went out of his way to give me directions to the Von Trapp Lodge near Stowe.  Great service.  Moderately priced but well worth it.
