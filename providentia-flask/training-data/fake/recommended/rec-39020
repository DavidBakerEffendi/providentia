The chips and Guac are my fav! The huac seems to be whipped/pureed.. its amazing. Chips are made in house i believe. The the steak tacos are truly an LA tacos. 2 soft flour tortillas, steak..etc its great! The chicken flautas are a bit dry, but still so tasty! i LOVE THIS FOOD, Be ware, it is in the LES, so its jam packed.
