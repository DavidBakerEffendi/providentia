Went Friday Night. The food was pretty good. Did the Turista menu, which I would strongly recommend because of the variety of food you get. Portions are medium so you end on the fuller side. Can't give them higher than a 3 because if you go without reservation they treat you very rudely. I wanted a table for 2, and the waitress made us wait 20 mins before even telling us that the only table they had available was outside next to the kitchen door/garbage. I took a step inside to see the ambiance and was greeted with a waitress who tried to shoo me out immediately and rolled her eyes when I told her I just wanted to see the inside. We decided to take the seats but wish we hadn't. The whole time we would get shocked by the dishwashers slamming clean plates against the window. By the end of the night we had about 20 mosquito bites between the two of us, and had been shooing bugs away the whole time. Worth going to, if you are ok with the tightness of the space. Do not sit outside if you can help it. Get reservations or you will get treated like garbage.
