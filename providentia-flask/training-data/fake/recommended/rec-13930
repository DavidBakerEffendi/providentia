Tried DiNic's famous Roast Pork Sandwich today with provolone and broccoli rabe and it was DELISH! The bread soaked up all the juices from the tender roast pork, and the broccoli rabe and provolone really added dimension to the flavor and texture profile of the sandwich.  My  only complaint was that I wished the pork was a little more seasoned...but its nothing a shake of the salt bottle won't fix.  Head over to DiNic's if you're at the Reading Terminal and give the Roast Pork a try!
