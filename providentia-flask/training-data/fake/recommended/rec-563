Really enjoyed myself! I'm allergic to shellfish but still felt there were plenty of yummy options. My group took a while to get behind the sharing bit cause we all really liked what we ordered. But highlights for me were the patatas bravas and the patatas in alioli (sp) as well as the meatballs in brandy sauce! Don't let them fool you into thinking the patatas bravas are hot- they were just tasty. I could have eaten just potatoes and meatballs and been perfectly happy. The drinks looked good too-though I wasn't partaking this particular evening. Service was very friendly and they described anything we had questions about as well as letting two of my friends try two different wines and then decide what they wanted. I feel like a lot of places don't do that anymore. We made a reservation so our party of 5 had no problems getting in. I'd suggest making one if you know you want to head there-it did fill up pretty quickly once we were seated around 730. Definitely seems like a later night dinner kind of place. I think it would be fun for a group or for a nice date!
