The pizza is some of the best I've tasted. Literally. Cheap too and very filling. I got myself the 2 topping pizza with pepperoni and sausage and it was worth every penny and dollar. So makes good pizza slice are the elements of having a nice crunchy crust that gives a crunch, the cheese melting off of the slice when the slice is being picked up, and the grease that leaks off of the cheese without the taste of grease being so overpowering. This is definitely my new go to spot from now on as it is very affordable, delicious, and the delivery service was stellar. I can't say anything bad about this spot. Try this spot out!
