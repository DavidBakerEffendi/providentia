7pm on a Saturday and I snagged the last spot in the cramped parking lot. Inside there were still a few tables open and plenty of room at the sushi bar. Service was efficient but aloof (par for the average non-Western eatery). Bibimbap was a small portion (compared to other Korean restaurants). A small meat portion is usually fine because you get plenty of banchan (sides) and a fried egg on top...but Soonja doesn't appear to serve banchan and there was no fried egg in sight : (. My side order of kimchi was delicious - spicy and funky like kimchi should be - but it should have been included at $15. Not bad, but ridiculously expensive.
