Enjoyed yet another perfect meal here.  Tried and adored the turban shell special (an aquatic snail).  This has become one of my favorite seafoods, so it was so happymaking to scoop the meat out, shake the shell, and keep finding more meat.   Also, it's amazing how clean their Motsu tastes. Then of course got my regulars:  tsukune, cheese plate, gluten plate, enoki, sweet and croaker fish, etc.
