i love fogo for a billion different reasons but my experience here last night just made me love it even more. as others here have stated, the service here is VERY fast - extremely attentive waitstaff (not to mention some good-looking cuties...) however, my friends and i HATE wasting food, and they kept taking away our silver plates of bread, mashed potatoes and polenta sticks when it was just over half full. of course, they woudl replace it with a fresh portion, but they were just so fast about taking it away when there was still so much left on the plate! so we got it into our heads that we needed to try to scrape off every last bit before they took it away, because we didn't want to be wasteful. of course, the first time we tried to scrape away the last of the mashed potatoes, a waiter, hovering above our table, reaches to take it away from us. my friend is attempting to coop off the potatoes as the waiter reaches for it, and she holds on to it - not allowing him to take it away and waste food yet again! the waiter, with a patient sigh, goes, "ladies, PLEASE," as if mortified that we were being so stubborn about eating the last of the mashed potatoes. in turn, we were mortified, as we looked like starving children who had never eaten before....but we just hated wasting! so, throughout dinner, we had somewhat of anxiety issues as we attempted to transfer the little appetizers onto our own plates before they got taken away to meet their garbage fates. anyway, anxiety from food-waste aside, fogo was impeccable in service and food. the meats were delicious - picanha and bottom were great, as well as the lamb. salad bar was diverse and i love that they have smoked salmon. the atmosphere makes it look and feel kind of fancy, although there were also some people there in jeans/sweatshirts. i can't wait to go back, minus the anxiety from when they take food away.
