From away and randomly chose this restaurant without any prior knowledge.  This place was amazing.  Had the pulled pork sandwich and it was the best one of my life.  My dining companion had their grilled chicken sandwich and she also said it was the best she's ever had.  The service was very good, the place was very clean and the prices were very reasonable.  Already planning our next trip back!
