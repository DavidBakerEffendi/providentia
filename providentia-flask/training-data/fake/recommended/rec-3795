Echoing so many others, my one and hopefully only trip to Eataly was a disappointment.  It was full of products that featured the latest in foodie vocabulary, but not tasty, fresh and delicious products I would purchase for making a meal at home.  I paid little attention to the seating areas (if I do dine out, I would not wish to do so in a crowded, chaotic grocery store), but simply shopped the aisles for fresh and dried pasta, cheese, meats, seafood, oils and other items one would expect from an Italian grocery. WAY overpriced.  Shamefully so.   Few Americans can afford to eat the food sold and served here.  In brief, Eataly is a sad testament to over-consumption and trendy but often ill-informed foodie-ism.  Simple food does not need staging. Shop in a place in which the majority of the money you spend goes to the farmer, not the marble-draped retailer.
