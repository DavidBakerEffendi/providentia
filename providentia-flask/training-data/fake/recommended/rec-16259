The noodles are verrrrry good... and their pork buns are simply amazing. They're very expensive, but it's worth it. Just go once in awhile and splurge! But one warning though - you may have to wait a long time if you are going after 7:30-8 and that's because there isn't much seating inside, and a lot of people tend to crowd around outside. It's very popular at St Marks and the closest to any quality food. Do yourself a favor and go try out this great ramen place. The only reason why I gave this place 4 stars is because sometimes, their ramen soup is very thick and oily. If you're not into it, as I'm not, it can be rather disappointing. I tend to like the clear, juicy broth..more on the natural side and less on the MSG.
