A great value.  Good pub fare with decent vegetarian options and lots of beers to chose from at a reasonable price point.  Steps away from Church Street and Main Street, the location couldn't be more convenient.  The large wrap around patio makes this place a wonderful spot for a summer time beer.  I'm not much of a beer connoisseur, so I can't speak to the Brewery aspect, but there was an extensive menu of options. Service was just OK.  We arrived before the dinner rush and it was still a solid 15 minutes before someone took our order.  The inattentive service continued throughout the meal, but we were enjoying the sun soaked patio too much to care.
