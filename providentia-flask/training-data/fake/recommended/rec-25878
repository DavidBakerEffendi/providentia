All around great food, tho a tad pricey if your drinking. The house wine was reasonably priced and quite delicious for the price and we were given two types of bread: a regular italian and then a garlic.. I started with the cheese, melon, prosciutto, which was awesome. Completely out of season their cantelope was moist and juicy. The prosciutto was de parma so you cant go wrong there and the cheese was a good mix of parm, goat, and one other im forgetting. For the main course I went with the lobster cannelloni with the vodka sauce (thanks to someone leaving a pic of that on here I could choose nothing else) and I was not disappointed. Everyone else at my table of 4 enjoyed everything that was served.
