Amazing food. I had the vegetable potpie and it was perfection - flaky crust and creamy filling. THE ROTISSERIE PINEAPPLE was GREAT!!  I could hardly believe I was eating Paleo. My partner had 14 organic rotisserie chicken, kale, and mashed sweet potatoes. He practically licked the plate! We topped it all off with wine and beer served by a lovely lady who was very attentive although extremely busy. Then there was desert! Holy moly soooo good! We got two mash bar concoctions (ChoColate Chia and Totally BakeD) and a few squares of the almond butter & puffed quinoa chocolate bar. I would come back just for desert (I have a serious sweet tooth). We loved the chocolate bar so much that I bought one for home.   We sat at the bar near the wine and really liked the atmosphere. Although a little overwhelming to navigate the first time with the various areas, the staff was available to show us around and recommend their favorites. I loved Hu and plan to bring my parents when they are in town for the holidays! Let me add I am not Paleo but healthy, affordable, tasty food is always something I look for.
