Tried the Valley Thunder and Tweksbury. It actually sounds better on the description than actually tasting it. just average tasting meal. probably wouldn't go here again. I do want to try some of the numerous cheeses they sell. I went here on a sunday afternoon on the weekend of the flower show and the terminal was packed but lines moved fast. friendly service.
