We had a lovely lunch 2 days ago. Love the atmosphere, so open and the eye has so much to take in. I had the $9 half sandwich, cup of soup, and field greens salad along with the very generously poured Italian red flight. All the tastes went so well together, especially at those prices. Every time we go to Rizzuto's we are more than satisfied!
