I'm gonna pretend this place doesn't attract a bunch of bros because I love Frankford Hall. Yes, it's where a lot of people from the 'burbs come on the weekends and thus, it gets crowded and security is necessary. Aside from that, though, it's still my favorite beer garden in Philly. Beyond spacious, heaters/firepits outside for when it gets cold, the Bavarian pretzels are huge and awesome, and the beer is reasonably priced with a good selection. It's great on weeknights with nice weather; you can sit outside and play some jenga or ping pong and it's never crowded then. I also am really partial to the exposed brick interior decor, but Steven Starr always kills it with design. Also, the bartenders are super knowledgeable.
