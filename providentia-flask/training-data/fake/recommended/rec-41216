I am not a ramen fan. My boyfriend is a ramen fan and it was his birthday. That being said, Chuko made me a ramen fan. Seriously. We had the Brussels sprouts (sans tossed in fish sauce) and they were crispy without being overdone with the portion perfect for two maybe even three. I had the veggie ramen with the soft poached egg and it was phenomenal. Sort of buttery and rich with earthy tasting noodles and soft cabbage (I think it was cabbage), onions and carrots. SO GOOD. My bf had the sweet potato beer and really dug it. We had to sit at the bar and the waitress was delightful. I told her I was a vegetarian and she made sure anything we ordered (or tried to order) was veggie friendly. Total sweetheart and attentive without being overbearing. Only pain is that they're cash only and you'll probably have to wait for a seat if you get there at peak times, but totally worth it.
