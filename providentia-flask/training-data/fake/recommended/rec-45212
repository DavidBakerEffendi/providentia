I ordered the Black & Blue Burger, one of THE best burgers I have ever had, and I'm very picky about burgers. My husband had a breakfast crepe, and my son had the steak fajita crepe, both really enjoyed them. Kafe Neo has high quality, made-to-order food, but portions could be bigger. Would have liked potatoes included with the crepes, but they were extra. My 15 year old son left not fully satisfied after spending almost $50 for lunch for three people. We will go back, it is good food, but a little pricey.
