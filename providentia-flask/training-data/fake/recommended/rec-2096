I am reading a Lot of reviews about Pats vs Genos. But most people dont know what they are talking about.. I went to Philly Just for the Damn Cheesesteaks and I had Both Pat's and Geno's to compare the two.. To me Pat's wins, by a very small margin.. #1 because it seems to be the more Authentic one, and #2 because of how the steak is chopped...... My favorite cheesesteak would have to be Pat's cheesesteak with wiz cheese and grilled onions. The flavors simply blend together very well.. Geno's tastes almost identical, but it seems like just a carbon copy of Pat's to me.. But I will write a review for geno's and give them 5 stars as well.. because they taste just as good.. I just dont like the way the meat is sliced. For me the quintessential cheesesteak would be a Cheesesteak from Pat's with Both Wiz and White American cheese, with grilled onions.. I have yet to try an authentic Pat's or genos cheesesteak with provolone , mushrooms and bell peppers.. I think It will not be as good as  a plain old cheesesteak with wiz.. Lastly  I must mention that after trying an authentic cheesesteak, the closest we have to this is called "Phillys best" and Im telling you, it rivals Pats and geno's Dangerously close...
