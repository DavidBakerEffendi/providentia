This is definitely the best of this style of food you're going to get in ANY of these fine boroughs we call NYC. Having lived on the west coast for quite some time, I do consider myself to be an expert on the subject and can easily say that this place is the only place I can go for these flavors in this city thus far. Having come back from living overseas for the past two years, I couldn't wait to get back to CA and have some Banh mi. I was pleasantly surprised when I found this place and realized I wouldn't have to wait. Everything is legit here, from the sandwiches to the shakes to the snacks. The only thing missing is some pate chaud. That and maybe that the menu is a little toned down. I didn't see any offering some of the more "special" parts, but I may have just not noticed. The other reviews are spot on about getting the number 1. But all of the choices here are really good.
