i was 1-2 times/week customer since 2007. just re-opened with SAME menu and chef....I loved benito ONE before and looks like new owners care as much as about making the place excellent. very simple, fresh, affordable italian food, summer time/warm weather the best place on mulberry st is there-- center of action sitting outside. if they get the house made carrot appetizer(free) back and maybe some new chairs/furniture i would rate 5 STARS....in any event welcome back!.
