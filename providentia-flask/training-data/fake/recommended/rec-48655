Dear Tattooed Mom, Could I please take you back with me to Chicago?  You are kitschy enough to make me want to wear a granny sweater but still hip enough to stay out late.  Yet it's just enough kitsch that was still companion approved.  The bartenders were on their game and served up some tasty drinks.  Saw a lot of laid back looking locals, nobody acted pretentious.  Too bad we were too stuffed from homegrown and it wasn't wednesday, because the .25 cent pierogi deal sounded amazing.  If grandma style isn't your thing  the perhaps the rock and roll upstairs will suit your needs. The free dum-dums at every table sealed the deal.
