I've got to be the last person in Philadelphia to try El Vez, but I did a couple of Friday nights ago, with friends for happy hour and a seriously energetic winding down session. I'd forgotten that this was a Stephen Starr restaurant, so I didn't have my Stephen Starr guard up when I walked in the door.  What's my Stephen Starr guard, you ask?  Well here's my Stephen Starr disclaimer: Stephen Starr is brilliant!  He's calculating, smart, a marketer par excellence.  He can even recruit some of the greatest culinary talent around and create the perfect mood to accompany the food, but do I love his restaurants?  Not always. I always say that a restaurant is only as good as the bad service and on this night, my first sojourn by High-speed Line to El Vez was not horrible, but as my Aneira put it, it was tinged with the "major 'tudage" of a bad waitress who was so clearly overly-trained in the Starr tradition of push-patron-toward-entree-not-appetizer mindset that we'd have barely had a good time if it weren't for the delicious blood orange margaritas and raw tuna guacamole we were noshing on. So next time, I'll be ready.  Walking into a Starr establishment always inspires me to aloofness and concentration on my friends and our good time, not the crowd, the trendiness or the "theme."  I visit Continental Midtown when I'm in the penthouse mood, Pod when I'm in the playful mood and Buddakan when I'm feeling zen.  Its not that I'm against the marketing Starr is hopelessly hooked on shoving down our throats along with the seared diver scallops, its just that at the core, I just want to hang with my friends and enjoy some good food, however cleverly presented it may be!
