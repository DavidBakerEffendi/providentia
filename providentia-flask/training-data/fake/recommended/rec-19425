I came here for the Dean's Ring in the New Year's Party with my fellow nursing students. Atmosphere: 5 stars - Tall ceilings with huge windows - Grand rotating staircase, perfect for making any girl feel like Beauty and the Beast - Magnificent view of the Brooklyn skyline Food: 4 stars - Delicious guacomole and salsa - Super cheesy quesadillas - Refreshing sparkling water I didn't get the chance to try the rest of the food because it was just too crowded!
