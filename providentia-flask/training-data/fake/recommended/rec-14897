Three stars as a vegetarian, probably more if I ate meat.  This place is super cute and the staff is very friendly.   They were nice enough to let me order the mac and cheese without ham, but it definitely was lacking...something.  I think it was missing creamy cheese sauce, there was not enough cheese with the mac.  The beet salad was refreshing but it contained shaved raw beets (?) not roasted beets, which was a bit of a surprise.  The mint julep was delicious - strong, but not hard to drink.  I heard they have different flavors on different nights, like chocolate, so I'll definitely be back to try that.  I would have tried their only vegetarian entree, red beans and rice, but when I saw the price of $15 for it, I thought no beans and rice could ever really be THAT good, right?  I'm not sure, since I didn't try it, but I can't imagine.  Even though the wait staff was very nice, they were also a bit disorganized.  3 people came to take our drink orders and 2 people asked if we wanted our checks.  I guess it's better than the opposite though, it was just a bit confusing.
