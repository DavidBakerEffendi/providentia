We ate here with a large extended family group of 18 people on Nov. 24, 2014, all accommodated at the large table/grill at the front of the restaurant.  Let me say "wow!" Without a doubt, this is the best Hibachi restaurant at which I've ever eaten.  All of the food was delicious, and the menu is EXTENSIVE.  The owner was our Hibachi chef, and he was both highly skilled and thoroughly entertaining.  I can't say enough about how great the food and service here is, and I highly recommended it.  When we make it back to Wethersfield, we will be back.
