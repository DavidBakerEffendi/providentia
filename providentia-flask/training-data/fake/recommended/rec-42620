As far as Jersey diners go, this was is a bit nicer than most. While having that crazy menu you would expect in a Jersey diner (i.e. 50 different omelettes), it provides a clean and friendly atmosphere. We were seated promptly, brought drinks right away and the wait for food was not bad at all. It was Sunday morning, and while the place busy, it was not overcrowded and the noise level made it still possible to hold a conversation. Next we'll have to try a lunch, because breakfast was spot on!!
