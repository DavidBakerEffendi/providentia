Rex 1516 is an upscale version of southern down home cooking.  I've been here a couple of times: once for drinks, and once for brunch.  Both times here have been pleasant, with good service and decent food and drinks.  On my most recent trip back for brunch, the BF and I wanted to try something out of our usual brunch rotation.  We looked at the menu online and although it was limited, contained enough decently sounding brunch dishes that whet our appetites. After we sat down, our waitress went through Rex's list of brunch cocktails so quickly I barely made out the words "mimosa" and "spicy", but I was still able to get my bloody mary no problem.  For brunch, I had the omelet with duck confit, sausage, taleggio, and sauteed spinach and onions.  The duck was cooked perfectly: juicy, moist, and filling.  The rest of the ingredients were also good except the sausage (I barely noticed it in the dish).  The omelet was also made way better with hot sauce (and they carry Crystal's! Yes!).  The BF's biscuits and gravy were sort of disappointing: two very doughy biscuits with a small helping of sausage gravy on top, with two sunny side up eggs.  One of the eggs even had small bits of eggshell in it.  Not cool. I did find it amusing how our cocktail garnish was very...phallic (a piece of okra sandwiched between two green olives), and aside from one small service mixup (the food runner bringing us the wrong food on the first attempt), there were no real complaints.  Also, it wasn't particularly expensive, which is a plus.  Overall, this is a really nice spot with some creative cocktails.  I would probably brunch elsewhere next time, but definitely a nice place to go for a drink or catch up with friends when the weather is nice.
