We had 2 specials. Chicken with sausage, olives, roasted red peppers. Just one word, Savory.  Chicken was moist and tender.  We just loved the olives with our all food.  Olives are brined in-house. They were just wonderful! The other special was calamari and 1/2 lobster with fresh black fetuccini. Unfortunately, they ran out of black.   Also, great flavor, however the calamari was overcooked. The cherry tomatoes were excellent in the dish.  The main reason behind the order was to try the black fetuccini.  So, I was a little disappointed with this dish.  I would try something else next time.
