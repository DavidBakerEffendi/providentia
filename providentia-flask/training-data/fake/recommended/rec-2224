Decided to compare the 2 best known cheesesteak places in Philly. Since Geno's and Pat's are just across from each other, I ordered a cheesesteak from each place with a bottled water and chomped away. The bread: -- Bread from Pat's was way too tough/. Not only did I have to bite into the bread, but I had to literally tear the bread in order to take any bites. The bread from Geno's was way easier to tolerate. The steak: -- The portion of meat from Geno's was much smaller than Pat's. Also, the meat from Pat's was much more seasoned. I'm not sure if Geno's seasons their meat with anything 'cause it basically tasted like unseasoned roast beef. The filling: -- I got Whiz With (with cheese whiz and with onions) at both places. I liked Geno's onions better, but the whiz was better from Pat's since Geno's was very skimpy on the whiz. The whiz is easily visible on the Pat's cheesesteak, but Geno's put a VERY TINY amount at the bottom of their cheesesteak. I almost went back to ask if they had forgotten to put it on. The price: -- It's same at both places. $8.25 for cheesesteak.  ***CASH ONLY*** Service: -- Service at both locations sucked big time. I guess it's part of the whole "lure" to be rude and even curse at the customers. But I am not into this whole dumb idea of  "Hahhahaa. I just got cursed at at a tourist trap. I can't wait to post it on Facebook and Twitter!"  I still expect people to be nice, especially people who are servicing customers. Personally, both places sucked. The food wasn't all that bad but it wasn't anything close to what I was expecting. I expected more flavor, more meat, more cheese, and most importantly, more taste.   It's cool to check out if you are a tourist. Geno's totally had the look of seedy old Las Vegas decor going on.
