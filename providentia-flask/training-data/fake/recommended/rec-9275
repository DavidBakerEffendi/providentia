Looking for a place that opens till 4am that serves gourmet food?  Well, Blue Ribbon is the place where you can still get fresh bread and delicacies after midnight!  My friend brought me in here on a business trip in NY.  It is a small and snug place, so there was quite a wait (even at that time!) but we ended up sitting at the bar.  But lo and behold it was one of the best raw oyster bars I have ever sat at!  I think I just ended up eating oysters and bread the whole night with a bottle of sparkling water!  My friend had some oxtail concoction that she thought was amazing but I just couldn't get enough of the oysters.  Good thing it was a business expense so it didn't hurt my own wallet!  Downside - this place is in NEW YORK!!!
