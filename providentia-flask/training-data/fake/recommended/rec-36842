Walked in late last Monday night- Everything was excellent.  The service was friendly and the atmosphere was lively.  The Champagne list has a few hard to find jems like Egly and Jaques Sellosse at a fabulous price. It's the kind of place you can always come back to and have a great casual meal, a celebration or just oysters and Champagne.  I love this place!!!!
