Everything you've heard about Corner Bistro is true: it's cheap, it's gritty, it's divey, and it's **the perfect way to end your night if you're getting your drink on around the west side of manhattan. With all due respect to places like Umami Burger and any other variety of $19 burger spots... but Corner Bistro is the kind of eatery that make NYC special. **Perfect may be the wrong term... Nobody should slam a bacon burger then go right to bed. Maybe give yourself a couple of hours to digest...
