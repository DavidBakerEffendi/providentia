The wait went from 45min to about 1.5hrs for brunch. But twice were told it would only be 20more minutes. And meanwhile a harsher wind and cold fell on us outside. Not good. The food was tasty but nothing special and a little overpriced. And the menu failed to say the sandwich came with bacon. My boyfriend and I both had to send it back. This was after waiting 30min for it. Will not return.
