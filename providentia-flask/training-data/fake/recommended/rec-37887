Per my other reviews, I've been looking for a reasonably priced and great quality sushi in old city.  I used to frequent the prior establishment at this same location.  When it closed I was dismayed that my local sushi place had closed.  I was pleasantly surprised when I learned that another sushi place was replacing it.   Almost as soon as Fat Salmon opened, I ordered sushi for lunch.  Great quality!! Great price.  Fat Salmon became my go-to place to satisfy my sushi fix.  However, I haven't gone to Fat Salmon since March and as of right now, I don't plan to.   As I stated, I ordered my lunch special from Fat Salmon almost weekly.  Although I don't currently have a menu in front of me, from what I recall, their lunch specials are served until 3 PM.  One afternoon, ~240 PM I called to order my usual sushi special (3 hand rolls + soup or salad for $10.50 - seriously good deal)(mind you, I had done this many times before as I usually take a late lunch) .  I was curtly told, our lunch service is closed (or we stopped serving lunch).  I ask, but doesn't lunch service end at 3 PM?  response: Yes but we stop taking orders 30minutes before for employee lunch.  I had ordered from Fat Salmon at least 20 times before I was told this new lunch rule.  I tried to sweet talk my way since the menu said lunch until 3 and I didn't know about this rule, etc. etc.   Bottom-line: If your takeout menu says "until 3 PM," you have to take orders until 3 PM.  I didn't get sushi that day, nor do I think I will be going back anytime soon (it's already been 4 months!).  Honestly, this really annoys me bc you can't find quality sushi for a reasonable price downtown any more and this place would have been a keeper.  Because of this incident, I have been actively searching for other sushi places in old city so satisfy my sushi fix.  Guess I'll have to save money and go to Morimoto's.  With that said, the food deserves 5 stars but the lunch issue downgraded it to 3 stars.
