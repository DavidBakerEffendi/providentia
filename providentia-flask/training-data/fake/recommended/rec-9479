We had a really fantastic time at dinner at Fish this week.  The red, white and blue appetizer  - 6 oysters and a drink for $9 was an amazing deal.  They include the cheapest oysters that they offer and they were delicious and surprisingly big.  The lobster roll was also very enjoyable.  Great service (we sat at the bar).  A great place to get good and affordable sea food!
