I rate this place 2/5 because the sushi sits out seemingly forever it seems the staff makes new batches very rarely and also the rolls are shorter than normally expected for a serving. When me and a few friends went out we had also ordered the boba tea. there was something wrong with my friends but not mine and the bartender was very insistant that there was nothing wrong and took offense. Our server was great but still when you examine it this is gimmicky sushi, it is way overhyped because of it's conveyor belt, decent music and distracting tv's and above all locale. It doesn't have the true flavor or soul real sushi has. If you are looking for all-around neutral sushi dining with this experience this place is for you.
