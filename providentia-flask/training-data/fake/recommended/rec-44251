my regular work spot. good wifi, coat racks and plugs under the seats, full food options, open pretty late (though there's not really anyone later in the evening, and they seem to close earlier than the listed 10pm time). i spend a lot of time and $$ here. all of the coffice workers sit in the middle at the communal table, and there's always a blend of workers, parents with kids, and second dates happening at the tables that ring the room. great dinner food (rotisserie chickens, lots and lots of veggie options), awesome sandwiches and french fries and pie and iced tea, good breakfast food (though as some have noted, the breakfast sandwich is unfortunately greasy). the main downside to LS is that it's prohibitively expensive. otherwise, i would be in here 12 hours every day working. breakfast runs you $10. lunch and dinner $10-$20 if you get something to drink. the only cheap thing in LS is the beer, which is all under $4.
