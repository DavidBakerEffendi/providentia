The food is really goos...no seriously it's really good!  The service was friendly and fast which helps because this place gets crowded...probably because the food is freakin delicious.  There is a great Happy Hour and a nice selection of drinks.  This is the place for good quality, good tasting food that has a feel of authenticity.
