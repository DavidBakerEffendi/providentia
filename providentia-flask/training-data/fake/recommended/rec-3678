I went here the other night with my roommate. Every dish we had was excellent, there is a lot of fried stuff, but gourmet fried.  We had the corn, the donut, the nachos and salmon.  If your squeamish, don't ask about whats in anything.  Just enjoy it!!!!! Be prepared to spend a bit if you want to try a lot of things.  The interior is pretty and ghetto fabulous, Justin has a good sense of humor about BK and his new fame.  4 starz!
