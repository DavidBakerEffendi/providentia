The pizza was pretty good! I particularly liked the salsiccia. However, we called ahead to see if we could make a reservation, and they didn't accept reservations but told us we would be fine for a table. Awesome! However, when we got there probably 20 minutes later, the hostess told us we wouldn't be able to have a table for 30 minutes because 2 big groups of 6 were coming in. So they do take reservations? Anyway, we were seated at the little bar by the window with super uncomfortable stools, which made the experience less good. But they do have buy one get one free pizza on Sunday, which made everything better! Overall, it was okay. Not sure I'll be back except maybe on a Sunday.
