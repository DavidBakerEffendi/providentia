Solid pub food.  Standards are good; wings, nachos, corn dogs, and a unique one, frito taco extravaganza.  The crab cake was so-so but the mixed vegetables were surprisingly fresh and cooked to perfection (crisp and flavorful).   The Mac-n-cheese was also very good.  Flat Iron steak had good flavor but the medium rare order resembled more of a medium well.
