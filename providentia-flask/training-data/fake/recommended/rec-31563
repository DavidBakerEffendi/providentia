Had a party, 40 people and the food was good.  The waiter and owner is what spoiled our experience.  The main waiter was impersonal and liked to talk under his breath allot, definitely not a people person.  Since they put my party by the kitchen door, we had a parade of waiters going through our area the entire night.  Getting up (kids or adults) to visit people at other tables wasn't acceptable especially since the owner yelled at the kids not to walk around.  I guess we were in the way of the parade of waiters.  When I confronted the owner, he arrogantly told me to have my party somewhere else, look around at the crowd in the restaurant.  I usually do, but the other restaurant was booked and he was available last minute.  It is a BYOB place, however, the waiters are to serve the wine.  I never had my wine served to me, I had to get it myself.  The meal came out, no fork.  It took 10 minutes to get the waiter's attention.  With all the other quality restaurants in the area that also have great service, there is no need to go back to this place.
