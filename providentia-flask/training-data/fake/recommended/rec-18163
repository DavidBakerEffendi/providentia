My friend and I performed an experiment this past Sunday. We went to Pat's, ordered a steak with provolone and onions. We split it, then went to Geno's and ordered the same thing. The results? Â Pat's had less meat, but was tastier and the roll was excellent. On Pat's cheeseteak, the meat is cut up. Geno's steak had more meat, but was less tasty. The rolls were about the same. As far as appearance, Geno's looks much cleaner than Pat's. You could probably eat off the floor at Geno's!. Both Pat's and Geno's are touristy places. Most locals know that you can get a better cheesesteak for a cheaper place anywhere in the Philly/South Jersey area. Try Chick's Deli in Cherry Hill...
