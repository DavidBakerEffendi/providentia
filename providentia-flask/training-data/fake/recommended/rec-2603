No great cheesesteak can be assembled in less time than it takes to order.  It breaks my heart than so many tourists will know little more than Pat's and similarly inadequate, corner-cutting, canned-attitude sort of establishments.  They are open late, which is a plus and they are preferable to Geno's. But best in Philly?  Not a bloody chance.
