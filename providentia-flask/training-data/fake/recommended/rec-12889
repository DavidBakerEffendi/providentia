I was here a few week ago because of the blackboard eats 30% coupon, so there I am trying everything they have, Connecticut, Maine, the shrimp roll and a clam chowder.  It is pretty much everything they got.  I have to say my favorite is the Connecticut lobster roll, it is warm and creamy, the bun is toasted with butter, topped with spices. Most important of all, the lobster is very fresh.     In a cold winter day, you can always seat at their indoor cafeteria room next door and enjoy those fresh catch!
