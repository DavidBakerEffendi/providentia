I was there to taste the best cheeseburger in NYC 2011.  I'm disappointed.  I can find a better much taste of cheeseburger.  Do not trust the review that we all on the news.  This is a perfect example.   If you want to try it, then great.  Nothing wrong withe burger.  If you have been Five Guy, In/Out, Goodburger then you might feel the same way.
