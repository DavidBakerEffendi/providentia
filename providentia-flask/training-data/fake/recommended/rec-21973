My family and I went to Sushi-Kuu for the first time about a month ago.  My husband and I love sushi, my MIL had it only twice in her life, though she's starting to love it.   We took our two little ones too and in total there were six of us - four of us walked out pretty disappointed. The decor was interesting.  Our whole meal lasted for almost two hours as the staff was extremely s l o w (pretty irritating too when they see there are little ones).  We felt like we were not taken care of properly, I've been to several lately where the servers were quick and personable and helpful.  We were the first ones in that night and the tables around us all had their meals first. The sushi was mediocre, there wasn't anything too special in the "special rolls" selection that popped out at us.  We ordered a few special rolls that had spicy crab and shrimp tempura.  One in our party ordered yaki soba noodles that were pretty yummy  We shared a few special rolls (can't even remember their names - if you know me, I remember everything when it comes to what I had, what is was called, etc), nothing really stuck out as uber-delicious, it was all just alright.   "Meh.  I've experienced better" is exactly what Sushi-Kuu was, head into Morristown next time.
