My girlfriend and I stumbled upon this place while searching for a good breakfast spot near my friends apartment.  I don't know about the dinner menu, but the brunch menu is amazing.  I still daydream about the truffled eggs, the polenta, and the pancakes.  They're like none I have ever had, almost like a biscuit dough, in a good way.  The pressed coffee, also amazing.  Glad to see they carried our hometown coffee (Intelligentsia).   As a design student I really enjoyed the interior of the place as well, light and airy.  The "market", which is a large open cupboard along one wall, is filled with a lot of great stuff too and adds a lot of character to the space. I will return.
