There's nothing I could say that hasn't already been said about Balthazar. Many of its detractors try to paint it as an expensive faux-french tourist attraction. You can however go there any time of the day and find it filled with locals enjoying excellent food and cocktails as well. I could have lunch, brunch and dinner at Balthazar and probably breakfast too if I was up at those hours. The place's ouefs at brunch will have you gushing. Pair that with their breadbasket and you'll find yourself visiting their bakery more than often. The Steak Tartare is as much a staple as their bellinis and mimosas made with real champagne/cognac instead of the cheap swill you're getting at most 2nd rate Brasseries. Enjoy! The set up with the host's desk at the entrance can be quite chaotic, especially if you have a table and have to negotiate the hordes scrambling in line. their prices are at a premium because it's Balthazar and the noise-levels can at times be night clubbish. Still I can't think of a restaurant I've recommended more times for people that just want a plain good NYC restaurant experience.
