Huge portions, and pretty good food. We started with the spreads of hummus, eggplant, etc. And also the calamari.  Both were pretty tasty.  I had the chicken souvlaki as my main dish, and it was HUGE.  Definitely could have shared it.  We also tried the cinnamon cauliflower, which was surprisingly very tasty.  Also ended up sharing a picture of sangria, which was $28 and large enough for about 5-6 glasses...Thus saving us a good amount on drinks. While this definitely isn't an upscale trendy restaurant, it was good for a large group, and the price was right.
