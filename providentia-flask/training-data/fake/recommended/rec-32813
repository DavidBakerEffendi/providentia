Honestly, I have to agree with everything the former reviewer said before her retraction. The food at Masala the freshest, and most flavorful Indian food in the Hartford area. They have a wonderful lunch buffet (great for the indecisive, experimental Indian food newbie), and excellent service to back it up. Give Masala a shot the next time you're in Hartford.
