I googled for the best brunch in Philadelphia and Fork was one of the top hits.  I called immediately to make a reservation for brunch.  Two weeks ago, I had a wonderful meal. First and foremost, the coffee was punch-you-in-the-face strong.  Always the mark of a great restaurant, in my book at least.  Everything on the menu sounded so tasty, I had difficulty picking my meal.  I finally decided upon the house smoked salmon (bagel and lox basically) and I'm so happy that I did.  A toasty bagel, chive cream cheese, capers, radish, tomato, red onion, and fresh smoked salmon.  So awesome.  I ate every last crumb.  It was the perfect portion too.  I wasn't too full or unsatisfied.  My friends ordered the french toast with a berry compote and the omelette with shrimp, leeks, and mascarpone.  Both looked awesome. I would have loved if they had bottomless mimosas or bloody marys, which is a popular Baltimore brunch option, but alas, such is not the case. Service was excellent, though a bit slow at times.  It did become quite busy, so it was understandable.  The decor was beautiful.  Lots of green plants.  Black and muted yellows stand out in my mind too.  Very nice.  Overall, a great experience that I would highly recommend.  Would love to go back for another meal, or just for coffee and the paper.
