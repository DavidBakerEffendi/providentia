If you've read my reviews, you'll know that I prefer small plates vs. large plates, therefore, I usually order multiple appetizers and skip an entree.   I was in NY for five days and I stopped by Blue Ribbon in SoHo for a late night dinner.  We arrived shortly after 10pm on a Friday night and there was a 30 minute wait.  We were greeted by a door staff person and the bartender quickly chimed in while we were still at the door he asked what we would like to drink.  Very friendly staff. We were seated in under 30 minutes at a comfy, cozy table.  The room reminded me of any restaurant in any town, nothing to fancy, dimly lit and not much on the walls.   Server approached our table after a proper amount of time passed and we ordered.  I had the Foie Gras, 1/2 dozen oysters (3 from the east coast, 3 from the west coast) and the bone marrow dish.  Everything was delicious, particularly the bone marrow, served just like my parents would have it.   The only downside would be the Foie Gras, it was not anything special.  I felt as though you could get this dish almost any where, and I've had this exact preparation else where. Other than that, a great dining experience but priced quite high.  You could easily have a $20 appetizer.
