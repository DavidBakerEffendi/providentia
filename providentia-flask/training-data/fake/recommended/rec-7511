Something happened. This used to be a decent restaurant, but now it's just terrible. Previous reviewer had it right, food tasted pre-cooked and/or stale. Pork loin that was probably cooked a week ago. Â Veal Milanese that was unseasoned, deep fried to a cinder and topped with salad mix right out of the bag for $36. Small portions, very high prices for the location and menu. But this isn't about price, I wouldn't eat there for free. The staff was nice, but I feel badly for them, it isn't going to end well for this restaurant. I'd have voted zero stars if that option was available.
