i came here for lunch on a nice day and enjoyed eating at one of their outdoor tables.  i really liked my meal, but you should probably know that i am extremely biased because i love places that allow you to get healthy veggies as your sides.  the gyro was tasty, i got healthy sides, i sat outside -- what's not to love?  this korean-american lady is liking the greek lady!
