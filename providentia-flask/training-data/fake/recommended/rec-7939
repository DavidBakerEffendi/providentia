I really had a lovely time when I went. I apparently chose the perfect night for it too, going out with some friends on a Tuesday night and it was a perfect late spring night: clear, warm enough to sit outside and quiet. I haven't gotten a liter of beer in quite a while, and nursing one took me through the entire night. I had to try a number of things, and their pretzels, bratwust and potato pancakes were all delicious, and great for soaking up the beer in my system. It does start to get expensive real fast but what I had was really quality, and having the option to play Jenga, foosball and pingpong in what felt like a public park was quite an experience, even as your game playing skills decreased the deeper in we got in our drinks. The staff was really nice, and service was quick...of course, it was a week night and I can see this place being packed to the gills this summer.
