Long wait, not a problem! The line wraps around the place, but moves surprisingly fast! For under $10 the portion of this sandwich is very large! My friend and I shared and we were left very full! We got the Pork sandwich with cheese and greens. My local Philly friend says that everyone gets the greens to add for flavor! I love the food because it doesn't have that salty taste after. It's fresh and very filling!
