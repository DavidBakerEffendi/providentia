I had high hopes for this place. but it was kind of disappointing. My friend and I opted for the tasting menu and we expected to taste the best of the best the menu had to offer. The first two offerings were okay--these cold potato puff things and a plate of oysters. Both utilized Â a mint/cilantro water which was fine but I thought it a bit strang to offer two dishes back to back which required the same condiment. The third offering--tandoori quail, was actually pretty amazing. It was the most flavorful dish of the evening. We were really impressed. The octopus was okay. Could have been a little more tender. Paled in comparison to better octopus dishes in the city (Estia, Positano Coast, Dmitri's). The red pepper sauce was nice, though. The biggest disappointment was the lamb shank. I have never experienced a more bland lamb shank. It looked great, but it just didn't deliver--at all. Dessert was nice. We opted for the doughnuts. A little on the spicy side. But for two people they gave us three doughnuts. A big pet peeve of mine--if there are two people, just throw another doughnut on the plate so we can each have two. The stuffed basket of nan was a nice touch and the chutneys were good--especially that green one. Overall, the meal was severely lacking in flavor. Where was that spicy Indian punch throughout the meal? Service was a bit intrusive and we could never really hear any of the servers very well. We were also surprised that the manager never stopped by our table to say hello or check on our meal. We were there for a good hour and a half and the restaurant wasn't filled to capacity, plus it's still relatively new so you would have expected at least a quick visit by the manager. so tasting menu for two, three cocktails and a $190 bill after tip we expected to leave happy and impressed, but we left thinking of a big "meh." Nights like this make me wonder why I eat anywhere other than Zahav.
