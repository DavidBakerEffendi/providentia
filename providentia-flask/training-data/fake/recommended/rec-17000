Prime 151 was a great expierence. Started off with fresh mozzarella and an  eggplant special of which both were fantastic. For dinner we ordered the cannelloni stuffed with short ribs, that was my favorite. The lasagna was very fresh like if your mom made it. The desserts were a great ending. The home-made profiteroles and the gelato were a WOW-- definitely save room for dessert!  Prices are reasonable. Nice outside seating in rear of building.  Remember it's a BYOB.  Owner is a gentleman, very attentive to our needs and didnt rush us out even though we arrivef late.  My wife and I go out to dinner alot, but if this restaurant was closer we would be there alot more.
