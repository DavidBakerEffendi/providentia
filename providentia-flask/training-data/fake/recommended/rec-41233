Love their hot rolls with claw meat. 4 bites and it's gone! The neighborhood is kinda in the middle of nowhere, though whenever I go I drive and theres plenty of street parking because the hipsters in the neighborhood only ride bikes. Place is BYOB which translates to F yea awesomeee!!! I recommend coming here with something in your belly already or you'd end up buying 2 rolls and/or a lobster meal as I did.
