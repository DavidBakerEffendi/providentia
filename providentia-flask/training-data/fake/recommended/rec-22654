It's a pub nothing more nothing less.  Great bartender I believe his name was Rob (Irish to the core- just what I would expect in a pub). Why do I say it is just a pub -well the food lacked luster however in their defense the kitchen isn't really a kitchen....  The fries were cooked in a oven, yes that's to mean not fried (I don't go to a pub to be healthy).  They reminded me of cardboard and those french fry chips they once sold in the supermarket.  The sliders were dated- tasted old, like when you defrost a well seasoned burger and let it sit in your fridge for 4 days before serving it up. All the above was however forgotten following the great music played by the Irish band!  They Rocked and we drank the night away! So will I go back? Yes Will I eat before I go? Absolutely Do I recommend it ?  Yes on a Tuesday that's when the band was there
