Warm and friendly atmosphere, very yummy food!  I am here every month for a regular meeting.  After the meeting tonight  I realized my battery was dead and I had to call Triple A but didn't know the address of the parking lot behind Trend.  I knocked on the then closed Trend, to find out the address.  Instead of just giving me the address, the manager, Alex offered to help me.  How kind he was to jump start my car!  Now I will definitely be more than once a month regular!!!
