I've lived in Tokyo for 3 years and have only had a handful of meals that compared to Wajima. We had the misoshiru, agedashidofu, spicy tuna roll, and sukiyaki. The misoshiru was delicious--fantastic lacquerware and was "roastier" than the standard fare you get a lot of times. The agedashidofu was also delicious. Perfectly cooked and just the right amount for 2 people. The spicy tuna was also fantastic, everything down to the pickle ginger tasted fresh and homemade. The sukiyaki was the biggest hit with us, as the broth and quality of every ingredient was above anything we've had in New York. Lastly, the service was impeccable. Everything down to how the beer was poured was precise, and we couldn't have been more delighted.
