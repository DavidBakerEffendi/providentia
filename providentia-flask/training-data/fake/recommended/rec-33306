I love this place. First of all, it's a refreshing change from my usual "Mexican or Thai" dilemma. Secondly, they have great menu, small and selective, representing what I assume is the bomb diesel of Balinese cuisine. I also love the ambience, the deserts, the coffee and the people working there. I'm excited to go back and try their breakfast menu. My favorite things: The Fish Salad appetizer - a really unique item, I've never had anything like it. Might be my fave. Prawn and Fish Satay appetizer - also unique and tasty, this is deceptively filling. Scarfing more than one may result in hampered appetite when the entree comes around, but maybe that's just me. The Shrimp entree- Classic.
