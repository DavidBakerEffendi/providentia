The soup Nazi Packed his bags and moved on out to Philly. The way you are treated here makes a lot of sense since the former proprietor was an avid law enforcement supporter. i.e Move along don't ask any questions. If you do you'll get yelled at by people who think they are better than you because they serve par cheese steaks. You have to know how to order or your par sub or you will be brushed aside and have to wait in line again until you get it. Â If a business requires ordering instructions it should post them especially for out-of-towners. The steak is Meh... but salvageable with extra condiments. Especially since its mostly bread, and the fries are reminiscent of burger king fries with a tender cardboard after taste. Maybe they are meant to be packaging fillers?
