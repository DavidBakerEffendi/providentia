Yes, I have to give it the 5 stars. It's absolutely delicious and tasty. Although it's not a sit-down-restaurant, this deserves its own merits and awards. Just look at the pictures and imagine what you'll be eating. TASTY. TASTY. YUMMY. I'm actually salivating right now as we speak. The process: 1. you wait in line (sometimes it's a long line depending on when you go) 2. when it's your turn, the guy will ask you which one you want; you either order the chicken plate (aka chicken and rice), lamb plate (lamb and rice), or the mixed plate with rice all for around $6. i usually get the mixed plate to double the goodness 3. then they'll ask you if it's to go or if you're going to eat it on the spot; if you get it to go, they wrap it up for you, give you napkins, and sauce, and utensils. if you eat it on the spot, you can just grab a seat somewhere in the nearby area and chow down -- this is what i do all the time 4. ask for extra white sauce and the spicy sauce TIP: WARNING: the spicy sauce is SUPER SUPER SUPER spicy. i only dip the tips of my fork in the sauce and it blows up my taste-buds and my nostril. YIKES. but it's super delicious. haha TIP: BRING CASH. And KNOW WHAT YOU WANT. TIP: For all of you travelers/tourists to and from NYC like I am, I always take an order of the mixed plate to go and it stays good on the plane! You have no idea how awesome it was to eat this bad boy when I got home to Southern California. I swear, it was a genius idea! TIP: You'll probably need to get extra napkins. It's kind of greasy!
