$2.50 Jesus fricking christ.  Are you serious???  Something cheaper than $3.00 in NY for a quick treat rather than dropping $20 for a hamburger? My host had extended an invitation to go listen to an erotica reading, so while we were lounging around in Washington Square Park, our stomachs began to grumble. She volunteered Falafel.  Heck ya! A true hole in the wall, Mamoun's is built on affordability but not in value and taste.  This was some of the best falafel I've had in years and the amount of tahini dressing was heaven (I do not like dry sandwiches, blah) Host purchased the chicken sandwich, which was slightly more but definitely tasty.   We sat outside people-watching while munching away. I love NY.
