open a couple doors, seat yourself and check the writing on the wall. you may have to rubberneck to read the rotating specials, but the blackened catfish with a side of kale is worth the stiffness. by the time you've polished off some jalapeno cornbread and sweet potato fries, the pain won't matter anymore. going when the restaurant's busy (i.e., all the time) = shouting at those across from you + squeezing carefully between tables so you don't knock other people's shit around. ya heard? cuz if someone spills my water on my cornbread again, i'm really going to cry.
