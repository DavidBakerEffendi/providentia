"The Levee - Protecting all good Williamsburg natives from gentrification and tetanus since '03." That's the slogan I would have attached to this surreally authentic Brooklyn bar, but surprisingly they chose to go with, "The Levee - Beer, Booze, Pool, and Dogs."  Eh, I suppose it's all trivial. Anyway, the Levee is a fantastic bar very close to where I reside.  The drink menu features an exquisite array of some of the most popularized rank beer in the Williamsburg area, willfully decorated with a coolie for the urban cowboy in all of us.  However, do not let this snippet of information deter you.  Okay.  Well, at least try not to let it deter you.  Bear with me for a second here. The Levee offers a wide array of your favorite board games, such as Connect Four and Shoots and Ladders, as well as provides copious amounts of cheese balls free of charge.  That's right, copious.  The staff always has smiles on their faces and is wonderfully giving both in the conversation and cheese ball sectors.  In addition, the crowd is generally underdressed and under the influence, which witfully counters any of the smug opinions I've heard recently that Brooklynites aren't intelligent enough to multitask.   I honestly can't conjure up any other ideas on how to verbally decorate the environment of the Levee further than I already have. It's a gem amongst the factories that dot its perimeter?  Its snarling atmosphere is conducive for the creation of awe-inspiring artistic works about urban living?   Okay.  Okay.   It's a great place to get drunk.  There, I said it.
