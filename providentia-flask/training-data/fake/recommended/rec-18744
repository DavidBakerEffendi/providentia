Right outside the corner leading into MoMA. Make sure you don't get tricked by the other guys around the corner the street over also wearing yellow - theirs say Halal Guys instead of "The Halal Guys"....they didn't have any customers when we passed by. Lol We got the chicken and gyro plate - more than enough portion for two people. Got the yogurt dressing on the side and the small spicy tub. Chicken is good and moist and gyro is the standard. Word of caution - easy on the red spicy sauce. It's good but your bowels will pay for it later. $6 for a big plate - can't get any cheaper than that! Bring cash!
