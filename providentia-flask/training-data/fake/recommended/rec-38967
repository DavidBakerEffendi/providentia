In the top three fries on the planet.  Dick's in Seattle being their main competition. Every time i'm in VT, I make it out to get me some AL's.  With Nectars using what on my last few visits tasted like freeze dried shaped potato whip fries, AL's is defnitively #1 in VT.   Though Nectar's still has the best gravy.
