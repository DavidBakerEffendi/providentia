Well I pass this place most every day and it's so nice to see a place with outdoor seating especially this time of year. Â I've actually never tried the food and maybe that makes me a bad reviewer but their coffee is scrumptious. I know it doesn't take a genius to make iced coffee but every time and I do mean every time I have gotten iced coffee here it was more than perfect. Not too much ice, sweetened perfectly, and room for a bit of cream.
