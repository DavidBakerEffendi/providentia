I know I know its a chain.  But out of all the chains I have to say this has to be the best one!!! They have added tapas to their menu and the goat cheese and artichoke balls are something that would be served in a high end restaurant for 3x the amount.   The food is always delicious, and the service staff is very attentive.   I have to give it to you guys-your doing a great job.   + if you sign up for their club they will send you a $15 coupon on your b-day and a lot of other promotions thru e-mail that make this place affordable, if you like to dine out frequently.
