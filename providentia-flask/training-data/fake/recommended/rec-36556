Still as delicious as ever. It doesn't change, year after year. :) Faves are beef stroganoff, the egg puff pastry, and soups. Mac n cheese is a bit too strong; salads can be uninspired. Profiteroles remain the perfect dessert, even compared to Paris; only thing better is when we make them at home. Service is always fast, if often standoffish. Best part? It's so damn atmospheric. From the micro-tile floors to the zinc countertops to the huge silvered mirrors, this place feels like "the" place to have been in Paris, 100 years ago. (The architecture is, in fact, an accurate representation of a Parisian brasserie at that time.)
