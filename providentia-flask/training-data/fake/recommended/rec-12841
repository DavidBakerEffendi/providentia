Foursquare says I'm the mayor of this place with 8 check-ins but I'm sure I've been here at least 20 times since last winter. Most weeks I'm having dinner here at least once. I think at one point I even came two or three times a week. I LOVE LOVE LOVE eating here. I always order the same items, the pork bone soup, fish roll ball, fried fish skin, fried tofu skin, beef tripe, and sliced pork belly. Each order comes with a side of vermicelli noodles, fried tofu puff, a piece of taro, a piece of white radish, golden mushrooms, one egg, napa cabbage and lettuce. Everything is fresh and delicious! I can drink the soup on its own. So tasty! The staff is friendly and makes recommendations on items to order. Recently I've tried the crystal crab, shrimp paste, fatty beef, and razor clams. Last night I finally ordered the watermelon ice drink. It was perfect for the hot weather. My friend had THREE. Usually I order the herbal tea. It's slightly on the sweet side but still hits the spot. Dinner here is always more than satisfying. When you check-in on Facebook you receive a Melona bar for free as dessert. Doublemint gum also comes with your check. I've been recommending this place to friends. Everyone should give it a try. They accept reservations and there's always a Groupon ($15 for $30 worth of food).
