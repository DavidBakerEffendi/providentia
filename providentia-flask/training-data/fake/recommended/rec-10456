very cute and romantic. they have a back room that is quiet and candle lit if you need privacy and want to be able to hear your date. the food was good. the most outstanding dish was the squid in squid ink. the plates were more medium sized than tapa sized but hey, i'm not complaining :) the waiters were very friendly and helpful with their suggestions.
