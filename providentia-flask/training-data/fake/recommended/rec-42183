Went to blue ribbon on a whim with two friends. To begin our waiter was a bit strange,  lingered too long at the table and then was slow to return after ordering.  Half way through our meal a different waitress began serving our table.  Food was good not great and pricey.  Overall a fine experience but not somewhere I need to go back to.
