This spot is our go-to in the hood, esp when we get visitors. - There's the occasional wait (we've never had to wait more than 10 min, if even that) - It's super close quarters (the tables have to be shimmied over for you to squeeze through, where you will sit rubbing elbows with your neighbors and listening in on their conversations because you mistakenly think it's your date/guest speaking) - Decor is awesome and you feel like you're having a dinner with strangers because you are (it's the culture folks, that's just how they do) - To save money, go for the happy hour, or order the Plato Don (enough for two). - Get a michelada. Cuz come on. We've never had a complaint about the food; the only one would be that guacamole shouldn't ever be $7, and this one ain't special. The downside otherwise is that the tables are just too small for all the food (especially the Plato Don, when you feel like a total glutton if you're not sharing), and sometimes, you just don't want to be that close to people you don't know. But hey, it's a popular spot. Get over it.
