Pros: - poached eggs (perfectly cooked) - maple sweet potato home fries (wonderful balance of sweet and salty-- MAKE SURE YOU ORDER THESE) - rainbow trout (tender w/ crispy skin and the sauce on top complimented the fish and eggs so well) - buttermilk fried duck (great deep fried skin & tender meat) - beignets (the chocolate sauce was on point) Cons: - pumpkin waffle was kind of tough (my sister said it took her a few minutes to chew one piece) - coffee is made in a French press (but not brewed for long enough) Bottom line: GO GO GO! This was my favorite meal during my last trip to New York. I know it's a bit premature to rate a restaurant I've only been to once so highly, but I loved the food and can't wait to return.
