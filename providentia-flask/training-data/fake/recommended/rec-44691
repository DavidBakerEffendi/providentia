Just popped into this place for lunch.  Never noticed it before and they said it was brand new.  I had a delicious steak salad and my date had the burger which was amazing!   The music was great, the server was super friendly and helpful but not overbearing and annoying.   We had such a great time and will definitely be back to try dinner and the cocktails!
