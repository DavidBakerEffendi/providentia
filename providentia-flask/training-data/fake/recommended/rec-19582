Love what they did with the old Taqueria space.  These are the same owners of Beachland Tavern and once again, they carve out a great niche for tasty food, thirst-quenching cocktails and fantastic service---all at an affordable price point.  They are still in their soft opening phase, but I was there yesterday/last night with some friends and everyone was very happy with their meals.  They aren't trying to compete with Plan B--so no burgers here--- Head over to Park Tavern and enjoy a large variety of delicious sandwiches, flatbread pizza and salads.  I will definitely be returning.  (But I still love Beachland Tavern, too!)
