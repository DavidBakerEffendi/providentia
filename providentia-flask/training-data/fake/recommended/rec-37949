Ahhhhh GOVINDAS....   After recently watching "Food Inc.," (do yourself a favor and WATCH IT) I have cut meat out of my life. SIGH. Govindas is actually close to my house so I decided to scoot my meat lovin' ass in and treat myself to a lil vegan cuisine.    I know a lot of you are probably BEYOND skeptical about eating vegan...  but I'm here to tell you it's BEYOND delicious.   Their Vegan Chicken Cheese Steak is one of my favorite sandwiches in the city (meatless or otherwise).   Today I also treated myself to a bowl of the Chicken Tortilla soup.  WOW!  SOOO GOOD!  I would think that since the "meat" doesn't look like chicken (the texture isn't like chicken, either) that I would be skeeved- out by it.  But the TASTE makes you forget all that.  So hearty and yummy!   Sure the joint doesn't have a lot of atmosphere. Sure its always a bit of a wait, but its SO worth it.   I wonder how much it would cost to have one of the hipster chefs come to my house and be my private cook?  With a menu like theirs, i wouldn't even miss the meat.  Also, DO NOT LEAVE without getting a cinnamon roll for the road.... some of the best in the city.  Actually,  you can't go wrong with any of their desserts!!  Govindas is a breath of fresh (although slightly Patchouli scented) air in our city.  I triple tofu dog dare you to go there.  You'll have your eyes (and taste buds) open to an exciting/ cruel free way of eating.
