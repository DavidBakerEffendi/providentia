Nice cozy romantic place.  Our waiter was polite and attentive.  The shrimp and grits was to die for.  Our drinks were great as well.  Make reservations if you don't like waiting or sitting at bar to eat for dinner.  My only disappointment was that the deserts come from a local bakery that I'm not fond of but overall it was a good experience and I would go back.
