The six of us were seated almost immediately after we walked in on a chilly Saturday.  What better food to eat than country comfort food before guzzling copious amounts of alcohol?  We actually had just stumbled in after finding out that DuMont was, in fact, closed. Their menu is straightforward, but not to be missed.  We ordered the biscuits, cornbread (with jalapenos and bacon - I highly recommend it!), country fried steaks, and chilis.  The biscuits and cornbread were in small portions, but they were delicious.  Some of our party had only ever experienced KFC biscuits, and these biscuits rekindled their faith in biscuits. There were so nice and straight-from-the-oven hot, not overly buttery and it had a nice texture.  The cornbread came in this really hot skillet that reminded me of the kind that they usually prepare mac n cheese with.  The bacon and jalapenos weren't too much - it would've been even better maybe if they had added a bit more, or perhaps my slice of cornbread just didn't have a lot in it. The country fried steak looked really daunting to eat when it arrived.  Doused in copious amounts of gravy - a little too much - and super crispy, I would say that it was a tad excessive.  The gravy was good, but it made my breading kind of soggy towards the end.  The steak was dry and tough to chew.  The mashed potatoes were delicious though and had hidden chunks of bacon strewn across the plate.  The coleslaw was refreshing, but nothing particularly special.  I didn't really like the plating of this dish because towards the end, it became a messy pile of food that was delicious, but it would've been nice to eat some of the stuff separately.  Or maybe there was supposed to be some method to the madness. In terms of service, this place was great.  Our waitress was super sweet and gave us plenty of time to decide what to order.  I felt really unrushed even though it was rush hour dinner time - just the way comfort food should be enjoyed.
