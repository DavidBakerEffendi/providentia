An absolute gem! Wonderful warm neighborhood feel, great staff, great wines great cocktail, great food, lovely decor. I can't say enough good things! In an area with wonderful food options Rucola really goes above and beyond b/c of their staffs attention to detail and accommodating nature. I may start eating here once a week!
