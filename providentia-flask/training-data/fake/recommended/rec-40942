It's your average diner.  They've tried to gussy it up adding a coffee bar / cafe section, but I've never seen anyone sit there.   The breakfast food is good and you can get a decent burger, but nothing you'll remember the next day.  Main problem is they are kinda pricey.  Who wants to sit down for pasta dish in a diner that costs 13 dollars?  Or a 20 something dollar steak?
