Food was delicious (and I feel fine afterwards), prices for food are very reasonable and the decor is very cool but.... 1) They have a "light pour" on the drinks.  That drives me nuts in restaurants because it is so dumb to do.   I'm okay with charging $15 for a drink (when you can buy an entire bottle for not much more than that in the liquor store),  but just give me a decent sized pour.  Why chintz on the pour, the marginal cost to the owner of an extra ounce is trivial and it makes the customer disproportionately happy. 2) No one else was in the place when I went there for lunch, they have a "Grade Pending" sign up, there are lots of flies buzzing around the light fixtures (in fairness, door and windows were open since it was a nice day) and waitress disappeared in bathroom for so long I had to get the cook to ring up my bill.  I'm just saying'.....
