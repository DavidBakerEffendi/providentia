Really great little Italian wine bar. We stopped in for a quick bite to eat - it was indeed quick to get food, but not quick to get a table. They are just too popular. However, getting on the wait list isn't a problem and they'll text you when your table is ready. No big deal. We shared the fettuccine (tasty) and the eggplant parm (some of the best we've ever had). We also ordered a side of rosemary flatbread. The latter tasted good, but reminded me a lot of naan - not the normal texture of flatbread. So while it was good, it didn't mentally fit with what I thought I was ordering. Service is fine, though spotty at times when it's super busy. I was super impressed that despite the rush, the manager (owner?) stopped by to say hi and see how things were. I'd love to go back when the weather is warmer and we can enjoy a more leisurely meal outdoors. Definitely a nice little place!
