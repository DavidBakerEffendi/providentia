Holy Moly! Everything from the focaccia and olive oil to the perfection of the pasta noodles,.. every bite was amazing!! After a long day of walking around the city, my boyfriend and I couldn't wait to sit down for a nice Italian dinner. And this dinner took the cake for us. We were seated very quickly (with our reso's for 2 on a sunday night @ 8:30). We ordered a decent price bottle of vino and the small meat board to start. FYI- The capicola melts in your mouth. :) I had the pasta special which was a duck/beef (i forget what kind of pasta noodles) but they were delicious Â anyway! My boyfriend ordered another delicious pasta, i think it was the carbonara. We shared the Octopus, for secondi... but unfortunately, we were both so full, we couldnt finish. I wish we had room for dessert, we were both dying to try the tartufo... But it was physically impossible. I can't wait to come back to Lupa, with an empty belly! :)
