Okay, the truth? This is the caipirinhas talking. They're like mojotos with teeth, with a smidge of something bitter and something else like pure cane. They're talking to me six months later. In the second floor of a coffee shop across the river, a world away from Brasilia. They're so good that they bumped this review up by a whole star. Rodizio is always spotty--some meats wind up cooking better than others when shoved on a spit and cooked over a high fire--but there were some really delicious bites in there. The salad bar was to salad what cement is to caulking foam: much, much too heavy for the job. Plenty of hunks of oil-marinated artichoke hearts; not a great counterpoint to endless beef and pork. But those caipirinhas. Try them one time--and remember to take the train!! Penn station is just blocks away, and you won't want to drive home.
