My BF and I went here for Brunch today because I had purchased a Groupon a while back. Turns out the Groupon was only for Mon-Fri, which completely sucked since that is the reason why I decided to eat there to begin with. I had the Mexi omelet which came with potatoes and a biscuit. The omelet was okay nothing special, but the biscuit was delicious! It was coated in sugar and they give you a side of melted milk chocolate to dip the biscuit in. Heavenly! I also had a chocolate espresso martini which was AMAZING! My bf ordered a burger, which looked pretty good, but I don't eat meat so I don't know for sure. We had a chocolate chip cookie for dessert, which was pretty pricey at $5, but was definitely delicious. I wouldn't go back for the food but will definitely return for the dessert and martinis!
