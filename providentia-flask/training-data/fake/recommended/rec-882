Forgettable to say the least.   Start with the staff.  I don't find it cute or amusing that they are so damn rude and wear it like a badge of honor.  Customers pay the bills at this joint last time I checked, quit treating them like 2nd class citizens.   Next, cash only.  It's 2014 and cash is dying off a little more every day, so it seems weird not to take cards at all. Next, value.  Generally when a place doesn't take cards, it's because they are making an effort to keep prices down by not having to pay merchant fees on credit cards and machines. But this place charges 9.50 for a sandwich, 2.00 for a tiny soda and 4.00 for fries, not exactly a value. Lastly, the food.  Simply bland.  The meat is scarce and lacks seasoning.  The cheese is scarce and not enough to moisten the meat.  The onions are bulky and not easy to eat.   Overall, I have to say that all the hype surrounding this place is just that, hype.  It's not justified in the least and it's not worth your time.  Try elsewhere.
