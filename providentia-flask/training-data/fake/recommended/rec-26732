Easily one of the top places to go in Philadelphia for pizza (not as good as Nomad or Stella though in my opinion). An ideal meal for a table of 2 would be an appetizer and to try 2 different pizza's. Went here with my girlfriend and had the marinated vegetable appetizer (was a special that day), the lamb sausage appetizer (Only 1 very small link), the polpo pizza( octopus, tomato, red chili flakes and smoked mozzarella ) and 2 pasta's (rabbit bolognese and a pesto with vegetables which was 1 of the specials). Best dish was by far the pizza and then the appetizer's and although the pasta dishes were good they were nothing stand out and the portion size was very small. Server's were very knowledgeable and wine/ beer selection was one of the best I've scene. Will definitely be coming back here but will stick to only ordering pizza and wine from here in the future.
