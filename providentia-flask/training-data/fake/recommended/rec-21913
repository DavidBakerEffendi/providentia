How can you go wrong?  For $6, one of the tastiest meals you will find and did I mention on $6 in New York.  I actually stop by here sometimes after a disappointing meal in one of NYC's high end restaurants.  Sometimes I order 2 or 3 for lunch and dinner the next day.  There might be a cart that's better than this...but I haven't found it yet.
