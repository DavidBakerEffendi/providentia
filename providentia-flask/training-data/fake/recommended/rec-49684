It is one star because of the service. When I asked more water because it was spicy, the waitress said "I am working" with angry face. I know you are working, but you do not refill the water? Is it part of your job? I waited another 6minutes more for water with fire mouth and it was not even busy. I will stay away from this restaurant. Â There are a lot better Thai food around the neighborhood.
