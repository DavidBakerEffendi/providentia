If you enjoy your dinner with a side of absolutely incompetent, spaced out waitresses then this is the place for you. Service is awful and the food is less than mediocre, but the beer selection is decent. Â Ate at their Morristown location which was better than this sorry excuse for a Montclair eatery. If you're in the area, do yourself a favor and choose one of the other 100 restaurants which will surely satisfy you more than this place could on their best day.
