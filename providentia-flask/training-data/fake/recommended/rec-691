Geno's has reached the pinnacle of mediocrity, when it comes to Philadelphia cheese steaks. Geno's still does not offer mushrooms, skimps on onions and cheese, and worst of all, the steaks seem like they are cooked using Steak-ums...I will never come back here, since Dallesandros steaks and service are far better than Geno's and any other place I have tried in the city...
