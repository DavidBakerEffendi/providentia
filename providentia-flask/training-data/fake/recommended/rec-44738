Everything about the experience was top-notch. The three of us shared a bunch of amazing, plump, fresh oysters. The crab cakes were amazing but the little arugula salad with honey/habanero dressing they came with almost stole the show. The squid in the squid salad was so flavorful with a perfect char. My friends had the fettuccine which they loved, but I had the fish of the day with sriracha butter, broccoli, cauliflower, and potatoes and it was pretty much a perfect dish. The staff is friendly and eager to tell you about their offerings. Don't miss it.
