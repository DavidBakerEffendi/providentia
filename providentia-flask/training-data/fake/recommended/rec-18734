Well turn me upside down and paint me blue. This place was great! Sadly my usual banh mi joint is closed for remodeling so I had to branch out and try something new. Â  After a long trek from the L train in the blazing 63% New York humidity and a couple pit stains later, I was ready to be impressed. BOY WAS I. Cozy little place with the AC blasting (praise banh mi gods) and a wide array of sammi choices was more than enough to make me happy. Skip ahead 14 minutes to meet a pal in union square to consume them. HOLY MOLY YUM. The pal and I split one hog and one side car. I felt pretty brazen and got them "spicy"- my pal was really riding the struggle bus on that one, but I loved it. Bread was just toasted enough and tasted nice and fresh, meat was juicy and tender and extra tasty, veggies were pickled to perfection! I voted it best banh mi that I've had to date (I guess the count is up to 8 now) even though pal is pretty loyal to my closed for renovations sandwich shop, he too loved these sammis. I will absolutely go back but probably when the humidity gets down to a reasonable 27%.
