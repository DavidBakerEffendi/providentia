Whenever I visit NY I will always leave a meal slot to come to Ippudo for their ramen. Usually it's a really long wait, but it's well worth it. Luckily, the last time I was here (after not 1, not 2, not 3, but FOUR unclaimed tables of 2 from the list) we got lucky and only had to wait about 20 minutes. So far my favorite is the Akamaru Modern. Everything on it's own is delicious, and everything together so well. It's a symphony in my mouth. Yum. The broth is just so flavorful and rich and the noodles has just enough bite to them. We also recently just tried the Hirata Buns (pork), and they were really really good also. If you enjoy ramen, it'd be worth visiting Ippudo.
