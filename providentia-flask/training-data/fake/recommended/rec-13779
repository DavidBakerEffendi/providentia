Really great neighborhood brunch place. I've been here a couple times and have tried the Nutella french toast, granola, and chicken meatball salad, which were all delicious.   The one time I came here on the weekend, they told us the wait was 2 hours but it ended up being only 1.  The nice thing is they have benches outside so if you have to wait, it can be a pleasant place for people watching.  Just don't come hungry on the weekends!
