Fun spot, GREAT SERVICE, and great food! Even though the wait can be a detractor (sometimes 3 hours), you can always visit Momo's next door for drinks and appetizers. Or you head towards the back where you can order Hot Toddy's! The wait for Saturday night was not bad, it was about 2.5 hours, and we ordered Margherita and Speckenwolf, and both were very good. We also ordered a beet salad, which was refreshing. The service was friendly, chill and attentive. Pricing was also reasonable. Try it out!
