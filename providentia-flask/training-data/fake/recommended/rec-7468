I settled on 4 stars as I think the wait staff , atmosphere and the eclectic wine list are a solid 5 and the food, 3. Everyone here is very knowledgeable and helpful at the same time, there are no airs being held. I was here for the 2nd time last night and at this visit I tried some of the food. I certainly wouldn't head here for the food but I definitely would for the wine list alone. The staff is more than happy to let you try a variety of wines before you commit to a glass. To start I had the Charles Lafitte Brut Rose and it's a very nice choice for $10 a glass. My date chose the Rias Baixas Albariño, and it was fabulous. We weren't starving but we did want something small to munch on. We ordered the deviled eggs with pickled jalapeno and potato chip and these were creamy and very good. We also ordered the shrimp with chorizo, white wine broth and Amy's bread. The shrimp were cooked just right and the broth was perfect for dipping the slightly grilled bread. The only thing that we weren't a fan of was the duck banh mi, house cured duck, spicy duck pate, siracha aioli and pickled vegetables. These were seriously little sandwiches with a few slices of pickled carrots and a thin slice of duck breast the size of a quarter, don't bother. For my second glass of wine I decided to switch to a red. I tried a few different ones until I hit pay dirt with the Toro, Muruve, Crianza. My date went with the Verdejo, Old Vines, Nisia, Rueda and I think this was even better than the Albarino. They always feature a special wine by the glass that they usually only offer by the bottle. We tried that, it was the Crozes-Hermitage, "Silène," J.L. Chave, Northern Rhone and it was also scrumptious. Ardesia is pretty much in my hood so it will now be my local wine bar. It's fabulous.
