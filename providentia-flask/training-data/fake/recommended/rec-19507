delicious. amazing. yummmmm. after being sorely disappointed by momofuku, i know its difficult to find great ramen in new places. but look no futher, becuase Ippudo is grand. Â i had the shoyu ramen (someone said they only have hakata, but that is a fat @$$ LIE) with an extra side of charsui and every ingredient of my bowl was devoured as it was divine. service was great and the price point is solid for manhattan. will def do it again when in town.
