Everything is good here (except the long wait to get a seat). I usually go for the mojitos and the guac is amazing (esp the goat cheese one)- get the sampler to try 3 different ones.  I prefer the appetizers and drinks over the entrees, but I have never been disappointed. The service is great too!  My boyfriend and I go at least once a month.
