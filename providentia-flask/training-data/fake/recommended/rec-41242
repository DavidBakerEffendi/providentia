We ate here last night, and while the food was good, the experiences was "eh." We sat in the upper dining room, which is a lot less attractive than the lower dining room. It was extremely loud (which, sometimes, I get, can be fun). But it was also really cramped, and not in that intimate, fun way that most cramped Manhattan restaurants are. The chairs and tables were cheap and I kept getting bumped from behind (ay, oh!). I left here sweaty and in need of air (ay, oh, again!).
