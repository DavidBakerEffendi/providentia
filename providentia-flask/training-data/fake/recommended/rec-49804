The food here is solid, and the cocktails are pretty wicked too. I had the mac and cheese with pork belly and chicharron, which was a little less creamy than I normally like my MNC, but it was a very satisfying winter dish that delivers on pretty much everything you'd expect from its description: soft pasta, fatty caramel pork and crispy skins. Texture and content playing very nicely together. I followed that with the arepas, which were admittedly a bit too small for my taste, but still very yummy. They were fried (or deep fried) to give their shells a nice crisp and airy feel. Inside they were stuffed with chicken, guac and a chipotle salsa. Add a bunch of homemade habanero sauce and you've got yourself a nice meal, especially if you do as I did and order the side of the yucca fries, which for me stole the show. Oh so good. Last, but not least, I had the matador cocktail: tequila, lime juice, jalapeno syrup, cucumber and crushed mint. In the words of one famous Kazakhstani: Very nice!
