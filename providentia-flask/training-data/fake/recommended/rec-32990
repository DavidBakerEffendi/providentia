REALLY? I've tried a lot of sushi places, all you can eat sushi, 50% off sushi, but this place I think is just "okay". I honestly only go here for sushi due to convenience of location. Personally, I think the 50% off sushi deal is a joke. It's half off, but it's also half the sushi. My rolls are so teeny tiny! You get what you pay for.
