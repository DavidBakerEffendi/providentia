Bullet points: Everything I've tried on the tiny menu is tasty and well-made No liquor license as of last visit, so byob Super-nice, unpretentious people waiting tables and behind the bar It's a refreshing break from the over-hypedness that can sometimes get too much in Williamsburg.  Sometimes I don't want artisanally produced greens/water/air and excruciatingly designed everything else.  That said, I've got mixed feelings about the room; once in a while it feels too bare, even though it's small, and at other times the sparse decoration feels soothing. Wanted to review it because more people should try it.  It's almost always uncrowded probably because of the lack of a liquor license, not because it's not good.  Ack, I hate double negatives.
