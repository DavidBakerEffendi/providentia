I wanted to give this place 5 stars, but I just couldn't. The food - amazing. The scallops appetizer - out of this world. The beet salad appetizer - just as brilliant. Tuna entree - wow. Two negatives, though: We had a reservation for an outside table at 8pm. Arrived at 8pm. Finally seated at 8.35pm, while waiting outside on the road. No-one asked if we wanted our wine chilled while we were waiting so we drank a glass of warm wine when we sat down. And the table they put us on were two tiny ones pushed up near each other, but fitting three people on two tiny ROUND tables was quite awkward. My husband requested the escolar for his main dish, sans the chorizo. The waiter comes back five minutes later and says the "side" of that dish can't be changed and to choose another side from the other dishes. Strange. Are the balance of dishes pre-prepared? Scary though. Overall, worthy of four stars. Shame about the fifth.
