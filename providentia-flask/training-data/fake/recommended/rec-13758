There's a saying that you're a true New Yorker once you walk into a bar and the only people you know there are the staff. Well, with Royale, that's true for me.  I generally go every Thursday and hang out with my favorite bar tenders.  It's a chill place and the burgers are the best in Manhattan.   I order the Royale with Bacon and Bleu cheese without fail.  It's always done to perfection.  I'm not a huge fan of fries in general, but the fries are great.  There's an outdoor patio, but I generally hang out at the bar - because the staff is that great.
