Refueled here after the KBVCM.   Our meal consisted of the specials menu.  The salad with beets, VT goat cheese and English peas was refreshing.  The lamb meatball flatbread was inhaled.  Red wine gulped with pleasure in the evening sun.  We just finished running a total of 39.3 miles. Service was pleasant, as was the rest of the city.  A very enjoyable visit.
