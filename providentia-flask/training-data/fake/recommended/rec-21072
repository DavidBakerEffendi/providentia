i ate here a few weeks ago with my mother and girlfriend.  we met the owner and he couldn't be a nicer guy. small place, maybe 15-20 tables provided a great setting. We had the mushroom tarte and mussels appetizers.  The mussels were some of the best I've had.  The mushroom tarte was good, but the mussels stole the show. For dinner we had: steak, skate, and duck.  The steak was good, but not spectacular.  The skate was great (flaky, juicy, cooked perfectly).  The duck (which i had) was the encore piece.  Fabulous.  HANDS DOWN THE BEST DUCK I'VE EVER HAD. after all that, we didn't stick around for dessert, but would definitely come back her to try. to top it off, the place is BYO, so make sure to bring a nice bottle of wine and really enjoy a great new addition to Bloomfield.
