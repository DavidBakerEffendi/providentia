My girlfriend and I walked by this place one night and she thought it was so charming on the outside that we would have to come back for lunch the next day.  And it was great!  The food was delicious, the staff helpful and pleasant, and the interior cultivated a friendly, comfortable atmosphere. Tripe soup:  I just had to order the beef tripe soup, based on other Yelpers' reviews.  It was good, and my favorite part of it was the broth, which was very rich and wholesome tasting.  The carrots and potatoes in the soup soaked up the sauce, and I liked those too.  I appreciated the actual tripe for what it was, but didn't eat too many of the meat pieces.  I like to keep an open mind, but I couldn't get into the earthy flavor or smell of the tripe. For my entrée, I ordered the thinly cut steak from the main menu.  Its seasonings were really good, yet unfamiliar.  The steak was thinly sliced, not unlike roast beef would be on a sandwich, but there was plenty of it, and as thin as it was, it wasn't overcooked.  I chose the red beans and yellow rice for my side dishes.  The beans came in a cup and the rice on the plate with the meat.  I poured the red beans over the rice and ate everything.  It was really good, and authentic from what I could tell (I've never been to S. America).  My gf got the grilled chicken and white rice with black beans.  The chicken, which I tried, was a quite a bit too char-grilled for me, but my girlfriend didn't mind it.  It was also very thin, but was decently proportioned.
