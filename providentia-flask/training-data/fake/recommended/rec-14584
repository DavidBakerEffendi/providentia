I was only in town for a few days and heard I needed to see the dosa man while I was here. The samosa was fantastic and the sauces were delicious. The dosa had only a small amount of filling in the center, but was still really good. He also have me a little cup of soup which was spicy but good. I wish I had got tent here earlier since a number of items had already sold out
