Anyone who would give this place less than five stars is clueless or a herbivore.  This place serves juicy, high grade beef, cooked to order from a grill.  At around $8 per pound, this place can't be beat. If you don't know anything about Brazilian BBQ, make sure you get the farofa which looks like bread crumbs with bacon bits.  Use it to cover your beef or pork.  If you like soda or any fizzy drinks, go for the Guarana which is a more natural Brazilian soda.  If you're feeling extra brave, you can even get chicken hearts from the BBQ. The environment is pleasant, and there is always adequate seating.  They have a couple of TVs that usually have lively, Brazilian programming - often scantily clad women dancing Samba.
