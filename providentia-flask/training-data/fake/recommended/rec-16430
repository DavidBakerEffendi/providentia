Offerings: They have fresh fruit and vegetable juices, fresh real fruit smoothies (unlike the sugar-loaded crap at Jamba), wheatgrass shots, salads and sandwiches (prepared after you order), and a great breakfast selection. The menu is catered to health-conscious people... feel good after eating here. Great coffee and espressos, made strong, as in the European way. Special callout to their iced coffee: brewed in the slop drip method, very strong and smooth. Setting: Great ambience, Moroccan themed, intricately decorated down to even the smallest details. Feels like you're hanging out in your buddy's living room. Reliable wifi connection. People: Owned and managed by a young couple, Amine and Tito. Nicest, coolest, people ever. Amine, Tito, and the staff know everyone in the neighborhood, and they add that personal touch that is so hard to find in the city. It's an honor to be a regular here. Tips: call ahead and place your order, so you can grab and go (the menu is available on their website: pausecafenyc.com). Seating is limited - capacity is around 12-15. My favorites: Go Green juice (apple, cucumber, kale, celery, spinach), Pause Salad, and slow dripped Iced Coffee with whole milk.
