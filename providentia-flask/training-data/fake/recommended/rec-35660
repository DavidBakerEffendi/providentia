Started with the guac and chips and a margarita - which was strong - bueno. Moved on to the mixed BBQ - loved the pork belly and short ribs with the dry rub - mmmm. Sausage link was good too. Finished with peach cobbler and ice cream. Wife had shrimp tacos and was happy too. BBQ sauce came as hot (which was sweet and not so hot) and sweet (which was super sweet). Oh well, overall, it exceeded my expectations. I lived in Dallas TX for five years and it tasted real good!
