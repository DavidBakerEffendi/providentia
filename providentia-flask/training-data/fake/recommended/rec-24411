went here for the first time last week and immediately fell in love.. though we did have to wait a few minutes to get seated, we received a free, delicious anchovy / avocado appetizer delivered personally by the co-owner who apologized Â and then came to our table several times during the evening to make sure we were doing well.. the entire restaurant even the bathroom smells and looks gorgeous adorned with candlelight and fresh roses... the food was amazing from the anchovy / avocados, croquets, fritas and paella... will definitely be back - my new favorite restaurant :)
