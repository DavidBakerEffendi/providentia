I was home watching a show with my wife about America's favorite Hot Dogs. And they showed this place in New Jersey. Well since i was bound for Jersey in the coming weeks i thought i would check it out. Rutts Hut was the place I had to check out. Arriving at Rutts Hut i didn't see anything special from the outside. But walking into this joint was a rare treat. It was completely full of people just like me wanting to try out a "Ripper". I know a deep fried hot dog does not sound all that good. But take me my friend... How do they say it? IT WAS OFF DA HOOK! Â I ordered 2 Rippers, with cheese and their "special" relish. Every single flavor snapped on every bite. The great tasting home made relish was the topper. I have NEVER had anything like this in my life. I had to go back in for 2 more before i left that night. Being from Northern Cali, It was just cool talking to these crazy fools from Jersey. Listing to how they order, and call when your order is complete. I would strongly recommend Rutts Hut if you are in Jersey. And i would say if you are, no matter what part of Jersey you are in. Take the drive to Rutts Hut.. You'll love the taste of these dogs. Trust me..... I cant wait until June when i head back out to NJ so i can stop by Rutts Hut for more tasty RIPPERS.
