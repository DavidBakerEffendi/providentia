Sometimes they overcook the clams on the clam pie, and their sauce isn't the greatest. However, this is still a pretty good pizza and one of the best in New Haven. They probably invented New Haven-style pizza, but I'm not quite sure what that means...it's pretty much New York style. Not really worth the ridiculous waits. I like the pizza and the atmosphere much better at a place like Bar. Still very good, though. I'd recommend going if you haven't before.
