I went here with my boyfriend for my birthday dinner last year.  I fell in love with the place as soon as we walked into the garden area.  The lighting was so romantic!  In some restaurants your seats are literally on top of the people next to you... and you feel like your dining with complete strangers.  That was not the case at Uva.  We ordered a bottle of wine, a meat & cheese dish, and enjoyed each others company.  I ordered a chicken and prosciutto dish as my entree, my boyfriend got the homemade pasta.  Both dishes were delicious.  I had such a great time that I still talk about the place and how perfect everything was.  I highly recommend to all couples.
