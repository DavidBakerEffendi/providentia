Came here in July for my birthday with four of my friends. We did Saturday brunch. The food was great. The wings, steak and burger, all good. The drinks were even better. Unique and strong. They even set us up with a round of pickle back shots:) The vibe was very chill, not crowded. Perfect way to start a weekend.
