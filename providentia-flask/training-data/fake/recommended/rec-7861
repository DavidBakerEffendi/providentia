Went for lunch. Nice feel, open kitchen in back gives the restaurant a great aroma of diverse food items. I always am more trusting of an open kitchen too. Chose the soup and sandwich or salad. The soup I chose was a summer selection, watermelon gazpacho. I could have had about three bowls of that. Incredible! I chose the chicken sandwich and my colleague chose the pork sandwich and we just traded halves and had a more diverse lunch experience. I think we both like the chicken sandwich better. The food comes out quickly and it is piping hot. Both were very tender meats. The bacon on the chicken sandwich boosted it above the pork. The pork had broccoli on it which was a nice touch, gave it an interesting consistency to bite into and a green flavor that wasn't lettuce. We had coffee and share a chocolate cake which had several other dressings which complimented the cake extremely well. There was a creme filling in the cake and a bit of ice cream that was pistachio and a bit of granola and a caramel sauce to add texture and flavor. Not a big chocolate fan but this wasn't too chocolatey and the accompanying variety of additional tastes made it even less so and more interesting.
