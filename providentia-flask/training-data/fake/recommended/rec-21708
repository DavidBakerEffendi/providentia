AMAZING dinner spot! I live in the Park Slope area and have walked by this adorable restaurant many times. I saw that they were offering dinner specials for the month of March and decided to try it out with my boyfriend last night. BEST DECISION I've ever made. It was a Tuesday evening so the dining room was fairly quiet, us and maybe 3 other couples, very relaxing/ intimate setting. The two gentleman waiting and taking orders were beyond polite and took their time explaining their unique Hispanic Fusion menu. The prices were great $18-23 for a meal, and they even had $1 oysters until 7pm that night! The waiter walked us through our first oyster experience and gave us excellent recommendations. The entire dinner was phenomenal and was even accompanied by a complimentary appetizer from the chef! We left the restaurant, happy and full. I've been to many restaurants around NYC and this has got to be one of the best. We were treated with such respect and the food was excellent. I would recommend this place to anyone, it is somewhere you must try if in or near Park Slope! Such a gem!
