Loved it. First, good value. We had two meals and two drinks for $35, one of the drinks being a margarita. Not too bad. We could have gotten away with the whole thing under $30 if I didn't have a $5 beer and she didn't have a $7 margarita (which the GF said was excellent). It's the type of place you could do for under $30 for two people or if you want to go all out around $50. There is a wide variety of beer selections, ranging from $3 to $7. I was STUFFED after half a rack of ribs and she couldn't finish the sandwich and french fries. As for the food... El Camino Real isn't the "hipster take" on BBQ. It's just really good Texas style BBQ. The ribs were good and the sauce on them was fantastic. Girlfriend had the rib sandwich and fries which she said was excellent. Imagine Famous Dave's, except really good and high quality. (we didn't try the Mexican, though). I will be dreaming about whatever the sauce was on the ribs tonight. Service was very good, too. No problems there. Comparable to Bar Ferdinand, where is where I think a few servers work. Attentive but not intrusive. Atmosphere was what you would expect for Liberties Walk -- a mix of everyone. It's a bit dark in there. It's pretty cool though. Reminds me a bit of Cantina. When we left, my GF said "This was a very good call, that really hit the spot. I bet we'll crave this from time to time." That about sums it up.
