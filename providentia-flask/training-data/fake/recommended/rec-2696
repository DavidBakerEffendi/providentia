I am a huge Thai food junkie and I love trying new places but rarely do any of them compare to my usual spots. I ordered the Pad Se-ew (vegetarian) and it was delicious. A generous serving with crispy tofu and fresh veggies. My table also ordered the dumplings, which are usually my favorite. They were good, but I have never had anything but steamed dumplings at Thai restaurants, and I think it's what I prefer, as these were a bit greasy. Still good though. Cute place, a little quiet if it's not busy, but once people start filing in it's not too bad. Very friendly service, and I didn't find it slow at all. Perhaps because it was a Sunday, but the restaurant was reasonably busy.
