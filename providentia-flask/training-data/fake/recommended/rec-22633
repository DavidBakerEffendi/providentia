Lovely restaurant, beautiful decor, quaint and perfect for a dinner with a companion where actual conversation can be exchanged. However, the food left much to be desired. The bread basket (or bag) was cold pizza crust--which wasn't necessarily terrible, but wasn't good either. Pizza dough bakes fast, so I would suggest them making it prior to serving it for a huge improvement. (It's the small things in life, you know?) The fried calamari-I'm very skeptical of places who serve calamari with only the head portion and no legs. This often means they came from a frozen bag. Da Mikele's calamari was--again, not terrible, but not great either. The pizza was supposed to be the item that blew me away--but unfortunately it did not. The Capricciosa pizza was cold in the center, and was a bit too soggy. Perhaps that was due to too many toppings, but I was not impressed. For a place that touts with the Luzzo name, I was a little disappointed. I would be open to giving Da Mikele another try--perhaps, I had ordered the wrong Italian staples.
