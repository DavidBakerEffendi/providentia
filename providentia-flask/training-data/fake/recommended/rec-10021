I came here with my bro and his lady friend on Friday night. We walked in the front door and sat down at one of the shared picnic tables. It was your standard bar, but I didn't get a very good look around because I wanted get down to the business of ordering. I was starved. We ordered beers after having to flag down the waitress, she may have been the only one and the place was busy. I had the Chimay, bro had the De Koninck, and lady friend had the Leffe. I'm always happy with Chimay, and the others seemed satisfied with their selection. I did force them to order a more off-the-beaten-path beer.  They both wanted a Stella, no way! Not with all these choices. As for the food- Croquettes aux Truffes were not what I expected. It was a deep fried rectangle. There were no discernible mushrooms or cheese. It was literally a deep fried rectangle about the size of a flip phone. For dinner bro had the burger/fries/salad entree and I had the Boucheé a la Reine. I expected a neat little puff pastry stuffed with cream/chicken/bacon, but it wasn't that at all. It was a croissant cut in half with the bottom on the plate, a scoop of soup over that, and topped with the other half of the croissant. It was decent tasting, but the presentation was blah. I would come back here for beer and I did see something about all you can eat mussels on Sunday and Monday. Cheers!
