Service was friendly and great.  I had their di mare pasta, and although the one I had in Boston was better (yeah, I'm being unfair, comparing Boston seafood to NY) it was still yummmyyyy.  Their dessert was awesome so make sure you have a second stomach for that.  I want to come back for their brunch menu sometime as well.
