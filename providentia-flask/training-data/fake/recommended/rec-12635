DELICIOUS PANCAKES! My girlfriends and I shared three dishes and it was plenty. We ordered their buttermilk pancakes, the frittata and an eggs benedict. Needless to say, we left the plates spotless and we were very satisfied. I am definitely coming back for the pancakes! Get there early though because the line up starts at least 45 minutes before it opens! We got there at 8:15am for the 9:00am open and we were third in line to be seated. It fills up very quickly and when we left at 10:00am, the line was still pretty long. It was a Saturday. Service was great and friendly :)
