At first I wasn't impressed- two items on the already limited menu were 86'd for the night.  Total let down.  But the food was all really good. I ate here with a group of 5 and we were all happy with our dishes.  The desserts won everone over- you have to try the avacado creme brulee and the lime pie- I'd go back just for those!  Worth a shot, but maybe rry and get there early so they have all of the menu items.
