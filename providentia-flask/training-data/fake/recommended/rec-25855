this place was wonderful ! we showed up 1 half hour early because the weather was so awful...the moment we stepped in we knew it was okay ....it was like walking into your aunts house at sunday dinner ...they were happy we were there and they rewarded us with a fantastic dinner! the house wine was perfect ...the atmosphere was intimate and the dessert was to die for ! father mother sister and brother made this experience the best part of our new york city journey .
