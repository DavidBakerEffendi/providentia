HOLY CRAP!  I don't know where to start.  Everything is impeccable, from service to ambiance and especially the food.  This is my favorite restaurant.  Yes, it's not cheap, but who cares... treat yourself once in a while.  They cut no corners, go above and beyond, and have continued to impress time after time.  I know it's not a competition, but I would way rather dine here then any of the Garces establishments.  Some standouts are the wood-grilled octopus, the treviso and endive salad, ahhhh who am I kidding everything is amazing.  Eat it all!!!!!!  But def save room for the polenta budino.  THANK YOU SO MUCH OSTERIA, YOU MAKE ME SMILE!!!!
