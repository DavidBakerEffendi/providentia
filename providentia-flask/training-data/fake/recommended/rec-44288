Simple and delicious. The concept is straightforward: pick your meat, pick your sauce, pick a side. The sandwiches are incredible, though you are likely to waddle away feeling guilty. We had the BoomBox with pulled pork. Heavy stuff, but worth the hour on the bike later on. The mac and cheese is a gem.
