I am korean, and my husband took us here for my birthday. It's very refreshing to see and taste korean food at its best. Everything was so delicate, delicious, and fresh. The chef made a mee-yuk gok for me (traditional birthday soup) and yes, it wasn't Â the traditional one, but that's what i loved about it. every bite was so heart warming and divine. We ordered a few entrees, few starters, couple deserts and everything was perfect. you know you had a great meal when you still think about how great it tasted ..oh, and service was spot on.
