Our friends ran out to this place and brought it back for us to try - they got the vegetable and egg soup.  It was super cheap ($4.00) and super tasty - the noodles were awesome, which is what I was expecting for a place with this name (so descriptive, I love it).  Next time, I really want to go eat there and try some of their other soups.  I think for the price, this place is really worth it.
