I love the food here! My favorite dishes are: 1) Penang Curry (I highly recommend it!) 2) Shrimp Dumplings 3) Pad See Ew 4) Drunken Noodles I also love that it's a BYO. It can get pretty crowded, the service is sometimes a little too slow and it's CASH ONLY. It's a cute place nonetheless and there is rarely a wait for a table.
