This place was...ok at best. I was down in Philly for a sales meeting for my company and they surprised us by taking us to the famous Pats/Genos. Half of us went to Pat's, half went to Genos. Now, I have had the authentic "Philly steak/cheese" at other places throughout my life in Philly. I was REALLY excited to try the ones that have been on every sandwich show known to man. But it was...mediocre at best. I get it. It's famous, the lines will be long, people will be rushing you, etc. I'm from New England, home of the entitled snobs and people who think the world revolves around them. But the staff at Pat's was very rude. I knew what I wanted, so getting to the window and ordering wasn't a huge deal. But when I went to say my order, instead of listening they did everything else but. So I had to keep repeating my order to them which made them more mad. Well, if you paid attention the first time I wouldn't have to continue to say what I want. So service was terrible. We did get our food quick considering we had about 20 people or so in our party so that wasn't bad. The food itself? Eh. Living in CT, I've had wayyyyy better Philly cheese steaks. There was really no taste to it, I like my bread to have that "toasted" taste and it didn't have that at all, it was more on the soggy/soft side. I was very dissapointed. I didn't get Â a chance to try any of my co-workers sandwiches that went to Geno's, but I'll try the next time I'm in the area. Honestly, from my experience, this place is WAY to hyped up. I know it's "famous" and all but famous doesn't mean it's amazing.
