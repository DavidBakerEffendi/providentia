This restaurant used to be Sammy Chon until they closed down for renovation. They recently opened and as far as I'm concerned, they have a 30% off your entire meal until the end of June 2014. The restaurant features a fusion of Asian meals: Korean, Japanese, Chinese and Thai. While the list was extensive, I decided to have beef japchae. It was great! I would definitely come back to try other meals they have in their menu. Glad we have a Korean restaurant here in Chinatown!
