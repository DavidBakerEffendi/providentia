I love a simple menu. And five tacos has five tacos. Very simple, but very fresh ingredients. The guys behind the counter were pretty nice and helpful too. I only knocked a star off cause I wanted there to be more flavor. All the tacos seemed to taste the same, they were great, but if I didn't know any better I would have thought I was eating all one kind. The other thing I had was the rice. I felt it could have been seasoned more, it was a little bland. But all in all, I love supporting small businesses like this and I'll recommend it. Â I suppose if you use their sauces you can enhance the flavors, I'm just not a sauce person.
