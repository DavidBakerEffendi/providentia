Was very happy to find this hole-in-the wall pizza joint (one I never visited during my bright college years, that's for sure) after a morning at the Peabody.  No-frills, thin crust pizza, decent hoagie sandwiches, and large salads.  Tried a number of things:  pizza, eggplant parm and buffalo chicken grinder.  All were serviceable (though the grinder was a bit greasy), and the pizza was a really pleasant surprise.  Thin, crispy/chewy crust and good ratio of topping to crust.  But tomato sauce tasted like it came from a can - sorry!  Still, my better half said it tasted better than Pepe's.  Blasphemy, I know.   Service was more than pleasant, especially given the large crowd I was with.  Lovely waitstaff and nice guy making the pizzas.  Thank you for being so nice to us! Parking was fine.  It was a Saturday and I got metered parking right in front in an hour space on Whitney Ave.  They do ticket aggressively (go New Haven cops), so beware!
