Cute place, good food and portions.  I would love to come back. AMBIANCE: Bright, cheery, busy, lots of stone, big window to garden, narrow space so it feels a little crowded but I like this.  We sat at the bar -- the bar stools are amazingly comfortable due to a clever spring mechanism on the back.  It's nice to watch the staff preparing many of the griddle items right there at the bar, also. FOOD: Good, though heavy.  We came for brunch, had the Croque Forestier, Crepes Jambon, and asparagus with a dug egg cracked on it (and Neapolitain, I think... grated Parmesan).  All good, though I don't know if the Croque F. needed to be completely encrusted in cheese.  The plates are very small, but the portions fill the plates, and the food is generally heavy, so the three things we ordered fed two fairly large men. SERVICE: Folks behind the bar were very busy, so we sometimes had to ask twice to get their attention, but this did not really bother me -- food was served in good time, and questions were answered cheerfully enough.  I suppose in an ideal world it would have been much clearer who our actual waiter was, and he would have been a little more attentive.   We came in around 1 pm on a Sunday, but it was pouring rain so there was no line (the place was full but there were two seats at the bar).  By the time we left around 2:30 pm, it was starting to empty out. PRICE: Quite fair, I think.  I guess we spent under $25 a head for brunch w/ tea and coffee.
