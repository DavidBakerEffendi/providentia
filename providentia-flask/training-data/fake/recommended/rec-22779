How to be overwhelmed by Korean/Japanese food? 17 free side dishes! Believe me, order your meal accordingly. It is A LOT! The rib eye BBQ is also delicious, as well as the stone pot rice. The service is also very attentive. They show smile and like to chat a little - they just seem interested in attending to your meal. It is not located in the best neighborhood, but the interior surely does not disappoint. Price is on the scale of 2+ dollar sign. Despite its lackluster name, this place deserves a return visit!
