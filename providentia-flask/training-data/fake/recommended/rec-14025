"Dear Sripraphai, can you please open another location in Manhattan or Bklyn, Â because Woodside is just too far for some people?" But seriously, although this place isn't as spicy or good as food in Thailand, it is still the best in NYC. My favorite dishes are fried snapper with green mango sauce or with chili sauce and the bbq pork. Don't go on Wednesdays 'cause they're closed!
