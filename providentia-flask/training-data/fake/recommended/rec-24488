Yes! Finally someone opened up a seafood spot in the hood. Greenpoint is great but it is also overrun with taco joints, bar food and thai. I come here at least once a week and i am never disappointed. Having a little more variety is refreshing. The New England style eatery has strong drinks, good beer and solid food. The classic whole lobster dinner is super fresh and filling, the fish and chips are crispy and tender and the sandwiches/"rolls" (lobster, shrimp and crab) are great; all going light on mayo heavy on the seafood and stuffed into a toasted buttery bread. The specials change daily and the raw bar selection is always super fresh. The backyard has a fun, relaxed feel perfect for groups sharing a pitcher of beer or one of the house cocktails. Â For dessert there are coolhaus ice cream sandwiches; perfect way to end a meal.
