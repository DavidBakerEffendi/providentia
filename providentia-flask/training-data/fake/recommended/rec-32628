This is a great restaurant from Top Chef winner Harold Dieterle. He was definitely one of my favorite top chef winners and I'm glad he is having such a successful restaurant in the city. Â I was very impressed with the food, especially the spicy duck meatballs and the egg filled ravioli with black truffles. The chocolate souffle was also delicious and one of the best desserts I've ever had.
