Karma has my favorite naan to date: fluffy yet chewy, crispy at the very edges but soft in the middle, with little burnt patches distributed throughout.  To reach naan perfection, it could be a little more flavorful, but this is as close to perfection as I've tasted. We didn't make it in time for the lunch buffet, so we ordered from the menu.  The chai was a little too creamy, and the beer selection seemed kind of scanty, but they do have a full bar. We loved the veggie samosas, although I admit to mainly using them as a vehicle for the fabulous chutneys that came with them.  The tamarind and flaming green (mint? cilantro?) chutneys came in tiny ramekins with tiny serving spoons.  I'll own it: all it takes for me to like something is miniature utensils.  But I suspect that the appetizer was legitimately good. Our entrees were both good, although I was a bit put off by the option to customize the spice level.  How spicy should my korma be?  You tell me, Karma.  I'm not cooking.  We asked for both entrees to be medium, and they did indeed come out mediumly spiced, but the korma had a strong black pepper flavor.  It makes me wonder if they didn't just take a regular korma and dump in a teaspoon of peppercorns. We couldn't do dessert because we were too full, but they appear to have one of everything.  The waitress seemed hesitant when we asked questions about some of the desserts; though she was friendly, perhaps she could have been more knowledgeable.  Overall, the service was highly efficient and friendly, but not overbearing.  They must put their busboys through SWAT-team training. We will definitely be back for the buffet.
