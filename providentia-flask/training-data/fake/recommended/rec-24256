I can't believe I am only hearing about and trying this place  for the first time. I have lived in Philly for so long and I just found one of its hidden (but in PLAIN view) gems. Marlon says the soups are comparable to Pho, I disagree 100%!! If you mean comparable as in they both come in a similar bowl and it happens to be a noodle soup with broth than yes.  BUT  you are having a completely and I stress this, completely different experience when eating this soup right down to the noodle.  I am actually salivating thinking about it. GO here even if you only go once, it's worth every penny!!! Thats the good thing....it doesnt cost much and it fills you up. Get it with a fried egg...very yummy
