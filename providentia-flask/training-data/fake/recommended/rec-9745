The service here is great!  Such a friendly and accommodating staff.  The space is small, but that's typical of NY.  We enjoyed The Manly Burger and requested the bacon lardons on the side (it was really just ham, which we preferred anyway).  The medium-cooked meat was perfectly tender and juicy.   Pass on the Thin Fries though - so boring and forgettable. FYI: They can split your bill between a max of 2 separate cards.
