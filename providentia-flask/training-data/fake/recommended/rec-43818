MUST give this place a chance...when I saw the menu, my first thought was "weird" but I braved it and loved it so far. I have not tried the Teriyaki burrito yet but I definitely will sometime. The set up is somewhat similar to Chipotle (CA) but definitely the menu is much more bold and daring. The staff is friendly and the cashier remembered us the 2nd time we visited; I thought that was a sign of good customer service and that he pays attention.
