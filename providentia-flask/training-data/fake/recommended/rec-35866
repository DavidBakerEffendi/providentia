I would give this restaurant more stars if I could. Honestly im not sure if there really was any miss at our table because everything we ordered not only complemented our tastebuds but totally satisfied my tummy. We started with the famous corn on a cob which comes with 2 per order and it was amaze balls. I didn't realize corn on a cob could create such party in your mouth. The roasted corn with flavors bursting in all directions was definitely orgasmic. This is one of the foods you have to try before you die because it totally made my mouth and life complete! (Its the little things in life you should be thankful about heh) The grilled shrimp tacos another hit! These shrimps aren't your small sized shrimp but they are jumbo shrimps and the sauce that accompanies the taco is not only full of flavor but it leaves you with a little room for you to accent it with habanero sauce. The fish tacos were good too but compared to the shrimp tacos i personally felt it lacked flavor. The rice and beans that come with your order is sweet and salty to help complement the tacos. Honestly i would have just ordered rice and beans on their own. Overall 5 stars does not do enough justice...tastebud wise money wise it is totally worth it in all aspects.
