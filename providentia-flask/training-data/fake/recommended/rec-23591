I've only been to The Farmhouse twice, but both times I had a really fantastic meal. The cheese plates are a must-have, and the grass-fed burgers were really good. The atmosphere is great. The colors are warm, there's plenty of seating, and the service was fast and friendly. The pricing was a little steep for your average night out, but very reasonable for local fare. I would definitely go back. I guess as a side note, I would say that I would not choose The Farmhouse for a date night, as the seating is very open and not conducive intimate conversation.
