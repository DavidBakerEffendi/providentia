Great beer & wine selection, delicious food, and friendly staff. Atmosphere is also very nice, great design for the space. Clientelle range in age all over the place - night time crowd is a little younger but not 100% which is nice. Very fun & let-loose vibe with music on weekend evenings. Also very nice for mother's day or special occasion. Definitely get the loaded potatoes/fries with cheese... yumz! Tacos and burgers are good as well. Prices are average and acceptable. Overall, I really like it here and can't wait to go back!
