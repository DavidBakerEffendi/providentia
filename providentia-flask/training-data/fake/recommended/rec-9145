GOOD & CHEAP = great combination Aww, wish they had a place like this near where I live since I love Korean food. You know how you go to a frozen yogurt store and pick what you want in your yogurt and pay for how heavy it is...same concept, except with great tasting Korean food.  My tray included a little bit of everything: kimchi fried rice, fried chicken wings, korean beef, clear noodles, kimchi & radishes, spicy squid w/ udon noodles - all for $5.89 :D If you're lazy, they also have tons of prepackaged dishes.  The Kimbab here is also very good
