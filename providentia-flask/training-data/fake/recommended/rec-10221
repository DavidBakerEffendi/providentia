This place was far far west, but very cute and if I lived in the neighborhood, might go again. The food was solid, but not terribly impressive. Maybe I was just too full from the Xian foods I ate around 4PM before our 5:30 dinner. Whoops. Go early b/c it gets packed! We had 30% off which made the food reasonable, but otherwise, I think it a bit pricey when it's the same prices as Amada for not the same level of food.
