Maybe it was better before they generated all this buzz, but to me this restaurant is just a glorified version of Popeyes. sure you have the extra fixings, like mac and cheese, hush puppies, extra thick biscuits or what not. and i'll admit I didn't try their pies. BUT from the chicken and waffles i ordered, i have to really question how they can microwave that frozen waffle from Pathmark and sell it to paying customers. I've seen better waffles from local diners. Okay, granted the chicken was nicely fried and tender but it wasn't worth the hour-long wait AT ALL. i feel establishments like this one give 4-star restaurants on yelp a bad name. afterall, shouldnt they have to earn it? to me it doesnt seem like Pies 'n' Thighs has done so dont believe the hype! you can find out for yourself. but dont say I didn't tell ya, chico
