While in NY for a wedding, the guy getting married took me to HU Kitchen for breakfast and I fell in love.  I went back there every meal while I was in town, breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The place isn't cheap, but good food isn't expensive, fake food is artificially cheap.   The only downside to HU Kitchen is the menu doesn't change.  But I've been able to mix and match and get enough variety where it is okay.  The reason it doesn't change is because it's hard to source top quality ingredients, as long as they change it a little seasonly I would be okay with that.   The veggies taste AMAZING, like vegetables are supposed to taste. I loved the beef bacon, the eggs were perfect, everything was delicious.  I hope other restaurants across the world take notice and start serving real food like HU Kitchen.  It is perfect for those eating Bulletproof, Paleo, Primal and to those who just want the best in their body and eat real food.
