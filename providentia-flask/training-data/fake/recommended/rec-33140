The food was delicious! This was the BEST beef stew I've ever had (carne guisada). And it came with rice and beans that were also very yummy. We had a special appetizer, stuffed roasted red peppers with crab meat. I would have preferred it served warm, but it was tasty. My bf had the thinner steak (forgetting the name) it came with the dried meat stuff, which he loved to stir into his rice and beans, and the steaks were delicious. Our caipirinhas were awesome, as expected, I had two of the passion fruit, he had a lime. We finished with the Brazilian tiramisu, which was more of a chocolate moose with graham cracker crumbs at the bottom, but I'm not complaining, it was still good. Whole bill was around $75, so considering everything we ordered, pretty reasonable. Service was also efficient and friendly. Â Will be returning!
