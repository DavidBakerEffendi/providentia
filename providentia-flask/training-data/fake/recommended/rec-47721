Great little hidden gem right across from CCSU. Tons of sandwich options, from basic to really creative. Friendly staff and good prices. It can get a little busy in there when school is in session - but they do a great job of keeping the line moving. I work in downtown and make the trek over quite often for lunch (gotta love those college prices!)
