I like the food here! I still do think California serves better food and restaurants overall, compared to NY. But Hakata Ton Ton comes very close. Japanese food in NY are authentic, lots of choices and close to Japan. I highly rec the small plates. The hot pot is ohkay. Maybe because I like spicy food, unfortunately hubby can't eat spicy at all. So, our hot pot is specially made in non spicy broth. I love the kampachi sashimi. Snowcrab croquette is good, but lack of crab, mostly potatoes. I can't wait to go back. Do rsvp on open table ahead OR come at 6pm when they just open. This place uses a lot of pig's feet as collagen. So, the broth is not a regular shabu shabu water. Officially a fan.
