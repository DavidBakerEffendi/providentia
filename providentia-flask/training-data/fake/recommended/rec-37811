I had come here for lunch with a girlfriend, and the duck I had ordered was one of the best ducks i had ever eaten. After raving about this place all week my fiancee and I decided to try it for dinner. It was even better at dinner I was very impressed and it was one of our best date nights. I can't believe this place is a "chain" its bar none above the rest. GO its a must try, have the duck or the wasabi filet and make sure to start with the tuna pizza, its amazing.
