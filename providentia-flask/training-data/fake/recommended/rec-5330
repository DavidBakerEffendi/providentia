I'm so glad to have this restaurant so close by to me. Not only is their food good, but service is amazing as well. A month ago my boyfriend told the bartender that he was going to propose to me. Fast forward, when I stepped into the restaurant a month later, everyone was congratulating me and was so excited to see my ring. Not only surprised that the remembered, but we got free desserts on top of it! I come here quite a few times for the burger, but now I know the desserts are also amazing-- do try to banana pudding and cookies and milk!
