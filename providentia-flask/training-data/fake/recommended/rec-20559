I have been coming here for about 5 years, and have never been disappointed. My favorite pancakes ever, no matter which variety you choose. Also LOVE the cinnamon almond french toast, and pretty much all the side items are great, including the Dutch baby. Fresh squeezed OJ is also a plus.There is usually a wait on the weekends especially if you're a large party, but it is well worth the wait. Service is hit or miss, but I would never let that stop me from coming.
