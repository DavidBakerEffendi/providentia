I'm a big fan of the set-up of this place. It's a school room of deliciousness. It's especially nice in the summer, as there's outdoor seating and giant windows that let in the light. My friends and I ordered a big plate of charcuteries to share. It was great - the meat was thinly sliced and deliciously fatty, and they served it with pickles and bread slices. Arguably the best part of the meal. We also got the duck leg confit, which was nicely cooked but overall a big letdown. The green sauce they used made the duck came off as overly sweet instead of savory. Would come again though, if only to give the foie gras oatmeal a try!
