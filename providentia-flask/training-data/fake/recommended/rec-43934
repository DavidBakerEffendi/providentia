checked this place out tonight.  i live on the same block and have been waiting for ages for it to open.  considering it just opened last night i was blown away.  it was delicious and the service was great.  i was persuaded to have the clam pizza which was a game changer for me (i never would have thought clams would go with pizza.). it is served with a slice of lemon for you to squeeze on top which gives a nice bright flavor to the already  creamy and tangy combo that the pizza has.  they are still waiting on their liquor license but i would not let that stop you.  in fact its probably better to try it out now because once they get their license it will be PACKED.
