Brand new restaurant.  Scott Conant.  Beautiful wood slatted ceiling. Polenta and mushrooms omg mmmmmm, buttery pomodoro, amazing fritto misto, in other words divine italian comfort food.  So far, the equation is right.  But, alas, terrible service!  I could be a better waiter and I have no experience!  Change the staff, change the staff before people catch on!  But ho, I reccommend you go anyways, its too fabulous and calorie rich to miss (definitely head across the street to Country Club to dance the calories off afterwards...)
