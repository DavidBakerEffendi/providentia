Been here for lunch, dinner in large groups and small. Each time is a hit. The dinning area is beautiful and great for people watching. I love to order their small plates to share. My favorites are the Brussels sprouts, Hummus with lobster and Phoenician fries. I have also had the bass as a main course and it's delicious. Portions are large for a fancy restaurant and I love that!
