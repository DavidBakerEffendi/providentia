Great drinks!  Good food!  Nice host!  The waitresses are a lil standoffish but whatever it's the food that counts.  Do try the scallops.  Do try the sweetmeats.  Do try the salmon.  And order lots of drinks because that's really probably what they're known for.  And there's even a fortune teller up front.  A little kitschy but fun!  She is strangely accurate, so much so that you might get goosebumps for the rest of the night.
