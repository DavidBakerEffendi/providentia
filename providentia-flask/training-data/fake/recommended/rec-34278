This has been one of my favorite places for years, through high school, college and even now, years later, I still crave this place. I am a huge Mexican food fan, and while this may not be what you would consider "authentic Mexican food" - it is definitely Tex-Mex to perfection. The vegetables are always fresh, the portions are big and the prices are very fair. I've been here countless times and always find myself ordering different things, because everything is delicious. The tortilla soup is nicely spiced and unique - definitely try this. The tostada salad is another one of my favorites, huge portions and great dressing. My favorite item is definitely the quesadillas though - the actual tortilla is much thicker than a typical quesadilla and it is nicely grilled with fresh veggies, cheese, etc. A lot of other places in the area are cheap when it comes to giving extra salsa, sour cream, etc which turns me off. At La Casa, there is none of this nonsense. Love the food and staff here.
