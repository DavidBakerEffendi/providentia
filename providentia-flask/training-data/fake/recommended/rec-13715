So good I went twice in a week!  This place is always poppin when I go.  I  had to wait an hour on a Tuesday night, crazy!   This place is famous for their ramen so of course I ordered the ramen.  I have to say that the price of a bowl of ramen is a little steep but when you start eating it, you forget how expensive it is.  The broth is unbeatable.  They make their noodles a little al dente, which I dont like as much but its ok.. the broth makes up for it.  I think during the weekdays, they have beers on tap for $4.  I tried the pork appetizer.  Nicely flavored, soft but kinda pricey for the small portion.   If you go downstairs to the bathroom, there's a window to their noodle making station.  I didn't snoop around too much but there was someone in the room preparing the chewy noodles.
