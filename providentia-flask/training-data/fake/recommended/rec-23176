Ploy Siam is a welcome addition to an area saturated with pizzerias and chain restaurants.  I have been there several times and every meal has been delicious. The red shrimp curry had an abundance of flavorful sauce, and the mango sticky rice was warm and comforting with perfectly ripened mangoes. I've gone with different people and none of us has had a bad meal.  I think the prices have been very reasonable as well, and as a BYOB you save a lot of money by not dealing with crazy alcohol markups. We have our fingers crossed that Ploy Siam is able to weather the economy and stick around.
