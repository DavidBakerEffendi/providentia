First off, the food was delicious and drinks were tasty. Â However, the service was far from top notch. After waiting a while for brunch, which was expected, we were seating and waiting for service. After waiting 10 or 15 minutes and watching the staff walk by and flirt, we then were approached by our server, Gabby, who had walked by at least a half dozen times prior. Not once did she say hello, thank you, or have a nice day. In fact, she practically tossed our credit cards and receipt at us after checking out. I'm sorry we aren't as cool and hip like you, but I'm sure courtesy is the minimum requirement in your line of business. Good thing I've worked in hospitality to know you live on your tips and wouldn't put another server out like that. All said, food was amazing. Just prepare for crappy service.
