This is a really great diner. They have a huge menu that includes brick oven pizza. There's a full-service coffee bar that really impressed me. I had two cups of regular drip and it was very good. They also have a nice variety of flavors of gelato and a fully-stocked pastry display that looked really tasty- although I didn't try either. They were pretty busy, but it wasn't loud at all and i could hear my boyfriend clearly from across the table. We wereseated right away and the service was excellent. I had eggs and my boyfriend got a breakfast sandwich. Everything was good. I can't wait to go back for lunch and dinner.
