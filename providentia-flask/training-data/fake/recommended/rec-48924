This was actually my second choice after dropping my daughter off at Giant Stadium for a concert. I'm glad I came. LuLu John's is a deli/pizzeria. I'm sure they're very good based on their reviews. I was in the mood for a bar/restaurant. I was impressed. I had the prosciutto arugula pizza. It was amazing! They also say they specialize in hospitality. You will not be disappointed.
