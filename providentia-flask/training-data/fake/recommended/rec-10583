Trend used to be my favorite spot in Montclair.  But in the past few months I had 3 incidents of horrible coffee and noticed that the quality of desserts had gone downhill- at times barely edible.  Recently we had the back room reserved for our wedding rehearsal dinner.  When my husband went by to confirm the day before, we were informed that the previous owner, Eliott, had suddenly quit a few months ago and moved to Florida.  They had no knowledge of our reservation and that was that.  Thank goodness my husband had gone by!  We had to figure out how to fit all of the family in my mom's dining room and my mom spent all day cooking and trying to prepare the house instead of being able to enjoy this exciting time.  This place used to be really great, but this unprofessional incident has left a sour note.  What a disappointment- this place had the potential to be really special.  I certainly won't be back.
