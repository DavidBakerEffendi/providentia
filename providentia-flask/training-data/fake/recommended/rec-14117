I was with my good friend who was looking at an apartment on the corner of Moore and White, just a block down from Robertas. Thank goodness, because there is no way we would have ever found this place! We kinda stumbled in, not really expecting what we'd find once we pulled back the inconspicuous front curtain. We were pleasantly surprised. It being 2pm on a Saturday, we had a bit of a hangover to nurse. Accordingly, I got the fried eggs - two beautiful hen-of-the-woods eggs made perfectly with a pork hash and roasted fingerling potatoes and grilled toast. Totally hit the spot - although something in the hash made it a little too salty. My friend ordered pork jowl. Yeah...they had that on the menu, and I appreciate her culinary curiosity. I abstained, however. She seemed to really enjoy it, though it looked a bit fatty (though I'm no expert on what good jowl looks like). The portions were on the small side, but they turned out to be just enough. We finished our plates and felt completely satisfied. And contrary to the main complaint among other reviewers, I found the dishes to be reasonably priced given that much of the ingredients are grown on the premises. Being a visitor to this fine city, I suppose that I just expect things to be ridiculously priced. All told, it was a warm and casual atmosphere with eager (and super hot) staff, and tasty food. A real find. I'll come back, but I still won't try the jowl.
