Totally unexpected, hip find.  We had friends visiting from Los Angeles and they wanted to see Brooklyn, we stumbled across this place and will be back for sure.  The Date/Bacon salad with nuts was simply amazing.  I had hamburger that was to die, one of my friends had the beef brisket that was another hit.  The pork loin was probably the best I have ever tasted.  Now for desert we couldn't pick one so we had them all and weren't disappointed one bit.   Since the menu changes often we will be back to enjoy the latest and greatest creations.
