This may be my new favorite Mexican restaurant and it was recommended to me by a friend who grew up in Mexico. This means it's held up to a ridiculously high standard. The staff was amazing, extremely attentive, friendly, and helpful. The guacamole was the best I've had, fresh, the perfect amount of citrus and salt, served with homemade tortilla and chips. We had the duck zarape which was fantastic for an appetizer, tortillas stuff with braised duck and smothered in habenero sauce. The camerones and enchiladas were also great. The pollo norteno would be the last bite I would eat to remember my meal with it. The chicken was so tender it fell apart and it was spiced to perfection. The drinks were also creative and well made. Definitely worth going to and one of the few places in the city of a million restaurants I would keep going back to.
