Classic French Bistro with an authentic atmosphere in Soho. We started with the steak tartare, very delicious. The duck confit was so tasty, but be prepared for LOTS of mushrooms and much fewer potatoes and greens. For dessert, the profiteroles are top notch, complete with a tableside pouring of chocolate sauce. I don't like fruity desserts, and this one was excellent. The inside was so bustling and lovely decorated for Christmas. The only issue is the bar area -- there's nowhere to stand without being in the way! They have these extra tables (probably because so many people want to eat dinner there) but if you're waiting for your coat, it becomes a nuisance. It's not your cheapest place to eat. But the food was great. I won't be rushing back immediately, but I enjoyed my experience. Good for groups!
