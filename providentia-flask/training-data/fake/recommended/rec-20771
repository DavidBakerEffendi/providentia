A few week ago I came here with my friend because she was craving crepes. When I think crepes I think of dessert but i was so wrong! This place also have very savory crepe choices. I got one of there savory salad crepes but I forget the name of it, I think it might be new or either one of there specials. But anyways, the crepe was very flavorless and it had tomatoes, avocado, basil leaves, spicy mayo sauce and pork. I think the pork might have been bacon but they didn't use a frying pan to make it crispy, Â I think instead they just sauteed it and the pieces of pork were very fatty. I thought the prices were kinda high for what your getting because mine was a little over 10 dollars and it can't even compare to the size and the similar price of a burrito from Chipotle. Never the less it was a wonderful find and next time i'm going to try one of their sweet crepes :)
