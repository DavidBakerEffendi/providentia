Used to live in 15th/ Bainbridge, and this is one of the places that makes me want to move back. Its the PERFECT neighborhood place to go and eat good food in a pinch, or in general. My friends introduced me to the Miles Burger when they first opened, I had one, liked it, came back months later, and ordered it again and it was about the same as when I had it the first time. The place itself is TIDY and very hip. I like it. They have a good selection of drinks that aren't just coke (In fact, they have Coke that is hecho en Mexico #canesugar). Service is fast, and I can keep going on about the food. I love it. Go here. On wednesdays. (half off burgersz)
