Ugh... I'm so turned off by this place. I recently took my out of town family here to try a cheese steak for the first time. We wanted to try both Pat's and Geno's so we ordered one cheese steak that we all could share. I asked if they had any plastic knives that we could use to cut the sub up, they said that I had to bring the sub back up here and they would cut it for me. I asked if she could cut it in four pieces, she scoffed and said absolutely not and that she shouldn't be cutting it at all for me... wtf? I'm not sure what the hell that means. They weren't busy, so it's not like I was in their way. They also have all of this shitty propaganda up that says, "we live in America, order in English" and they call their fries, "freedom fries". Uhhh... it's been ten years since that cute little joke came on the scene... we're friends with the French again. I think they're rude and the cheese steak was just okay. Go to PAT'S!!
