It isn't often that I find food that needs nothing. I try to objectively assume that there is always room for improvement. Plenty has shattered that belief and ruined me for all other sandwiches ever. When I say that I wept as I ate their Tasso Ham Panini, it is no exaggeration. It was by all means and without a doubt the best sandwich I've ever eaten. I didn't want it to end. It will be a dangerous life I lead from now on, what with having them right down the block. So I'm back for dinner and I have the Brisket Panini, and it is like having an out of body experience. I can hear no sounds while eating it. Nothing can penetrate the wave of bliss I'm feeling. I want everyone I know to try this, I want to shout it from the rooftops! PLENTY IS HERE, NEVER HAVE AN AVERAGE SANDWICH AGAIN!!!! Everything is locally sourced. The meats are cured, butchered and prepared in house. The sauces are all made in house. Unbelievable. After the Brisket, I can't understand for the life of me why anybody would waste their money at Geno's or Pat's for a boring old cheesesteak, when they can have the Holy Grail of beef and bread right here at Plenty. Thank you, for bringing your amazing culinary creations into my life.
