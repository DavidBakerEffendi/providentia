Honestly the food is quite nice. The service on the other hand couldn't possibly be any worse. The only way the service could be worse is if they shot me in the face as soon as I walked in. Also get ready to rob a bank in order to pay your bill. Or ask if they have a layaway plan The bread is nice... The chicken is cooked perfectly and is outright delicious. If you want better service and the same quality of food there is a Turkish store down the road that might tickle your funny. To summarize... Food is great Service is apauling Ambiance is boring and sad Prices are high And I am not even going to comment on the religious aspect of them serving halal meat and offering bring your own beer policies... Enjoy life and eat healthy. Xo
