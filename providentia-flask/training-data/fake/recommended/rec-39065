Pros: great food (Mostly meatballs, but great selection of types and sauces) great ambiance inside nice afternoon light inside though you wouldn't think it would be veg friendly - they have great, if simple fresh salads. inexpensive Cons: Noisy if packed inside the outside seating is a bit cramped you may have to wait for a table during busy times they tend to staff light - however the staff has always been really nice. all in all VERY worth a single try, and many returns if you can get over the 'smallness' of the place.
