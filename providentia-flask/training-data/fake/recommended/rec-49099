I ate here in December.  It's been nearly 6 months and it still occurs to me that this was an amazing meal.   Stellar dishes, all around.   Rock Shrimp Fritters Brussel Sprouts/Sriracha Cauliflower, Crispy Fried Pork Hock Caramel Pudding The pork hock was one helluva plate.  Such an awesome way to serve me some pig.  The cauliflower was a scene stealer for sure.   We ate at the chef's counter, which from now on is the only place I will accept should I dine at Joseph Leonard's again (which, mind you, is a near certainty despite living in SF).   My palate was shot before I got to their wine, but we'll assume it's as good as the food.
