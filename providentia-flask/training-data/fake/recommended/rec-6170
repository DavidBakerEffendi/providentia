Delicious! Savory crepes that are so freaking good -- I haven't tried anything else but that's enough to make this one of my top places to come back to in Brooklyn. We split a shrimp curry crepe and the Bergere crepe (goat cheese, swiss, fig, honey, onions caramelized, rosemary). Both were fantastically flavorful and elicited many MMMs and OMGs with each bite we finished. I was very happy with our choices, and enjoyed the quaint interior decor, the music, and the general cozy bistro atmosphere. And of course they have french press coffee. Lovely brunch choice, great place to take a date or catch up with a good friend, and definitely a charming bit of character in Brooklyn.
