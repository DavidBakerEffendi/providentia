This place is the ultimate brunch spot. Came here for Sunday brunch with my roommate and, after waiting a good 25 minutes, we sat inside their cozy yet fresh, rustic-style dining area. I got the Norwegian brunch combo, and she got the poached eggs and salmon. I loved my dish: the salmon was fresh and the hollandaise was perfect. She also loved hers, and the portions were both big enough to give you that wonderful, slightly-overstuffed brunch feeling. My only gripe was that the orange juice that comes with the brunch special is a laughable, shot-glass sized amount. Other than that, the cappuccino that's also included was good, so no complaints there. After hearing about this place for forever, I'm very glad I tried it and would definitely come back again.
