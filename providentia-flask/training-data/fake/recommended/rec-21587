Went to Zento sushi last night for dinner and was not impressed. Though they have innovated and unique special rolls, they are also high priced and small. The rolls were tasty and the sushi rice was also made very well, however, if I hadnt eaten an appetizer at Continental prior to arriving, i would have left hungry and disappointed. My girlfriend, her sister, and I split 4 rolls (then had to order a 5th). Eel avocado, spicy crunchy salmon, one wrapped in cucumber, and fourth- of the four i think the eel avocado was the most tasty. the 5th roll we ordered was the first special roll listed (with salmon). i would not recommend this roll as it was about an inch of rice with a thin thin sliver of salmon on top. If you're going to go, make sure you are aware that these rolls ARE very small- even the special rolls. There is not very much fish or filling in them either and its a lot of rice.
