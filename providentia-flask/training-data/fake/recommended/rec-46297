beautiful ambience. love the decor, masculine but still quaint feeling. personal touches of marc hanging on the wall. highlights include the franco bullo pasta special, with mushrooms and truffles. the chili lobster with toast. the foie tortellini is a fresh new take on foie gras. the sauce proposal is a forgione classic with their fluke, comes with cauliflower and cauliflower puree. cute and fun amuses. an octo dish thats charred with chili oil nuts and a variety of veggies underneath. a great interpretation of american cuisine that pays respect to all its ingredients.
