Staff was great - very friendly, attentive and knew the menu well (could tell they've actually tasted everything) Food was excellent - foie gras, truffle fries, homemade bread with truffle butter, pork cheek, etc). Interesting menu and executed perfectly. Liquor was not overpriced. In fact it was very reasonable. Atmosphere was nice - cool, clean, upscale yet relaxed scene. The open kitchen adds some vibrance and gives you something to stare at when conversation lulls.
