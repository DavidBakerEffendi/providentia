Eh. Definitely won't be back.  Did brunch here and while I loved the decor, hosts were nice, it was all down hill from there.  I love boozy brunch, operative word being boozy.  The deal is awesome $25/ AYCD and substantial food, but it doesn't mean anything if what you're getting is juice not champagne.  The food was mediocre, the service okay - they made my gf order another drink even though she wasn't done her first and couldn't understand my friend's glutton allergy - but the drinks. Ugh. I have a stomach ache thinking about it.  It's not juice with a little champagne, it's champagne with a little juice.  Non grazie.
