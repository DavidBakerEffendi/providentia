I was in Philly and I definitely had to do my own taste test to see who was better : Geno's or Pat's.To start with the outside of Geno's looked really,really, gaudy.Honestly, it looked like Snookie & Jwwow from Jersey Shore owned it. I think they spent more time with decorating the outside of the store than with trying to make their Cheesesteaks good.Pats is hands down the best. The bread is better bc its not chewy,the meat is juicier and I think they put more meat & cheese on their sandwiches. I went to both of them on the same day to compare & ate one after the other because I didn't want to forget what they each tasted like.At Pat's I had the Mushroom Cheesesteak add Provolone,American & onions.Afterwards,so it wouldn't mess with my taste test I added Whiz on it just because I love cheese and that's the way I wanted to eat it.Earlier at Genos I had the same thing minus the Mushrooms bc they don't have that option.I had 2 other ppl with me & the general vote was that Pat's was better.I'm sure there are better Cheesesteaks in Philly than these 2 but between these 2 Pat's is the clear winner.
