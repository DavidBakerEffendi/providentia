This place is one with the many other Dimple restaurants in the area, so the food is very similiar. I think their speciality is their many different types of naan that they have and their thalis (2 different types of vegetables, dal, rice, etc) We didn't have any of this. I got their pakoras to start off with, with actually pretty good. They were really hot coming out of the kitchen, which was a plus. My Mom tried their Bhel, which I thought was decent. I'm not a huge fan of bhel to begin with. I got their veggie burger for lunch, which i thought was excellent. It wasn't too spicy at all, which was a plus.
