This is the best brunch I have ever had in my entire life.  Yes, you have to wait a long time (it's a tiny place), yes the kitchen is small (it's right in front of you) and yes they are slightly understaffed at times.  All of those things still make it worth the wait because all the food is incredible.  The brunch menu is inventive and everything very fresh and wholesome.  It is not expensive and fills you up for the whole day and I can never finish what I have eaten.  The servers have always been incredibly nice to me.   Some are not a fan of the homemade ketchup, but the biscuits, frittata, really all the baked goods are simply amazing.  I always order off the specials menu.  When my boyfriend and I go there we always have a hard time ordering because everything is so yummy! This place has seriously ruined my taste for all others.  I have become an even better cook because I cannot find any place to rival this one.  I have recommended it to everyone I know living in Philly.   Sadly, I moved away from Philly and now live in LA.  I am not lying when I tell you that I actually cry after going out to eat at other brunch places because they are seriously not that good. I miss it so much and can't wait to eat there again!!! Addition: After reading several other bad reviews, I'm appalled.  I have never experience; all my friends love this place and when I'm in town, I have a hard time not going there daily.  I had the pear and blackberry glory cakes; my friend had the Italian (?) frittata--the biscuit was awesome, so good.
