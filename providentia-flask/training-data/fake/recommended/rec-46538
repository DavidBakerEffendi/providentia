This restaurant opened in June 2008 as "Forge" and has since been renamed as "Marc Forgione." Marc Forgione is located in the heart of TriBeCa, which is home to many of the arguably best restaurants in NYC. The peer competition is astounding. I walked in and was greeted immediately by a friendly hostess, who checked my coat. The interior is dark, dimly lit, mostly dark stained wood. That provides for a very, very charming setting for pleasure, not business. The bar itself was bustling, and this place sports a younger hipper vibe. If you're looking for an untraditional interpretation of some very traditional dishes, you do yourself a disservice to pass on Marc Forgione. Quite simply, Marc's interpretations of basic dishes like Mac & Cheese which is peppered with beer spaetzle, braised oxtail, and black trumpet mushrooms blew me away. Every bite was like a symphony of flavors and textures. And every dish I ordered was just as complex. There's an understated complexity in such deceptively simple dishes. Those whose pallate can appreciate subtle details will be most impressed. If you don't enjoy ordering the more unusual things on a menu, you may not find this restaurant to your taste. If, however, you enjoy plunging head (or tongue) first into unexpected culinary adventures, be forewarned: you seriously risk falling in love with this place. Oh, and Marc actually lives in the kitchen ... so he might just visit your table if you say or do something unusual or interesting ... like he did when I went.
