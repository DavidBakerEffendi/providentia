My family and I come here cause we love the open space and the playroom (although tiny) is a major perk. However, I must be honest, food is mediocre. Mac and cheese is as simple as Kraft dinner (I'm not kidding). Nothing fancy in here. Service isn't that great either. On a Sunday when the space is half full, the staff is looking super stressed and overwhelmed. Atmosphere isn't what I would call relaxing.
