On our way from Montreal down to Portland Maine we stopped in Burlington for a break, to enjoy the glorious warm, October weather and a for a good meal. It ended up being right when 5:00 service began so we waited for a bit but not too long. The vibe at Farmhouse is great and our server was fantastic. We wanted local, fresh food and that's what we got. I started with the VT cheddar ale soup - and oh so tasty! Then my boyfriend had the Jericho Settlers' Farm Grass Fed Beef Â burger with Creamery 'Landa"' cheddar, VSC bacon, house pickled onions - yum! Very tasty! I had the Local Chicken & Biscuits w/veggies, lemon, white wine, fresh herbs, buttermilk biscuits - wow! Extremely filling and delicious. I wanted to try cheeses but we were too full for that - so next time! We sat inside but it was such a great day outside the patios would have been nice too.
