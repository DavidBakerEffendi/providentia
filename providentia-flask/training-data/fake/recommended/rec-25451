I've recently discovered this gem over the past year and have eaten here on numerous occasions because the food is excellent. The restaurant expanded recently and the space is now great for bigger parties. The owner/s are also friendly. Now as for the food, I recommend the lamb platter-- full of ingredients and the lamb is juicy and well-seasoned. The rice, various veggies, and pita bread compliment the meat very well. Add in more white sauce and hot sauce and you have yourself a scrumptious meal! The lamb gyro sandwich is also very good. The lamb is juicy and flavorful, and the crispy greens with white/hot sauces in a soft pita complete a truly delicious gyro sandwich. Your hands might get a little messy but it's totally worth it. Another item to order is the ground beef kebab-- incredibly tender and flavorful. It comes with a few slices of Afghan bread that is great to dip in the tangy green sauce. So, if you're ever in the area and are craving gyros and kebabs, definitely go to this place and check it out!
