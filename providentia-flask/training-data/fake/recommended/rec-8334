ate there last night and it was really delicious food.  my favorite kind of surprise: an unassuming-looking restaurant that turns out to be a total gem.  we ordered two dishes (saag panir and a lamb curry special), the freshest garlic naan, and split a bottle of wine purchased next door.  the food was phenomenal, beautifully presented and so tasty, and then a dessert arrived "on the house" (gulab jamun, a sweet, spongy, deep-fried doughnut in honey syrup) to complete the perfect dining experience.  the staff was warm and friendly and the food was tasty and fresh. i can't wait to return.
