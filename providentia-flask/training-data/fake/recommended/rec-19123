Excellent jerk and curry and escoveitched (sp?) fish.   If you get takeout, don't ask Mama Shawn (sp?) to hold the rice.  When I did this, I actually received less chicken than did my pal who ordered the same dish but didn't try to mess with the establishment.  I wasn't trying to get more jerk out of them - I swear - I'm just allergic to certain beans.  And this is sad, obviously, for many reasons, one of them being that these particular rice and beans are very pleasant indeed (I've cheated - many times... I know, I'm only cheating myself.) The upstairs is a really cozy, musty little treat.
