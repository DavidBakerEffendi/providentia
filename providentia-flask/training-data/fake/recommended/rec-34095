Had a good time out with friends. The food was good, typically bar fare offerings. We tried the nachos, eggplant sticks, and poutine for apps. Poutine and nachos were really good! Eggplant sticks were avg. For dinner three of us had burgers, one had steak. Everything was great! Burgers come with two patties. Alone complaint is that draft beer could've been a little colder. Tried the Box 63 ale and it was good. What surprised me was someone had ordered a beer at the bar and changed their, so one of the managers walked around looking to see who was due for a drink. Well that person was me and he gave me a free beer. Most places would just pour it down the drain. Def will be going back!
