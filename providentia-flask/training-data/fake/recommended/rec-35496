Really solid neighborhood spot, and one of few places to get bubble tea around the area (really like their original flavor which is black tea-based). Haven't tried much food except the pork banh mi (not spicy) and it's a great value for the price. $5.50 or something like that, super fresh baguette, flavorful pork, pickled veggies...will continue to go here since I live nearby, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way for it
