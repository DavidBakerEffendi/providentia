let's see let's see... most memorable. to be honest, i remember more of my date than anything about this place. but i suppose that's what dates are about. That person you shared the food with, not so much of the food. The service was good, the atmosphere is romantic. I really can't remember of the food there. For me, if I can't remember the food, it probably just means I have nothing to complain about.
