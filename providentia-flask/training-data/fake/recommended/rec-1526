Two words - chicken & rice. That's all of what my co-worker had to say to me the last time I made a visit to New York.  She's not a native New Yorker, an Angelino most of her life, so to hear her rave about a food truck in Manhattan kind of threw me for a loop.  Hell, she was even willing to make the trek from Queens at 2am just to meet up here! Hands down, probably one of most economical deals you will find in Manhattan, if not entire city.  $4 for a gyro?  Awesome.  I had a few bites of my co-workers', and I was wow-ed by how tasty it was.  Probably one of best I've ever had. I stretched the wallet and went for the chicken & rice plate for $6 (also beef, lamb, or combination of each available).  It comes with a fresh pita bread, though you can save a dollar and get it without the rice.   I topped off my plate with some of the hot sauce and it made quite the delectable mix of tastes.     This food stand could possibly end up saving your life after a night of drunken debauchery.  The portions are huge - you'll get enough carbo loading food to take you from pass out drunk to passing field sobriety test sober. Expect a long wait in line, but it moves quick.  Trust me, it's well worth it to savor the goodness before calling it a night.  Next time in NY, whether it be rain, snow, sleet, or a clear warm summer evening, I will definitely be coming back!
