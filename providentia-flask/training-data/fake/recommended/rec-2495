Bread: okay Onion topping: didn't like the flavor Cheese whiz: yummy! American cheese: yummy! Steak: very good I prefer with american cheese b/c it's not so runny and messy.  The cheese does a great job of accentuating the flavor of the steak.  I personally think the cheese whiz kind of masks the other flavors.  But Pat's cheese whiz does taste less salty than Geno's.  Do they use different brands?
