Frankly, one of the best meals I've had in awhile. Food is incredibly fresh. Service was perfect. The cocktails were yummy (try the OBAO Sunray), and the ambience is nice and laid back. We had the spare ribs wrapped on sugar cane (must try) and steamed dumplings to start. Then chili cashew chicken and pho ga for our meals. Simply outstanding.
