My boyfriend and I were in Philly for the day and decided we wanted to wanted to try some real Philly cheesesteaks. We live in San Francisco and heard about the rivalry, so decided we needed to try both Geno's and Pat's.  Short answer, Geno's was better. Geno's was all around the more flavorful cheesesteak.  The bread tasted fresher, the steak was more flavorful and so was the wiz....  However, I didn't appreciate the awkward pro america (borderline racist) paraphernalia - I would actually refrain from bringing people here because of it.  The building is..interesting, I didn't mind the orange paint but the sign with flames is gaudy.  I would rate the food at 3.5, but the experience they provide made me round their score up to a 4.   Bottom line:  Tasted better than Pat's, fun experience, good cheesesteak.  I can get an equally good, if not better tasting cheesesteak at home in California so if you don't like Geno's cheesesteak it's not the end of the world, it's more about the experience.
