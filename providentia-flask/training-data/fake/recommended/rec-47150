Probably my best place in Manhattan! Guys can be a bit rude when you ask for a table at the entrance, but the ambience is wonderful and the food great! I suggest the Chardonnay mussels and tuna steak; wine selection is quite embarrassing, but still the place is totally worth the price (which is not low). Won't be disappointed! A downside is you cannot book in advance and waiting time is generally 15-20 minutes, but you can do that at the nice bar with a cocktail!
