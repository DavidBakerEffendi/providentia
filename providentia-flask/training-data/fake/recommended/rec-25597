Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, it did! Their lines are always long, but the wait is never long. The mixed dish with rice, chicken, and gyro is delicious with the BBQ sauce along with the spicy sauce and the white sauce! Yum yum! I didn't hear about the BBQ sauce until recently and couldn't be more happy that I tried it! Service is fast and friendly! Cash only!
