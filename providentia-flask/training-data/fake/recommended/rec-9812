Mmmmm sake bar hagi was definitely one of my favorite places in nyc! Our group ordered almost all of the recommended dishes and then some! everyone had their favorites but all the dishes we ordered were tasty and unique! My favorite was the sauteed kimchi and pork! My friend's lychee sake was also very yummy. This place is great for big gatherings. If I go to ny again, I would definitely go back!
