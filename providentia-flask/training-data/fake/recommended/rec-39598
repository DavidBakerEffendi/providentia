-=The deets=- I've been to Yuca Bar a few times and my most recent visit was for dinner with a friend on a mid-July Friday night. We had frozen sangria, coconut shrimp, shrimp and mango skewers, spanish meatballs and crab cakes. -=The review=- When I went in to make a reservation in advance of my friend arriving, I thought: "I'm getting too old for this sh*t." It was 7pm and the Happy Hour crowd for Yuca Bar's amazing 1-8pm Happy Hour was jonesing to get their last drink in. In other words it was packed and loud. My friend wasn't due for another hour and I was surprised to see two seats open outside, a welcome respite from the noise inside. Even more surprising was that there was one guy trying to get himself that table for himself and another party member who was nowhere to be seen. Luckily the hostesses sided on our favor (since we were a complete party) and sat us. Victory! Service was friendly, if a little estranged and while our drinks took a long time to come out due to some issue in the kitchen, the food was quick to arrive. The crab cakes and spanish meatballs were tasty and the coconut shrimp was good, if a little underwhelming. The skewers seemed a little skimpy and bland, especially since the description suggested there would be more vegetables on the skewers themselves. And the frozen sangria? Strooooong. Yuca Bar drinks have always packed a wallop but this one nearly knocked me on my ass. For you value-seekers out there, Yuca Bar is a definite win. -=The verdict=- Yuca Bar delivers tasty, punchy drinks and some great eats too, but the atmosphere can be overwhelming unless you're seeking an ear-splitting good time. But, as mentioned, they've got a 1-8pm Happy Hour, so you shouldn't have any problem finding a time that's good for you.
