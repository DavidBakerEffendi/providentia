Cafe Sabarsky is a beautiful restaurant with dark paneling located inside Neue Galerie, a 5 minute walk from the Met. My parents and I ordered: Weisswurst mit Brezen & Handelmaier's - (Bavarian Sausage with warm Pretzel and Handelmaier's Mustard) The sausage was a little too bland for my tastes, but my mom loved it. The Handelmaier's mustard was sweet and chunky and perfectly complimented the soft pretzel. Kasekrainer mit Sauerkraut & Rostkartoffeln - (Smoked Bratwurst stuffed with Cheddar Cheese served with Riesling Sauerkraut, Roasted Potatoes and Dijon) The bratwurst was a little too salty. The dijon mustard...OMG. It was honestly the best mustard I have ever had. I'm usually not a fan of mustard, but WOW. Bratwurst mit Sauerkraut & Rostkartoffeln - (Roasted Sausage with Riesling Sauerkraut, Roasted Potatoes & Dijon) Similar to Goldilocks and the three bears, this was the sausage that was just right! Perfectly delicious and just the right amount of flavor. All three were juicy and let out that beautiful popping sound when our knives cut through the casing. Make sure to try: Holunderbeerensaft (Fresh Elderberry Syrup with Sparkling Water). It's a rich purple colored drink that is so subtly sweet and refreshing. Apfelstrudel (Apple Strudel)! Oh boy, oh boy! It's dusted with powdered sugar, served with whipped cream on the side, and guaranteed to make you drool. Lastly, you MUSTMUSTMUST try one of their Viennese coffee specialties. We got the Kaiser Melange (Fresh-ground Coffee with Whipped Cream). The presentation was amazing. The coffee was served on a silver tray with a glass of water topped with a small spoon. The perfect end. Â  Why do I live on the other side of the country? :(
