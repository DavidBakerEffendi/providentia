Went here for the first time a few days ago, walked in and got a seat at the bar right away. We ordered food to go, the fish tacos were SLAMMIN. Definitely would go back again for the food. The beer was good, and the waiter was friendly. Overall chilled out environment, but might be different on busy nights/weekends.
