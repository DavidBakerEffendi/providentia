As my quest to find the best burger continues,  I may have found the holy grail of Burgers and possibly ended the quest. The burger was so moist and juicy, cooked to perfection at medium.  Just the basic condiments and toppings: lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and ketchup.  This burger needs nothing more; anything else would just detract from its grilled beefy goodness.
