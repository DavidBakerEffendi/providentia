Wifey and I come back here everytime we're in NY. The food is still exceptional, but don't take our words for it.  Here are two recent endorsements from total strangers during our many visits: 1) Persian family (mom, dad, 2 daughters) waiting in line with us.  The 2 daughters get sick of waiting and ask daddy if they can go down the block to a less busy Halal cart.  Dad gives 'em both the evil eye and a stern dressing-down.  He tells them both, "We stay here!!  Dis is best food!!"  I half thought he would bitch-slap his own daughters for the blasphemy they uttered. 2) Caught a cab to Union square yesterday.  Chatted with the cabbie who was an affable fellow and just happened to be Egyptian.  I asked him what he thought about the 53rd and 6th Halal cart.  He looked me straight in the eye (while still racing down Park avenue at 50mph) and said in a serious tone, "their food... better than any restaurant!"
