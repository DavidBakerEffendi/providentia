How can one restaurant make me so happy? I don't know, but 4 days later and I can still vividly imagine myself in this dimly lit, intimate West Village restaurant, sipping on red wine and sampling some of the freshest food I've ever had in this city. The night began with champagne and ended with pumpkin s'mores (yes. pumpkin s'mores), yet everything in between was just as nice. I began with the garden salad and moved on to the sauteed halibut, which (if ordering straight from the menu) came with parsnip, brussels, and beets under a citrusy drizzle. I hesitated on this choice due to my extreme dislike of beets, but the server offered to swap them out for something else ("the chef will decide on a good pairing if you'd like"). Despite the customization, the resulting dish came out beautifully and could not have tasted better. Never once did we feel rushed, but at the same time, the server always appeared at just the right moment - certainly a perfected art. Highly recommend.
