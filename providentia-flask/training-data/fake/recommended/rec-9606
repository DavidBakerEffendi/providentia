We four friends often have dinner before going to the Signature Theatre near 10th Ave and 42nd. A little out of the regular theatre district restaurant area.  So it is always terrific to find a new place nearby.  Hourglass was our latest try. Nice set up with dining rooms on first and third floors and bar / cafe on the second where we got into pre-dinner drinks.  We found it so comfortable - and Josh the co-owner and bartender so amiable - that we had our dinner at the bar too.  Excellent!  Two of us had the prix fixe meal, others ordered a la carte.  The pastas (we tried three different ones in our group, mine being the nicely spicy fettucini Fra Diavolo) and the lamb) were all superb. As were the salads and desserts.  Nothing but good things to say. The Hourglass is definitely on our "regular place" list in this area.
