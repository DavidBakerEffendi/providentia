Food: 26 Service 25 Decor: 22 With every restaurateur running around and trying to be innovative by serving goat brain tartare, Dover excels on the staples.  Great raw tuna, a lobster dish that will have you wishing you ordered the larger portion( I did not make that mistake) and a whole chicken for two that comes out in 2 courses.  If you're on a budget, skip next weeks meal and splurge here.
