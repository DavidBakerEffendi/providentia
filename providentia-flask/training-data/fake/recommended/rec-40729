Okay so where should I begin.. I absolutely LOVE beer and I absolutely LOVE mussels!!!!!   Last Saturday I had the opportunity to visit this fine establishment.  My first impression was, "Ooooh.  A man's bar!!"  The bar was packed and the dining area was packed so all we could do was wait.  The people I was with assured me that the moules were worth it! I ordered a Hoegaarden which is a very good beer! It's not hoppy so if you like hoppy beer I would order the Victory HopDevil Ale.  (I had a sip of that and it was pretty good!)   We ordered one pound of Moules Mariniere, 2 pounds of Moules Provencal, and two pounds Moules Dijon.  I don't like Dijon mustard so I didn't touch the Dijon.  I just don't like grainy texture of Dijon mustard, but according to the group I was with the Moules Dijon was yummy!   The Moules Mariniere has white wine, peppers, capers, onions, etc.  It was REALLY good!!  The Moules Provencal has tomato sauce, garlic, shallots, etc.  It has to be my favorite out of the three.  It was SOOO good!  I'm very picky when it comes to muscles.  I hate, hate, hate it when restaurants serve muscles that have an 'ocean' taste.  These mussels had NO ocean taste!!  (Hopefully you guys understand what I mean.)  They were just.. yummy.  I also had the crab cake croissant and I thought it was alright.  The moules were definitely way better. The staff is pretty nice.  The bartender was really nice and our waitress was kind.  This is definitely a place to take your friends and family if you guys love mussels and beer :]
