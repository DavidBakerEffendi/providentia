We love The Abbaye. We have been here to eat or get a quick drink before a show and we're never disappointed by wait staff or something great to eat! This past weekend we were on our way to a show and wanted to stop in for a quick bite to eat. I had their special for the night (Mushroom & Gruyere Streudel with vegetable rice and garlic green beans), while my guy had the Seitan Cheesesteak (which he has had before and loves). Our waiter was quick, offered helpful advice on drinks and got our food and bill to us efficiently so we were able to make a break for the venue as soon as we were done! We've had brunch with friends here in the past and that was great too! They never seem to have too much of a shortage on tables, and parking is sometimes difficult--but it's a busy area so you just have to have a bit of patience and check the side streets for openings. They have a pretty great selection of drinks, and the large bar is okay to stand at too even if it's a patron-full night. I would and have recommended this bar/resto to friends!
