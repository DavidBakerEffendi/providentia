You are looking for ramen, this is the place. It s worth to wait... Hope you have time. A joke, 2 hours and a half on a Friday night at 8 pm, but the food / ambiance is excellent. Also, this place is not expensive for the quality of the food. An instant success.... Highly recommended ( two times per year)
