8/20/13. Awesome night at do it dine tonight! Â Great food (foie doughnut, both kinds of deviled eggs, chicken & woffals, duck breast), the service was good but one of the cooks did most of our food running but I don't care about that, I just hope they pool the tips. Atmosphere is pretty rad and the music was great. If you don't try this place out you're stupid!!
