A poor excuse for a steak house and even a restaurant . I wonder how this place is still open. I actually took my mother here for mother's day for convenience. It was a waste of money. Food was horrible, service was poor , and the cooks walked through the dining room like it was the kitchen. The menu is set up like a big time steak house but the food comes no where close . Just a warning for restaurant week ... stay clear of this establishment.
