So this has only been my second trip to a ramen noodle house.  I was there this past Saturday, and apparently it has stirred my ramen craving... I've how had ramen noodles 3 days in a row... I know, so bad for you but so good! The good... I got the shoyu bowl with a side of pork buns.  Tasty broth, no complaints here.  And I really liked the spicy sauce on the pork buns.  It was unexpected, but delicious. The not as good... cash only is always a bummer.
