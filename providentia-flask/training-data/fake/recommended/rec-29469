When I fly in to PHL from Seattle, my sister's gonna bring me a cheesesteak from here and I'm gonna wolf it down in one bite....that's how good this place is. Sigh, can you guys move to Seattle? Aaaaa, I drool as I type. Cherry pepper spread is a must. Provolone cheese. Chicken cheese steak is damn good too. Can't wait.
