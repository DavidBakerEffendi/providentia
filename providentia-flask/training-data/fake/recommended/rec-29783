This was the PERFECT stop-in for snacks on the cheap before quite ironically paying an arm and a leg for Sleep No More. Nice casual modern atmosphere with a huge tiled wood-burning oven in the back.  The menu is composed mostly of your usual Modern Italian suspects with a heavy tilt toward pizza (hence the oven). The real draw for my particular visit was the Happy Hour special which includes free access to a tasty sampler buffet with your drink order. The day we visited the offerings ranged from a few different types of pizza to pepperoni rolls, to some roasted veggies.  I was thinking it was a nice way to sample the menu, but our chat with the hostess revealed most of it wasn't on the regular menu. So, that made it a little special!  I was delighted by a sparkling Rose on the wine list and enjoyed quite the relaxing bite before our show. Tip: You don't need to make reservations for HH, but it is first come, first served with the buffet so arrive a little early. It's also super fast since you don't have to wait for anything to come out of the kitchen so it really eliminates that pre-show time anxiety. I will update when/if I get to re-visit and try the regular menu to see what the "real" food is like!
