I walked into Sharkey's around 11:45pm last night after having left another bar in Clifton to find something a bit more lively. From its outside appearance I expected Sharkey's to be a bit sketch, but it was quite the opposite. Sharkey's offers a cozy yet fun atmosphere. The music was great and the people were very friendly, not to mention the beer was relatively cheap. The place is also open till 2-3am, and the kitchen is open until about midnight. Â I wasn't able to sample the food, but from the looks of the menu it seems like it would be a great place to eat as well. Overall it was a great experience.
