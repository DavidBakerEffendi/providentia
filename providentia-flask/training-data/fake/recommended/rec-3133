Overpriced, overhyped, gaudy Brooklyn food joint. The menu says "Limited" so I asked to see the "extended" menu.  I wanted more options.  "It's coming--if you come back in two weeks we'll have more." "Can you add guacamole and cheese to my burrito?" "Well, yeah, it's eight dollars extra." [???!!!] So I ate my boring $8 burrito.  I didn't buy an eight dollar machine made margarita or mojito in the small plastic cups. I must say that this place relies on it's space, outdoors seating, colorful environment, the yuppie factor in the area, but it's nothing special.
