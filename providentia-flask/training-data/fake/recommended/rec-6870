This place is so wonderful.  The space is unique and cozy, drinks are great, and the food is like nothing else in the area, or really anywhere.  I took my out-of-town foodie relatives for dinner over a year ago and they are STILL raving about (and remembering) each course.  The cool thing about the Pines is that It rivals any fancy tasting menu while still remaining approachable and relaxed.  The combination of textures and flavors is always surprising, but as soon as you taste it... it makes so much sense.  Oh, and if there's pasta on the menu, GET IT.
