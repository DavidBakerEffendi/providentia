Since my not so great review, I was contacted by a member of the Starr team to apologize for the experience. When you write a review like this, you do it to help the establishment, not hurt it. They heard the feedback, passed it onto their team and I hope it will only make them better. I appreciated the instant reaction time by Starr restaraunts - it shows they care. Because of that, I will definetely be giving them another shot! Thanks guys.
