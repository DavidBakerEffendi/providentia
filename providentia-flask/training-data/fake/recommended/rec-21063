We have been patrons for years but not any more. We went there this weekend for breakfast with a party of 10 people. We all placed our order together but when the food was delivered, 3 people did not get their order. I inquired and was told that the kitchen was really busy and it would be out shortly. The restaurant was not full- I could see several empty tables- but acquiesced to that. After abut 5 minutes, 1 of the people received their breakfast but not the others. Asked again and got the same answer.THe other orders did not come out for an additional half hour and no server ever appeared to inquire further or even to cancel the order. When the bill came,  I asked for a manager and was told no one was there. I explained my complaint- at least a 40 minute delay for simple breakfast food- and was told that no one could adjust the bill since the owner was not there. I asked for a phone call from the owner which never came. While I was discussing the problem, one the the managers came over and repeated the same thing the waiter had said. When I repeated my complaint the 8 of 10 orders came out on time,  he rudely told me that I eventually got my food, yelling that " You ate it, didn't you". I responded that since we had waited that long, what did he expect? I finally left without any satisfactory answer. There are after all no shortage of good, pleasant diners in NJ. I will not be returning here. While the food may be good, the owners apparently feel that they have no responsibility toward their customers except to treat them like human ATMs. I will go to diners where they treat you like a person.
