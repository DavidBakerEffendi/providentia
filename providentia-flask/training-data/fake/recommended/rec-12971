Came in on a weekday evening for a cheesesteak. I know this place gets great reviews for their pizza, which I will have to try. This was my first time here, I just moved to Philly, I was starving, and dammit I wanted a cheesesteak. I've had other cheesesteaks, including Pat's and Geno's. Maybe it's because I didn't know what to expect, but it was actually really good. Bread was delicious, plenty of steak in it, filled me up. And they were really nice, which is a bonus. I live about 2 blocks away. They have pretty good hours too, close at 11 on weekdays I think. I see myself coming here often. I'm definitely going to have to try the pizza that people are recommending, and I'll update the review.
