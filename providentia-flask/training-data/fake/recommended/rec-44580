Food taste was ok not even tasting as authentic as luto ni nanay. The male waiter was nice so that was a plus. But the owner (a white guy not even pinoy) was rude. He was more concerned of his San Miguel glass not breaking over his customers. And if you're eating outside eating next to repaired old shoes and and the shoe-man smoking every 10 mins is a major thumbs down. Instead I really suggest Tito Rads restaurant at Â  49-12 Queens Blvd, Woodside Sunnyside, NY 11104 I will not come back to this place or recommend it to people. We drive all the way from DC to have NY pinoy food and this is definitely not the place.
