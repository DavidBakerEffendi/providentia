This place has a real maritime feel that reminds me of the guy with the boat in jaws. I love that scene when Richard dryfus and the other dudes are drinking whiskey and telling stories about their scars. Anyways, the waiter was wearing a stupendously red striped t shirt which added to the experience. You just can't get amenities like this most places. And the bar has this soft cushion under the bar for your knees. Whew! I'm always knockin' my knees! If you love The song "brandy you're a fine girl" you'll love this spot! I subtract a star because a homeless guy kept staring into the window at my wine and oysters and fogging up the glass. Gross.
