McCrossen's will always hold a special place in my heart. When I made the jump from University City to the big city in '09 this was my crew's neighborhood hang out. No matter what night I went in knew I'd see one of my buddies or a bar regular who had now become a buddy. The food was always good but the focus was more on the drinks and social aspects more than the dining establishment it is today (not saying that's a negative just pointing it out). As time goes on we all moved to different parts of the city new bars became our haunts and McCrossen's became a fond but distant memory. The food here is fantastic. From Wings to a handmade pasts dish to the baked brie, you will not be disappointed. They hold regularl chef pairings with a seasonal or rare wine/beer they are able to get their hands on and it makes for a great date night.
