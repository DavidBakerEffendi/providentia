My wife and I were in NYC for the weekend, celebrating our 1st anniversary. We love Greek restaurants and Pylos looked like a winner. And it was. Such a cool little spot. Clay pots hanging from the ceiling and doors opened wide to the street outside. Wine and beer from Greece- winners. The Mythos lager tasted like Yuengling's cousin. My wife had a Sav Blanc that she loved. For dinner I had the scallops and shrimp. My wife had the whole fish special, which was Branzino. It's been a few days now and we're still talking about how good everything was. Just so effin' tasty. Delicious. Not the cheapest place out there, but definitely worth the price. And our waiter was a champ. My wife is allergic to garlic and our waiter went through the menu with her, dish by dish, telling her which ones had garlic and which ones didn't. He was just a real good dude. When my wife thanked him for being so kind and patient with her, he replied, "No problem. That's my job." If more people were like him, going out to eat would be such an easier fail-safe prospect. In the end, I can't wait to go back to this place and know we will soon. Great for dates, anniversaries or just a quick bite.
