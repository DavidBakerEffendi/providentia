Out of the three big tourist cheese steak places (Pat's, Geno's, and Jim's) in the Philly area Pat's is truly the King.  It has the best tasting cheese steak which is fueled by great options and the most flavorful/ steak.  It also has the most options for your sandwich. My personal choice is the pepper cheese steak with provolone. If you can only make one cheese steak joint I highly recommended Pat's.
