This is my 100th review, and also the review that earned me the Sushi Sensei badge :) Kumo is a nicely decorated, large, sushi/hibachi restaurant.  I went on a Sunday since it's 50% off most sushi (basically everything except the tempura rolls) all day long.  It was nice and quiet, I think due to all the fairs and events going on in Connecticut and possibly the time we went.  We sat along the wall with nice comfy pillows cushioning our backs.  I had the volcano roll, a shrimp avocado roll and a salmon roll.  The volcano roll was pretty good.  The flavor was good, but it wasn't very explosive.  I must say though, the spicy tuna on top was very delicious.  The vegetable gyoza was alright.  My boyfriend devoured his sweet potato roll (not included in 50% off) in under 2 minutes.  As far as pricing goes, our 4 rolls and appetizer came to $28.  I think it's the best deal if you are going for simple rolls (maki rolls like salmon, tuna, california roll, yellowtail jalapeno...), since at half off they are only 3-4 dollars.  If you like special rolls, prices add up quick (the cheapest was $11), so if you are looking to really indulge in sushi, I would recommend a buffet.  Their quality is very good!
