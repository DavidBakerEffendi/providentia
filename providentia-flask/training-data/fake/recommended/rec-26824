I'd really like to review the food at Churrasco Grill, but we never got that far.... We walked into the restaurant for lunch at 12:15PM on a Wednesday.   There were no customers at the time....and nobody greeted us...OK - We figured we could seat ourselves...We walked in and chose a table.   I'm guessing one of the reasons the person / people in back didn't know we were there was the TV BLASTING in the dining room...I enjoy a good soccer game, but this was way too loud for a dining room during business hours....We looked in the back - saw someone standing there....Yelled "hello"....No response...Tried 2 more times over 5 minutes...He never turned around.  Nobody ever came to the dining area.  Being totally unable to get his attention, our choice at this point was to walk into the kitchen and ask for help, or walk out and drive to a restaurant that would value or business.  We chose the latter.  Maybe we will try another time, but that probably won't be for a while.
