I came here with a bunch of friends and we did the set menu where they bring out a variety of dishes and you share it family style. The food is average, nothing mind blowing, but overpriced.  We all had about two drinks, and when it was all said and done, it came out to a little over $100 per person.  For that kind of money, you can eat very well at any steak house in the city.
