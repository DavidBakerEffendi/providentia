I was introduced to this Banh mi shop by one of my good friends. I fucken love this place because it's everything you would want. 1. Amazing service - the staff is super friendly, chill 2. Food is always fresh and consistent - bread is toasted and ingredients taste rich 3. Affordable prices I always take my friends here and everyone leaves satisfied. Although I wish there was more sitting room. Because if you're lucky you'll get seats. My favorites: The Hog + Lamb
