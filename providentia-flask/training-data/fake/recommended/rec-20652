This is the place to go if you want to get THE chicken and rice. OK fine. I haven't had any of the others. But if you're in NY for only a few days and can risk only one cart, go to this one. Despite the line full of tourists like you and me. Just do it! Be careful of the red sauce. It's spicy, and that's an understatement. Theories have been floating that there are a different group of guys in the same spot after 9pm, and they make it better than if you go earlier in the day. I went around 5pm and was greatly satisfied, but just for kicks, I would definitely try to get there in the night hours.
