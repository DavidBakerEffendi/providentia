Was planning to have brunch at Cafe Colette but line was spewing onto Street. Walked up Berry & saw Juniper, even though we wanted brunch items & theres none there, we wanted to give the underdogs a try. We sat down and had 3 burgers. They were EXCELLENT and super delicious. Will definitely return... We think the burgers + fries are better than Dumont :o) Must try their sweet potato fries- very addictive..
