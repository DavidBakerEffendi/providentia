I visited on a wed night for dinner. I had the buffalo wings and fries.   I loved the hot wings just like I like them, nice and crispy. The fries were delicious and the dipping sauce. Yummy!   I liked that they had large assortment of teas as well. I am not a coffee drinker.  The like the whole feel and look of the place.  Red walls..high ceilings...modern.  I hope they do really well. It's nice to have a good local spot.  I heard they have a good brunch and I will check that out one Sunday,  I did only notice one waitress. Although not super busy when I went. I did have to track her down for bill.  I hope that as they get busier or on the weekends...there are more than one waitress,   She was a sweetheart tho and was pleasant and knowledgable
