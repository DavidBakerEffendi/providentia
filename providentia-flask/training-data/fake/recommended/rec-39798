Got 6 plates, 3 were amazing, and 3 were OK at best. Wait staff was OK, except that it seemed like i was inconveniencing him every time i wanted to order another place. The upside was how cute the place was. Â Perfect lighting and feel, great for dates (just make sure to read the other reviews first, and figure out what dishes will be to your liking )
