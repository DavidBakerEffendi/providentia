Third visit.  Consistently good steaks and side dishes.  Good wine list and friendly knowlegable sommelier.  They have the service down pat and don't seem  to mind if each table never turns over during the evening.  However all this is expected for the prices they charge.  You get what you pay for (I mean this as a complement).
