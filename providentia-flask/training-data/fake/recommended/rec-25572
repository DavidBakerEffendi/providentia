This place really is wonderful! It's one of the biggest reasons I miss living in the area. Perfect spot for anything from studying, music, grab & go coffee, pensive alone time, talking with strangers or spending quality time with friends. It was my "Cafe Nervosa" and I always look forward to having a reason to pass through the area and stop in. Oh, and anything they make that had peanut butter in it is to DIE for.
