My friend has been bugging me to go and try this place out for months!  I finally did.  I went on a Sunday night and only waited for 15mins to get in.  Judging by all the previous reviews on Yelp, I had it easy. Simply put, the corn is absolutely the best corn I've ever had.  That said, a corn is a corn.  That said again, you HAVE TO order it if you're there.  If you're a fan of spiciness and heat, then try it with the green hot sauce they have there.  So much flavour and soooo HOT!  Guaranteed to give you a kick and wake your senses! For main, we had the grilled steak and the grilled pork chop.  Both were delicious and well made, but not really to-die-for.  For dessert we shared a coconut flan. In a word, for the price, you really can't ask for anything better than this.  I will definitely visit again on a night when there isn't a 30min+ wait.
