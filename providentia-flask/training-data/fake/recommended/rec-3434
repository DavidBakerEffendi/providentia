I took my boyfriend out for his birthday to Campania after eyeing this establishment for a while - a lot of really cool spots are opening down south in Bay Ridge. The interior is glowing and gorgeous, with beautiful wood floors and brick walls. What really won me over was the service - I didn't even mention that it was my boyfriend's birthday, yet we received incredibly attentive service and in-depth explanation of each item on the menu. We split the Lombarda Pizza (prosciutto + arugula + truffle oil = heaven for me) and an Italian cheesecake, which was pleasantly zesty and lemony. The entrees were a bit on the pricier side for the portions given, but the pizza was perfectly crisp, and the toppings fresh. I don't usually go in for high-end coal fired pizza, as I'm a regular slice-on-the-go type of pizza eater, but this was a really wonderful place to visit for more of an indulgent Italian dining experience on a Bay Ridge budget.
