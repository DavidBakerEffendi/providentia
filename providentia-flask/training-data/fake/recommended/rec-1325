It's and OK place. Cheesesteak sandwichs are good but a bit on the oil side. More a Tourist Trap and Kitsch type of a joint but still a fun place to visit. (the place is lit up with neon like a Las Vegas Casino) Here's what I suggest. Buy a classic Cheesesteak sandwich or two from BOTH Geno's and Pats just down the block behind you and take both of them home to the wife and kids. Cut them into 3" bite-size pieces and have them on a Friday or Saturday night for dinner while watching the Phillies, the Flyers or the Eagles. I've found in my wife and son like Pat's while I and my daughter preffer Geno's. This way everyone is happy. Enjoy!
