BYOB Chinese noodle house. Every noodle is hand drawn in the restaurant.   The wonton soup had thin small wontons. There must have been 20 in each bowl. For the price of $2.5 it was huge and filling. I could have stopped at the soup and been set. Vegetable stir fry was also huge and delicious.  Only one big eater at our table finished his own plate. For everyone else we could have split a dish and been set. This place is great cheap and clean. This is the place to come to in chine town.
