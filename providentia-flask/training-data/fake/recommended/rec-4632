Supreme pizza? Yum, yum, YUM! Definitely the best pizza I've had in South Orange. They're busy on weekends and if you're getting takeout, it can be a bit of a wait. Try to call ahead. Other than that, I dined in once on a lunch date (I had the shrimp scampi) and that was really good too. I always see lots of families/big groups, so it seems to work for everyone's social situation. BYOB. Worth a try!
