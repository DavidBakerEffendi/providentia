I'm from Santa Monica and love experiencing new havens and cultures across the country through food.  I Yelp'd this place on a layover and went there as I was impressed by the reviews.   Unfortunately, three things didn't make my visit worthwhile:  1. the location; 2. the service; and 3. the food.  The coffee was good. Not worth the hype.  The food was a poor attempt at fancying up good wholesome dishes, by presenting small portions on even smaller plates.   And what's with the chemistry-like coffee decanters?  Coffee is coffee.  There's not much more you can do to it than serve it boiled, steeped, or pressurized.   Instead of reinventing Chhaya should concentrate on presenting simpler well-made standards in larger portions on larger plates.  The fancy coffee drips and japanese-like portions really don't work here. Also the flies continuously landing on our food didn't help.  : (
