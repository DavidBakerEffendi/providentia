I took my wife and three young boys to Hapgood's recently and was pleasantly surprised.  The food was outstanding and the prices were reasonable.  My wife had the pancakes and commented that they were the best she ever had!  The boys enjoyed the chicken fingers and cheeseburgers. The place was very clean and inviting with a friendly staff.  We will be definitely be returning to try the rest of their menu.
