My friends and I had the pleasure of enjoying this restaurant TWO TIMES while we were away in New Jersey, 2 weekends ago. We not only found the service absolutely fantastic, but we were received with great pleasure by, whom I believe to be the manager, Dominico, and his staff. The food was, without error, most delectable! I see all of us visiting again from NYC! The ambience is beautiful, from paintings, to beautiful earthy decorations and palm trees. I've never been to Cuba but I can say I certainly didn't feel like I was in Jersey while sitting and eating there!
